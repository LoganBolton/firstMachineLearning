this is an example of why the majority of action films are the same generic and boring theres really nothing worth watching here a complete waste of the then barelytapped talents of icet and ice cube whove each proven many times over that they are capable of acting and acting well dont bother with this one go see new jack city ricochet or watch new york undercover for icet or boyz n the hood higher learning or friday for ice cube and see the real deal icets horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth and im still wondering what the heck bill paxton was doing in this film and why the heck does he always play the exact same character from aliens onward every film ive seen with bill paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character and at least in aliens his character died which made it somewhat gratifyingbr br overall this is secondrate action trash there are countless better films to see and if you really want to see this one watch judgement night which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script the only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera  the cinematography was almost refreshing which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself  but not quite 410
