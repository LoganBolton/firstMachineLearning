first of all i hate those moronic rappers who couldnt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads all they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like clich√©e version of gangstersbr br the movie doesnt take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before were already at the warehouse there is not a single sympathetic character in this movie except for the homeless guy who is also the only one with half a brainbr br bill paxton and william sadler are both hill billies and sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters i didnt like him right from the startbr br the movie is filled with pointless violence and walter hills specialty people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere there is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for noone everybody dies except from paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deservebr br the only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the junkie but theyre actors by profession not annoying ugly brain dead rappersbr br stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead at lest they have characters you care about a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast
