this german horror film has to be one of the weirdest i have seenbr br i was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism but this is supposed based upon a true characterbr br our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father he also has a doll fetish but i cannot figure out where that came from his coworkers find out and tease him terriblybr br during the day a mildmanner accountant and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls they are all attractive of course else we wouldnt care about the fact that he usually tears their clothing down to the waist he graduates eventually to actually killing and that is what gets him caughtbr br like i said a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as werner pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood
