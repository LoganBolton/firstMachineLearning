being a longtime fan of japanese film i expected more than this i cant really be bothered to write to much as this movie is just so poor the story might be the cutest romantic little something ever pity i couldnt stand the awful acting the mess they called pacing and the standard quirky japanese story if youve noticed how many japanese movies use characters plots and twists that seem too different forcedly so then steer clear of this movie seriously a 12year old could have told you how this movie was going to move along and thats not a good thing in my bookbr br fans of beat takeshi his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo and unless youre a rabid fan you dont need to suffer through this waste of filmbr br 210
