this film is absolutely appalling and awful its not low budget its a no budget film that makes ed woods movies look like art the acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything i have ever seen an ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants woddy strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit there is sadism as you would expect from an 80s italian video nasty no talent was used to make this film and the female love interest has a huge bhind italian taste maybe even for 80s italian standards this film is pretty damn awful but i guess it came out at a time when there werent so many films available on video or viewers werent really discerning this piece of crap has no entertainment value whatsoever and its not even funny just boring and extremely cheap its actually and insult to the most stupid audience i just wonder how on earth an actor like woody strode ended up ia a turkey like this
