heres a decidedly average italian post apocalyptic take on the huntingkilling humans for sport theme ala the most dangerous game turkey shoot gymkata and the running manbr br certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work generally bland action sequences a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughoutbr br take for example towards the end of the film when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains he initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep upon discovery of the said corpse the villains response bearing in mind that our hero has come to brutally murder them all Â– they resolve to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit br br however i suppose to be fair the film remains nonetheless about watchable if you can suspend your disbelief during such stupid scenes and does benefit immensely by the presence of the always excellent woody strode even if his screen time is very limitedbr br not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but still just about worthy of a watch for italian bmovie enthusiasts
