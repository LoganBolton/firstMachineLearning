at the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called the final executioner at least where i come from a bloke is trained by an excop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood and thats about it lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue has one of the weirdest array of costumes ive seen in a film for a while and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people great job on the dubbing too guys best moment when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck he just gets out his gun and bang why not do that earlier its a mystery as is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place im still puzzling over that one myself now 210
