im a huge fan of both emily watson breaking the waves and tom wilkinson normal and was amused to see them upstaged by rupert everett dellamorte dellamore in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more the too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid infinitely entitled worthless son of a rich lord are spoton and entertaining but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone the music was annoyingly movieoftheweek quality and the voiceover jarring and totally unnecessary clearly the work of a firsttime director with a small budget who either lacked or didnt sufficiently heed good advice too badbr br i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end and viceversa so there is some sort of character arc at least in terms of perception for example watsons character while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man began to grate on me near the end particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat with no asking of permission no apologies offered and i went from disliking wilkinsons control freak  moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change unlike his wifebr br this movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a love story or steel magnolias illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact so i was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed was it the lord driving the car the lords dog the scene where the lord visits wilkinson and relates how brave watson is the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for florence nightingale incarnate etc was ok until he started overthetop sobbing like a baby good god if you ask me shes just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands and so she drives her hard working well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproachbr br look everyone would have been better off if wilkinson had just left her for his secretary who seemed to appreciate him for who he was instead he acted like an abused dog his open craving for his wifes affection increasing with every kick she gives him im not anti pc or anything it just didnt ring true even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face the ending for me was and not the directors intention i am certain depressing the movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just dont belong together so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing im not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed is that asking too muchbr br my score 410
