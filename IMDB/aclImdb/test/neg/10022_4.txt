1980 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies friday the 13th and the burning may have been the best ones but there were like always a couple of stinkers not far behind like dont go into the woods alone and this one but in all fairness the prey is nowhere near as bad as dont go into the woods but its still not great either one thing is that its just boring and acting isnt very good but much better than dgitw and this movie actually has some attractive looking females to look at all three of the female leads were stunning one thing what is up with all that pointless wildlife footage it just seemed pointless and it looked as the director used that to just used that to fill up some time spacebr br so what was there to like about this movie well there were a few laugh out loud cheese moments i couldnt contain a fit of giggles when the final girl did a bizarre type of backwards moonwalk to get away from the kille and there were a few good kill scenes my favourites being the girl suffocated to death with the sleeping bag and the phoney lookingbr br all in all the prey is dumb boring and the killer i didnt find scary at all this movie could have been a whole lot better
