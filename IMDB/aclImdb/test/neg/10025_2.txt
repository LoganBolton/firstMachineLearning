oh yeah this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of worst 80s slasher ever made the prey has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick a routine derivative plot that youve seen a thousand times before and better insufferable characters and terrible performances a complete lack of gore and suspense fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and  most irritating of all  the largest amount of pointless padding footage youve ever encountered in your life and thats not an exaggeration but a guarantee apart from the seemingly endless amount of national geographic stock footage which ill expand upon later this film is shameless enough to include a complete banjo interlude  and two occasions where characters tell dillydally jokes that arent even remotely funny the setup is as rudimentary as it gets with the intro showing images of a devastating forest fire with ott voiceover human screams fast forward nearly forty years later when an elderly couple out camping in that same area get axewhacked by something that breathes heavily offscreen this ought to be enough information for you to derive that someone survived the fire all these years ago and remained prowling around ever since enter three intolerable twenty something couples heading up to the danger zone with exclusively sex on their minds unaware of course they are sitting ducks for the stalking and panting killer the prey is an irredeemable boring film apparently it was shot in 1978 already but nobody wanted to distribute it up until 1984 and it isnt too hard to see why in case you would filter out all the content that is actually relevant this would only be a short movie with a running time of 30 minutes possibly even less theres an unimaginably large of nature and wildlife footage sometimes of animals that i think dont even live in that type of area and they seem to go on forever the only thing missing in fact is the typical national geographic narration providing educational information regarding the animals habits animals in their own natural biotope are undeniably nice to look at but not in a supposedly vile and cheesy 80s slasher movie for crying out loud the last fifteen minutes are finally somewhat worthwhile with some potent killing sequences and fine makeup effects on the monster who turns out to be lurch from the addams family movies but still silliness overrules  the scene with the vultures is too stupid  and the final shot is just laughoutloud retarded as mentioned above the prey easily makes my own personal list of worst 80s slashers alongside appointment with fear berserker deadly games dont go in the woods hollow gate the stay awake and curfew
