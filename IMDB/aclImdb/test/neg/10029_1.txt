rented 3 bad movies to watch with my friends in my dorm roombr br leprechaun 4 jack frost and the preybr br i picked up jack and lep 4 because they are well known bad movies i have never seenbr br i picked this movie out because it matched the how to find a bad movie guide on badmoviesorg no real description no pics of the movie on the back and i had never heard of it had to be a winner br br spoilers but this movie is so awful it doesnt matter pbr br this is a true bad movie lep 4 and jack frost are dumb on purpose this is dumb despite the best efforts of the cast and crewbr br this movie starts out much like evil dead even the actors look similar and have the same style of dress unlike evil dead it never gains any speed at all for a slasher movie it is pretty bland in 80 minutes 6 people get killed but these are spread apart so far it becomes quickly boringbr br the director threw in a lot of boring shots on animals hunting obviously to go along with the whole prey theme but they do nothing to advance the story and are quite boring the gore is horrible all these extra shots were to make up for lack of a script and storybr br the last 5 minutes of the movie are shot mostly in slow motion yet another way to add length to this the climax is such a total joke its hard to laugh at it is so bad the back of the box says the ending will shock and haunt you yes it will it will shock you that someone could put such a bad plot twist on film and haunt you because you wont believe you paid to watch this crapbr br also the tagline is its not human and its got an axe one person is killed with an axe in the whole movie and it is off screenbr br a true 1 out of 10 i love laughing at bad movies but this one is so bad that it even lacks campy qualities no bad movie night is compete without a true character building flick p
