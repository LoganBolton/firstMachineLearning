i was pulled into this movie early on much to my surprise because i hadnt intended to watch it at all now i wish i hadnt the suspense starts out well with the hitandrun resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess or be found out or doable now though a nono in the old days of moviemaking get away with it the plots been done beforewhat plot hasntbut the tensions inherent in it with the additional complications and motivations arising out of the illicit love affair make for an absorbing first half then the film abandons the hitandrun to embark upon a misty exposition of two unrequited allsuffering loves the two tracks of plothitandrun and unreasoning lovejust dont have enough to do with each other and that they involve the same characters doesnt bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line the screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other at the end of the film in the midst of the movies second funeral i found myself thinking now what does any of this have to do with that hitandrun the filmmakers may think the answer obvious but i think the movie was plotted and executed flabbily
