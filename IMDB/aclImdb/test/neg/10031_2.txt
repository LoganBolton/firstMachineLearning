all the criticisms of this movie are quite valid it is pretty boring and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff a couple exchanging nods over their good grub a medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes sits down and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace quadrupletakes or more when people look at things solitary banjotuning and playing taking a break for a beer telling a joke to a fawn about a bigmouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies complete with many bigmouthed expressions which are needed for the weak punchline the sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread which to the squeamish become unpalatable when theres talk of people burned in a fire lots of seemingly stockfootage closeup shots of animals birds insects and spiders in the woodsbr br the movie starts with a forest fire then at least a couple decades later some people in those same woods get killed by an axe the killer evidently wasnt too satisfied by the axe he stole and kills other people with other weapons of opportunity or his bare handsbr br if its true that the movie in the version available on the outofprint videotape is cut perhaps if theres a lot of footage that was cut it deserves another look on dvd otherwise its simply not very interesting and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore outdoorsslasher fan
