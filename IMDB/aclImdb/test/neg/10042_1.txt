i love ghost stories and i will sit through a movie til its end even if im not really enjoying it i rarely feel like i wasted my time but this adaptation of the bell witch story was horrible br br it wasnt scary in the least bit what is with the comic relief moments the dialog was tedious acting inconsistent the movie was way too long and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn out in my open like the birthday partybr br the only good think i can think about mentioning is the costumes and props were well donebr br i am curious about other adaptation but until then i will stick to reading about the story
