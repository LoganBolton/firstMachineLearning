from time to time its very advisable for the aristocracy to watch some silent film about the harsh life of the common people in order to remind themselves of the privileges and the comfortable life that they have enjoyed since the beginning of mankind or even before in comparison with the complicated and hard work that common people have to endure everyday since the aristocrats rule the worldbr br and thats what happens in the love light the first film directed by dame france marion who will be famous afterwards in the silent and talkie world thanks overall to her work as a screenwriter better for her certainly because her career as a film director doesnt impress this german countbr br the film tells the story of dame angela carlotti  dame mary pickford  a merry italian girl who lives surrounded by a picturesque squalor  an important difference of opinion between upper and low classes aristocrats prefers to live surrounded by picturesque luxury  she has two brothers and a secret admirer but all she gives him in return is indifference destiny begins to work hard and pretty soon war is declared and dame angelas two brothers enlist and in the next reel both are dead but destiny is even crueller and dame angela meanwhile falls in love with a german and to make things worse she doesnt know that her teutonic sweetie is a spy and that the light signals that she sends to him every night from the lighthouse she maintains thinking that is a love signal dont mean ich liebe dich but sink any damn italian boat at seabr br fortunately for dame angela pretty soon her sweetie german spy will be found by the neighbours in her house in which she was hiding him  a not strange fact indeed because it is not an easy task for a german to go unnoticed  but the german spy will prefer to die before being captured by those italiansbr br from that german love a halfteutonic baby will born  the wicked destiny at full speed  but a greedy neighbour who has a particular idea of motherhood will carry away her son with the consent of a catholic nun who has taken the council of trent to extremes a fact that will put dame angela at the verge of insanitybr br but meanwhile dame angelas secret admirer has returned from the war and you can think that finally dame angelas sorrowful life will improve a tremendous mistake because destiny has in store for her that the returned soldier is blind but as they say in germany it may be a blessing in disguise and finally dame angela will recover her son and will start a new life with her blind sweetie in a poor italian village in what it is supposed to be a happy ending for the common peoplebr br as this german count said before it was much better for dame frances marion that she continued her career as a screenwriter because as can be seen in the love light she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories ja wohl but a completely different subject is to direct films and her silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm in spite of the effort of dame pickford to involve the audience with her many disgraces the nonexistent film narrative causes indifference in the spectator making this the kind of film where only dame pickford herself provides the interest and not her circumstancesbr br and now if youll allow me i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must send morse signals from the schloss north tower to one of his teutonic rich heiress
