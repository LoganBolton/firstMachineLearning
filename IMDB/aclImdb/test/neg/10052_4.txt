this is a family movie that was broadcast on my local itv station at 100 am a couple of nights ago  this might be a strange decision on the part of the schedulers but the real howard spitz is a rather strange film  strange in the way it doesnt want to upset its audience  come on theres nothing kids like more than sadism and thats why roald dahl was such a popular author for children  it also explains why doctor who was such a successful show across the world  in this screenplay youre just dying for pulp fiction author to do something nasty to the kids but this doesnt happen  im not advocating child abuse but to see howard spitz lose his rag at the little ones would have made the movie rather better  can you imagine how much worse kindergarten cop would have been if the producers had gone all pc  i mean if youre making a movie centered around a childrens author who hates children shouldnt the story show and not tell  br br much of the problem lies with director vadim jean and you do get the feeling he doesnt know how to handle the material which is bad news for the movie  as someone previously noted the soundtrack is haphazard and kelsey grammar is very wooden  i guess he was trying to play it dead pan just like in that show hes famous for but it fails to work here and theres many scenes with quiet ridiculous camera angles which seem unintentional but which are very distracting  but at the end of the day the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because no one wanted to offend the audiences sensibilities
