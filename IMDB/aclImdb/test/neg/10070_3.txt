jp3 lacks the spielberg touch its an allout assault on the senses featuring in your face dinosaurs watching this film was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell br br the script is lame it simultaneously asks and then leaves too many questions unanswered also we dont really get to appreciate the humans in the film for all theyre worth for example william h macy is too great a talent to have to compete with dinothugs for our attention and laura dern was especially sympathetic in jp1 in this film shes barely a blip on the radar screenbr br the whole jp3 experience was t o o m u c h too much noise too many surprises too many characters dying off too much predictable gratuitous violence br br word to the wise vote yourself off this islandbr br i rated it a 3 for special effects i took off the other 7 points for having absolutely no originality
