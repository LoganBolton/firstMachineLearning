i had been looking forward to this movie since lost world came out it didnt bother me that lost world wasnt as intellectual as the original and here i was just hoping for a good monster movie it was all about dinosaurs eat people however it was disappointing even on that levelbr br for starters there were not enough people to eat and while ill keep it a secret how many people get eaten it was not enough also while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community there were not nearly enough dinosaurs and many dinosaurs like the spikeybackandhasaclubonitstailosaurus just made cameos and didnt do much considering how cool they arebr br start spoilers then there were the pterodactyls the figures ive read put their body weight at about 15 pounds while the movie made them look closer to 300 worse they didnt get to eat anybody or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them from high up there was no ending to the movie either it was just all of the sudden credits end spoilers im left wondering if the edition i saw was missing 40 minutes of filmbr br my only conclusion can be that they taught the pterodactyls to stick their long beaks stealthily into your pockets and get your 7 go rent the carnosaur series at least you wont be disappointed
