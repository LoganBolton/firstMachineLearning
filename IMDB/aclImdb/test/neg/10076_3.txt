to summarize my group of friends and i spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorites gaffes plot inconsistencies untied loose ends and other ridiculous aspects of this movie i found the story trite to the point of inconsequential and the plot lines as underdeveloped as the dino embryos still locked in the shaving cream canister from jurassic park 1 the editing was poor and none of the characters engendered any sort of sympathy or feeling in short this movie lacked any of the suspense and thrill that the first movie provided from a story standpointbr br even the new dinosaurs were few and far between although i really enjoyed the pterodactyls we got several brief shots of the new species and only 2 really were involved in the actionbr br as a scientist and former childhood paleontologist the lack of any real scientific content not that it had to be realistic but logically formed ie how they built the dinos in 1 and malcoms chaos ramblings was disappointing as wellbr br in short the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back on the scene to make some money i hope that moviegoers dont fall for this trap again although i did apparently
