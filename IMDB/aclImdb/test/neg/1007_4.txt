i was disappointed with the third film in the death wish series and wouldnt recommend this unless you are really into bronson he is his usual self in this one maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on tv  the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the ateam and i like the escapism fun of a show like the ateam but not on the big screen even if it is an action movie that doesnt claim to be anything to sophisticated the film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness the plot is something out of an episode of highway to heaven and bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you dont even get any satisfaction from bronsons revenge against the bad guys skip this and go on to the 4th installment which i highly recommend
