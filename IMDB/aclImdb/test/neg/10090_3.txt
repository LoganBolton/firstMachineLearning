imagine every stereotypical overacted cliche from every movie and tv show set on the streets of brooklyn between 1930 and 1980 populate it with a cast of interchangeable caricatures instead of actual characters throw in a mix of period music and wailing electric guitars during the rumble scenes then pass the time trying to figure out or care which of the deuces is going to be killed in the anticlimactic final rumblebr br ill give this movie points for not being just another romantic comedy teen slasher explosive action movie teen sex comedy kiddie musical or oscarnomination vehicle but bringing something new or interesting to the streetgang tragedy genre mightve been nice
