in a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950s leon the leader of the deuces starts the gang after his brother ods on junk he vows to protect the neighborhood the leader of the rival gang is just getting out of prison and wants revengebr br the movie didnt really do it for me the good guys werent any more good than the bad guys very little was shown to suggest that the deuces really cared for the community i suppose the writers were going for realism here but i just didnt care which side won none of the characters were likable or even capable of drawing my sympathybr br on the plus side the courtship between annie and bobby had some snappy dialog and the acting overall was well done
