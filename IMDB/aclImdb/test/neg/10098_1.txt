2001 wasnt perhaps eric roberts best year both raptor and this came out watched raptor a while ago and really thought it sucked and being erics worst but that had itÂ´s share moment of fun and dstandard this one doesnt have a thingbr br tommy lee thomas is the name of the probably worst actor in these days the story lacks any punch and the whole thing feels even slower than a snail breaking in curvesbr br the two thing that stands out are martin kove and eric roberts you could argue about their effort being good or what but compared to the rest they are above all criticismbr br i say thank you roberts see you next time and hopefully a better one
