enjoy the opening credits theyre the best thing about this secondrate but inoffensive timekiller which features passable performances from the likes of eric roberts and martin kove the main part however goes to newcomer tommy lee thomas who looks a bit diminutive for this kind of action but who nevertheless occasionally manages to project a bantyrooster kind of belligerence the first time we see him hes barechested sweaty and engaged in that favorite beefcake activity  chopping wood after this he has seven more scenes without his shirt including one in which hes hanged by his wrists and zapped with electricity a la mel gibson in lethal weapon he could use a better script however since the manner in which he exposes the truth about corruption and violence inside the prison is never very convincing theres also talk about millions of dollars which apparently is tied in with this investigation but which is never explained there are a few pluses though sending john woodrow undercover as john wilson is an amusing play on a presidential name and costar jody ross nolan shows promise as an inmate who early in the proceedings is shown hanged by his wrists and getting punched by a burly guard one final note the movies low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of extras despite the impressive size of the prison it only seems to hold about 12 inmates note the cast credits at the end arent too helpful for the record the burly baldheaded guard who uses jody nolan as a punching bag is played by bill fishback and the young fairhaired guard who administers electric shocks to tommy lee thomas is played by marc chenail
