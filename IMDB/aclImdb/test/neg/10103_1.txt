horrible acting with the worst special fx ive ever bore witness too its bad enough i wasted 3 to watch this crummy pile of crap but its the hour and a half time i lost that i couldve been doing anything else like getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duty getting drunk couldnt even help this videobr br to put it bluntly i sincerely believe i actually lost a few iq points during the course of watching this idiotic piece of mindnumbing work perhaps i should have followed my own advice this time never expect a decent film if its written directed and produced by the same person and never ever expect anything of value from jeff fahey
