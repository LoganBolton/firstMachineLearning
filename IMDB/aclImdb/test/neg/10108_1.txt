br br spoilersbr br im going to be as kind as i can about this film some people including directors can get quite upset when reviewers speak their mind sobr br there is a nice car accident and the opening credits look good and thats it everything else bites the big one all the acting is appalling the script is embarrassing the special effects look like they were done by school children on cheap computers all in all this film has serious bowling shoe tendenciesbr br as a horror film its not very scary and if it supposed to a thinking mans horror film well it succeeded on some level i kept thinking that the end of this film is an awfully long way away it may actually be an ironic look at bad horror films and im missing the point but i somehow doubt itbr br this is a complete car phone warehouse of a film and i could not recommend it to anyone and it does pain me to say this as i eagerly await the resurrection of british horrorbr br if you dont agree with this review that fine its just my own opinion and im sure someone out there will love it the directors mum for instance
