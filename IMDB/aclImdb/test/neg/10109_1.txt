well ill begin with this i love horrormovies not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present second this is the worst movie of all times it even beats mean guns and the attack of the killer tomatoes and for that i pay it homagebr br however the involuntary humor was only funny until half the movie had passed after which point everything was so so sad to my great surprise the reviews where somewhat divided and you guys who rated this piece of cmoviecrap from 7 and up i know youre joking good one hahaha because if there is any reason in the world and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is you cant be for realbr br everything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up so ill leave it br br minor spoiler alertbr br but the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dogkennel for ten minutes with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two really does it for me
