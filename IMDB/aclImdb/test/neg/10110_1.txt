this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen the cast is an international one  australianpretendingtobebritish stage american and a character with an english name sporting an unrecognizable european accent what passable efforts in acting from this motley crew are totally undermined by a plot and script of especial inanity so short were the shoestrings of this films budget and the overall production values are so low that it would have no trouble winning a cinematic limbo competition in the last twenty or so years we have seen horror films and stalkn slash thrillers of extraordinary though not necessarily high quality which have been made on no budget at all recent examples include the poorly made but totally scary blair witch project and of course  the most recent  that lowbudget winner saw featuring practically unknown leads gary elwes is just someone you dont remember even if you have seen him before in darkhunters it is shocking to find a known character actor dominique pinon and hollywood hasbeen jeff fahey struggling valiantly to save the film it is embarrassing to see the once handsome leading man fahey in corny makeup uttering bizarrely bad lines i would have rated this film 0 out of 10 had that been possible
