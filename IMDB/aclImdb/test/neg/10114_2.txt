its a shame theres an interesting idea here but it gets completely lost in a confusion of commodore 64 style computer effects and bad storytelling the plot such as it is concerns a bounty hunter of souls it should be a fairly straightforward hunterhunted kind of story but the director andor the writer seem like they forgot what the movie was supposed to be when they were about three days into shooting things arent helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like hes wearing a cheap darth maul mask which they tried to disguise with flowing cg colors not much to recommend here even the title seems to propel it into obscurity
