at what point does a film become so bad its good compelling in its awfulness darkhunters stands out as a shining example of cp cinematography and for that alone probably deserves some kind of awardbr br the plot revolves around the age old battle of heaven and hell for the unclaimed souls of the recently dead in the case of darkhunters the representatives of good and evil manifest themselves variously as a herd of cats a hooded grim reaper figure with a face of flickering flames similar to a coal effect electric fire a philip marlowealike with a seriously bad manicure and a female psychologist who appears to be on dayrelease from kwiksavebr br the protagonists are competing for the soul of a newly dead teacher who spends most of the film running around a foggy field and bizarrely a boarding kennels in an attempt to evade his pursuersbr br the plot is spread thinner than a dieters sandwich with no character development or attempt to build suspense the acting is laughable comparable to a school play  although that would be an insult to many educational establishments and the dialogue  oh how my sides ached with the unclaimed souls of the dead being described as lifes unwanted gherkins by the flameglow demon you wonder whether hell really is a mcdonaldsbr br but is is bizarrely compelling you find yourself watching just to see how bad it can get  at just over 80 minutes its worth the time spent for the unintentional giggles
