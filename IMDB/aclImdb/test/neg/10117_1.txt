this is truly one of the most awful movies of all time its dull ponderous badly acted and teeth crawlingly pretentiousbr br i watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold before realising there wasnt any the shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful these have to be the worst day for night shots since plan nine from outer spacebr br the only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous demons wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket how scary is that and i did like the moggys used as extras i suppose they are least cheap though it did seem a bit obvious that they had been enticed into camera by the careful placement of some tunabr br this film is so dreadful it should have a public health warning there was a queue at my local video store when i took it back of people demanding their money back i kid you not
