hm where do i start i usually ignore whatever rating imdb has when looking up a movie because i think i might like it anyway or whatever and i should at least give it a chance but this time i wish id paid attentionbr br i know some people liked it and im not trying to say that they shouldnt it was semiamusing at some parts but if youre like me and you dont like watching cats prancing around in the undergrowth for 20 minutes random fast motion cloud scenes dogs barking in cages for another 20 minutes set to thrilling music and closeups of faces while people are speaking then you might want to avoid this movie the actors were either positively wooden or way over the top and the film quality was awful fuzzy and grainy and bland and not in an artistic way at all and i know that we were supposed to think that carol was not just a crazy maniac with a gun shooting innocent people with this weird religious psychosis going on but well she doesnt really convince me otherwise in fact i ended up really disliking her crazy character and what was up with the souls in space i understand this is a fantasy movie but come onbr br i will say the angel at the end was freaking creepy it was the creepiest thing in the whole movie way more creepy than the darth maul lavaface demon i give them props for that scene it was good but not good enough to actually see the movie and the opening credits were great but dont be fooled i wouldve rather they used whatever money went into those credits to make the movie betterbr br bah i wish i hadnt bought this for even the 2 that i paid for it i could have bought a candy bar instead
