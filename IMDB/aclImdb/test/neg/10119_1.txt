first of all i really cant understand how some people enjoyed this movie its the worst thing i have ever seen even the actors seem to be boredand i think that says it allbr br however i have to give my applause to the opening credits creators  that team seems to have a really good future thats why i recommend the big studios to watch only the opening credits and one or two special effects sequences if theyre watched outside this movie it almost looks like a good moviebr br better luck or judgment next time for the producers of this this this thing
