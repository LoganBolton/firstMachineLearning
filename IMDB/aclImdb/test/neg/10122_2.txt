this is arguably the worst of the major ava gardner films yes she is gorgeous but that can wear thin over time especially after the corny and predictable movie endingbr br in this turkey robert walker has to pretend that hes eddie bracken which surely embarrassed him olga san juan plays the jane powell golly gee part dick haymes plays a sort of dim sidekick  and eve arden plays helen broderick and a host of other wisecracking female semicomedians yes the film contains a major popular song speak low but check out the other entirely forgettable pieces dick haymes sings very well of course and so does the uncredited vocalist dubbing for avabr br the sets are cheap the script is filled with clich√©s and failed humor and tom conway looks as though he has been battling with liquor as indeed he was in short if you want to see ava in her prime buy a photo and stay well clear of this movie
