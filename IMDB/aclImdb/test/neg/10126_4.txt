for a series that was inspired by kolchak its ironic that the x files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on its ass 3 has always puzzled me and  at the risk of sounding like the dreadful hans keller  ive often wondered if im missing the point the story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that dont match the box and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea this incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it i know that this review puts me in danger of being dragged to whitby by teenage vampires wholl drink my blood while listening to busted but thats a risk im willing to take ive always been a werewolf man myself
