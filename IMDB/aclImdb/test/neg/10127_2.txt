you might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting but its far from that take the concept for example the main characters have a big secret that they hide from theyre peers its just like hannah montana and thats so raven next the acting is just average selena gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes lastly the jokes are either clich√© or boring if theyre not using theyre colorful yet strange dialog to make us laugh they are throwing various props around the room i really wish this show would use more original and entertaining material in conclusion wisards of waverly place is a disappointment
