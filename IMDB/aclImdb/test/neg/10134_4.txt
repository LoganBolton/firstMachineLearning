imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are chasing you where is the absolute last place you want to hide id say inside the uncanny virgin of nuremberg torture device because theres a good risk youll get brutally spiked to death and yet the elderly lady in this film stupidly runs into her spiked coffin the vampires coffin is a rather disappointing sequel as director fernando méndez doesnt recreate the gothic atmosphere of the 1957original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs no more ominous castles with eerie cobwebs and dark vaults but confused doctors and clumsy assistants that provoke laughs instead of frights the story opens inside count de lavuds final resting place where an eminent doctor and a hired assistant steal the coffin in order to examine the corpse at a private clinic naturally the wooden stake gets removed from his heart and the vampire count comes to live again immediately enslaving the petty thief to do his dirty work the vampire has his eye on a beautiful female patient at the clinic and its up to dr enrique saldívar to rescue her soul and to destroy the bloodsucker the vampires coffin uses a limited amount of locations and theres very little action the whole film would actually be pretty boring if it werent for a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting performances the photography is amazing though with the sublime use of shadows and darkness this is most notably during the scene in which count de lavud stalks a young woman through the deserted streets of little town at night its the only truly worthwhile scene of the whole film the rest is fairly mediocre and déjàvu
