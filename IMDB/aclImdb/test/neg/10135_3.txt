ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie but this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason furthermore many changes have made the story illogical a few examples 1 in the movie paul renauld really meets poriot before he dies in the book poirot only gets a letter telling him he is afraid to be killed this is completely stupid because if renaulds plan would have succeeded poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been renauldpoirot was in the morgue when mrs renauld identified the victim 2 the movie has combined two persons into one cinderella has been removed by the movie the girl hastings falls in love with and the exgirlfriend of jack renauld are one person in the movie why for gods sake 3hastings finds the victims cause he is such a bad golf player totally unfunny and stupid 4 the movie tells secrets much too early for example at the very beginning so you know things you shouldnt know 5 the murderer gets shot at the end by a person who doesnt exists in the book perhaps because the person cinderella who stops the murderer does not exists in the movie 6the book is very complex the movie takes only about 90 minutes sure it is difficult to include all the necessary details but it is impossible if you include stupid things which were not in the book and have no meaning eg bicycle race
