my parents may enjoy this show but i fail to find the humor in it what is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team absolutely nothing its a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays blame that on shows like the dating game and the newlywed game bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid1960s sure the series has its touching moments still thats no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series this is nothing like the familyoriented days of i love lucy some five decades before br br an answer i would have to why this series plays on the lifetime cable channel is because that channels brass think women can relate to rebas character i absolutely dislike the character of reba harts daughter kyra she is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager funny i wonder if the actress who played kyra scarlett pomers is like that in real life away from acting who plays the blockhead exhusband dentist christopher rich is not much better barbara jean played by melissa peterman is ditsy in herself the characters of van and cheyenne are also very annoyingbr br something else that baffles me is why the dingbatofaseries creator allison m gibson decided to set the series in where i live 25 miles away from houston texas reba mcentire isnt even from this state shes an oklahoman why is it during one season or more they decided to make the incidental music sound like a pig snorting what i mean by that is where we hear this baritone saxophone being played with drums accompanying it but the melodies are basically tuneless
