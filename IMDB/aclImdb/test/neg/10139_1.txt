reba is  without a doubt  one of the worst comedy series ever i wonder how come there are people writing good comments on reba  you watch friends  married wtih children  fraizer if you laugh at that  you can never laugh at the stupid jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer who is trying to make her way in comedy and obviously having no chance whatsoever the actorsactresses beside reba are ok so i feel bad for them stucking in a socalled comedy show with the least funnies person in the world rebato sum up  i suggest this tv show to see how low comedy can get and appreciate the ones that can make you laugh
