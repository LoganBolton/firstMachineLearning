this really is an okay series everyone in it is pretty good but i just cant take reba shes trying to be funny but she just isnt and then she got a stupid accent if they took her out of the show i would love to see it every daybr br i have been watching the show in 10 min now and as i said before reba is destroying the show however the 20 year old guy dont know his name but hes soooo funny and hes really saving it allbr br so heres the recipe to get a great show kick reba of it and then put the 20 year old guy into the lead rolebr br i really hope someone out there agrees with me and thinks like me that they should kick reba of the show and put someone else in the lead role
