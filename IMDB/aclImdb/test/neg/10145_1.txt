while it would be easy and accurate to go into why reba is at its heart indicative of many familyoriented sitcoms in the way it rips off from other better sitcoms the real truth is that the show is repetitive full of stereotypes from funnier and more groundbreaking shows and the lead star is completely out of her element while im sure ms mcintire can sing and has a fan base that supports that being in a sitcom shooting out zingers and calling her the next lucille ball is far far removed from realitybr br reba herself has no presence which is needed here to establish the fact that she is cast as the putupon woman of which her entire family is centered yet after watching a few episodes there is no real connection to the character i could care less about her adventures because her whole character seems to be mia reba mcintire has no screen presence and to make a show around her seems very shortsighted and indicative of most familyoriented programming to push a sitcom full of menstupidwomendoeverything stereotypes that appeal to nobody but those who cant afford cablebr br the show is a waste of time the only good thing is that it at least has better production values than your standard pax ripoffjust
