i got this on a double feature dvd called scream theater and its no doubt one of the most terrible movies ive ever seen and ive seen some really bad ones schools out and of three girls who if theyre teenagers id eat my hat are talking about nonstop party so of course they all go to the house of the girl whose parents are the most strict for a slumber party meanwhile a psychotic has escaped the local bughouse where one girls father works  is on the loose with sharp objects and wearing green scrubs and sporting wideopen eyesi guess thats to show hes bonkers of course since he has a bone to pick with that particular doctor off he goes to his house the location of which is apparently common knowledge in the meantime some dumbjock types are slamming down beers and out to scare the girls and of course the loony shows up too and starts cutting throats and thats about it as the heavy metal music chugs along in the background or maybe thats not it but really thats all you need to know unless you spend your time perpetually stoned or drunk youll find little of interest here and even if you are wasted most of the time youll still probably find your intelligence insulted 1 out of 10
