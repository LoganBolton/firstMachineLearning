my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago and i must say this is the single best movie i have ever seen i mean woah dude we better get some brew before this joint closes and dude lindas not wearin a bra again what poetry woah and its such a wonderfuly original movie too i mean you dont usually find a slasher film where every single murder is exactly the same i mean exactly now thats originality and almost all the transitions between scenes are these great closeups of the psycho in the er scrubs how cool the acting is so wonderful to the dad was just brilliant must have studied real dads before filming and how many movies do you find that just dont make any sense not many but this is one of those gems i mean how cool is it that one guy waited outside for like six hours to pull a prank while his friends were both inside thats really cool overall id say this is the single greatest film of the genre nay in the world
