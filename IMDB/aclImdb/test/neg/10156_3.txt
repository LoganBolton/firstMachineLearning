oh well its funny should have been a sadistic comedy a lot of horror movies lack common sensebut i think a retarded caveman would weasel his way around this situation dont really expect hitchcock or anything close to this this is a good one for friendsbut i wouldnt recommend it for anything elsethis movie lacks all the substance of a true horror moviethe suspensethe shockand good characters the killer failed to be the unstoppable force that i expected him to beand he seemed to be the average angry d student able to outsmart only stupid people and the really funny thing is the horrible acting and the lack of emotion of the so called victimsbr br 310 just expect this one in the daily funnies
