two years after this movie was made the juror came out dont waste your time on this one see the juror instead the juror is essentially the same story as trial by jury with better acting better directing and a far more gripping aura about it william hurt was not believable as a copgonebad and armand assante couldnt be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit you didnt become involved enough with joann whalleys character to be that upset by what was happening to her also the way in which she interacted with the jury wasnt compelling or interesting in any way kathleen quinlans role as a hookerkiller wasnt fleshed out enough and quite frankly was unnecessary for to the plot
