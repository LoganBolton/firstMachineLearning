this movie was the biggest piece of garbage ive seen in a long timebr br its marketed as as scifi when in fact its nothing more than a christian recruiting toolbr br it tells you quite a bit about the state of the christian church when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch but then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child molesters in their organizationbr br religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants hypocrites and war mongers lets not forget our bumbling former president actually came out and said that god told him to invade iraq and nobody questioned if he was hearing voices or seeing things br br anyway going of the subject here no this movie has nothing to do with ufos whatsoever its nothing more than a religious production
