my wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store from the cover it looked like a sciencefiction film but upon turning it over my wife saw rebecca st james was in the film realized it was a christian movie and suggested we watch it we are conservative evangelicals but we also know that christian films have a poor reputation in the mainstream nevertheless we decided to give it a screeningbr br to be fair there were a few things i liked about the film the musical score  much of which was orchestrated  was quite good the cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lowerbudget moviebr br unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script the film begins with an interesting premise  ufo abductions  but by midway through the feature the storyline veers wildly into an evangelistic crusade spearheaded by the movies two main characters which then veers wildly into a treatise on the rapture at least the frank perettiinspired the visitation which was itself a deeply flawed film had an endgame that tied together the movies premise unidentified ends nowhere even close to where it started which is a huge letdownbr br as for the acting the supporting acting ranges from decent to awful rebecca st james plays a bit part and is passable for their part a few of the main characters are manned capably enough sadly their talents are wasted on characters so onedimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable the protagonists are anything but you know its bad when two christian viewers find the most vocal christian character in the film to be the most annoyingbr br a final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie which will be of more interest to christian than nonchristian readers in a word it is embarrassing other christian films like carmens the champion and perettis the hangmans curse have managed to communicate a genuinely uncompromising portrait of the christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive this film by contrast is a sledgehammer that feels so heavyhanded and lacking in tact that a nonchristian would have a hard time taking it seriouslybr br i do believe that the filmmakers heart is in the right place and i applaud efforts to create good christian film unfortunately this is not one of them if your church is looking for a screening of a good christian film consider mercy streets the aforementioned the champion or if youre pentecostal robert duvalls provocative the apostle br br as for unidentified rent it if you must but screen it before you show it to a nonchristian or a larger audience
