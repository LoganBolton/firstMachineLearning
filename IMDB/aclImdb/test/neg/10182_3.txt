wow just wow there are a lot of reviews on this movie already but i wanted to add some comments of my own i agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting writing and directing  whoo boy does it ever however i think there is some other problems herebr br 1 why is christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive the film acts as though you just cant be a christian and also allow for the possibility why they eversobriefly touch on this in the film ie the bible doesnt say there is aliens well the bible doesnt say there isnt but the actual rebuttal is never answered the bible really doesnt say there isnt so how about dealing with the question instead of dismissing it out of hand or better yet acknowledge that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite god there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for thembr br 2 how come the only two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and hoax what about sleep paralysis and night terrors which have been linked to abduction experiences what if its something else entirely too bad the film makers already have their minds made upbr br 3 the film makers claim that all who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult thats a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present im not necessarily arguing that they dont but if youre going to say something so asinine youd better have the facts to back it upbr br 4 why does the other reporter not the greasy haired blonde guy the other one always have his hands in his pockets its hard to take someone seriously when theyre constantly playing pocket poolbr br i wish this had been an exploration of christian faith and ufo phenomena but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their faith message to care much about make a thought provoking movie as a christian myself this saddens me
