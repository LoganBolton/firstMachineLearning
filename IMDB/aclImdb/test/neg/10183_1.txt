i happened across this movie while channelsurfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly made christian film about the end times which i find rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously to be fair i only saw the last 30 minutes so i missed the part about ufos and the scifi stuff but it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and appalling representation of the christian faith as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sensebr br as a film the script was terrible the acting was mediocre and the pacing was poor the cinematography and direction were subpar no interesting visuals no layered plot line no creativity dont just blame it on the budget films can still be interesting without special effects this wasnt christian films cannot excuse their mediocrity and unoriginality in the artistic sphere just because of their message and the message here was hardly christianbr br disclaimer the rest of this comment is targeted towards christiansbr br first off it is unethical in any business to baitandswitch your customers i dont like being told i can win a free ipod only to realize i have to spend 300 at participating stores first nonchristians dont like being told theyre watching a scifi film and then get bombarded with christian propaganda that has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer hidden agendas dont win you any friends much less converts br br secondly you should not use overt threats to convince people your beliefs are true the actors who represented christians came off as callous smug bullies when dealing with the skeptical unbeliever they even go so far as to stage the rapture in order to scare him into believing representational dialogue turn to jesus or go to hell fine dont believe me but youll be sorry the day you die i can guarantee youll wish you paid more attention to this jesus stuff when you land in the belly of hell ok i may be exaggerating but it certainly came off in the same manner if you think this is a clear message for christ youre wrong i dont recall jesus using threats and coercion and i dont think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of fear so christians please dont use this as a witnessing tool for your unsaved friends it is heavyhanded offensive and inaccurate in portraying a true christian messagebr br thirdly the theology was bad apart from characterizing jesus as a means of hellinsurance it gave no room for debate or discussion and didnt attempt to engage the issue of whether ufos or alien life could exist instead it offered one pat answer ufos are the devils scheme to deceive people when the rapture happens which is neither biblical nor widelyaccepted by most christians as the bible doesnt mention ufos or aliens you cant use it as a source to draw conclusions one way or the other the rapture isnt necessarily even a widelyaccepted sound biblical concept though nowadays most evangelical christians seem to believe it because of a popular book series if you do your research as so many of the supportive reviewers are suggesting the idea of two comings of christ the first as the rapture is a relatively new phenomena in church tradition popularized by some traveling evangelists around the turn of the 20th century the majority of orthodox christians will probably find this films message to be a pretty big stretch that rests on a lot of unsupported presuppositionsbr br basically this film misses the mark both as a worthwhile piece of entertainment and as an accurate representation of christianity and its beliefs i wouldnt recommend it
