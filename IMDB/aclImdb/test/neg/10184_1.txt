movies about ufos are always a nice way to kill some time so on a rainy sunday evening i picked up this flick expecting what can be expected from a directtodvd ufo mysterybr br boy was i wrong at about halfway in the movie it becomes very apparent that the ufo theme is just a deceptive way of attracting unsuspecting viewers to this christian propaganda and this is not just a christan movie from an average christian no this is christianity of the extremist fundamentalist kind the scary kindbr br in the end of this movie the nonbelieving lead is tricked by their colleagues using a practical joke in thinking that the rapture has started which is believed by christians to be the happening in the end of time where true believers are going to heaven and nonbelievers are left behindbr br when the joke is explained it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer just in case we christians are right now thats a lamest excuse ever to become a christian if you ask mebr br this movie still tries to convert nonbelievers using scare tactics believe in god or you will go to hell is the message here simple but quite offensive really especially because this movie is being sold as something completely differentbr br now lets assume youre a christian fundamentalist yourself and youre not likely to be offended by the themes in this movie is this a good movie im afraid it isnt no actually im lying im glad it isnt the acting is horrible the pacing is horrible the plot is horrible especially the ending is laughably bad as soon as the movie starts you immediately sense that this is going to be worse than you expected and you will be rightbr br in the first half hour it seems to at least attempt to set up a passable ufo mystery but then suddenly they bring in this count dracula lookalike that starts babbling about the devil at first you just think this dude is just a crazy maniac but as it turns out he actually represents the real views of the makers of this movie as soon as you start realizing this you know how this is going to end up but actually it ends up worsebr br avoid
