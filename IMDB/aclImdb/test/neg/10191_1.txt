i just happened to stumble to this film and checked imdb for more information score 67 well not so bad genre scifigood i like scifi so i got the movie and i was looking forward to have a relaxing sunday evening watching it but butnobr br as in summary this isnt a movie at all it is a religious advertisement including preatching about jesus god devil end of the world etc movie starts with a epic abduction story driving at night car stops bright light and so on well actually that was the film last of this ummm frankly i dont know what to call itwas dialogue about end of the world and last judgement quite a same stuff what these tvpreachers tell you but they are good at itbr br honestly if you want to see a scifi movie or something with ufos please stay far away from this thing it has nothing to do with them if you want to hear some cuckoo heads opinion what the bible has to say and what you should do then go ahead and watch this thing but i still prefer going to the church at sundaybr br this is complete bull and evangelical christian propaganda as another users said well i should have red another users comments before i got the movie br br 27 of voters have rated this thing as 10 yeah right please go somewhere else to do your propaganda
