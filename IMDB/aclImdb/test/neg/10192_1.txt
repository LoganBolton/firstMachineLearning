christian propagandalots of fear mongeringbr br this is not scifi this is chrifi christian fictionthe movie started out ok but took a sharp christian right turn from then on it was all about god jc the holy bible and the devil  the ufos are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe satans idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the biblebr br the abductions could be used to explain away the rapture the people left behind would believe it was a mass alien abduction instead of god taking all the christians to heaven no reason to repent if its aliens the deeper message in the movie is that if you dont believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose
