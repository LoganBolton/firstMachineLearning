how awful is it let me count the ways 1 it is a baitandswitch movie that starts out being about a ufo investigation then turns into a highpressure sales job for christianity cmon if the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message why disguise it it annoys nonbelievers and pushes fencesitters in the opposite direction 2 its not even a good sales pitch if the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them id run like hell in the opposite direction theyre scary 3 the acting is terrible they all behave as if they were in an educational film about etiquette in the workplace 4 the cinematography is homemovie bad wait actually its not even that good 5 script bad bad bad all dialogue no action like a tennis match they bounce back and forth between the talking head close ups 6 direction what direction oh there must have been a director there somewhere i challenge you to figure out wherebr br believe it or not i have some positive comments about this movie the editing seemed professional but couldnt make a difference a good edit of bad material is still a bad movie the opening theme music was actually very good very scary and ufoish too bad the movie wasnt about ufosbr br if you cant tell already heres the bottom line i wasted my money seeing this movie and it made me angry if they had not disguised what this movie was really about i could say it was my fault
