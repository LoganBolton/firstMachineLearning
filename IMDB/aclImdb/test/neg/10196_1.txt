this movie was terrible it is not something that people should have to pay to see it looks like some christian group made it to convert people i dont understand why it was released to theaters and not to tvbr br it started out like an old fashioned b movie scifi film from the 50s but quickly changed about 30 minutes into the movie the characters start talking about god and do you believe in jesus it quickly moves into pure religion territorybr br i thought i was going to a scifi movie the film has poor acting bad camera angles and is amateurishbr br avoid it
