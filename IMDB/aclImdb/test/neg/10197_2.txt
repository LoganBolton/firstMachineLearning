calling this a sunday school movie might be generous because even as a christian i found the religious message so onedimensional that i wouldnt want to see it at my church the message is read your bible go to church and sign up for fire insurance so you wont get left behind at the rapture there was no love i guess when you get right down to it i dont believe in the god portrayed in this film the guy who was supposed to have all of the spiritual answers came across like count draculabr br aside from the spiritualreligious element the script was tedioussaying the same thing over and over that might have been to make up for some of the acting which was unable to deliver a convincing line the first time so they just said the same thing over and overbr br i did enjoy the final scenes i thought it made a point without hitting someone over the head or stooping to a sunday school formula the movie wasnt all bad just most of itbr br i am in favor of more clean movies that are welldone and that present truth in a nonpreachy way this wasnt one of those i am sorry to say i took my family to this film wanting to support that kind of movie now id like my money back
