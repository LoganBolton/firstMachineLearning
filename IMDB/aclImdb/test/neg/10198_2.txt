unfortunately i went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information i had seen on fandango since i am a scifi buff the notion of a movie about ufos interested mebr br instead this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical christian propaganda flick appropriate for an audience of likeminded individuals but very unchristian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions shame on you at least the da vinci code did not hold back its wildeyed crazinessbr br so this bgrade movie and i am being kind production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs probably shown to wednesday and sunday evening youth groups but if you are a mainline christian or nonchristian you will not be comfortable
