this movie changed my life hogans performance was nothing short of incredible and i still havent recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 oscar nominations and as brightly as the hulkster shines in this movie you cant discount the brilliant writing and direction that vaults this masterpiece in to the highest strata of achievement in film if you havent seen this movie drop what your doing right now and get yourself a copy i guarantee it will blow your mind and if you dont like it then i just have one question for you watcha gonna do when the 24 inch pythons and hulkamania runs wild on you
