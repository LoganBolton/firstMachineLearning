in 1989 here in nz wrestling was somewhat of a megahype phenom and who was steering starship at the pinnacle was the orange goblin himself hulk hogan one of my uberheroes at this time so it seems obvious to me now why i adored this movie in 198990 when it came out here hulk hogan aka terry bollea is a shockingly bad actor and zeus aka tiny lister is worse the story line follows a standard wwe then wwf circa 8891 story line culminating in the standard good guy beat down hulk up and then get beaten down again story line only to follow that the good guy calls on all his inner strength gained from eating vitamins saying prayers etc etc  to mount the epic come back pretty standard formula here worth watching if only for reminiscing your youth
