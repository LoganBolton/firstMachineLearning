alert this review contains major spoilers do not read on if you plan to see this filmbr br judging from the amount of votes this got my vote was the fifth one very few people know or care who mimi lesseos is well back in the late 1980s professional wrestling was pretty decent an allwomans federation called the ladies professional wrestling association opened it was a great league and mimi lesseos was one of the names on the roster i always thought she was one of the best people the lpwa had in terms of ring skill and acting ability unfortunately the lpwa closed down in the early 90s so it only seemed natural for someone with as much talent as mimi to start an acting career right but surely there was an alternative to stuff like this this movie is really bad as it was going along i kept comparing it to an underrated movie called survivor quest only this film lacks everything that made survivor quest enjoyablebr br as i started the tape i went to fast forward through the preview to get to the meat of the tape at first i wasnt paying much attention but then i realized that the preview was for a movie starring mimi lesseos oh i thought heres another movie featuring mimi to look for but as the preview dragged on i became aware that is was a preview forbeyond fear you know youre in trouble when the only preview at the beginning features the movie you are about to watch the plot of this thing is pretty standard lesseos plays an exkickboxer that is living with the guilt of injuring an opponentfriend so she focuses herself on her second career which she shares with her friend sammy being a wilderness guide on this particular occasion she gets a troop of three couples two of the couples are just there to take up space you think that one couple a caucasian husband and a korean wife will be explored as an issue appears between them halfway through the film but it is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about bears in the woods which consistently scares the korean wife the joke is funny the first time you hear it but it certainly isnt by the ninth time they do it the third couple is just painful to watch it consists of mr and mrs page they trade insults back and forth and mr page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism when hes not busy playing cruel jokes on his portly wifejust like your typical american couple before the hike mr page is spying on two stupid guys and their prostitute one of them accidentally kills the prostitute and finds out mr page taped it so begins the peril as the two guys track the group on their trip and we waitand waitand waitand wait for them to finally do something when they do its a fiascobr br you cant blame the cast they try as hard as they can with the material they have to work with the main culprit is director robert f lyons who needs to go back to playing bit parts and stay out of the directors chair lyons starts and stops scenes in such a sloppy sudden matter that you start to think he was suffering from dyspepsia throughout the entire shoot theres even one incompetent moment when a broad daylight scene with the thugs is slipped between some nighttime scenes then there is the sound department the music and background noise completely overpower the dialogue so that you have to move your ear right next to your televisions speaker dont bump your head on the screen it isnt worth it to hear the poorly written lines speaking of poor writing lesseos gets some of the credit there as cowriter the few interesting developments between characters are often abandoned for shots of the thugs or bad practical jokes early on lesseos knocks out a thug with a switchblade knife so not once do you think they are in any danger from the two stupid thugs when the crooks finally get their rear ends kicked by lesseos in a well done and long fight our cast all have a huge laugh together despite the fact that one of them has been shot and is bleeding everywhere yes everyone is happy in the end everyone except the poor souls witnessing the film wishing for the good old glory days when mimi performed in the wrestling ring zantaras score 4 out of 10
