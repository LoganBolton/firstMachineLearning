over the gw is a near failure of a debut feature and not because its not without tryingactually it is its a shamble all the more because its writerdirectortechnical everyman nick gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film sometimes a first time filmmaker full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed unsure and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story the extremely personal side gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story gaglia who was 13 when put into a horrid program that basically tortured and brainwashed their patients with crazy group scare tactics psychological mindf sessions that could go on for days and attitudes from the rehab leaders that would make most nazis cringe escaped finally when he was 15 im glad he got out though it might help if he now goes into a real rehab for his filmmaking skills if only for a couple of days to learn things like say structure proper lighting fluid camera movement subtlety with actors and other basics that are perpetually lost herebr br its all the more frustrating because gaglia is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public there was recently a newsweek article referring to a similar aa cultrehab many times one wonders if certain personal character studies might work better as documentaries as opposed to narrative dramas this is an evernagging sensation throughout over the gw where it almost feels like gaglia wants to tell the truth but doesnt know how to communicate it properly through his characters the character that one would think is closest to him bronx teen tony serra gallagher who is taken by his mother to a rehab in new jersey would be closest to gaglia is actually much more of a onedimensional being where there is very little backstory we see a brief freakout in black and white in his old home and little connection to his mother moriarty who has more potential that is never tapped aside from a cold stone who passes her kids off to another but there is a story to go with his twoyear crisis i guessbr br right off the bat things get rough a nude cavity search in the first five minutes and soon its clear that instead of medical care its more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious sect where the head doctor hiller insinnia is a total overcontrolling loon but soon tonys sister sofia donohue gets thrown in to the program and as opposed to tonys repeated moments of outrage and supposed noncompliance she goes headon through the whackedout three step program and once released becoming a runaway at times there are bits in this fractured nightmare where theres one woman a 22 year old mother who has been in the program a year and a half finds shes become a prisoner not allowed to leave and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an enraged visit to hiller when sofia finally returns to them that do contain some raw power very brief glimpses of gaglia being able to at least garner some leverage in pure melodramabr br but these are moments few and far between its not just the unsuccessful characters who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that veer into being like hysterical dare ripoffs maybe some of them like an angry black youth the passiveaggressive counselors or even serras older sister who is ratted out by the siblings as having taken a hit off a joint and almost thrown into the program would resonate more if there was more time given to develop any of them its that gaglia is so unfocused in his multiple roles on his tiny 30000 budget that not one side of whatever potential talent he has can come through he overuses tints mostly with a shade that looks urinecoated he jiggles his handheld dvx camera as if its supposed to be intense ala city of god occasionally a character will just shoot into frame randomly his choices of music are like the worst selections possible from pseudoindie softrockers and theres even inane fake interview scenes with nicholas serra inspiration  and krakowsky that feel about as false as possiblebr br could gaglia just not get any interviews with the real victims he was with and resort to wouldbe artistically cathartic plan b bottom line no matter how much fromtheheart true life stories may appeal to you dont bother seeing it in the theater or even on rental unless you love a final scene with two kids staring off into the digitalhued hudson river sunset with the final words reading dedicated to the kids oy
