now im a big animation fan  love svankmeyer and usually am into all applications of stop motion so i had high hopes for this one then i came on imdb and paused  im always real suspicious of films with a bimodal distribution of votes on imdb here weve got another  a bunch of 10s shill anyone and then some real low ones im also suspicious of 10s with the word visionary in them br br sure there are visionaries but this character isnt one of them despite my misgivings i saw this film and have to side with the ones the stop motion animation was okay but the plots were banal and overall it seemed amateurish treat yourself to the real deal get some svankmeyer and leave this also ran on the shelf
