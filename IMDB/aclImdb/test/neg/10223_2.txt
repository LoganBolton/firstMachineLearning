walt was particularly fond of quality so how come the producers at disney would release such a terribly edited roughly acted even for family fare mess of a movie the big green had a good concept and since it is disney you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously but the big green is horrible the jokes are lame and steve guttenburg still alive pulls in another terrible performance on his resumebr br kids with too much time on their hands in small town elma are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play soccer the kids dont know a thing though and gracious for us we get to see steve guttenburg try to hit on the teacher from beginning to endbr br the speed up camera work does not work the big green is full of speeding the pace of characters to move the movie along kids are not idiots they will catch on if you give them enough of a hint without showing all that garbage guttenburg for once in his life should have turned down an offer to join this movie also the pretty olivia dabo should have called this one off too the big green can be known as the big bomb
