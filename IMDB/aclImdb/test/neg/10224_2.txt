this movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me everything i hate about films is present fake sentimentality extreme corniness bad child actors and more feature abundantly thats ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of american sports fans with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon what thats a rugby ball the story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like who coincidently teaches the class in a short skirt and gets them interested in football naturally theyre all rubbish dont forget theyre no hopers except for one kid who has moved from el paso blah blah etc etc and the kids still dont become good footballers but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of wellrounded kids hell even the adults start to come round drunks are turned into caring parents illegal immigrants are let off the hookgroanbr br this movie stars steve guttenberg now before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy hold up a minute guttenberg is rubbish no no come on lets face it how did this guy ever get to be in a movie i have absolutely no idea and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea olivia dabo stars along side steve and doesnt impress either she merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it although i have no problems with the latter part her performance does the movie no credit the child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this most of them are disgusting andor annoying and it doesnt make for pleasant viewing at all theres a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job but you wouldnt see a movie for a goat so dont bother seeing this movie
