nothing more than a soccer knockoff of the mighty ducks this film proved to be annoying in most aspects this was one of those times where youre parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they dont have to deal with them for a few hours to say the least my younger sisters liked it but it proved to be too much like the far superior mighty ducks oh well at least olivia dabo was hot and steve guttenberg still had a job at that point in time
