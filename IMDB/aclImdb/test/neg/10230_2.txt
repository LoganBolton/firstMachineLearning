i loved the first movie the second one was okay disappointed john cleese wasnt jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character but the third onewhat happened to the animation it looks low budget like a sat morning cartoon except for the flashback which was taken from the first movie they really should have stopped after number 2 this just makes the rest look bad dereks voice has changed but its not as recognizable as jean bobrogers also looks very strange i also dont understand where rothbart came from i thought he died this movie made me want to turn it off as much as i love the first one i was very disappointed with this installment they will never beat the original
