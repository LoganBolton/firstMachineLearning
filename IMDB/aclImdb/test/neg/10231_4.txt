i had to rent a couple of movies for my little cousin for new years and she picked out the swan princess the mystery of the enchanted kingdom and the little mermaid 2 and we just watched both films while shes sleeping i figured i could get a couple comments in  while this is a very cheesy cartoon it really wasnt that bad you have to admit that for children these plots are new to them and it could be a great introduction of these stories to thembr br odette finds out that derek has been secretly keeping the magic secrets of rosthoe and she tells derek to destroy them immediately but him being a guy typically he does not do so and tells her that no on could achieve the magics without his help when a witch named zelda gets her hands on them she finds out that derek tore off the last words of a spell she wants to use to destroy everything and she kidnaps odette in order to retrieve this informationbr br the swan princess the mystery of the enchanted kingdom is silly and predictable but for the kids i would honestly say its a go its so rare we have these clean cut cartoons now a days so im going to cut the film some slack it was just weird seeing all the voices change all of a sudden i grew up with the first one so i guess it was just stuck in my headbr br 410
