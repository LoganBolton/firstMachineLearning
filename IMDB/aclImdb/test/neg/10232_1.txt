i am the sort of person who never ever watches animated movies but i make an exception for thumbelina and the swan princess being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series i bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind determined to love it because id spent money buying it i finished the movie and all i can think is the horror i wanted to like it i really did i tried very very hard to like it but i couldnt enjoy a second of this grueling film the songs made me feel like ripping my ears out of my head the dialogue was so lame i felt myself twitching with frustration and irritation every time someone opened his or her mouth the villain was laughable and i felt myself wanting derek and odette to die in the end and i was absolutely in love with them from the first filmbr br i am going to try repress the memory of this movie because it almost destroyed the first one for me there is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film the difference in animation between the two is made very obvious and i began yearning for the first one and wishing id never set eyes on the thirdbr br do yourself and favor and dont waste your time
