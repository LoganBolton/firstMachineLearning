wow was this version of the racketeer tough to watch while none of the other reviews have mentioned this the public domain version i watched was seriously flawed the sound track was off by about 10 secondsmeaning the dialog and action never came close to matching so youd hear something occur well before you saw ita very confusing proposition the worst is where you hear a gun shot and only later doe the guy get hit and slump to his death in a taxibr br while this seriously marred the film it also made concentrating on the dialog easierand showed the serious shortcomings of it as well the dialog was simply awfuloften delivered with almost no inflection or feeling as one review said it was like watching a high school play part of this is understandable as sound was a new medium but this films dialog was bad even compared to other 1929 filmsreally bad and like many of these early sound films the film was just too talkywith sappy and overly melodramatic language and just not much action and youd think with a title like the racketeer that there would be some action however its really a sappy romancewith very little actionbr br the film finds carol lombard straddled with an alcoholic musician she herself ends up stealing to try to take care of himand the crook robert armstrong comes to her assistance when armstrong catches her cheating at cards he covers for her and then helps the drunk brother to get on his feetand naturally he falls for her in the process the problem is that once the drunk sobers up he too wants lombard and she needs to choose between them wowa recovering drunk or a mobstertalk about a couple great prospects overall its a bit hard to rate considering the lousy print i saw however even if you ignore this the film has a lot of problems due to its poor use of dialog and excessively talky nature andit was sappy too boot
