ive seen several stage and film adaptations of alice in wonderland and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst my family bought the dvd unsuspectingly and couldnt even make it through the first half i later went back and forced myself to watch the whole thing it had been a christmas gift to me and was just appalledbr br the only redeeming factor and its hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show is mark linbaker playing the mock turtle with a yiddish accent its one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously other than that the songs are halfsongs the melodies are halfmelodies and even meryl streep cannot make this direction look good
