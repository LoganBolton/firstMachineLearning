how can anybody give this anything higher than a 1br br i thought manos the hands of fate would forever be the worst movie ever to impinge itself upon my optic nerve indeed i didnt think anything could be worsebr br i was wrong galaxina is that rare movie where every single element of it is achingly agonizingly blindingly bad how often have you watched a movie and commented who the hell lit this thing from lighting to soundtrack to effects to script to acting to cinematography to    well everything this movie is absolutely unendurable its so bad i couldnt even tell for some time if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama id ever seenbr br its too bad even to be laughable id sooner eat a platefull of broken glass than sit through it again
