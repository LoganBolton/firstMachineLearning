this is not the worst movie ive ever seen i did not feel like i wanted to remove my eyeballs forcibly after watching galaxina it just is not good the jokes are almost funny but fall short all of them the few gags that come close are beat back down by repeating them over and over the production values are well nonexistent the sound is bad the lighting is bad  it just seems cheaply made overly so the dialog  well often it is missing  many awkward silences they are all just standing around and it seems like someone should be saying something the film even seems ambivalent about what it wants to be  it is not always clear that it was intended as a comedy  like maybe that developed after shooting started it feels like someones film project that they threw together the night before it was due and if they had put two weeks into it it could have been goodbr br and im easy to please i thought mom and dad save the world was a hoot i like pluto nash mystery men is one of my favorite movies spaced invaders is well nigh unto a classic this turkey just doesnt do it space truckers was more believablebr br avery schreiber who can be very funny tries too hard his part calls for a straightman and he plays it leaning toward sitcom dorothy stratten is ok in her role but not particularly noteworthybr br oh yeah the my watch is always slow line was funny ill give this movie all the kudos it can get it needs itbr br the space vehicle models are not bad but they are few and are not used effectively the space scenes are vague no sweeping passes no close up detailed flybys not even appropriate action scenes when they dock the infinity does crash land very oddly at one point the flight dynamics are terrible worse than anything youve seen theyre jerky not smooth the initial battle is stilted and static even though the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver in their jerky fashion they trade slow shots at close range in a manner that is more reminiscent of a 16th century sea battle except not as excitingbr br the aliens  imagine if all of star wars was the cantina scene that many rubber masks could get dull rather rapidly no a few are used as sight gags that work ok the first time but not the fifthbr br mercifully if you attempt to watch galaxina you are likely to fall asleep i got busy doing something else and missed the last ten minutes and did not feel like it was worth replaying it if that doesnt say it sucked i dont know what does sadly there is a lot of potential and this could easily have been a good movie it would be easy to remake this and have a decent filmbr br madkaugh
