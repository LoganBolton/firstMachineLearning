im not a movie snob ive liked lots of movies that critics hate and ive hated movies that critics love however i have to agree with critics heregalaxina is just substandard clearly intended to be a comedy it only has a few scattered laughs galaxina has poor photography it has poor special effects it has some pretty poor acting and the production valueswell the sets might as well have been made of cardboardbr br galaxina tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called the blue star after a long voyage and some very unconvincing space battles the crew arrives at its destination a sort of wild west alien world theres a painfully unfunny cantina scene clearly designed to be a spoof of the famous star wars scene a chase involving space bikers and a final getawaybr br the cast tries but cant breathe life into this turkey stephen macht and avery schreiber have done better work in other movies james david hinton is pretty good as a member of the spaceships crew the late dorothy stratten stars as the robot of title and while she looks great her role doesnt give her much of a chance to actbr br you might catch this film to see dorothy stratten however if youre looking for a good movie youll probably want to skip this one
