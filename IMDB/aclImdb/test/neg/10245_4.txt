ive seen worse films this is bad but at least doesnt try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause it rest firmly in the realms of the lowbudget bmovie scifi genrebr br it is a rubbish film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if its in the bargain bin at your local supermarket awfully charming rather than just plain awfulbr br the highlight for me is when galaxinas lover goes to rescue her upon turning up she exclaims bunnyfluff which draws sniggers from his copilotbr br sit back get drunk enjoy
