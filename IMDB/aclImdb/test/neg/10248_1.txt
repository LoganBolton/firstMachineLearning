for connoisseurs of bad movies galaxina is a true gem with truly horrid dialog acting and directing its no choice for people seeking a proper movie but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre its priceless for a good laugh in particular the scenes involving the harley davidsonworshiping motorcycle cult are especially good and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laughbr br sadly the scenes with dorothy stratten really fail to deliver but since shes playing an android i suppose one can excuse her for wooden actingbr br bad movielovers dont pass this one up
