 what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog cheap sets and bad acting you would have galaxinabr br this film came out when the original star wars proved there was a market for science fiction this in turn lead to some gems such as alien and a revitalized star trek unfortunately it also led to some bad movies and this was obviously one of them i say obviously because i hadnt even heard of this film until a few days agoi missed it when it came out in 1980 br br heres the underlying problem dorothy stratton couldnt act so for most of the movie they didnt even let her try i understand her tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status but for the life of me i cant understand whybr br clearly the movie tried to spoof star wars star trek and aliens but they clearly dont understand than when you spoof something it has to be funny this movie wasnt or at least the comic timing on jokes that could have been funny werent science fiction is ripe for parody as spaceballs and galaxy quest proved this movie however did it poorly
