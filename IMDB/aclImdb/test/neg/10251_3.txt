yesterday i watched this tv production and i was very disappointedbr br i didnt have big expectations when it was a tv production but the complete movie was pain with no ending i felt it lasted for 3 hours but it was just me who was bored to death every minute was a long struggle and i really fought hard to stay away from the turn offswitchbr br the movie is about a doctor dr verghese who gets a lot of aidspatients and most of them die during the movie it is hard for verghese to live with so his family gets punished with his frustrations however this movie has problems showing both sides it mostly focuses on his conversations with the patients and sometimes we see flicks from his home but we dont get much the difficulties to show more than one part of vergheses life doesnt get any better with the poor acting from naveen andrews a man i hopefully cant see in any good future moviesbr br i believe it got 76 because of the subject taboo but im sure that there are better movies about this subject on the market stay away from this movie it does not deserve more than 310br br
