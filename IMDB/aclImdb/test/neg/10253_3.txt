i readily admit that i watch a lot of really bad movies but there are very few that i can think of that are quite as bad as when women had tails its a stinker of epic proportions what should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull lifeless affair without a single laugh to be had the comedy is extremely weak i suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is funny you might find a laugh or two the guys in this movie make the three stooges look like high art and theres just not enough of a plot to hold the thing together it seems to drag on and on and onbr br well you may be asking yourself if its as bad as you say why havent you rated it lower than a 310 good question and ive got two answers first the movie is not without its curiosity value i do find a bit of interest in an italian spoof of movies like one million years bc with raquel welch ill give when women had tails a point for its historic value the other two points are for the mere presence of senta berger i know its not much of an explanation or reasoning for a rating but what are you going to do its the best i can come up with
