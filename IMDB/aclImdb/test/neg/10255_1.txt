i dont really know why so many persons love this movie maybe its funny ok but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written as the author himself said this movie has betrayed the book not only the story is violently cut to about 13 but all the symbols all the complexity everything is lost in a very 80sfashioned fantasyadventure film for kids today we have effects directors a new attention to books i hope that someone tim burton peter jackson hayao miyazaki someday will direct the real neverending story a great dead writer a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve it
