although not a big coen brothers fan i am an admirer of their dark humor films like fargo and millers crossing i have been much less impressed by their other comic mode goofycamp or is that camp goofy unfortunately o brother where art thou falls into the latter category and isnt even as good as the big lebowski or the hudsucker proxybr br o brother is basically an episodic series of injokes without much point and not all that much humor or cleverness either as most reviewers have noted the films plot is very loosely  and as far as i could tell quite arbitrarily  based on the odyssey its main character ulysses everett mcgill george clooney is an adventurer like his homeric namesake and has as his real goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife penny to a suitor of course we dont discover that this is what the clooneyulysses character really wants until long after weve stopped caring and what does homer have to do with cool hand luke chain gangs ku klux klan meetings a la indiana jones cult gatherings a disbarred lawyers vocabulary a talent for bluegrass country music singing an association with baby face nelson a clark gable lookalike hairdo and other random and sundry character traits and encounters i leave that for others to discernbr br the allusion to preston sturges sullivans travels in o brothers title is equally pointless yes viewers familiar with the sturges minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression movie sullivan abandons hollywood and comedy hoping to make and they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shotscene riffs eg hopping freight cars and the chain gang shuffle into view a movie but so what the coen brothers dont seem to have anything to add to the artforartssake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art they obviously fall into the former school but that doesnt seem to motivate the reference in the slightest is it an homage if so why make it i like postmodern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person but its a lot nicer when it amounts to something at least tonally if not thematically consistent  and not just an arbitrary concoctionbr br this screenplay is simply a silly mess the only consistent and consistently pleasing element is the folkcountry music soundtrack it doesnt have much to do with homer or preston sturges but considering the rest of the film thats probably a good thing on the other hand id recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack cd
