saw this last night and being a fan of the first demons i had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun spooky spirit of its predecessor this is unfortunately not the case the setup is similar as the first in which a horde of flesheating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played the first had been a movie theater this one takes place in an apartment building and on tv once the demons are released madness and mass carnage ensues thats pretty much it as far as plot development goes it worked nicely in the first part because of the ghoulish makeup fx fast pace and unpredictability the sequel however doesnt cut it the first problem seems to be that there are way too many characters who we dont really care about one way or another if they were annoying or idiots then there would at least be some kind of gratification when they are inevitably butchereddemonizedeaten alivebut these people are just kind of there waiting to be slaughtered plus the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building and out of it they are constantly cutting back and forth between them which kept pulling me out of the story there are some amusing bits courtesy of the splatter fx and campiness such as a constant flow of dripping blood eating through one floors construction after another as if it were alien acid the first demon possession of a crabby birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire party and a creepy demon child clawing his way into the room of a tenant who is pregnant with child however that sequence parlays into a ridiculouslooking rubber demon baby puppet thing that bursts from the chest of the human child that constantly flies across the room at its intended victim i got a couple of chuckles out of that scene but i dont think that was bavas intention the scene probably wouldve worked better if they just kept the child demon around to attack the woman but hey other little things like the overzealous acting of most of the characters and the bad dubbing dont help matters in summation i managed to see the unrated version on dvd and cant imagine having to sit all the way through the previously only available r rated version because the makeup fx and gore were the only thing i got out of it also notable is an early role of producer argentos future hottie daughter asia in fact she probably gives the best performance of the whole cast and shes barely on screen argentobava fans might want to check it out just to see it but will probably find themselves looking at their watch like i did gore fans might get a kick out of some of the fx but will be laughing themselves out of their chairs at the most goofylooking evil baby puppet since little selwyn from deadalive you could do worse but it certainly doesnt live up to the original
