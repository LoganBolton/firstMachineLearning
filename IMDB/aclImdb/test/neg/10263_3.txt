the films use of blueblack and vibrant skin tones to create a noirish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work in fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beingsbr br at least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore setpieces were quite stunning black gore is hardly frightening nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp lugosi stylebr br the narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine naked lunch directed by russ meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be william burroughsesque otherwise give this film a wide girth bava and argento fans  once again  are bitterly disappointed
