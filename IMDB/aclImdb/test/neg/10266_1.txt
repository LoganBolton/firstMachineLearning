please why on earth did bava had to add insult to injury making this pathetic piece of follow up crapbr br to begin with we the viewers at home are treated to a narration from some unknown dingbat informing us of the aftermath events of the previous episode indicating mankinds triumph over the demons yeah rightbr br i can tell you right now that this doesnt in anyway whatsoever have anything to do with demons as this is a completely new story with a different backdrop altogether bava as usual makes a casual appearance that doesnt even seem to fit into the main context of the story at all acting in this one beyond appalling and the whole concept about the demons appearing through a tv set oh god im not going to go on go see for yourselfbr br as usual youll be treated to laughable dubbing crap scenarios that dont make any sense and above all unanswered questions how typical of a sequel that dished out the first batch of crapbr br overall if youre one of those dvd argentophile collectors then maybe youll wanna give this a go otherwise avoid like the plague its no way near the first so you may wanna avoid like the plague
