when the word presents finds its way into a title preceded by a famous name the work is usually immediately dismissible for some reason people who are capable of creating good art dont seem to be able to see it in others however ive always been willing to give the second installment of the demons trilogy a try for one thing the soundtracks are absolutely to die for most american directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of demons 2 for another well two words asia argento of course she was eleven when this film was made and a number of years away from her seeming decision that she would style her acting after early helen mirren steamy looks and little clothing as well lamberto bava comes from one of italys finest dynasties in that odd horror sub genre known as giallo hes the son of mario bava who may well have invented the genre in the sixties and the original demons is an absolute mustsee for fans of eighties bhorror films so how bad can this be right well bad the demons continue their assault on italian media as the movie opens in a modern italian highrise where many people going about their lives have their televisions on in the background theyre all watching a kind of combination news reportmater video of some investigative reporter types trying to get proof of the events of the first film which would seem to put the time frame of this one no more than a few days after the first film through the usual horrorfilm extra inability to concentrate the reporters manage to bring a demon back to life and he comes through the tv screen to start the plague anewbr br yeah its that bad about the only thing good one can say about the film is that the soundtrack when youre not being buffeted about by the likes of the smiths the cult gene loves jezebel etc is stunning it comes from the keyboard of simon boswell who got his start as a part of the argento dynasty and has since gone on to score such films as lord of illusions and hackersbr br makes a halfdecent free rental if youre planning on drinking heavily but its certainly nowhere near the fun the original was cronenbergs wonderfully funny highrisenastycreature romp shivers aka they came from within is a whole lot better
