everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here this is simply a run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc slasher but without the passion that graced the originalbr br theres nothing new in the story in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether here the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and naturally kill most of the residents in grisly fashion the makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around although the actors werent exactly brilliant in demons in demons 2 theyre actually a lot worse you dont care about these characters at all the plot is nonexistent the music poor apart from one simon boswell song its not scary in the least its just not that goodbr br easily the worst film dario argento has been involved with and lamberto bavas also bava has a cameo in this film not a very funny onebr br maybe 3 is too high a rating but at least i could watch it all and didnt think of stopping midway my advice stick to the original
