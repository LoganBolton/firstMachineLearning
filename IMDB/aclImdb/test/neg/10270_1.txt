despite the allstar cast this attempt at epic fails it comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too too clever social commentary br br its as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says isnt that clever am i not smart isnt that biting social commentary andsadly the answer is always ummmmno wearying selfabsorbing stuff that is more like soap opera in the worst sense of the term than a movieand an obvious attempt at television immortality thankfully it died young empire falls falls flat
