im relieved the later reviews have turned sour  reading all the positive feedback i was starting to worry that my understanding of movies and life was completely different than everyone elses in the world everything in this movie rang false to methe characters the dialogue the manipulative soundtrack the corny narration all of it as each scene unfolded i kept thinking people dont act like this its relentlessly heavyhanded and maudlin in a way i think the movie bullies you into liking it or pretending to like it because its serious and about real people and confronts issues but man it really did not work for me
