we found this movie nearly impossible to watch with such a super cast its a shame that the writing and direction were so awful the excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening the flashbacks were clumsy the characters were onedimensional the heavyhanded metaphors  the river the cat  were repeated way too often br br the movie nobodys fool based on another novel by russo was infinitely better probably because it was more tightly written and directed br br the photography in empire falls was lovely too bad it wasnt a traveloguebr br i read the novel and enjoyed the writing style but had some quibbles with the novel itself i would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars perhaps the screenwriters and director were so awed by the novels reputation they felt they had to include every darn thing in their movie this was supposed to be a television movie guys not books on tape
