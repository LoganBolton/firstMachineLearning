the show is at least partially faked so is not reality just pretending to be reality which makes me believe at least anyone without face blurred out is a fake episodebr br proof in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed there is already camera crew on the boat before he gets there can been seen as his boat approachesbr br the actors playing ambulance officers didnt remove his shirt or expose the wound in anyway so they work on it which would never happen in realitybr br they also parked the ambulance in the car park and did not drive up to the emergency entrance which does not make any sense unless its fake and they would not be allowed to go there
