im not bothered by the sleazy hosts nor am i bothered by the cynical selfrighteous stance the makers of this crap takebr br what i am bothered about is that the vast majority of the episodes are fake i wouldnt even be surprised if all of the episodes were staged hence this isnt a reality show but something far worse even than oprah garbage television with zero comma zero appeal like daily tv soap opera but with more action and fighting and less plotbr br the premise would have turned out great  if only it had been executed without cheating the viewer if only this idea were free of all the legal complicationstrappings that would most certainly ensue due to what would happen with real people and what is eventually aired hence the only way to create this reality show was to get some rather desperate actors and make them improvise and what pitiful and unconvincing improvisation it is most of the time shouldnt this be obvious to anyone who finished grade school most reviews i read here dont even mention that any of this is fake let alone that all of it might be wishful thinking or just boundless naivety br br the actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of bottomofthebarrel unemployed actors who are miserably waiting on tables waiting eagerly for a call from a talk show or this crap which is when they finally get a chance to make several hundred bucks i even recognized one actress in the role of cheater that i saw years earlier in the jerry springer show and i only saw 67 episodes of cheaters how many more of these loser actors are there that appeared in springer and cheaters that i dont even know aboutbr br however to compare cheaters with springer isnt fair to the latter the springer show is not all fake a bulk of the episodes are unstaged  hence often highly entertaining there is no value to be found in cheaters unless youre a struggling actor and want to get tips on how not to act in front of the camerabr br the producers use various very cheap transparent tricks to create the illusion of realness to give their footage that elusive documentary feel but its all in vein in the end the more intelligent trainwreckseeking viewer is left with absolutely squat professional wrestling has more credibility than this
