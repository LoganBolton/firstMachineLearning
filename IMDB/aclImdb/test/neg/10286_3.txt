if you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining then youre bound to enjoy surveillance this film was garbage for both the mind and spirit the notion that this is a thriller is comical that would imply some kind of tension and twists you kept waiting for the story to actually finish starting it never rises above a glorification of weakminded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life picture all of the violence of no country for old men without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters thrillkillers run amok the acting is good mostly but the script is a pile dont bother and tell your friends to dont bother
