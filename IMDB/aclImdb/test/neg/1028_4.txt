i guess only a selected number of audience members really had any interest in watching how a male hustler in new york operates but id be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by the irritating patchwork technique and deliberately muffled sound recording on display here the fact that these inherent defects were a direct result of the films lowbudgetundergroundexperimental nature is id say beside the point anyway for those so inclined the film features extensive male nudity and joe dallesandro understandably became an underground  and gay  icon br br the episodic structure showing the daytoday routine of the hustler protagonist offers a couple of mildly interesting scenes his meeting with and eventually posing for an eccentric elderly artist the one where dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and delineates his particular modus operandi to a couple of prospective colleagues including perhaps the unlikeliest of hustlers  a bespectacled nerd perhaps mercifully the film ran for only 89 minutes against the imdbs claim that its complete length is 105 but the latter could well be a mistake br br i had watched a few other of warhols movies and this one is decidedly not as satisfying as the most tolerable example ive run into yet bad 1977 and only slightly better than the likes of my hustler 1965 which were mostly a strain to sit through the fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy did not augur well but as the saying goes you gotta to do what you gotta do and the other two chapters had to follow in quick succession br br despite my generally negative reaction to it flesh is nevertheless still valuable as a 1960s time capsule and as a prototype of the underground scene of that era both cinematically and in real life for the record an image of dallesandro from this film adorns the sleeve of the smiths selftitled 1984 debut album and transsexual candy darling who appears here rather unremarkably was immortalized in candy says the opening track of the velvet undergrounds eponymous 1969 album although the latter band is my alltime favorite and one of the reasons for this is that through their sheerly unique and groundbreaking music they described a lifestyle so utterly different from my own this is truly a case where id much rather experience something aurally instead of visually
