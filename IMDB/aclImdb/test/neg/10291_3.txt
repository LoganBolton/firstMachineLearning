this movie was good relatively during the first parts of itbr br we have a story from 3 points of view so lets find some clues and complete the storybr br oh waitnone of that stuff matters because the fbi guys are the bad guys though that was a great twistit was almost a terrible twist i immediately downgraded the film from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 1015 minutes of itbr br does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad yes its a good shock but it is bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the preceding hour and twenty minutes theres no connection to the killersbr br the killers are in about all of 5 minutes of this movie as killers and the two fbi agents are only in 15 minutes of the previous hour and twentybr br we get itsurveillanceoh the killers are voyeurs which makes no sense because they were only described in limited terms as just being psychopaths and the hour and twenty minutes of surveillance we are watching of the 3 stories goes out the window as everyone is dead in 5 minutesbr br all of this makes the ending even more ridiculous oh they killed a bunch of fbi agents in the beginningwhat fbi agents sleep together all in the same room to be found and murdered by amateurs and then impersonated by people who know nothing about being fbi agents a cop 3 feet away apparently cant hit either one with a standard police issue pistol that can shoot several shots i hate movies that try to make you feel like this could be real when they make absurd leaps they think we will believebr br the other thing is the movie ends about 1015 minutes after they are revealed as the killers with a girl standing in the field somewhere
