i must say when i saw this film at a 65 on this site i figured it was well worth a view i was sorely disappointed from nearly the opening scene it is obvious the two supposed fbi agents are in fact the killers could they have made it any more obvious if that is the intended twist in this film thats pretty sad while pullman and ormond are excellent actors even their talent is no match for a reprehensibly bad script pullman adeptly acts the part of a sociopathic killer and thats the problem there is no switch from im playing fbi guy to i just killed 12 people and boy are my arms tired you cant blame the actors the story fails in far more ways than onebr br from the onset of the film however i was certain i was wrong that no directorwriter would ever be so blatantly obvious about a plot twist ormond and pullman must just be acting strangely in order to divert the viewers attention from the real killers i thought which gave the films makers far too much credit i should have followed my instincts and turned off the movie before it even made it past the 15minute markbr br to lynchs credit she did manage to interject many things that make a good film sex violence humor and welltrained actors too bad they were in the wrong configuration hopefully pell james can recover from this role i found her performance particularly impressive as the stunning drug addictturned wouldbe savior she should have rewritten the role so the crack whore would winbr br those people who have compared this film to natural born killers take note tarantino made the characters of mickey and mallory reprehensible yet sympathetic the artistry of that film far overpowers the gore and this is not seen once in surveillance surveillance only wishes it were natural born killers in fact it has wet dreams about being even a fraction of what that film was folks who havent seen surveillance stick to something with a little more intelligence like camp rock
