the films executive producer is none other than that messenger of peace thru transcendental meditation david lynch the directors father i wonder what davids guru his holiness maharishi mahesh yogi would have thought of this production the hypocrisy here is as repugnant as is the film itself its a safe bet that samuel l dieteman phoenix serial killer and devotee of recreational violence would have loved every minute of itbr br i doubt if many would fault this film for its cinematic craft on that level its quite good but on a moral level its the most disheartening movie ive ever seenbr br spoiler comingbr br i guess its the phoniness of the thing that saddens me the most morallynumb generation xers learn a craft and a little postmodern aesthetic theory at art school or film school and then get involved in the artsandentertainment industry and heres the result a film which wallows in human suffering injustice and carnage much of which is witnessed by a nineyear old who sees her entire family brutally murdered by a couple of recreationalviolence killers who at the end ride off into the sunsetbr br no more spoilers comingbr br for whom are films like this produced narurally sadists are going to adore this  why wouldnt they but who else as i noted above theres some really good film craft here but good craft can be applied to any subject matter why apply it to stuff like this also the movie is very suspenseful but thats not because of the graphicness  grossness of the violence its suspenseful because its welldirected  wellacted im sure the ghost of alfred hitchcock could explain this much better than i canbr br so what has been put before us here and above all why br br yes our world can be an ugly dirty even evil place but shouldnt we dissent when an artist makes it herhis business to rub our faces in it or worse still to stick it in the faces of those nineyear olds who will one way or another end up seeing this on home dvd br br i hope that people will see to it that this film is not seen by their kids yeah i know  dream on bernon
