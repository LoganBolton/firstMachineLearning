i of course saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other lions gate extravaganza so of course it was only the best parts and therefore looked intriguing and it is to a point a young college student sarahis finding riddles all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them and in doing so shes unwittingly becoming involved in some game now thats fairly intriguing right there but unfortunately it all gets rather muddled and becomes so complicated that the viewer like myself will most likely become frustrated characters appear with little introduction and youre not really sure who they are or why sarah knows them or is hanging out with them all of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a young boy years ago and her reason for that was that its all part of the design in reality its all part of the very sketchy script and when the film is over youll find yourself feeling that youve lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want back for more productive uses of your time like cleaning the bathroom for instance 4 out of 10
