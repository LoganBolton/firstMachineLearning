fox is pretty lame they cancel the wrong shows its bizarre that they would cancel a wellwritten program like arrested development and yet they keep this show and war at home i feel that fox loved that they broke barriers with the thenedgy married with children but now its just getting ridiculous the loop is a pointless and boring watch and their edgy jokes just fall flat in order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming family guy and the simpons work because there is a constant flow of jokes fox needs to pull their heads out of their rectal cavities and quit letting their relatives write this mediocre tripe i mean if youre going to invest money into making something entertaining make it entertaining also stop using nonamed actors its great to have upandcomers but you need to anchor a show with a noted celebrity duh fox
