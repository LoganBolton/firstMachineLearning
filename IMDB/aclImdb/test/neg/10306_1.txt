i am very open minded i watch all kinds of programs to the endgood or badjust to give them a chance and learn from the good aspects and bad ones this show had potential to be good but my god what were the writers casting director and director thinking the cast of actors are terriblewith the slightest exception of meryl mimi rogers and darcy joy osmanski being given occasional good lines with the best execution of the lotbr br the rest of the cast kill the show it is the same story line in every episode sam has plans to do something his boss disrupts these plans by assigning him ridiculous work projects then the foolish ways sam tries to accommodate both in a manner that is primarily stupid and lacks any real intelligent humor this is every episode it gets very tiringbr br season 2 they ditch the eye candy the 2 hot girls in the show get written out yet the brother stays explain that casting cut to me please i can see why they wrote them outthey had no substantial rolebut they didnt add anyone better to replace thembr br the cocky derek tricolli character is given a continuous appearance in season 2 his acting along with everyone elses resembles many poor sitcoms from the 80smight have been funny thenbut painful nowbr br the show could have been so much better with a few good writers and some people who had any talent to execute them this show lacks everything production quality is the only good aspect of the show it is great in that regardunfortunately the content is painfully sadbr br my god fox was there really nothing better to choose from im sticking with shows like its always sunny in philadelphia or 30 rock for now the bar should be set by programs like these that actually assume the audience are intelligent and arent continually drooling on themselves using all their brain power on continuing to breathe
