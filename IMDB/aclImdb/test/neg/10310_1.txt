oh boy oh boy on the cover of worn out vhs has a picture of sandra bullock and her name written on top i think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties was because of sandra bullocks name bullocks fans dont have to disappoint sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting rest of the movieÂ… its fun to watch in first fifteen minutes because its bad but after that its going worse much worse directing is awful acting is awful script is awful dialog is awful action is awful music is quite good actually typical score for eighties action movies this movie is so bad that it goes close to anything andy sidaris has ever produced its so bad that there isnt proper word to describe this poor attempt to be a movie but still there was sandra bullock and super cool sarcasm jake lamotta who tried to be marlon brando br br i think they can now bring the film out on dvd it could be cool and they should write on the cover academy award winner sandra bullock in hangmenbr br 1 out of 10
