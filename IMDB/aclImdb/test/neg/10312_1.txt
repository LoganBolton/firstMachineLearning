found this film in a dvd discount rack for 10 it wasnt worth it some of the camera work and dialog look and sound as if it were done by a film student sandras performance was somewhat credible but the film was predictable and the action was spotty and draggedbr br one thing that i will give them however unlike most action films people in this film actually ran out of ammo and scavanged dead bodies for new weapons and ammunition
