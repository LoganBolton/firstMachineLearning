i broke my own rule buying this movie from the 588 bin at walmart basically if a movie has a big star in it and youve never heard of it before its usually for a reason well in the case of this movie the reason is because it sucked they plaster sandra bullocks photo and name all over the cover of the dvd as bait and it reeled this little fishie right on in i was thinking of donating the disc to charity or giving it to the library but i dont think i would want to subject anyone else in the world to this movie worst lines what do you mean army buddies what do you mean your dad
