i dont know how this dvd made its way into my collection  my wife suggested it was one of these 3 for £20 deals at a high street store the thing isnt worth 66p let alone £666 having invested heavily in it i felt dutybound to watch it to the end just to make sure it was equally bad all the way through  and it wasbr br the dialog was awful the story line was impenetrable i still dont understand what the hell was going on despite having read the synopsis the camera work was disjointed and hopeless the acting was wooden not helped by the dialoguebr br in fact there were no redeeming features  no not even the lovely sandra bullock on whose glittering subsequent career this pile of dross has probably been sold she should get her agent to buy up all the rights to it and then bury it asapbr br as a final amusing example of the directors ineptitude there was a scene where the young lead is conversing with his fathers exarmy sidekick while driving this was the clearest bit of dialogue in the film  no engine noise whatsoever i look forward to the enginedamping technology eventually making its way across the pond into british cars
