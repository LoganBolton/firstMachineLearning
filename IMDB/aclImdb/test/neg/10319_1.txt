i watched 5 of this movie tonight and you may tell me that i need to see the whole movie to understand it but frankly i dont think sobr br what the hell is the story in this movie i saw a lot of people running around in a factory shooting at everything around thembr br where to start okaybr br 1 they were shooting around the place as if it was the terminator or something they were trying to kill the entire place is made of metal but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfacesbr br 2 no ricochet metal vs metal is bound to cause ricochets but apparently no one got hit by a stray bulletbr br 3 magic bullets in one scene a badguy is standing right in front of a goodguy when another goodguy pops out behind the badguy and pumps him full of metal you see the bullets exit his chest as it explodes in a bloody mist but the goodguy right in front of him doesnt get hurt at all 4 after having just splattered a human being all over the wall the two goodguys tell each other some jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with softgunsbr br 5 sound at one point the goodguys cut a wire and an alarm goes off who the hell cuts a wire just to set off an alarm the lady screams out alarm in sector blah blah and the badguy boss says okay this is not a drill blah blah in a very very amateur kinda way ooh were getting ambushed by terrorists this isnt a drill but im gonna sound like i dont give crapbr br 6 focus first you see the badguys load up on weapons for some reason the same guy gets the same uzi twice deja vu or loop of scenes you literally see every single badguy receive the same kind of weapon and they lock and load the same way the weapons dealer pops in the clip and the badguy extra no xx locks and loads when they started opening fire you had to see the barrel flashes boooring 7 actors or dummies one of the presumed goodguys throw down a smoke grenade for some reason and of course the badguys are suddenly inside the smoke because theyre smokeblind or something so they dont see it coming they cough and moan as if it was anthrax in the grenade then a semiboss badguy arrives and he doesnt even cough when he enters the smoke he just pushes the other badguys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke isnt anthrax anywaybr br 8 b flick i think yeah a guy sliding down a metal pipe wielding a uzi in his right hand shooting away at someone in his eye height apparently id like to see a guy fire a uzi with one hand and id like to see him go get his hand afterwards extra bloody gore mess in a b flick kinda way small pops and a red hole with a torn shirt indicates that this guy is dead though the first bullet hit his heart the goodguy who is a super trained green berets still feel the urge to empty his clip into the dead guybr br 9 one of these mentioned trained soldiers jump out from his hide with an empty clip how stupid can you be always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies 10 boring scenes like the barrel flash scenes and the lock and load scenes the movie is filled with time wasting scenes of people running around in an apparently empty building cut to the action if youre going for a b flick movie pleasebr br my two cents on this movie
