i checked this out for free at the library and i still feel ripped off yes sandra bullock is actually in it but only in five scenes totaling up to barely 5 minutes and even those are fairly painful to watch the rest of the movie is so bad that youll spend most of the time hoping it will end soon but only if youre one of those people who have to finish a movie once they start it everyone else will just turn it off dont worry you arent going to miss anything bullocks lines assuming that you were tricked into watching this because her name is plastered on the case are essentially just parroting of other characters lines like this dialogbr br lisa bullock  danny please tell me what is going onbr br danny  i dont know br br lisa  whaddaya mean you dont know br br danny  i dont know  its something to do with my dad br br lisa  whaddaya mean your dad br br danny  i dont know  he ed up or something br br lisa  why am i here br br danny  im sorry lisa i dont know br br moments later danny  some army buddies of my dad     br br lisa  whaddaya mean army buddiesbr br see what i mean br br bottom line  just say no
