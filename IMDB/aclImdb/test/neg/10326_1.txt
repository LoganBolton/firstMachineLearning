i love sandra bullockshes one of my alltime favorite actressesbut this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be trashcanned i realize that its almost 20 years oldbut my dead grandmother can act better than these people did bewareits not even worth the  550 walmart rackyou know that when the acting stinks this bad that its not even worth a couple of bucksthe sound quality is horrendoustheres no closed captioning to even hear the hideous dialog and it looks as if it were filmed on a  198 budget i thought that id like to see sandra in an early role to see how she evolved as an actressbut yikes is too kind a word to use
