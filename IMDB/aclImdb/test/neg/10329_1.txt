this movie is 1 in the list of worst movies i have ever seen with lessons for an assassin on the 2 spotbr br the acting is lousy sorry sandra bullock but even your performance was horrible the music score could have come from a bad xrated movie and the story was downright ridiculous it had this in common with a typical action movie the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of onesyllable words but contrary to the average action movie there was no real action in this one boringbr br the only reason i continued watching it was in the hopes that at one point there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie br br thumbs down on this one
