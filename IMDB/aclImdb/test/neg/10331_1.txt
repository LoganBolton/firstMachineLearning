notable only as the acting debut of future bigtime hollywood starlet sandra bullock this ludicrous action flick is so full of holes that one might easily suspect termite infestation the storyline is incomprehensible and very poorly thought out the production values stink of cheese in fact a total lack of production values would have been betterat least the film might have seemed grittier that way the adr is laughably bad and omnipresent in the film its debatable as to whether or not any of the dialogue tracks from the actual shoot were usedbr br the performances are for the most part horrible though there are a few exceptions in those exceptions however the performances are undermined by the fact that the director was obviously giving the actors poor direction and making them act completely out of character at times ie characters going from passive to panicked in the blink of an eye bad direction also the constant weapon sound effects magazines being loaded slides being cocked etc are completely overused and more often than not totally out of sync with the onscreen actions add to this cheesy bad guy vocal distortion for the lead villain mainly so that you know hes the villain in this incomprehensible mess of a film and you have a recipe for disasterbr br the situations in the film go well beyond standard suspension of disbelief and become downright laughable one lead character spends a good portion of the film tied to a chair before he decides to use the butterfly knife tucked in his sock in order to free himself so my questions arewhy didnt he do this sooner and why does he even have the butterfly knife he wasnt searched right this is one of a hundred examples of completely ludicrous situations which have somehow been crammed into this 90minute packagebr br in whole the hangmen plays like an unbearably bad rrated tv movie from the 80s if not for the subsequent success of sandra bullock this would have never found its way to dvd but it has so my only advice is to steer clear watching this film may actually impair your iq
