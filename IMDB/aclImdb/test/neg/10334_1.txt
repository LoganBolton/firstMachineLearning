but certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all timebr br i got this dvd cheap with sandra bullock as headliner on the case this is false advertising  shes onscreen for almost 10 minutes of the moviebr br on the other hand there was no other selling point for this movie  the dialog was horrible the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on quaaludes the directing was  well lets just say that my 14yo daughter could do better but i hope she never sees such faint praise from me its possible that the family cat could have done betterbr br sandra does a creditable job for a first film in the short time shes onscreen  and thats the only redeeming quality of this film stupid story poorly written and transferred to film as only a 7thgrade media class should be able to dobr br in short this is dreck
