i wont go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating plenty of other people have already done that suffice it to say that out of the over 400 movies that ive owned on dvd this is the only one that i got rid of it was so worthless that i couldnt see ever wanting to watch any of it againbr br however i do have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 29 as of 31506 while skimming through the 4 pages of reviews i saw no rating higher than 3 stars looking at the voting history 78 of users rated the movie as 4 stars or less it looks to me like a few people are stuffing the ballot box to keep this movie off of the imdb bottom 100 list it would be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this movie as 10 stars none of who wrote a review of the movie are actual active usersbr br dont be fooled this movie isnt worth your time
