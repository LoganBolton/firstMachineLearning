i love documentaries the andy goldsworthy doc was greati looked forward to this one  but was very disappointed i knew of kahn and was intrigued by the idea of his lonely death in a penn station mens room there must be a story here i mistakenly believedthe only story here is of sadly deluded women who had affairs with an ugly little famous married man in the absence of anything like an explanation for this guys horrible behavior were given endlessly repeated clips of kahn walking around and painfully long  supposedly contemplative  shots of his soulless buildingsactually some of the buildings are interesting but the thrust of the film asks us to think about the guy himself the overwrought soundtrack references an emotional tug that is entirely absent from the film kahns apparent gifts do not excuse his behavior or martyr his mistresses this film seems to want to give kahn the great artistes free pass and thus make the director and his mother sympathetic figures  i dont buy it
