i am currently 22 years old and remember seeing this movie in the theatres when it first came out you heard me right i was 5 years old and yet i can still distinctly remember what i saw that afternoon so many years ago was it a mystical trip through the fantastic world of mark twains creativity no on the other hand it was a quite creepy film about mark twains dark depressed and in fact suicidal side one scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which mark twain is playing the organ at his own funeralbr br would an adult enjoy this film well this movie quite possibly features some interesting viewpoints that a person with a working knowledge of mark twains writing might enjoy but trust me on this adventures is not the film you want to use to introduce your young children to mark twain
