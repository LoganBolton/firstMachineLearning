i attended a screening of this movie it was wrought with clich√©s and very unfunny jokes and set ups i think the other comments were by people who mustve worked on the movie or been family members of the cast im amazed this movie cost 34 million without any real stars where did the budget go it obviously didnt go to writers for rewrites nice thought to bank on the success of big fat greek wedding but a major miss there was little or any spark between the main characters and the inciting incident was a bit flimsy at best the direction was uninspired and looked like a student filmbr br i dont even know what it means everybody wants to italian is that a real saying ive never heard it
