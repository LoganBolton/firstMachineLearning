need i say more the reason the good australian version of kath and kim was as mentioned good was because of its hilariously funny originality the reason this new americanised version is so terrible is because a lot of it is taken straight from the original not to mention the unfaithfulness to the characters kath is meant to be a dag kim is meant to be fat kel or phil as they have dubbed him is meant to be pathetic brett or craig is meant to be a loser not a person who acts like hes on heroin and finishes every sentence with dude thank god szubanski didnt sell her rights to sharon shed probably end up being a tall thin blonde who kim likesbr br kath and kim are mother and daughter they are not meant to look 2 years apart and they are not meant to giggle like school girls this show is a disgrace to even share the same title as the australian version america get your own television shows
