ive tried watching it twice though i havent been able to make through either episode for me its basically just not funny i can tell where im suppose to laugh but i cant ive never seen the original so im not comparing i also love comedies including offthewall comedies like marriedwith children and family guy but this show just doesnt do it for me the jokes are lame and flat and the acting is mostly annoying the commercials made it look interesting but it isnt theyre trying too hard to be different and tying to force the humor that style usually doesnt work too well i dont think this show finishes the season of course i could be wrong
