it isnt too bad but ultimately it lacks the quality that the australian series hasbr br the jokes are few and far between the actors are attractive they shouldnt be the film makers think far too much about the cinematography its supposed to look like a home video and its just like a serious version of kath and kim its stupidbr br its too normal to be kath and kim kath and kim are supposed to be two curvy middleaged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes there are no look at me kimmy jokes the fat friend of kim is not fat at all and shes not even slightly stupid shes a stereotypical blacklatino chickbr br its just not as stupid or funny as the australian series it doesnt compare nothing is the same i admit this show is pretty funny at times but it is not anything like the aussie series i was looking forward to an american take on a bogan family they failed its supposed to be really stupid and hilarious but the actors dont act stupid to me this is just a typical american tv show its a let down if you want it to be anything like the aussie showbr br 2 stars because it is an okay show just nothing like what it should be
