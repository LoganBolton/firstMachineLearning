the best thing i can say about the american version is that jane turner and gina reilly must be raking in the money for this crap yes the american ripoff was shown for about two episodes in australia but didnt rate probably by curious viewers who were wondering how bad it would be answer deplorable a complete waste of time the actors are relatively unknown and they dont take readily to the nuances of the australianwritten script bad luck for them as they are doomed to plummet with this turkey my advice to usa viewers is dontbr br americans should be best advised to find dvds of the original version on ebay but be aware that some dvds are in a different zone format to those issued in the usa otherwise some dvd players will operate discs from bothall zones
