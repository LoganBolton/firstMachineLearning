there is something about this show that keeps me watching and hoping for the future of it in the writing the jokes are few and far between and the story lines are a bore so i figure it must be the physical comedy and the visualsbr br i do enjoy the camera movement set dressing and wardrobe its amusingly highly contrasted against the dullness that reigns and im pretty sure every time i have laughed it was because of john or mollys physical comedy the two of them make a sickeningly cute couple that make me laugh and want to puke at the same timebr br so here i go ready to sit down to kath  kim one more time tonight to see what path this production will go down or up as the case may be looking forward positively
