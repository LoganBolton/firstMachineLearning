a frustrating documentary louis kahns son who saw his father only minimally during his childhood because he was a member of just one of the three separate families his father had created takes on the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and his life it sounds like a great idea for a documentary but it ends up flat and uninterestingbr br sadly the basic problem is that kahns son nathaniel is not just one of the films protagonists  he is also director writer producer interviewer and narrator nathaniel seems both too inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to function well in any of these roles further while he seems like a nice enough guy he doesnt have much screen presence so the fact that he is the only constant in the film becomes wearing br br nathaniel also comes across as an unprepared and amateurish interviewer  there are several points where an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts to a shot of nathaniel offering little more than a blank stare and a sort of timid uhhuh as if hes a little panicked that hes going to have to come up with something to say in response at times i felt embarrassed watching people who might have had truly interesting things to say about kahn or at least better things to do with their time seeming to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who was going to rely on them to direct the conversation br br nathaniels dual role as both documentarian and lost son seem to do more to hurt the film than help one senses that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to really open up about negative aspects of kahns personality and career presumably because its not clear from nathaniel whether hes looking to dig into the truth or simply wants to hear nice stories about his dad  preferably ones that will confirm his hope that his dad really did care more for nathaniel and his mother than seems likely his passive approach as an interviewer may stem directly from this conflict the only person nathaniel does push is his own mother but those conversations tend to feel a little like bad teen drama arent you angry mom and dont offer much in terms of helping us or nathaniel understand kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him br br what the film desperately lacks is shaping by an experienced and independent hand not to exclude nathaniel but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience an independent director could have stood away from the material given more thought to what the interviewees could contribute and one hopes cut out those portions of the documentary process that just dont work such as the weird segment with the guy who claims to have see kahn die which made it look as if nathaniel was just being taken in by some loony or the entire bit about hooking up with kahns first cousin who had nothing to add about kahn or nathaniel too many times nathaniel makes us watch him standing in or near a kahn building buttonholing strangers to tell them that his father was the designer ahhh huh thaaats nice sir ummi gotta go now i understand why these things might be important to nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting but this is one of those examples of when a documentary can be too personalbr br as an aside i thought the score written for the film was great but one of the oddest moments in the entire thing for me was when during the tour of the kimball art museum the voiceover quotes kahn as making a comparison between architecture and beethovens fifth symphony the music being played at the same time beethovens ninth symphony a mistake a miscue who knows it did make me laugh br br kahn was a great architect and its clear that he was an unusual human being and had an intriguing life story theres definitely a good documentary to be made about him one is sympathetic to nathaniels search for the father he didnt know but im not sure whether that is an interesting story neither works so well in this film
