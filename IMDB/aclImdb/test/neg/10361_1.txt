i mean nothing happens 5 dumb kids go to oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana this couldve been fun if it hadnt been for the 5 worst actors in the world and the dialogs werent even half an inch of fun the only thing that i almost showed my teeth of was when the dumb cops stopped the teenagers in either oklahoma or kansas the plot could have been fun had it not been for abysmal interpretation if you even think about watching this pieceofcrap movie dont how dumb is it that the guy gets away from the cops by telling them hes gay like his friend did just that he wasnt pretending and theres that dumb hick joke about the several meanings to the word gay im laughing my hair offnot anyway worst movie ive ever seen
