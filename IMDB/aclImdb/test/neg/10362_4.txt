this movie was extremely disappointing i thought it would be another marijuana comedy but dont be mislead its not at all there are barely any weedrelated jokes that come to mind i dont even think they smoke any weed in this movie the marijuana field is merely a plot devicebr br my impression after seeing this film was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write up a script full of their idea of witty dialog and make a movie the product is bland dialog supported by mediocre acting to say this movie has no hook is a huge understatement dont waste your time or money
