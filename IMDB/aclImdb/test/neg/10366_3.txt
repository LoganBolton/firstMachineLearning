this film has some flaws and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening possibly the greatest film to show the direness within flyover country rolling kansas is a film in which nothing happens and you dont care about anybody like life it starts it moves and then it ends a few attempts at humor are made but everything falls very flat the occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that they could be wasting their life doing something besides watching this movie and the one rock song they bought and used at every single instancebr br do yourself a favor and go see a good movie this is free and repeatedly frequently on comedy central because nobody went to see it nobody wants to see it and its marginally better than dead air not to damn with faint praise but the movies one rock song is worth listening to too bad the movie isnt worth watching
