so i decided to watch the entire puppet master series and had just watched parts 13 which i thought were all excellent they had a unique charm to them and a certain intelligence that i really appreciated about a year ago i even saw puppet master vs demonic toys which of course was bad but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watchbr br from the very beginning of this film i knew it was in trouble the cheesy power rangersstyle egyptian skull villain who watches the puppets rita repulsastyle through his pyramid glass came straight out of left field all of the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd suddenly we have a grand assortment of all kinds of new and random characters and plots that are a far cry from the first three films i seriously doubt that when the first puppet master was being penned the writers had visions of someday seeing an egyptian power rangers villain totem monsters annoying twentysomethings who seriously cant act and are supposed to be brilliant scientists but never say anything intelligent and a lame decapitron puppet whos head can morph into the ghost of toulonbr br another thing that greatly disappointed me in this film was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry part ii since iii was a prequel suddenly the puppets are back at bodega bay inn back in their case minus blade and toulon for some reason is willing to help his puppets again he betrays them in part ii for his love of elsa this isnt explained at alland so with that and all of this other junk thrown in i was no longer amusedbr br im a huge fan of ridiculous b movies a connoisseur if you will i even collect laser discs of rare b movies you cant find on dvd and so it takes a lot for me to say that this was one of the most absurd movies i have ever seen in my life i still love those puppets the original ones blade tunneler pinhead jester and the rest and if they had only stuck with what they had rather than trying to fix something that wasnt broken well the series might still be alive and in good health that being said even though the reviews arent so great im really interested in checking out puppet master retro sounds like an interesting one that pays great tribute to the original themes
