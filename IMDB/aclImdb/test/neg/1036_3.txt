try as i might i just simply couldnt get into this one perhaps it was the washed out tones perhaps it was the drawnout approachim not really sure but though this was by no means a bad movie i didnt really find it to be very much of an effective movie words that i understand are so much more arbitrary than their common usesbr br so basically the deal here is that a series of adolescent boys deaths sets off an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town triggering a witch hunt what do the boys death have to do with the mysterious sexy woman who has appeared in town is the crazy hermit woman involved is it voodoo the story is a mixture of crime drama and horror as the various townspeople are all suspect and corpses keep appearing while bloody violence ensuesbr br good enough but to me most of it fell a little flat oh it had its moments the one boy walking in on a beautiful naked seductress was pretty good and the scene where the fathers beat the hermit was a bitter commentary even if the effects themselves failed considering her skin seemed to peel off as if they were whipping her with redhot ironsbr br my biggest issue was the ending ive already put spoiler tags on this review but be warned heres the big spoiler i dont believe it i dont believe that a priest could convince himself to kill young boys for becoming sexually aware without some hint of that psychosis appearing earlier with other boys with a history or some other personal affect the movie didnt really earn its ending end spoilersbr br nonetheless fulci is a big name and im more than certain theres an audience out there for this i definitely need to check out more that hes done because this may have been a poor introduction most italian giallo is hitormiss anyway so im waiting to see what else this guy can do before writing him offbr br polarisdib
