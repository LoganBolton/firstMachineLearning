is the cannes controversymeter remarkably esoteric or is that we americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore be that as it may with plenty of careful analyzing falscher bekenner at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to cannes in 2005 a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to its glum american retitle low profilebr br building on familiar themes of bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation kind of admittedly its a film not without its surfacelevel interests it starts out with a grabber as a haunting shot of a desolate offthehighway road focuses in on a teenage drifter who ultimately walks by a totaled car where supposedly a brutal hitandrun has left the driver dead in a gory mess stunned he does nothing but pick up a scrap of the remaining enginebr br just out of school the drifter turns out to be armin steebe a product of the german suburbs with minimal ambition persisentily pressured by his caring but somewhat nagging parents to find a good job he endures interview after interview with every haughty interviewer along with it every one with the same fruitless outcome getting mighty sick of it his aforementioned highway encounter soon provokes his first act of rebellion claiming responsibility for the crime which he did not commitbr br pretending to fill out more applications and going to more and more bizarre job interviews by sunrise he partakes in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism way after sundown as the days get shorter and the nights get much hotter as he goes on living in his suburban neighborhood as if hes doing nothing out of the ordinarybr br if you seem confused about what exactly is going on dont worry about being the only one this is about as far and coherent as the story gets the plot seems simple enough and perhaps due to its seemingly direct purposes thats why falscher bekenner becomes pointlessly convoluted becoming enamored with endless false conclusions dreamlike situations and graphic sex scenes to try and enlighten a story lacking clear logic to an already vague argument supposedly the soulnumbing effects of the modern suburban wasteland or something about youths fascination with crime hey it could even be a comingout movie at hand it spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols both tangible and surrealistically allegorical but they dont seem to be really symbolizing anything of interest br br the most fatal flaw however is how the filmmakers paint all its characters in a rough shade of vanilla theres hardly any distinguishable traits to help understand their purpose and how the secondary characters especially the confused relationship between armin and his rather normal perhaps too normal family catalyze the already underdeveloped lead characters plight never comes into focus how are we supposed to identify with this young almostadults rebellion with little sense of the world hes living in or the prominent figures around him that help comprise it br br many people drop in and out of the movie including armins sortof girlfriend katja and a strange affluent visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in watching the protagonist eat brownies and seem to exist for no reason whatsoever they ultimately just seem like prolonged padding to an already thin story with pointless subplots that continue to prove the movie is drawing a total blank about where to go nextbr br and even a movie that supposedly toys with reality especially with armins nightly exploits it ends with a literal almost moralizing headscratcher that seems to halt questions to a story that does little but put its viewer in a state of pointlessly exhausted perplexionbr br without any color its impossible to shade anything vital in
