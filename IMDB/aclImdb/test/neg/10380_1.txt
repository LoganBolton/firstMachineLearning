while this movie did have a few scary moments great use of music and film angles to build suspense its obvious director ethan wiley and scriptwriter ellary eddy didnt waste any time researching their subject matter which also makes me question their claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a genuine catholic bishopbr br amongst the many inconsistencies br br  jacob the roman catholic priest when we first meet him outside the church is wearing an academic robe over his clericals rather than the typical alb chasuble or surplice academic robes are commonly worn by protestant ministers in liturgical denominations not roman catholic priests br br  jacob the priest quotes some obscure and disturbing scripture about the angels taking up weapons he attributes it to st paul this verse is not from st pauls writings neither is it in the bible i cant even find it in the gnostic scriptures br br  jacob tells his bishop he doesnt believe in demon possession and turns down the request to study exorcism but does a complete 180 later that same day within minutes of talking to possessed isabelle sure its possible but a little unrealistic see father damien as a priestpsychologist in the original the exorcist for a bit more realistic portrayal of a skepticturnedbeliever br br  miguel the former priest turned farmhand is the first to try an exorcism on isabelle he quotes scripture and she quotes back he says i see you know psalm 65  she corrects him thats psalm 67  theyre both wrong br br  miguel the former priest who just got done performing an exorcism  making the sign of the cross calling on the name of christ applying holy water etc  tells jacob he doesnt believe in church and he doesnt believe in god maybe hes just conflicted jacob enlists him to put on homemade vestments and have another go at it anyway br br  miguel the former roman catholic priest crosses himself backwards or eastern orthodoxstyle as an hispanic roman catholic who used to be a priest he shouldve crossed himself forehead to sternum leftside to right side of chestbr br i had to read into the little side stories to get the notion satan was messing with the whole family not just isabelle but even in the end it was hard to say for sure if anyone was really guilty of the images in their heads or if it was all demonic trickery except for the sheriff  its pretty clear he was guiltybr br on the positive side isabelle was creepy  in my opinion she was the best part of the whole movie and i liked the plot twist with clairebr br im just not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or a spoofbr br listening to the running commentary with cameron daddo and ethan wiley im inclined to believe it was a joke
