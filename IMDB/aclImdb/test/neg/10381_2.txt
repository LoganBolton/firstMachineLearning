blackwater valley exorcism is a movie about a possessed young girl do i need to describe any more of the plot to you the exorcist and the exorcism of emily rose are two terrific terrifying movies classics imo blackwater valley exorcism bve is not not by a long shot its certainly not as terrible as a low budget copy of the exorcist could have been from start to finish it has the feel of a made for scifi channel production its one of those movies that will probably be spoofed and ridiculed on mystery science theater 3000 or a similar showbr br the make up and effects were absolutely laughable the acting was horrendously bad there was not a single performance that didnt lead to me rolling my eyes or giggling oh except maybe for jeffery reanimator combs as the sheriff the script wasnt that terrible but it certainly wasnt anything specialbr br it seems like through most of the movie everyone is more focused on who is sleeping with who than they are with the demon possessed girl in the other room oh there was something i learned from this movie apparently if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon then all you have to do is lock them in the room cmon and if your daughter is possessed dont worry too much because all it does it make them talk in funny voices eat rabbits try to stare you down and put fog machines in their bed other than that there is nothing to worry about apparently she was possessed with a low budget dlist demonbr br there was none of the ghastly deeds done by alist demons like crucifix intercourse painful body distortions or even projectile vomitingbr br totally laughable movie not worth even a discount rentalbr br 2 out of 10
