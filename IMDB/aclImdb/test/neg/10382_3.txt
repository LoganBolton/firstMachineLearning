this movie just seemed to lack direction the plot developed so many twists in such a short amount of time that it seemed to lose any semblance of what the true storyline was there was a lot of wasted dialogue and just seemed like the writing was rushed and a little too wandering the exorcism scenes and possession story began to take a back seat to the characters back stories which were a little weak to begin withbr br all in all i would say skip it unless you have rented out the rest of the horror section at your local video store and you have a jones for a movie you havent seen before youre much better off just watching the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose
