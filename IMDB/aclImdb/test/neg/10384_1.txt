while watching blackwater valley exorcism i encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that i was convinced that this was supposed to be a comedy a few choice bits of dialog worthy of a belly laugh i ate a rabbit i told you she was possessed are you telling me the devil is in my daughterbr br there are many many more but you must discover these for yourself  if you darebr br the story goes off into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldnt and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort even the priest and i havent even gotten to the bad acting most notable in this area is the fellow playing isabelles father the director must have just told him to act like hes got a stick up his  because thats the general impression one getsbr br i dont really want to steer anyone away from blackwater valley exorcism because there is entertainment value to be hadfor all the wrong reasons but if youre looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense and is actually scarywell run dont walk
