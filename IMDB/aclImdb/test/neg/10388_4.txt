i have to agree with the previous reviewer although the kristin erikson did a great job of playing the possessed girl i seriously dont think that isabelle the character she was playing was possessed i have seen people have psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse and they never made it clear whether or not the father had actually abused her or not i also had to watch some parts of it over again to make it clear as to what the letter said what the characters names were and im still not clear on a few things that happened whether they were real or not im trying to find the original story that it was based on to compare facts but i cant seem to find anything about it onlinebr br it wasnt a bad movie but some of the dialogue was incredibly cheesy special effects wise the movie wasnt bad for a grade b pretty much and those possession scenes made it all worth while that is if you have nothing better to do lol
