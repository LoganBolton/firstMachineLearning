a girl named isobel becomes possessed by a demon the local priest who formerly dated isobels sister must try to save her but the bigger problems are with the familys suspicions of each other rather than the demon in their daughterbr br this film is directed by ethan wiley the writer of house and the writerdirector of house ii i loved the first film and liked the second one even better so you would think this would be a winner alas this one looks like it was thrown together by firstyear film students dawson leery could have done better i have thought about blaming new writer ellary eddy especially because the idea is hardly original are they trying to cash in on the fans of the exorcism of emily rose but wiley should have been able to do his magicbr br also youd like to think veteran horror stars jeffrey combs and james russo would help this film russo playing the bishop barely shows up and combs has a great role as a sheriff for the five minutes hes on screen but i love the mustache so no help herebr br after seeing the exorcist all other exorcism films must be compared to the classic by default no and the demonic possession in this film was not scary in the least no headspinning or paranormal activity at all just a girl with a deep voice and runny makeup all the demonic stuff was centered around the father accusing everyone of sleeping with his wife as another reviewer wrote you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like its a trampoline hiding in her closet and jumping from a hayloft yeah its chuck e cheese gone wild that sadly sums up the extent of the evil in this moviebr br if you want to watch a movie about family members who invent accusations and yell at each other while the possessed daughter sits in another room offcamera this is the movie for you but if you dont mind my saying so you have a horrible taste in film if this is what youre seekingbr br the plot seems to focus on the father accusing a cowboy of sleeping with his wife who didnt but did sleep with his daughter and of the veterinarian of sleeping with his wife who might have but denies it and then you have a gardener who attacks the possessed girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist but once the priest arrives the gardener declares he does not believe in god what was all the biblequoting you were doing five minutes agobr br a horrible exorcism movie horribler examples of what combs and russo are capable of and such a sad display of directing after the house series of films became classic i would like to pretend wiley had no part in making this shamefully derivative and unoriginal uninspired film the power of christ compels you to avoid this movie as if viewing it were a cardinal sin
