im not sure if this is a comedy or not but i found it pretty comical isobel is possessed by the devil somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna fix that part exorcism and part soap opera youll at least get some laughs theres the paranoid jealous dad satanic sister valley of the dolls mother and then the cowboy boyfriend all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear isobel it sometimes felt like a jerry springer episode but i actually paid to see this instead of the cool headtwisting sailor cursing and crucifix humping that regan did in the exorcist you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like its a trampoline hiding in her closet and jumping from a hayloft yeah its chuck e cheese gone wild so if you want to watch a quote unquote horror film that is worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable ending  this is your movie
