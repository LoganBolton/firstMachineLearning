i just rented blackwater valley exorcism because the cover and pictures looked terrifying and i dont normally watch movies that are automatically released onto dvd but this looked so interesting and scary i was very much in the mood for a good scary film and to me possession is one of the scariest subjects to watch or learn about just look at the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose both terrific movies that made breakthroughs not only horror wise but story as wellbr br blackwater valley exorcism is about a girl isabelle who from the get go is automatically possessed so we cant even tell what kind of a person she was to begin with but a former wife beater turned priest is on the case with a gardener i know i know then they go into several other stories with the priest and isabellas sister and the priest hit the sister and messed around with isabelle im not sure then we get into a story with isabelles dad and his questioning of his wifes faithfulness to himbr br i mean the story just goes into too many directions and wasnt well developed at all not to mention that the exorcism didnt seem authentic at all and more of a just scare your pants off type of a film which i didnt like at all because i couldnt take it seriously whoever directed and wrote this clearly had no idea where to go or how to direct the story well so i wouldnt really recommend thisbr br 210
