documentaries about fans are always mishmashes and never worth seeing through but i found this one made by some of the fans themselves more than usually unenlightening as a veteran of the original tolkien craze forty years ago id hoped for more than the obviouswhich doesnt always equate to the true if theres anyone living who doesnt already know the nature of a fandom any fandom from having been or known a fan he wont discover it here between irrelevancies platitudes to which the actors from the films are particularly prone and acting out by fans making the mostif not the bestof their one shot at fame i could glean little of the special appeal of lotr the special emotional responses it evokes and the range of the special creative forms those responses can take in addition the film is rather lazy it slights some facts that could have been got across with little effort eg what the exact legal loophole was the wording of a copyright notice that permitted the books unauthorized publication in the us speaking of which i take strong exception to the films dismissal of the covers on that edition as irrelevant and psychedelic which they were not they were the work of jack gaughan a very able sf illustrator of the period and some fans including me found them more apt and more attractive than the covers on the rival set
