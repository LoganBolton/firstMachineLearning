i was surprised to discover michael moore or bill maher wasnt involved with this movie an american leftist laundry list of axes to grind with a distinct sparseness of democrats in hell mao zedong and karl marx didnt make an appearance in hell but ronald reagan is in the same room with hitler perhaps well have to wait for these california spin doctors to butcher paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figuresbr br cheap shots at religion rightwing politicians corporations and their lobbyists fox news even suvs all the radical leftist talking points were too completely covered  while conspicuously omitting references to wrongdoing from the other side of the aisle  to not have been a conscious effort the singular exception i noticed in the hour and a half is jfk has to have sex with marilyn monroe for eternity the token inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt at appearing nonpartisan
