too bad this movie isnt while nemesis game is mildly entertaining i found it hard to suspend my disbelief the whole length of the movie especially the situations that sara was putting herself into are we supposed to believe thatbr br 1 this hot chick is going to go slumming unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some riddlesbr br 2 the protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play riddle games for fun but dont put the whole i never sinned riddle together until the very endand thenand thenget thisshe has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put the pieces together i know it was the filmmakers device to show the audience what was going on but do they really think were that stupidbr br 3 when vern and sara go to the chez m to question the blonde there is not one topless chick in the whole building nada cmon i know its canada but i would expect more from a country that gave us shannon tweedbr br and anyone else notice that when vern was surfing the web and found that riddlezone site that when he moused over the link the cursor stayed an arrow and didnt turn into a little hand like all cursors do when you click on a hyperlink i mean if youre gonna have the internet play such a prominent role in your movie at least get the little things right geez
