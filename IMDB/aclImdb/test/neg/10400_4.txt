a group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original  and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on dantes inferno there is nothing especially clever dantes divine comedy was a brilliant piece of social commentary this film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to high artbr br i suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political andor religious right and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked be that as it may few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satirebr br the high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of schoolhouse rock on the subject of lobbying and the revolving door its really a shame that the entire film couldnt have been a musical that would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun
