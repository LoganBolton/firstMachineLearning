kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times he may have made more classics than anyone else he may have been a perfectionist but man was his first attempt ever badbr br kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map it looks like an ed wood film it has strange narration cheap shots bad dialogue ominous music reminiscent of your 50s scifihorror flick and what looks like relatives of the cast of reefer madness going insane for no reasonbr br sure you can see an undeveloped kubrick in there it is a psychologicalhorror study of war the characters became dehumanized and insane there are people playing more than one role there are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people and there are a few interesting shots around there but really this is a messbr br of course i am not discouraging you from watching it if you get a hold of it you are joining a select group of myself and a few thousand people world wide who have had access to it
