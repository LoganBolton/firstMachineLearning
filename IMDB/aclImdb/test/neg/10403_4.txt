stanley kubrick a director who i hold in the highest of esteems for his masterpieces clockwork orange 2001 the killing the shining dr strangelove etc took the film out of circulation leaving it to be found by only the hardcore fans and completists after seeing the film for myself i could see why at the age of 24 kubrick had already honed his craft of still photography for look magazine and had done a few short documentaries like many firsttime filmmakers that came in the decades after him his ambition for fear and desire was in short to just go and make a film cheaply more than likely to see if he could do it on that level he was successful however the film itself definitely is notbr br i cant really say that the film is a failure because there was something i did like about it throughout even as the films story went on the wayside and the actors whom kubrick didnt have any idea how to direct not being a man of the theater his knack for producing and capturing some great images gets its seeds in this film at times there are some shots of closeups and quickshots in suspenseaction scenes that are eyecatching unfortunately this is all the good i can really say of the film although there are a couple of name actors in the film frank slivera who also appeared in killers kiss and paul mazursky a director in his own right the performances overall are dull and very routinebr br in fact that is the films main demise for me whenever i watch any kubrick film even his early film noirs killers kiss and the killing i can tell who made it as his style by then became distinct which would continue as he evolved as an artist it wasnt artsy like i might have pictured which is usually the case with firsttime directors like scorsese and spielberg but watching this film not only did it feel like it wasnt kubrick it felt like a lot of the time i was watching some b or even c grade movie by a director that time forgot not quite ed wood bad but close the music is as standard as can be the fades are pedestrian and the plot seems to not really hold that much attentionbr br in short as others have said and which i can agree this is a doodle pad of a future groundbreaker who shows some shots and a few edits that grab some attention the best scene overall being when the soldiers take the dumb girl hostage but not enough to really recommend except to those like myself who end up seeing everything by kubrick or perhaps have to see every ultralow budget war film ever made if only out of curiosity
