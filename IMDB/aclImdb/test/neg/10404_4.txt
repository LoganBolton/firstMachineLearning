this sickly sweet and laboriously paced 5reeler is definitely not among harold lloyds better films gags are sparse and mostly uninspired saccharine melodrama is abundant the setup takes forever as lloyd the unconventional but impossibly kindly country doctor makes his rounds bringing a little sunshine into the lives of children the elderly and puppies its like a 1922 version of patch adams ugh 410
