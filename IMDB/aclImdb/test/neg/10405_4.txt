its another variation on the ofttold tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids with six you get egg roll is directed by howard morris from television and it shows because its the kind of tale that plays like a halfhour situation comedy padded out to feature film lengthbut with a scarcity of laughs or to put it differently only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the halfhour limits of a tv showbr br doris day decided to call it quits after this filmand its rather easy to see why even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast doesnt help brian keith barbara hershey pat carroll and alice ghostley do their best but the script is the real problem and should have been left untouched for the big screenbr br nothing much can be said in favor of it skip it and see miss day in any number of her more worthwhile films
