and obviously i didnt see it br br but looking at the cast and seeing that doug masters is back from the dead i know now to avoid this like the plague i hate it when hollywood producers writers directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that theyre not going to catch continuity errors a supposedly dead doug masters returning is a big giant one wont you saybr br and i cant believe that someone like louis gossett jr would return for something like thatbr br did jason gedrick really decline this well i hate to say it but even if he took the role again it would have still had that same continuity error i bet if he really turned it down he must have been incredulous seeing that his character died in the second filmbr br ill probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel but no way am i going to rent this or buy the dvd
