this is a slick little movie well worth your time to find and seebr br it really speaks to all those mundane choices we all make every day and like an hg welles story i cant quite recall may live to want backbr br keep in mind that this is a short very short it starts out slowly but just as you begin to think it has become boring bang its over and believe me the punch line is one you will rememberbr br im not sure if the producers are going to make it available for purchase  or available on the web but either way youd be happy you took the time to get hold of a copy  of that i am sure
