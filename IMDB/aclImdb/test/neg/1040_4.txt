where do i begin its one of the most frustrating movies ive seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid a movie about a ghost inhabited bed the first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a fabienne from pulp fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie this is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story still though if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early having a strangulation is the way to do it fast forward to the present day a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things so far everythings normal then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress they realize they need a bed frame this is where things get fishy why didnt they bring or buy a gd damn bed frame before they got there we learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place doesnt open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame the door magically opens they go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are savedor so they thought the rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe the female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if theyre bring tortured or tied upone of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old yuck the female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie they find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge while packing up the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on herbr br well if youve read this far you have to be thinking one thingwhy the hell didnt they just throw the bedframe out the window seriously they never said anything about the actual house being haunted just the bedso why not get rid of the damn thing and move on thats why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than sonny corleone at a toll booth the couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the ol oh lets give this place a chance honey scheme going so props to that still though me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every 5 minuteswhy didnt they just throw the bed out especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or somethingbr br all in all its a nearwatchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot to an extent but the solution is so simple youre scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be the highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the 50 year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he cant shoot her like thatbr br 4 out of 10 a low budget porno the man show would love
