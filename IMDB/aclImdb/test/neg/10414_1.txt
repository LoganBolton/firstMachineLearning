i was attracted to this film by its offbeat lowkey real life story line that is a twentysomething guy flops in the big apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother it just might have worked but theres a problem and that problems name is casey affleck br br casey affleck is nearly catatonic in this film his acting mantra must be exert as little effort as possible at all times or why speak when you can mutter or maybe put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls lips moving when speaking barely facial expressions none muscles in face atrophied something nothing anything zip
