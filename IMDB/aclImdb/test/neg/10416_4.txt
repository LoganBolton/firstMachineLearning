whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of filmmaking its thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoeverbr br if youre depressed already this film will send you over the edgebr br if youre feeling somewhat depressed this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about youll feel that its just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of timebr br otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed i didnt btw safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than jims then again you might consider that you have been fooling yourself and that are in fact in a much worse situation than youd previously realized you might feel a bit annoyed at jim for bringing this to your attention you may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish br br the sad truth is much as i wanted to like this movie i hated it it took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly for no reason whatsoever looked back at itself and then stoppedbr br jim does not have an epiphany at least not one that is conveyed on screen jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options he discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of selfdiscovery br br of course noone alive could write a happy ending to this movie as others have said its no hollywood tale its gritty and its real its well made life is quite a struggle at times if anyone were to know the answer they do well to shout it from the rooftopsbr br still i feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say you feel that its going to say something that if you just suffer through a little more of it itll have something to say itll make you stop and think br br it doesntbr br again i do submit that this is a well crafted film and therefore may be of value to a film student with a penchant for eg lighting techniques of the use of colour palettes br br for the rest of us its utterly missable
