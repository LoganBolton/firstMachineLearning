i am sitting here writing this review and the movies not even over yet in fact i just checked and there are 45 more minutes to go but no matter theres no need to see it through to the end ill just write this review and laugh as the film plays in the background and stumbles onward to some kind of presumably horrible conclusion which i dont care to ever see or knowbr br what accounts for my hostility to this movie the characters are not believable the plot is not believable the pretentiousness of the movie is sickening basically every element of the movie rings false buscemi obviously thought he had something to add to the dozens of movies which have already explored the wellworn themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent meaninglessness of life however buscemi was badly mistaken because this movie contains nothing new it tries very hard to be depressing but fortunately no one can really be depressed by it because its obvious that no people like this exist in the entire worldbr br what is depressing however is the knowledge that somehow this film was voted several undeserved awards disgusting bottom line stay away from this worthless film at all costs
