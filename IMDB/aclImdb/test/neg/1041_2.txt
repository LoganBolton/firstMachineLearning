i mistakenly thought this was the 70s art film about the bed that eats people which sounded interesting it isnt interesting i mean let alone about a maneating bedbr br i assume stuart gordon put his name on this in the same spirit that lloyd kaufman puts troma on just about anything thats been shot with a video camera in the interest of building up a franchise library little more can be said about this opus other than the running time is less than 90 minutes it is of course about a bed that is haunted by the spirit of a man or something that once killed a woman with a wig and long false eyelashes along the way we get a five minute opening credit sequence is the one for lawrence of arabia even as long a murderer with marylin manson contacts who kills using the same technique as the troll in cats eye demonstrations of a sexual practice michael hutchence may have employed a preview of what emilio estevez will soon look and act like soft core porn even cinemax would pass on manbutt and one topless scene a wacky or is it whackee ending involving unintentionally hilarious hammer hits and leftover strawberry pie well it looked that way to me and a rudimentary surprise ending apros pos of nothing much its like the screenwriter even fell asleep on the deathbed before finishing the last draftbr br its not scary its not sexy its shot on hidef video and doesnt look bad but doesnt look good either the acting is just good enough to not be bad enough to be fun and so is everything else no one would probably have even seen or heard of it unless it was on a disc with another movie the modern day double feature i wasnt paying attention for parts of it so i may have missed something but for some reason i doubt it rating pass
