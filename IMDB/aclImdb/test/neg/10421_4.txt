what is it about the french first they apparently like jerry lewis a lot more than the us does second they seem to like edgar allan poes work more than just about anyone else does its got to be the beaudelaire effectbr br dont get me wrongim a poe fan myself but this trilogy manages to make three of poes belowaverage stories intowell im not sure what theyre made intobr br toby dammit is a fine fellini film but it has nothing to do with poes story at least in terms of theme its enjoyable on the first viewing terence stamp does a good job with an interesting role however it has nothing whatsoever to do with poe or spirits of the deadbr br metzergenstein is a big mess how did vadims films get produced its just awfulnot even up to amateur film school standards depending on the dvd menu you have try to skip it and save your timebr br william wilson is actually the segment that is most faithful to poes work it does not have much style though even if it includes the strangest snowball fight i think that i have ever seen on film it looks like the boys are throwing tissues or maybe handkerchiefs that have been rolled up into balls br br my advice is to skip metzergenstein watch william wilson and then if youre a fellini fan im not keep toby dammit on while you cook dinner or make a snack
