wired would have to rate as one of the ten worst films i have ever seen the writing and direction show a stunning lack of imagination and im sure that most of the actors still cringe whenever anyone mentions this filmbr br it fails to work either as a tribute to belushis unique talent or as an accurate account of his short life br br a pointless mess with no redeeming features
