any film school student could made a film 1000 times better than piece of garbage as someone who had read the book i expected even a straight retelling of the book would make this a fair film there was a chance that a talented director could go beyond woodwards narrative and make a great filmbr br well the director did go beyond woodwards narrative he added a hip hispanic angel named velasquez that was not in the book he had bob woodward interview the dead belushi in an exchange in the morgue the film had all the insight of someone stoned on pcp staring at his navelbr br if this is a spoiler to you you will thank me for it because it is absolutely the worst movie ever made
