rented this one by mistake thinking it was another film with the same title and realizing that i had rented it some time beforebr br quick plot line a couple consisting of an artist and photographer rent a studio apartment in los angeles from joe estevez still cursing the fact his brother martin sheen could actually act they find a bed in a forgotten room but the bed is haunted by a nasty looking serial killer from the 1930s and his last victim their ghosts inhabit the couple first enhancing their sex life but eventually becoming more menacingbr br what ensues is cheap rrated sex scenes cheaper thrills and kind of a waste of time
