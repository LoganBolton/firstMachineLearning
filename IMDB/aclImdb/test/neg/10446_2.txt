hey what a great idea to open a film  show someones home movie  drama schools must be full of idiots   there they are taking drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio  hey i think ill send in the video of my wedding and call it the greatest romance ever seen or send in a tape of my honeymoon and call it the greatest sex ever seen  oh hold on im not married and ive never been on honeymoon  not to worry ill send in a video of someone elses weddinghoneymoon br br  mild spoilers br br youd think with an opening like that shark hunter could only improve wouldnt you  as shocking as it may seem the home movie is the best directed  best written and best acted part of the film  alas its all downhill from here as the family go to sea  in reality a fog shrouded swimming pool  in a three foot yacht where mom and dad get eaten by a cgi fin and their son spencer swears revenge against the fin  cut forward to the present day and the french are using an underwater research base for oil exploration  only thing is  and its so obvious you cant fail to notice this  its not filmed underwater   the director hasnt made any attempt whatsoever to even use the unconvincing technique of shooting the scene through a fish tank  the underwater research base is blown up by the shark  maybe its hired by greenpeace   killing everyone inside and spencer now a grown man is hired to hunt down the shark that killed his parents and a bunch of frenchmen  what else happens  no idea because i decided to watch something else br br no hard feelings if any of the cast and crew are reading this and i do hope matt codd becomes a big fish in hollywood  you think you know about sharks matt  you aint seen nothing yet
