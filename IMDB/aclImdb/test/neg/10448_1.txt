at last a film to rival el padrino and darkness falls in terms of sheer and utter dullness this is actually the first film ive ever given 1 out of 10 for on imdb and with good reasonbr br for one the cast is nothing special thats usually not a problem for me except that the only character thats in anyways interesting or different from all the rest is grand l bushs harrington secondly the production values a substandard  television scifi such as stargate has more convincing sets and all of the underwater scenes not handled by the sfx teams are filmed on dry sets with falling particles that arent very convincing this film is literally drydocked the worst part though is that this film is boring for the first 45 minutes i felt as if we were going round and round in circles its a prehistoric shark bullsht no really bullsht im not making this up bullsht there it is now i didnt see anything let me guess yup bullsht after then it picks up ever so slightly for about twenty minutes or so then were back to the dialog runaround dialog is not a bad thing but thats all this film has characters talking that too is not a bad thing except this film isnt very good at it the dialog is often contrived and clich√©d and is not very interesting to listen to i dont see any point slandering the special effects this film has worse qualitiesbr br the sets are small and unrealistic the acting is subpar the script  oh lord the script  is worse than a garbage of scifi television has to dredge up it makes you wonder where the budget of this film is or wasbr br yet another awful awful addition to the megaloadon theres about four series of films bring on steve alten please
