sorry after watching the credits i thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring sf actorsbr br boy was i wrongbr br the direction and story telling in this pos are terrible i have never been so insulted by a productionbr br i have great respect and love for many of the actors in this film but have to say they were connedbr br if you havent seen this debacle yet do yourself a favor and stay away these are not only two hours you wont get back but they will also ruin your respect for some actors you may once have enjoyed
