this movie was beyond awful it was a pimple on the as of the movie industry i know that every movie cant be a hit or for that matter even average but the responsible parties that got together for this epic dud should have been able to see that they had a ticking time bomb on their hands i cant help but think that the cast would get together in between scenes and console each other for being in such a massive heap of dung i can hear it now you getting paid nope you i understand that this flick was more than likely made on a shoe string budget but even with that taken into account it still couldve been better you wait for the appearance of a monstercreature and when you finally see it its a big yawnim so mad at myself for spending a 107 on this stinker
