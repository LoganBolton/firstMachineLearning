the twilight zone has achieved a certain mythology about itmuch like star trek thats because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner they are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show because of this a while back i reviewed all the original star trek episodes the good and the bad because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive now its time to do the same for the twilight zonebr br now i was very surprised when i saw reviews for this bland episode that described it as being among the best and gave it scores of 10 if this is the case then why is it that everyone i know who has seen this episode hates it as much as i do its possible that me and my family and friends are all cranks but its also possible this is yet another case of rabid fans rabidly inflating the rating on an average or below average episodebr br the episode itself stars william windom and others as various archetypesa soldier a dancer etc they are all stuck in a cylindrical room with no escape and only at the end do you realize the shocking truthwhich isnt at all shocking and is in fact majorly lame no this is a badly written and unengaging episode yes there were plenty of episodes of the series that deserved a 10 but few as undeserving as this one due to a shallow script and an unappealing resolution
