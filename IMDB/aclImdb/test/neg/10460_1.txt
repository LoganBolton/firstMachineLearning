while trying to build a major mall or complex or something like that a wealthy landowner ignores ancient native american artifacts buried on the land and unleashes the bone eatera creature who goes around and kills people in search of his fallen friends or something like thatbr br indeed this movie had to be a scifi channel original if it wasnt then the director should never direct anything again the effects in the film is laughable at best and the bone eater monster is nothing but a cgianimated being added into the frames at a later date the actors dont even look all that frightened when they see the thing probably because they really dont and theyre just terrible actors its a great comedy though even if its supposed to be pure horror
