all i can do is laugh wow i like jim wynorskis movies i really do i mean chopping mall is a classic but this what happened to this guy he used to make funny horror movies that tried to be good but this was hardly even funnyi mean i guess it was because i laughed the villain is incredible i mean horrible cgi it looksterrible and the movie has no gore and no nudity as redeeming qualities it is rated pg13 a movie named bone eater you know wont be a blockbuster movie you know it probably wont have a smart script a movie like this may rely on gorebut no it doesnt rely on anything really its justcrap check it out if you want to laugh though but dont expect a good movie i hope jim wynorski goes back to movies like chopping mall and ghoulies iv because this and komodo vs cobra aint cutting it
