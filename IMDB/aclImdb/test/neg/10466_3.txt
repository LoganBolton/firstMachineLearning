another indian legend you never heard of before is let loose as the name implies this is a vengeful wraith who likes to absorb the skeletons of people while theyre still using them as usual ancient burial grounds can you say poltergeist have been disturbed by clich√©d greedy land developers building stuffbr br the cgi if it had been better might have made the effect more treacherous looking but they skimped on the budget and it showsto comical effect the unleashed creature probably should have been kept off stage during its first several killingsthat might have added some mystery or impending doom atmospherebut the inept director decided to show us in the first five minutes what it looks like and it wasnt impressive the deaths are just poorly done again with shoddy cgi i guess ancient spirits always kill by using cheap special effects as for the victims they look theyre going to laugh any moment while they do goofy screams its always obvious whos going to get it a character with only a few lines shows up strange noises are heard cgi dots fly exit character repeat several timesbr br still theres a few chase scenes featuring the monster that actually made this thing watchable unfortunately the director seems to be using these as a device to fall back on so its used too often when he cant think of anything else for his characters to do overall its pretty silly but ive seen worse this flick is cheap but its oddly fun to watch
