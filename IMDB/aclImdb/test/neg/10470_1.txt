bone eater is set in a small desert town in alabama where property developer dick krantz jim storm is financing the building of a huge resort late one night three of his workers riley timothy starks hansen adrian alvarado  miller paul rae are digging foundations in the desert when they unearth what looks like a tomahawk axe unfortunately for them an ancient native american demon called the bone eater comes along  kills them local sheriff steve evans bruce boxleitner soon has krantz breathing down his neck as the construction of his resort grinds to a halt sheriff evans also has to deal with the bone eater demon as it kills anyone it comes acrossbr br you know i consider myself a fairly big fan of the horror  scifi genre i certainly dont think my opinion is worth more than anyone elses unlike many here on the imdb but please believe me when i say that bone eater is the worst scifi channel creature feature i have ever seen  its up against some damned strong competition as a horror  scifi fan there are two names that when involved with a film send shudders down my spine in anticipation of how bad it will turn out those names are jesus i have no talent franco who had nothing to do with bone eater  jim wynorski who directed the absolute disaster that is bone eater in fact bone eater is so bad wynorski hid under the pseudonym bob robertson when a director as bad as wynorski hides under a pseudonym you know the film must be bad where do i even start bone eater is quite simply the worst film i have seen this year  is so bad its untrue the story is awful the script is sloppy at one point sheriff evans tells kia to meet him at the hospital but when they meet there later he acts surprised  says what are you doing here at one point sheriff evans triumphantly claims that we are in the twentieth century  that ancient native american demons are nonsense although actually we are in the twenty first century now theres a part when a woman tells in flashback the story where three men awaken the bone eater  it kills them but since it killed all three of them how did anyone else know about it for it to be passed down in legend  at times it gets more than a little bit embarrassing the characters are horrible clich√©s the small town sheriff who saves the day his daughter becomes involved which adds some personal motivation  as for the native americans theres an old wise man a young hot head who hates white man  a young woman who is the voice of reason between the two who have names like storm cloud  black hawk the film is as boring as hell nothing happens the story is awful its full of plot holes  lapses in any sort of logic the setpieces are terrible theres no horror or gore or suspense or mystery  bone eater is just the sort of film that makes you lose the will to livebr br bone eater has some of the worst cgi computer effects ive seen in a while from the daft looking stiff moving bone eater creature itself which is just a selection of bones magically held together to a motorbike jumping a large gap to an awful cgi truck crashing over the edge of a cliff to a van being tossed to one side by the bone eater whenever the bone eater needs to get some speed up he causes a large horse to form from the sand  dust  rides it in principal this is actually quite a neat idea but it looks awful  the scenes even have cheesy cowboy music on the soundtrack there is one pointless scene at the end when sheriff evans cuts his own arm why  it bleeds but apart from that there isnt a single drop of blood in the thing whenever the bone eater kills someone they usually just disappear in a cloud of dust boring the hilariously goofy climatic showdown between sheriff evans  the bone eater has to be seen to be believed sheriff evans goes native on horseback complete with tribal war paint on his face while the bone eater also rides his dust horse  they have a sort of jousting contest which is just to bad to describe properlybr br with a supposed budget of about 700000 bone eater is filmed in a very bland forgettable  flat way theres no sense of style here at all the majority of the film takes place in bright sunlight  if you watch it on a decent telly then the desert scenery is quite nice on occasion there are several veteran known actors really slumming it here boxleitner plays exactly the same role as in the similarly themed but much better creature feature snakehead terror 2004 william katt will obviously put his name to any crap as long as he gets paid while ex star trek man walter koenig must be really desperate to agree to appear in thisbr br bone eater is a truly atrocious creature feature theres really not much more you can say about it other than to steer well clear of it the worst film ever to appear on the scifi channel  thats saying something isnt it
