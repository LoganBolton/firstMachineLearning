ok smalltown clueless sheriff check sheriffs hot daughter check neerdowell boyfriend of sheriffs hot daughter whom sheriff hates check corporate land developer who greedily puts profit over people check developers rankandfile accidentally unleashing a primordial monster then being pressured to cover it up check natives warning of mass death and destruction if things are not returned back to the way they were check amateurish cgi special effects that could have been produced by a commodore 64 computer check seriously virtually all the clich√©s of your typical scifi original movie have been lumped into a classic sobaditsgood movie the only one thats missing is the scientistexpert trying to impart his knowledge there is a paleontologist with three students who get ambushed my the bone eater fairly early in the movie but they are basically extras in the movie and i can honestly say that i predicted virtually all of this right down to who survives and who doesnt though i have to say i got the actual death time of one of the characters wrong by about an hour i swear i could have done this movie myself if they gave me all the characters despite all this the movie is fun to watch if for no other reason than to play mst3k with your friends if youre up for some mindless fun its a great movie to watch which is why i give this movie a surprisingly respectable 4 even though for all intents and purposes it deserves a much much lower rating but then again you wouldnt tune in to a scifi original movie if you were looking for a movie with an actual plot substantive characters or good special effects would you
