i really dont know if this was supposed to be science fiction or horror it was confusing to say the least what really upset me however was the lack of story development between the charactersbr br the sheriffs bruce boxleitner 17yearold daughter clara bryant is stuck with him for the summer and they dont spend 30 seconds on screen together at any one timebr br the hot native american jennifer lee wiggins apparently has the hots for the sheriff but they dont spend any time together eitherbr br the hot secretary kristen honey ends up dead and she had more acting ability than the other two put togetherbr br the bad developer vs the native americans is an overused story but i personally like evil developers getting theirs as i live in floridabr br the only reason i stayed with this was the creature it was original i have never seen anything like it and i am a sucker for new creatures
