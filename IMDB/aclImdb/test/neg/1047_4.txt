i watched this episode with high hopes after seeing it on so many peoples favourite episodes list im not boasting in any way but from the start i realised they were in some sort of toyboxcan with the huge eye looking down on them to the type of characters in there even though throughout the episode the questions of who are we where are we whats outside carry the suspense of the episode which i unfortunately already figured out i must say that different types of characters and the interaction between them did make the episode interesting enough although the twist of the story may have been harder to guess if all of them were toy soldiers
