okay when i bought this flick i though this gotta be the ultimate bmovie space monkey landing to the earth and starts right away to kill people br br well it was almost everything what i expected typical lowbudget scifi movie from the 60s acting has to be the worst ive ever seen especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the waitress made me laughing my ass off br br so why night fright doesnt fall in to category so bad that its good reason why is that some of the scenes were just too long and boring for example the scene were the police officers are searching clues in the woods it was just minutes of walking without purpose and then the grand finale the peoples waiting for the monster about 5 minutes and when the space monkey appears it get wackd in 20 second end of filmbr br yeah night fright is boring but it got couple of funny moments i can recommend this movie to all who liked films like zontar the thing from venus or curse of the swamp creaturebr br i give night fright 4 space monkey slaps out of 10br br rob gruesome
