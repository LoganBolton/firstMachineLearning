when a rocket from a government experiment on the effects of cosmic rays on animals crashes in a small texas town people start to die the county sheriff tries to investigate but is hampered in his efforts by other government officials it turns out that there is a mutant space gorilla on the loose killing teenagers in the woodsbr br i like low budget science fiction and horror movies i like monster movies so i thought that there would be a good chance that i would like this movie sadly i didntbr br i dont mind the bad acting the corny dialog the atrocious musical score or the giant plot holes that this movie has there are a lot of movies that have the same problems that i have seen and enjoyed in a so bad its good kind of waybr br but where others of that type and night fright differ is that night fright just has terrible pacing and it drags on because of that there are scenes that just go on and on without anything happeningthe searching the woods for clues is just people walking in the forest for a long time there are several seemingly endless dancing teens at a party in the woodsbut nothing interesting is going on if these scenes were shorter the movie might not have been as boring though i dont think simply cutting those scenes would save this onebr br i have now given this movie three viewings to make sure that i gave it a chance before slamming it in this review sadly it has gotten worse with each watch there wont be a fourth
