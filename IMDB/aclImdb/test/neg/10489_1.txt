i am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60sfilms so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh so because of this its natural that id choose this filmespecially because with john agar in it it was practically guaranteed to be bad sadly while it was a bad film it was the worst type of bad filmdull beyond belief and unfunny at least with stupid and overthetop bad films you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting here you never really see that much of the monster mostly due to the darkness of the print and the acting while bad is more low energy badlistless and dullbr br the film begins with some young adults going to satans hollow to neck well considering the name of the place its not surprising when they are later found chewed to pieces duhdont go necking at satans hollow well there are reports of some sort of crashing object from the sky so what do the teens go yep throw a dance partya very very very slow dance party where the kids almost dance in slow motion so its up to the sheriff agar and his men to ensure that the teens can dance in peace without fear of masticationbr br as for the monster its some guy in a gorilla suit with a silly maska bit like the monster in robot monster not exactly original and not exactly high tech to make it worse it makes snorting noises and moves very very slowlyso slow that even the most corpulent teen could easily outrun it how it manages to kill repeatedly is beyond mebr br overall too dull to likeeven if you are a fan of lousy cinema
