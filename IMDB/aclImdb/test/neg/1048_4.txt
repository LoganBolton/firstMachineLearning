honestly i am not that impressed by it its not a bad movie but its not great one either theres a story to tell but its told in a very incoherent way which kinds of makes it loose its full meaning and ability to intrigue this movie could of been made in another way with an outstanding result the story is just so interesting yet somehow im not intrigued when watching it br br it definitely isnt an amateur movie rather the opposite and some of the scenes are really emotional the actors and actresses does quite a good job and so does the director but theres just something so unfinished by the whole movie that i cant quite put my finger on perhaps if you had gotten to know the characters abit more all the messiness of the movie could of been better clarified and put more action throughout it cause as it was it became abit slow from time to time
