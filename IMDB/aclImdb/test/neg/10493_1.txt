mixing small town sheriffs highschool students fake rock music and some weirdo who kills for well no reason in particular this film is essentially a remake of the giant gila monster  except without the gila monster of coursebr br now anyone who has actually seen giant gila monster knows that it is one of the worst made films of all time frequently so slow its not even funny and i cant believe that by 1967 giant gila monster had earned such a reputation that young directors were just dying to get to work on a sequel let alone a remake so will someone please explain to me why this film was made the dance sequence by the way is historically interesting although about three years out of date but even thats spoiled since it goes on and on and on
