i watched this as part of a vampire movie marathon with research intent otherwise there is no way id have watched it all the way through the first scene wherein a bunch of vampires in very bad wigs seemingly get electrocuted by various slow moving weapons wielded by an even slower moving van helsing wannabe in black and white with a voice over sets the pace for the entire rest of the film the fight scenes look ridiculous the dialouge would be funny if the acting wasnt so bad what passes for plot doesnt make sense and the production values bite from the pleather knock off of spikes coat worn by the hero to the cheesy cheap magicians cape their lead vamp swooshes aroundbr br ive seen some bad movies check out the magic sword with b rathbone or the raven with a very young jack n but this one gets my vote for worst of all times
