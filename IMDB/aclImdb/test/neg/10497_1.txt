incredibly vampire assassin is significantly worse than such atrocities as tequila body shots and zombie nation  and those movies are terrible writerdirectorstar ron hall is devoid of both charisma and acting ability and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts possibly the worst camerawork editing lighting sound visual effects music and fight choreography i have ever seen in a movie rarely do two shots cut together nor can you see much in the beyonddim lighting the terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a supremely untalented cast stretching the movie to a neardeadly 87 minutes this is a truly laughable embarrassment for everyone involved obviously aficionados of terrible filmmaking will want to see this but its very hard to sit through no matter how experienced a badmovie viewer you are the fact that ron hall thought this was actually releasable is astounding if you are a movie director and you actually think its ok for the opening credits of your movie to include a few frames of the words slug before the title appears left over from your rough edit  and you apparently cant muster the energy to edit those frames out  then your standards are obviously so low as to be insulting i am astounded that lions gatemaple agreed to release this movie on dvd in spite of rudy ray moores very brief cameo this movie is a work of supreme selfindulgence on ron halls part  he clearly thinks he is a formidable actor and must also believe he possesses superior writing and directing skills  but the movie is so unbelievably inept that its hard to believe hed actually want people to see it for fear of being brutally excoriated like im doing right now a jawdropping insanely terrible movie im not kidding
