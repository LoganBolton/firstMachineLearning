i wasnt able to last ten minutes on the this terrible film in and age of dv cameras it looks to have been shot on vhs without aid of any color correction or microphonebr br as a filmmaker myself i know the constraints of indy filmmaking and even keeping those things in mind im amazed films can be made this poorlybr br the only praise i can offer is that this film got distribution as ive seen considerably better films still seeking modest domestic or international release im guessing the box is what sold itit does have good box art but it all goes downhill from therebr br side note it seems the director has 11 friends since no one on the this planet would give this film a 10
