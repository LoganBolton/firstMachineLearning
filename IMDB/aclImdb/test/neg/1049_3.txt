the kite runner began as one of those important films that most people fawn over because they are told that they should if they want to be among the elite and quickly descended into an idiotic film of absurdly outlandish proportionsbr br ive never read the book and never felt the need because i honestly dont care sure im called uninformed for saying it but i truly have no interest whatsoever in just another pull at your heartstrings copy off of all other story lines to get emotion from the readers novel even if it is set in afghanistanbr br that said i watched the movie i heard good things about its beauty and how touching it was and decided why not as it turns out there was a very good reason why not not only was the so called main character completely unsympathetic i get it he was young and this is a film about redemption but honestly he was horrible i hated him and not in that good antihero way he was just a dull idiotic selfabsorbed character that i felt nothing towards but the rest of the story was so completely absurd that i couldnt believe how everyone else was fawning over how beautiful it was and how they cried and it moved them im sorry but i only feel moved by something that feels realistic scifi has been known to move me fantasy as wellbut this please this surpassed many other movies for pure absurdity my biggest peeve hassan was amirs brotherreally you sure you didnt just rip that off from a thousand other stories positive that that particular tidbit wasnt just added in to try to pull more tears out of your audiences yknow the type of people who look for reasons to cry during a movie i was rolling my eyes when that twist was revealed knowing that it could only go downhill from there not to mention flashing back to star wars amir hassan is your brother nooooo thats not true thats impossible oh and it certainly did filled to the brim with clich√©s and just plan dumb storytelling like good guy miraculously escapes bad guy against all odds with help from spunky kid who despite being viciously sodomized and having no clue who you are is willing to help out with a conveniently placed weapon that holds special meaning to you ooh and dont forget the oh so idiotic finally getting vengeance on the kid who teased you when you were little who surprise surprise has turned into a psychopathic adult trust me guys i understand you like to live vicariously through movies but thatll never happen you know that kid who teased you in high schoolhes no terrorist hes probably an accountant br br oh and i must mention the cgitastic kites i think those were on par with the matrix movies and transformers bravo you guys bravobr br it seems this movie was just made for western audiences who need to a reason to care about the middle east hey an overly emotional friendship story will work this is one of the most shallow movies ive had the misfortune of seeing it poses as deep wellbut when you get right down to it its nothing specialbr br unfortunately the core of americas audience will do what theyre told and follow the its about controversial material so it must be good way of thinking
