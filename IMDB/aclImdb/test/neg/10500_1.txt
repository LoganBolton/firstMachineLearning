i dont normally give movies a 1 although i am a heartless critic i try to find anything that makes the movie worthwhile that is to say watchable the main thing i look for is a coherent plot if it has that alone i can watch it let me start by saying this doesnt even deserve to be called a movie this is more like an elementary school projectgone horribly wrong and ive seen every scifi movie special that was ever madebr br many times ive read professional critic reviews that say crap like this played like a madefortvetc etc and i kept saying oh come on i wish theyd think of a real criticism well this is worsemuch worse this is truly the worst thing ive seen thats lasted the length of a movie if i did consider it a movie it would be my new worst movie of all time and ive seen every movie uwe boll made this movie makes uwe boll look like francis ford coppola  id rather watch jaws the revenge all day then see this one more timeeven 5 minutes of itthere was one good scene and it was the end p ok enough bashing the works of ron hall now for the serious criticismbr br the script is poorly written the dialog is delivered in a wooden manner the effects are cheesier than those in a power rangers show and dont even get me started on the screen zoomin transitions ugh someone actually watched this thing edited it and then said ok release it i would have rather burned this than release it in closing all i can say is thank goodness dvd and vhs players have a stop and eject feature my advicedont rent it if you do youll be glad you have stop and eject too
