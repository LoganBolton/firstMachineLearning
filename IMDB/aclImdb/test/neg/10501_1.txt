so this is the worst movie you will probably ever see its up there with crossbones and southern comfort but if your a bad movie fan like i am this atrocity of a film will be the most fun youve had in years why does the camera make oldschool kung fu noises when it zooms why does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag and who is he anyway why do the vampires shoot lightning after they die what is this highlander dracula mccloud who cares just laugh at it this movie has no continuity no plot no anything really ron halls range of emotions are always off he looks happy when he should be sad angry when he should be confused the rest of the cast couldnt act their way out of a paper bag the special short bus kinda special effects are randomly placed and never needed most scenes are lit with a desk lamp if they are lit at all mel novak has the audacity to look offcamera for his line and its not even edited out they just keep on filming in fact half of this movie isnt even on film at all its 12 film 12 sony handcam for most of the film it seems that they left their boom mike at home this movie doesnt just have a few plot holes its a mine field of confusion and mental pain but oh do i love it thank you ron hall for this cinematic abomination i went out and bought it cause its just so damn funny 199 on amazon and i had it rush deliveredbr br i have weapons i have weapons i have weapons
