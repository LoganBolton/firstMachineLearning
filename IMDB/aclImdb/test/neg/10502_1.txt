if you came here its because youve already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about itbr br i feel for you i really do and i profusely apologize as a canadian because thats what we do that this film ever had to cross your eyes if only for a moment i hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen casesbr br i like everyone else rented this movie believing it to be some stupid bmovie ripoff of blade i thought sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie ill give the creators of this film one positive comment about their creation thanks for removing the rec xxxxxx from the bottom righthand corner of the screen i can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this moviebr br and for the record i saw the movie but did not watch it the dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmothers trailer i swear to godbr br you know what im not writing anymore about this its just too painful
