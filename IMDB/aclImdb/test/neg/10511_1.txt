its 2005 my friendsa time of amazing special effects and an age of technology so why cant we see a movie thats a little more thought out than this cheesy lowbudget film ive seen a lot of lowbudget movies that rock my socks off but this oneits almost as if its trying to be horrible justdontwatch it i can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good i feel like a small child produced this entire movie theres not even an original plot line vampire assassins in itself is one big plot hole with an attempt to mock itself can someone tell me if perhaps this was designed as a comedy movie and i just didnt know it it makes me wonder what does the sequel have in store for us who so loved the first installment
