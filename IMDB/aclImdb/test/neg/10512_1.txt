i rented this movie expecting it to suck and it didnt let me down i rented it with some friends as a joke but what we got was worse than anyone could ever imaginebr br it starts off sucking before you even take it out of the box it looks like a blade ripoff and the guy on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie its called vampire assassin but isnt an assassin someone who kills for hire well this guy kills the of his own volition so that doesnt make him an assassinbr br then when you actually put the disk in it gets worst first off the menu animation is lame but when you actually start the movie every thing from the set design to the lighting or lack thereof is terrible you know a movie is bad when the credits even suck the acting is laughable the action is childish the writing is elementary and the directing is the worst
