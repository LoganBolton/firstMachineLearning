ive spent a year deployed in iraq and amongst the hundreds of movies ive seen here was this little gem called vampire assassin judging from the cover africanamerican with cornrows with a curved blade leather coat and the demeanor of a badass i expected a blade ripoff fair enoughbr br so i pop it in and observed a borderlined overweight africanamerican with no blade no cornrows and well nothing at all really excepti dont know if youve read any of these other reviews you get the gist of the flick it sucks bad really badbr br i dont know if it was the highlanderesquire lightning after killing an immortal vampire or the karatekick sound effects for camera zooms or the twenty dollar budget on props or the ok we have 90 minutes to film this before were caught filming in a johnson  johnson parking lot or the martial arts that is as exciting and fastpaced as two old people having sex or the 7th grade acting talent or the eccentric asian master whos either senial or on acid or what but the movie manages to force you to question your existence and thats awesomebr br not many movies can be so bad that your head will explode like scanners if you heckle or mst3k with your friends this is the flick for you ive seen it three times already and i think it mightve caused permanent damage on my psyche if you still dont have any clue as to the quality of the film people were trying to give it away for free and no one would take it not even by forcebr br long story short watch it either as masochistic pleasure or punishment it will rock your skull and for the most part for all the wrong reasons
