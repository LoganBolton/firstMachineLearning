ron hall pulls a triple threat as he writes directs and stars in vampire assassins derek washington hall is your clich√©d coponamission who finds himself up to his neck in some nasty vampire action tossing away his badge he searches for the last vampire slayer no not buffy to take back the streets and vanquish the bloodsuckers back to the gravebr br vampire assassins is a horrible film it rips off so many other films can you say blade that it never even attempts to establish its own identity the script is non existent the action is horrible who says a microbudget stimulates creativity there is nothing even remotely interesting here you will get nothing out of this except a headache stay away at all costs
