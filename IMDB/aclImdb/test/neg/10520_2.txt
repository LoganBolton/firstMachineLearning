a blatant ripoff of air bud this movie is really about parents worrying too much about parenting all the foibles of the characters eg adult coaches who dont know the game are taken to the extreme so much so that they are totally unbelievable not funnybr br there is no semblance of reality here folks and youll not develop sympathy for any of the charactersbr br the best thing about the movie is the good looking kits uniforms of the opposing team in the first game the dog plays perhaps chosen because the setting is supposedly near arlington heights il the home of the columbus crews franchise player brian mcbride
