this stinker is in mystifyingly frequent rotation on one channel here and ive found myself watching in horror again and again the script is like something one would come up with friends over several too many drinks and the production values match admirablybr br its meant to be a childrens movie but features a grotesque and poorly explained kidnapping scene the star dog has a lack of star quality equaled only by the other actors and it in general has the look of being filmed in someones backyard the climactic soccer game features no more than three dozen extras sadly cheering in the backgroundbr br it even all wraps up with a budgetranout voiceover sequence when the story to ones relief simply stops the highraters here must be either the producers  or the majority of the extras from the soccer game
