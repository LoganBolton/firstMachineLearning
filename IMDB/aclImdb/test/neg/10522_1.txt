even my five year old was boredbr br very predictable and overacted this movie couldnt make up its mind as to whether it was slapstick or wry commentary on the state of pee wee sportsbr br characters were underdeveloped could have done more with the connection between father and son both coming from an orphanagebr br did not like the reference regarding the goalie slipping the laxative to his teammatevery mean spirited for a kids moviebr br typical mafia behavior was boring and stereotypicalbr br the dog however was so darn cute
