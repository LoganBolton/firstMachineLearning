ok we were going along with the stereotypical bad orphanage experience and explaining to our son adopted from russia that this was overthetop acting and dramatization so we could get to the dog playing soccer since he plays soccer but the last scene in which the dog goes back to his original owner put my son over the edge and he cried for 1520 minutes hes been replaced this from an elementary child i do not recommend this movie to any family that has an adopted child it displays adoption orphanages and adults badlyand in the end even though they win the gamethe dog that the boy bonded with has to leaveand this is too much please be wary if you have any adopted children and beware families with biological children because the impression of children who are adopted is not positive and paints a stereotype that is unhealthy and nasty the dog is cute but not enough to save our familys reaction to this movie
