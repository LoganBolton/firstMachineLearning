physical evidence is one of those films that you want to like but really should be a lot better than it actually is developed as a sequel to jagged edge for glenn close and robert loggia it gives the impression that all involved only made it while they were waiting for something better to come along the premise is perfectly serviceable its mostly technically efficient if horribly uninspired with even henry mancinis musacky score surprisingly pleasant but you cant help feeling that things would have turned out better if one of the leads had turned out to be the killer as is rumoured was originally the case as the opening scene of his littleseen personally disastrous heat 1986 showed reynolds has all the makings of a great screen villain as is there are few surprises and a feeling of halfhearted filming by numbers as it builds up a head of intertia as it ambles disinterestedly towards a less than grand willthisdo finalebr br reynolds is fine sailing through on charisma in what is clearly a star vehicle unfortunately the same cannot be said of theresa russell an impressive and fearless actress in husband nic roegs films which allow her to delve into the darker side of human nature shes trapped in a part that requires star quality rather than depth and she aint got it in spades she doesnt fluff her lines or bump into the other actors but thats about all that can be said in favour of her astonishingly stilted and often amateurish performance that lets the film down badly aside from ned beattys prosecutor the supporting cast add only a slightly surreal presence in a boston where everyone seems to have a badly disguised canadian accent and the streets bear a startling resemblance to toronto and montrealbr br likewise director michael crichton who in westworld coma and the first great train robbery showed that he knew how to lean an audience to the edge of their seats seems to handle the action in a purely perfunctory fashion  indeed in one brief chase the shots dont even match and seem thrown together almost arbitrarily the climax itself has no flair and is completely bereft of threat or danger and many scenes are played for far less than they are worth its no great surprise that aside from uncredited reshoots on the 13th warrior crichton hasnt directed sincebr br its watchable enough in an 80s tv movie sort of way even if it never lives up to the promise of its opening whether thats enough of a reason to see it is down to individual taste
