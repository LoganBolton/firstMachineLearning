seagal fans beware he does no action scenes until almost an hour into this mess instead seagal runs away from numerous fights letting ja rule convincingly lose every battle actually ja rule could be an up and coming action star but hollywood needs to let him at least hit puberty which should happen in a few more years also what sort of commandoterrorist wears a baremidriff outfit the chick in this atrocity looks like a backup singer for christina aguileraback to seagal when he finally does cut loose its his stunt double heavily padded to resemble the bloated seagal doing a lot of the work  taking the falls i dont remember any aikido either its just your standard kicks  punches youd see in any straighttovideo martial arts turkey not even sobaditsfunny either just plain dull
