i saw this movie yesterday and like most allrdy wrote i also expected a steven movie god i love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humerous in had a little doubts cause i read that ja rule was playing in it but i thought hopefully they give him a smal role so i dont get irritations by watching him and offcourse the opposite happend goooooooooooooooooooood steven what the heck were you thinking going to join a sry  crew like this steven was broke and needed cash bah  what a big dissapointment if you like steven movie pleaseee skip this one its pure drama you only get a few special effects that made me vote 310 but the acting of ja rule screws up the whole movie aswel for his buddy kurupt with his irritating hood talkbr br my beer went from tasting fresh to water we do the dishes in the story didnt had any good about it to me it felt like a 3 year old produced itbr br hopefully steven makes me happy again in a future movie people this isnt even worth renting simpel as thatbr br to bad and pitty
