my take steven seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller even a totally dull one br br remember steven seagal you dont dont worry theres not much to catch up on after starring in admittedly enjoyable crowdpleasing films like under siege and executive decision seagal hits the low grounds of the bad movie abyss now he stars in lowbudgeted blevel action vehicles some of which are madefortv movie of the week entries that lost their way to the big screen half past dead is among these shall we say dead action movies a loud and lousy action film sloppily directed and lazily written and worse badly acted this is one of those bad movies that i dont need to watch until the ending to know its bad i didnt have the guts to have all my braincells die while wasting my time with this it it this kind of bad films in which you realize those other films you hate are not bad after allbr br the plot and the locale is completely lifted from a similar picture michael bays the rock although similar may not be the word to describe it both movies are summer movies and not meant to be taken so seriously but in comparison even the rock which isnt much in the writing department as much as the lights and sounds has better characters a more compelling plot better action sequences and overall a more entertaining atmosphere although there are action scenes in half past dead none of them are exciting all of which are sometimes tedious and predictablebr br although predictability seemed to be a welcome asset in summer action films predictability has never tasted more sour in ones that arent fun and half past dead is never really fun a lot of times its just a pain in the head hearing the bad rap music repeat over and over again throughout this film makes me yearn for an aspirin every second i hear them the acting is horrendously mediocre the plot is derivative with no compelling or appealing characters whatsoever seagals character an undercover agent sent to alcatraz to stop a criminal mastermind morris chestnut a very boring villain is nothing to get excited about seagals character is also provided with a sidekick played by rap star ja rule and a bunch of amigo inmates and theres no chemistry going on herebr br if starring in a series of other forgotten action vehicles what were those films again killed of seagals career for good half past dead is overkill and audiences be warned youre invited to feel the pain advice avoid it at all costsbr br rating 0 out of 5
