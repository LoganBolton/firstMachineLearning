most lorne michaels films seem to fail because theyre essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in fiveminute segments tommy boy is a character right from snl  a big fat lovable in their opinion goof who doesnt know anythingbr br david spade gets the thankless overwhelmed everyman role hes paired with the annoying overweight slob and they endure miserable misfortunes as they travel cross country to save daddys businessbr br the plot for starters is really faulty the whole premise  daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz  can be traced back to just about any movie you want like any snl style film it is reduced to a simple motivation  empty shallow just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be funny togetherbr br the movies biggest influence is the 1987 comedy classic planes trains  automobiles that movie is great because the plot isnt stale and recycled its basic yeah  a guy traveling home for thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob but its real dammit it makes all the difference the characters are real the situations are far more real tommy boy is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters  we feel nothing for them and we dont care about whats happening onscreen pta walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relateable  tommy boy is simply absurd with jokes like a simple deerintheheadlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isnt dead then awakens and wrecks their carbr br the whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from pta and its eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the steve martinjohn candy moviebr br farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable  ive never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasnt changed my mind spades given very little to do serving as the movies most thankless characterbr br dan aykroyd is wasted as the evil baddie who plans to destroy daddys business the ending is a joke and not in a harhar funny way more like a oh god are they serious waybr br some people dig it thats cool but i just cant get into it nor do i appreciate all the stuff it borrows from  not just counting pta  without any credit whatsoever
