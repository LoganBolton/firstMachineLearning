the best thing about the movie is the name as it both describes the plot and the acting at least they cannot say they didnt warn you kind of like the button labeled dont push thisbr br segal must have run out of things that move like planes trains and ships but the plot remains the same under cover guy who fights slowly but still beats like 40 mercenary types and doesnt even blink when doing so what amazes me is that segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and 50 clips of ammo where do all these bullets actually go to the only redeeming feature of this movie is watching nia peeples pound ja rule real name jeffrey atkins doesnt quite sound so punk into the floor i could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that especially wearing an outfit like that it was just a bonus watching jeffy get is ss kicked and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed sorry its just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy cant act rappers out of the movies pleeeeease who came up with idea anyway id lay odds it was the person who decided that cameron diaz and drew barrymore would pass as witty athletic angelsbr br the only surprising twist in this movie is that they dont do the politically correct thing and have jeffy come in and save the day no doubt if snoop otherwise known by his momma as calvin broadus which again doesnt sound so cool when you refer to him as cal had been in the movie hed throw some signs down on her and probably saved segals life or something
