yeah a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction now its a prison again kind of well its more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits so i guess in that way its like a prison not really though when sasha steven seagals character is being admitted into prison hes standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend like hes in line for the security check at the airport then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches smacking around a couple of security guardsbr br let me tell you something you assault a corrections officer in a federal prison theyll shoot you on the spot ja rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second punch oh and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot in prison federal prisonbr br you cant dress like that at most high schools in americabr br speaking of ja rule i have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth including ja rule himself had to have been 50 cent just before i watched this movie i saw one of those shows on tv about the greatest celebrity feuds ever and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 cent who had lived the thug life for real and ja rule who had not every time i saw ja rule on screen the only thing i could picture was 50 cent laughing his ass off ja rule looks like a rowdy 9yearold every time he appears on screenbr br anyway getting back to the plot its funny sasha is an fbi agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so he can get behind the criminal organization hes sentenced to five years and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes nothing else in the movie matters after that it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences most of which arent even well choreographedbr br oh how about this a helicopter crashes through the roof of new alcatraz at one point accidentally freeing all of the inmates and what do they do they all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block without so much as a basket they had a ball but it doesnt matter the scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotchbr br so some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in alcatrazs state of the art execution chamber evidently not for stealing 200 million dollars in gold but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caughtbr br hey good thinking people if you cant get information out of someone kill them thats a great way to learn the truth so some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the 200 million for themselvesbr br oh and the 200 million is in gold bricks i doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currencybr br theres also the issue of the warden at the prison hes some toughtalking vato who thinks hes a hardcore chollo from the barrio which reminds me of a joke i saw this comedian once talking about people in california who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense these people go to mexico the comedian says and theyre like oh my god people live there thats like a total shackbr br the best is when the united states supreme court justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men cant carry their guns inside his prison i dont care if she is a united states supreme court justicebr br this woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks hes in charge habr br and by the way the supreme court justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is 53 thats a year younger than steven seagal i just thought that was funnybr br the only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where ja rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little asian woman that was the funniest thing ive seen in a movie in a long long timebr br you know i work for the company that produced this film which i why i watched it and i still dont have a single positive thing to say about it except of course for that one scene with ja rule getting spanked by that asian womanbr br so read my review of malena and you will see how strongly i sometimes disagree with professional film critics like roger ebert but in his review of this movie ebert wrote something that i agreed with as much as anything else hes ever writtenbr br i imagine the flywheels at the mpaa congratulating each other on a good days work as they rated half past dead pg13 after giving the antigun movie bowling for columbine an rbr br way to go guys
