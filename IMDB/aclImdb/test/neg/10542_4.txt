oh dear what can i say about half past dead i was really disappointed in it i was thinkinga steven seagal movie cool well get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones we might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody excellentbr br however i was in for a rude awakening this film can be summed up as followsbr br take an episode of the ateam remove the lovable and roguish characters such as murdoch hannibal mr t and face then get a writerdirector to pen a plot even ed wood would be ashamed of and whos too big a fan of the matrix and john woo movies for his own good throw in a bunch of people with really bad acting ability and who dont have real names finally add in a main star whos getting saggy around the midriff and doesnt appear to be able to do his own stunts anymore br br the result half past dead an action movie so ridiculous that it at least made me smile right the way through the plot holes are stupendously glaringly large  for example prisoners who when the jail is invaded fight the invaders rather than attempting to escape or how about the prison itself which has an armoury that contains heavy machineguns and rocketpropelled grenade launchers you also have a helicopter bearing a striking resemblance to a huey with some kind of video game machinegun mounted in the nosebr br then theres seagal himself i like the guy he can fight hes even witty in a way that jeanclaude van damme will never be but all through the movie i kept hoping for that one great defining fight scene never happened instead we got people firing guns a lot and not hitting a whole hell of a lot i mean when someone runs down a narrow corridor and you fire a submachinegun at them there isnt a whole lot of places the bullets can go other than down the corridor and into the target yet somehow they miss even the ateam would cringe at this foolishness and then when it gets to any kind of oneonone physical stuff we get treated to a shabby matrix ripoff without the benefit of bullettime people getting kicked twenty feet through the air and sundry other ludicrous acrobatic nonsensebr br cmon steven youre better than this your career cant be over say it aint sobr br this is instantly forgettable except im forcing myself to remember for the purposes of this review and if you watch it try to find it amusing in an ateam kind of way but i doubt itll be high on anyones rewatchable list out for justice this aint more like out to lunch
