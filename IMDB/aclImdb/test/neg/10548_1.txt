the toxic avenger br br the idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this person a looser and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste mutated into a superhero that is completely disfigured sounded ok even for 1985 this movie is listed as a horror i even have read of a cult following with this series br br now this movie even given when it was made was so bad that i couldnt stop watching the acting is horrible even for an independent film that i think was to be the horror part of this moviebr br drug dealing sumo godzilla entrance im all for movies that promote antidrugs heck i even like godzilla and well sumo im not into it but even still i think that the heights of sumo would love to give this movie the 1000 hand slap and ground salt into the eyes of the people that made this movie br br personally i am almost ready to write to the film company that made this and ask them for the 87mins or so of my life backbr br to me 1 out of 10 is too high its too bad that there isnt a 0 zero or even negative integers to place on a movie herebr br in other words this movie is junk would rather watch paint dry and deal with explosive diarrhea then have to watch this movie ever again i would be the first person that would use not only the packaging of this movie as kindling but i would be up for a goodol movie and script burning
