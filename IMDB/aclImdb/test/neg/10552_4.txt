there were nice characters in here played by pleasantlooking actors and actresses plus it had a famous band and some famous dancersyet the film just didnt work by the time this was almost over i was bored to death the dialog was dumb the humor mainly milton berles was downright stupid and the music was just not up my alleybr br ive never been a bigband fan anyway and if i hear in the mood one more time ill pukebr br this was my first look at famous skateractor sonja henie and i have no complaints about her almost part of the problem at least with the humor is that its so dated it isnt funny anymore berle phil silvers bob hope red skeleton abbot  costello etc etc were hilarious to the crowds in the 40s and 50s but humor changes and what was funny back then is not today
