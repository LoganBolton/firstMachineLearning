this is an oftused line but it really sums up this movieif this is the current state of gay cinema then were in real trouble i saw this film at siff because of the high imdb rating 76 and if there was ever a case of vote stacking on imdb then this is it just watch the number fall over the release weeks of the filmbr br easy plotboy finds out his high school ex boyfriend is getting married to a female friend of theirs so he goes back to his old hometown still carrying a 10 year old torch to see what happenedbr br first off i liked latter days the directors last feature despite its cookie cutter characters and plot contrivances but youre supposed to become a better director with each subsequent release i dont know how you get horrible supporting performances out of so many tv veterans robert foxworth joanna cassidy tori spelling but somehow he managed to the writing was lifetime network quality way back when they were really bad and the situations were unbelievable and uncomfortably hard to watch i kept reaching for a nonexistent remote control to fast forward but ultimately made myself stay to the end hoping for a decent ending ughno even the gratuitous male nudity that popped up during the movie was so blatantly gratuitous that it seemed to be there to keep people in their seats br br to be fairthe 2 leads especially in the gratuitous nude scenes were gorgeous there was also a real sweetness between them during their rekindling friendship as they uncovered how they went separate ways and the film looked greatgood quality and color saturation for an independent filmbr br how is it that network tv can give week after week of great entertaining weekly episodes like ugly betty desp housewives etc but so many feature releases in similar genres can be as bad as this
