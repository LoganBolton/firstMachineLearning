as a fan of cjs earlier movie latter days i really wanted to like this filmbr br the nicest thing i can say however is that its not an awful film there are some good performances and a few funny scenes in particular tori spelling has a couple of great scenes where shes talking to her fiancés exboyfriendbr br overall though its pretty week the script falls back on weird coincidences and clichéd movie moments way too often the main character went to stanford on a golf scholarship and his high school buddy doesnt even know that he plays the game br br most of the time this movie had no idea where it was going or what it was trying to say there are a lot of scenes that are mildly cute but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time and you could easily cut half the characters from the film without losing anythingbr br still for all its faults i would have to say that this is one of the better gay films of recent years which says a lot about how bad most gay films arebr br im hoping cjs next film will be better
