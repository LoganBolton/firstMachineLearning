how did so many talented or at least charismatic actors wind up in this baloney nothing is very good about this movie but the worst things probably are the screenplay and the directingbr br apparently this is director damian niemans heartpiece as hes both written and directed it and acted in as well hes a card magician himself and seems to have named characters in homage of other famous magicians this was his first feature film as far as i know and chances are its his lastbr br its hard to point to exactly what makes it so poor  but id say the story and characters are not believable the screenplay and the directing doesnt give it any boost the director plus  the poker scenes are bad in the worst hollywood manner superhands hollywood rules the supposed twists in the movie are either totally predictable or totally unbelievable they just end up tying a knot to a story that at best can be described as a few decent scenes
