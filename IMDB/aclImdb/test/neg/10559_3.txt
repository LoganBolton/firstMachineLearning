shade tries hard to be another sting substituting poker for horse racing as the means by which to bring down an enemy but it fails miserablybr br i watched the whole thing and still never could quite understand why the young kid wanted to doublecross his partner was it because his partner stole his girl is there a woman in the world who is worth going to that much trouble over if there is it certainly wasnt this shrew she had no redeeming qualities whatsoever and really now did she actually have a special room set up so that a surgeon could remove the kidney from whoever tried to pick her up in a bar dina merrill makes a short appearance as a rich woman who hosts of all things paytherent poker parties at her palatial home and then the players say things like ill see your thousand and raise you another five thousand give me a break you cant call see and raise you do one or the other any kid playing for nickels and dimes at the kitchen table knows this youd think grown men playing for stakes this high  or at least the knuckleheads who wrote the script  would know it toobr br one of the other posters mentioned how no highlimit poker game would allow players to actually deal their own cards and i agree you dont allow two of the bestknown car cheats into a game where the buyin is 250000 and then let them deal to each other thats not poker thats just seeing which one can cheat better and id like to know what person in his right mind would buy in to a game in which two of the bestknown card cheats are playing and expect that he might have a chance at winning and most of all what mafia boss would run such a game every time melanie griffith came on the screen i was so mesmerized by those gigantic fluorescent red lips of hers that i completely lost the storyline and seeing her and stallone together was more like a public service announcement for plastic surgery gone wrong than a love connection stallone mentions that she used to be a grifter before she bought the restaurant she now runs but we dont know what kind of grifter she was and we never see her working with stallone in their younger days so we are left to wonder if we even care that muchbr br jamie foxx is the best character in the whole movie but he gets killed off right off the bat and were left with cardboard cutouts who all sound like theyre reading their lines off a teleprompter just offcamerabr br the ending makes no sense either the kid gets his cut from the game and just walks down the street with a briefcase full of money and his partner is nowhere to be seen the mafia isnt watching every move he makes everyone else just shrugs their shoulders and quietly accepts the loss of millions of dollars without trying to recoup any of it i dont think sobr br most of all this movie does a great injustice to professional poker players all over the world insinuating that the only way to win is by palming cards and playing with juiced decks and why is it theyre always palming kings and aces sometimes you need a three or a nine to fill a straight or full housebr br the best parts of the whole film are the sleightofhand tricks during the beginning and ending credits everything in between is ridiculous
