if you want to truly experience the magic  of don dohler then check out alien factor or maybe fiend but not this alien factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and its fairly creepy but nightbeast which i guess is sort of an updating of alien factor is just plain dumb actors sleepwalk through their roles especially mr monotone sheriff and the monster is some dumb halloweenmask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative but kind of stupid looking critters from alien factor a spaceship crashes on earth and theres a critter inside of course who runs around vaporizing people and ripping off arms etc and he has a cool ray gun that he uses to vaporize people too until it gets shot out of his hand and thats really about it alien factor beats this mess hands down if you really want to see a good don dohler movie check that out instead and rip don dohler 12206
