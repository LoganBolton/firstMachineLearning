an hulking alien beastie crashlands on earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun to dissolve into dust almost every human he catches sight off that is when his aim isnt terribly off and later his bare claws with which he likes to rip out and eat human spleen br br all in all its pretty silly stuff i do have to give it some points for being somewhat fun at times i actually enjoyed the mindless ray gun battle at the beginning and some of the later over the top gore effects however it doesnt help when the monster provides the movies only truly entertaining moments and he isnt on screen for a large portion of the films running time the acting throughout this is just plain awful and amateurish and our lead hero sheriff cinder is much too unattractive to be bagging the films hottest chick i also have to take off points for blatantly copying the thing from another world 1951 on several occasions when the monster isnt on a rampage nightbeast is far too dull and eventually his attacks become so repetitive and predictable even they become less fun watch this one back to back with the 1951 thing and see the difference characterization attention to plot and detail and creating suspense makes to a monster on the loose movie
