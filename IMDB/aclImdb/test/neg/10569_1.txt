it is terrible it is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and 30 and told them to make a film even then youd get a better and more professional film than this the story is so dumb you can say there isnt one i dont think the guy who made this knew what to do at all  watching foreign art movies all day long isnt enough to make somebody an instant director the acting is very bad really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful the only scene i didnt hate was the one with the caravan accident but even that only means it was just slightly less horrible than the rest of the film how do people get finance for this stuff i dont mind alternative films but shouldnt they at least not be a big steaming pile of cow manure i would call price of milk amateurish if it wasnt an insult to amateurs this would not even be a good film if you were drunk or drugged
