this movie is somehow showing 62 stars it seems inconceivable that the director has that many relations i am at a loss to explain thisbr br avoid this movie at all costs you have only a certain number of hours on the earth dont waste 112 of them on this retarded steaming heap of guanobr br there is no story as apparently the director wrote and im guessing with a blunt orange crayon the next days script at the completion of the days shooting the story has been called whimsical no it is aimless there is maybe enough story to fill a commercial dont you hate adsbr br now while both leads can act they obviously decided not to here and similarly the writerdirector can actually both write and direct as evidenced by his next work toy love br br so to recap even if you get this movie for free even if youre paid to watch it avoid itbr br to paraphrase monty pythons search for the holy grail run flee
