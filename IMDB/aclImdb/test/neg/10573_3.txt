i thought this would be funny i did i dont know what happened but i think a lot of the problem unfortunately falls with the casting i dont know who this kid is he could be a very nice person but he wasnt right for this movie and the supporting cast was great which only makes it more obvious for example there would be a scene with him and his love interest and your mind just starts to wander off but then keith david starts speaking or leslie nielsen or marion ross and its like someone turned a light on and suddenly you can pay attention again and you think it might not be that bad but when they get back to the main characters the lights go out again br br the spoofing material available in the superhero genre is plentiful so the fact that most of the jokes were basically a fart makes you wonder who wrote this thing i mean it had a couple of funny bits as i do remember laughing a couple of times but right now i dont remember why and it was only a few days agobr br really im giving it a take it or leave it rating but i think most people should just leave it
