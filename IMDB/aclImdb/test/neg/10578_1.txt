i went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night im 20 years old and this movie was way too much for me i couldnt imagine taking a teenager preteen or especially a child to this movie it was crude and offensive i was totally misled by its pg13 rating and the previews that i had seen for it i had originally seen previews for it on nickelodeon and i thought that it looked pretty cute maybe i just dont remember the preview correctly  plus drake bell the movies main character stars on a nickelodeon television show that targets preteens and young teenagers i really didnt think that the movies content would be as risky as it was i should have done more research about it before i went however im hoping that parents will read up on this movie before they take their kids to see it just because it has drake bell in itbr br seriously do not take your kids or teenagers to see this movie the rating should have been r there are tons of sexual references drug references and disturbing events throughout the movie examples drake bell gets attacked by sexually charged animals several scenes that involve men grabbing womens breasts lots of profanity drake bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla frosting or something like that people get stabbed hit and hurt in the movie and an elderly lady and her dog get shredded there are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie it was really demeaning to women in general the movie is by the people that made the scary movie series so that should tell you something right there please remember that seeing movies like this can give kids and teenagers all kinds of wrong ideas about sex drugs and violence most children and teenagers cant decipher between spoofs or comedy and realitybr br i do have a sense of humor i also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its genre but i find the possibility of children and teenagers going to see this movie horrifyingbr br as for the overall quality of the movie i didnt think it was that original or funny it dragged in parts and some of the humor was just forced and painful the acting wasnt too bad considering how bad the script was if youre an adult or older teen looking for a funny movie skip this one or rent it
