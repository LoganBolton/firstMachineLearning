scary movie 14 epic movie date movie meet the spartans not another teen movie and another gay movie making superhero movie the eleventh in a series that single handily ruined the parody genre now ill admit it i have a soft spot for classics such as airplane and the naked gun but you know youve milked a franchise so bad when you can see the gags a mile off in fact the only thing that might really temp you into going to see this disaster is the incredibly funny but massive sellout leslie neilsonbr br you can tell he needs the money wither that or he intends to go down with the ship like a good capitan would in no way is he bringing down this genre but hell hes not helping it but if i feel sorry for anybody in this film its decent actor drake bell who is put through an immense amount of embarrassment the people who are put through the largest amount of torture by far however is the audience forced to sit through 90 minutes of laughless bile no funnier than herpesbr br after spoofing disaster films in airplane police shows in the naked gun and hollywood horrors in scary movie 3 and 4 producer david zucker sets his satirical sights on the superhero genre with this anarchic comedy lampooning everything from spiderman to xmen and superman returnsbr br shortly after being bitten by a genetically altered dragonfly highschool outcast rick riker drake bell begins to experience a startling transformation now ricks skin is as strong as steel and he possesses the strength of ten men determined to use his newfound powers to fight crime rick creates a special costume and assumes the identity of the dragonfly  a fearless crime fighter dedicated to keeping the streets safe for lawabiding citizensbr br but every superhero needs a nemesis and after lou landers christopher mcdonald is caught in the middle of an experiment gone horribly awry he develops the power to leech the life force out of anyone he meets and becomes the villainous hourglass intent on achieving immortality the hourglass attempts to gather as much life force as possible as the noble dragonfly sets out to take down his archenemy and realize his destiny as a true hero craig mazin writes and directs this lowflying spoofbr br featuring tracy morgan pamela anderson leslie nielsen marion ross jeffrey tambor and regina hallbr br hell superhero movie may earn some merit in the fact that its a hell of a lot better than meet the spartans and epic movie but with great responsibility comes one of the worst outings of 2008 to date laughless but a little less irritating than meet the spartans and in the same sense much more forgettable than meet the spartans but maybe thats a good reason there are still some of us trying to scrape away the stain that was meet the spartans from our memorybr br my final verdict avoid unless youre one of thoses people who enjoy such car crash cinema as bad as date movie and scary movie 2 but not quite as bad as meet the spartans or epic movie super villain
