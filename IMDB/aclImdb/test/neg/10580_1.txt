i happened to rent this movie with my sister in hopes of watching a great entertaining movie that was humorous however my expectations were let down this movie was beyond disgusting and revolting for a pg13 movie this should have been rated r for the many mature references that went on in this movie i wouldnt recommend allowing a 13 year old teen see thisbr br even if no one under the age of 17 is watching this movie beware of a truly stupid movie theres no humor in the movie just a bunch of disgusting sexual references including a small touch of pedophilia something that shouldnt even be joked about br br i would like to know what happened to pg13 movies that were actually safe for actual a 13 year old this is beyond a deplorable movie and should be rerated
