heres a spoof thats guaranteed to entertain folks in the iq range of homer simpson its a cheap shot at every great superhero notably spiderman and batman but it doesnt end there it gets progressively worse until it disintegrates into a pathetic ensemble of slapstick trollop by the truckloadbr br for those interested in the plot youve only to watch spiderman while under the influence of some heavy narcotic what you get is dragonfly man Â– a boy wonder who loves the girl next door suddenly inheriting some stupendous superpowersbr br the rest of the script is as predictable as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth but dont take my word for it for kids this is somewhat amusing for adults its a great film to drop the kids off for
