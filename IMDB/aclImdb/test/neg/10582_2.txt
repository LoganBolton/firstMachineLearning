superhero movie 2008 is the most recent in the long line over parody movie movies which i despise so much i wish this movie could be the death of the genre but i know that it isnt awful enough to put the final nail in the coffinbr br if meet the spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as hollywood movies go than superhero movie is probably near the top unfortunately meet the spartans was actually miles below the barrel and this movie just barely makes it inbr br superhero movie has a decent cast of clist celebs its got drake bell the kid from disneys drake and josh leslie nielson airplane tracy morgan snl and 30 rock and a few others scattered throughout although it has the star power to light a 40watt bulb the movie fails to utilize any humorbr br this movie is about 80 minutes long most of which is dedicated to following the spiderman plot and not one single joke is funny i didnt laugh or chuckle or smirk the entire timebr br dont see this movie dont even think about it for the love of cinema just skip it and maybe they wont come out with another onebr br oh who am i kidding theyll probably come out with another one by fall
