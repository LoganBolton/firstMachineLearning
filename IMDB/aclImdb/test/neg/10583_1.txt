the movie starts with a spiderman spoof which is your introduction to rick riker played by drake bell of drake  josh fame personally id have given the movie to josh who is much funnier and the rick punchers joke is lifted right out of airplane so the writers were obviously already scraping the barrel for ideas for this film ricks class is on a science trip to the amalgamated genetics lab and this is where we get to meet the 1st star name in the film brent spiner data in star trek tng playing dr strom rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly which is where his powers come frombr br we meet our next big star names at ricks home his aunt lucille marion ross of happy days fame  uncle albert leslie nielson of airplane police squad  naked gun fame and were introduced to carlson on the amalgamated board of directors dan castellaneta from the simpsons who is then very promptly killed were told rick has slept for 5 days  get some cheap crappy sexually orientated scenes designed to get the teen male audience paying attention the stephen hawking lookalikes scene is painful to watch and is really a bad idea that doesnt work and isnt remotely funnybr br we get another spiderman spoof rick catching the girl and all the planets but the movie should end right there as jill was hit in the head by a falling bowling ball which would have broken her skull and killed her stone dead you get to see ricks 1st powers emerge gripping ability  speed then his 1st rescue which goes very wrong we also get an incest reference which is in very poor taste indeed we get a flashback and a batman spoof in which we discover rick is solely responsible for the death of his parents spoofing spiderman again ricks uncle is shot with jeffrey tambor from hellboy playing the hospital doctor we then get an xmen spoof done very badly as patrick stewart is about as white as they come barry bonds is played by yet another lookalikebr br we meet invisible girl played by pamela anderson looking stunning in her costume ricks 1st outing in his costume once he fixes his ability to see  breath through it is another batman spoof the tom cruise youtube interview clip is played by yet another lookalike and not a very good one at that there are lots of modern references like youtube facebook  wikipedia all showing that the movie is set in modern day theres a very weak gay joke never a good idea to do those either when jill is helping aunt lucille make thanksgiving dinner and the pissing scene isnt very funny just infantilebr br the aunt farting scene isnt particularly funny just incredibly childish anyone finding it funny must have a mental age of about 12 shes killed and then we have a really bad necrophilia joke is there no topic these people wont try to use to get a cheap laugh out of at her funeral and the even worse cremation jokebr br we get the 2 worst lookalikes in the whole movie prince charles  nelson mandela at the awards ceremony and if you didnt already know how infantile or stupidly lowbrow this movie is landers wins the douchebag of the year award landers is revealed as the hourglass in a really bad scene where the same girl manages to run past jill twice in the same directionbr br obviously the hourglass is foiled jill is rescued from certain death and the only funny scene in the whole movie is the final one
