well you know rutger hauer and robert patrick both are really good actors but wtf with this movie the story was lame and the script was just terrible the poor actors didnt have material to work withbr br the dvd cover invited you to a flight action flick you would expect something like top gun huge disappointment the flight action in this movie is so cheap that makes you puke the aerial scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other footage sources not made for this movie and they didnt even care about the marks or the fighters models taking for granted the audience will not notice itbr br as i said the story was lame with a little effort from the writer and director it could have been very interesting in short it seems a bmovie made in the 70sbr br i feel very sorry for these actors who put their names here they sure must be ashamed
