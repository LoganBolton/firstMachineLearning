i had the misfortune to watch this last night on the bbc i expect i may have been the only viewer from the beginning there was something quite wrong about the movie after a few minutes of viewing i managed to work out what it was the movie was bad not bad in a good way like wolfpack or a seagal film just plain old shoddy badbr br why was this made into a movie ive seen a few episodes of the tv series and thought it was alright but i only saw repeats of that because they made thisbr br i spent most of the film trying to work out what the story was and by the end i was none the wiser i seem to remember at some point a character maybe farinas mentions that the mod squad can get in to places regular cops cant the place turns out to be a club one of the toughest places to get into maybe it was student night i lost track of the plot at this point or maybe there was no plot and the movie was just chopped together from various leftovers from other tv series remakesbr br was it an action comedy i dont remember any laughsbr br overall this movie lacked the real scene stealing power of someone like seymour hoffman as the bad guy with him ribisi would have had somebody to bounce off
