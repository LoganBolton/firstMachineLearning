the mod squad isnt a movie its a void thats the most fascinating thing about it and the thing that kept me watching  id never seen a film that offered absolutely nothing before its a film without any reason to exist whatsoever seemingly consciously designed to appeal to noone as if made purely as a contractual obligation to someone the studio really dislike there is no plot there is no characterisation there are no set piece action scenes there arent even any scenes as such just a progression of increasingly empty shots projected at 24 frames per second im not talking about empty as in dumb summer blockbuster but empty as in we havent got the pages yet so just point the camera at something and stop when youve got 90 minutes worth it makes you appreciate the artistic achievements of charlies angels and swat that much more what it does offer is far too much of giovanni ribisi at his most tediously execrable doing his bastard son of a thousand morons impersonating marlon brando method acting routine michael lerner dancing with omar epps and no thats it oh clare danes has a nice smile in one shot and dennis farina has the sense to get killed off early genuinely the most utterly pointless film ever made its like lhumanite without the jokes but you know for kids
