i was not old enough to really appreciate the original mod squad but i knew everyone thought it was cool i have some of the books that were written based on the series in my screentoprint collection and theyre pretty light duty so i didnt expect much from the movie thats a good thing because this movie was bad on a long leash br br i admire the risk in creating a movie that is so completely true to the 1960s hit the movie audience though has gained sophistication in 30 years at least i think so i certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original mod squad concept with now old car chases now considered poor camera work tinny sounding soundtrack and poor script and all on the big screen in the 1960s we didnt care as much because we had minimal expectations an integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough it was that another thrilling episode of ironsides or passwordbr br rating this episode against usual theatre releases the story waswell im not sure i should even say because im not sure there was one drugs are bad whatever the script was silly when the characters are exchanging dialog and advancing the plot with lines like i overheard him say so on the phone and i think i got a plan we really are in trouble no wonder the acting was dreadful no one knew how to say such idiotic linesbr br if i were claire danes id be going after my agent with a flamethrower right now actually i think everyone in and watching the film has a right to seek retributionbr br and where was the mod in that squad i realize these kids just got out of juvenile hall but no one had a velvet suit mod only meant young and integrated what happened to white gogo boots perhaps the costume department was going for gritty but all they got was dirty and dingybr br since the movie was completely true to the original series and required special behavior from the actors cameramen stunt men etc we should appreciate it more unfortunately i still dont like it if i wanted to watch 60s crime drama id buy dvds no thanks
