the movie was slow the dialogue between actorsactresses felt flat and basically there was no development of the characters in the storybr br omar epps skulks around with a mad look on his face the entire time pouting and basically looking annoyed with everybody danes has no onscreen magic and ribisis character is a goober that nobody would want to hang out with even if they were paid to do sobr br throw in the weird scene where epps has to dance with an old man and you have what quite possibly could be the worst movie in cinema historybr br i watched it on satellite thank goodness i didnt pay for it and wished i hadntbr br do yourself a favor and go sort your underwear and socks drawer if you need something to do but are tempted to watch this movie whenif it comes on your tv awful movie if you ask me and i generally have something good to say about just about any movie out there
