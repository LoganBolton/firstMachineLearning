well this movie shows us that mark griffiths and producers think we all are idiots if not how should we understand thisbr br american pilots take off on mig29s suddenly all aircrafts turn to f16s ha a magic after an action migs land the magic againbr br oh did i mention that f16s had israel markings br br another magic obviously unarmed l39 trainers are bombing enemiesbr br and more magic while all movie is situated in europe we can see a desert in almost any flying scenebr br maybe the director wasted all his magic on things above because action scenes are incredibly chaotic and also explosions look awfully as if pilots bombarded with molotovsbr br ok ok this is a movie i should write about its story wait a story yes there is some story in this film and its horrible as well
