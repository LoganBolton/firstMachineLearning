possible spoilers three young people on the wrong side of the law are given a chance to turn their lives around and become useful members of society by becoming undercover cops in the mod squad a resurrection of the hit television series of the Â‘60s directed by scott silver given their less than stellar backgrounds and because of who they are and the people they know julie barnes claire danes pete cochran giovanni ribisi and lincoln hayes omar epps can go places other cops cant so they are tapped by captain adam greer dennis farina to infiltrate a seedy night spot suspected of being a front for a prostitution ring for a start julie gets a job there as a waitress while pete and linc just hang out to find out what they may julie quickly becomes reacquainted with an old boyfriend billy waites josh brolin who turns out to be involved with drugs which are tied in to the shady dealings going down at the bar before its over the squad is in it up to their necks while also running afoul of a bunch of wrong cops who are also involved with the drugs and consequently tied in with their investigation from the beginning of the movie there is a sense that you are coming in late as if its presupposed that you know whats going on as far as the origin and workings of the squad all you get here are brief mugshot bios of the three that give you nothing more than a glimpse into their past theres nothing about how this all actually came about the thinking was probably that by doing it this way it would lead into the story quicker get things moving along while this is true to a certain extent some added background would have made the texture of the story a bit more interesting the way it was done here merely depreciates the credibility of the entire proceedings the plot is marginal to begin with and any time spent on character development would have been well worth the while whats delivered and quite unimaginatively at that is a less than compelling story filled with one dimensional characters the performances are satisfactory but the actors get no help from the script nor apparently from silver danes ribisi and epps come close to fleshing out julie pete and linc but given the time allotted them combined with the lack of support they still fall way short of giving these people life farina a good actor who deserves better than what he gets here comes off as nothing more than a caricature of the good cop theres a feeling that everything was given the onceover in this film some detail and nuance would have driven the stock up considerably on this one the supporting cast includes richard jenkins detective mothershed steve harris briggs larry brandenburg eckford lionel mark smith lanier and sam mcmurray tricky its a shame to see the acting talent involved here wasted like this a lot more thought and planning should have gone into the making of this movie as it is it comes across as illconceived and poorly executed danes ribisi and epps are like major leaguers who got stuck playing for all the marbles at the local sandlot instead of getting a shot at the title they all got hung out to dry like terry says in on the waterfront you was my brother charlie you shoulda been looking out for me well its obvious that there was no charlie to look out for them here and after the mod squad they can all just hope for something better to come along the next time i rate this one 110
