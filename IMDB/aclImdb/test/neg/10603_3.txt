i really wanted to like this movie but i just couldnt it had the potential to be a really cool hip remake of a cool show but thats where it fell apart it was too hip too cool first of all all the cool lines and scenes were showcased in the preview trailers which id seen lots of times and the editing was very disjointed so that the scenes didnt seem to flow together and they all seemed out of place claire danes who i love as an actress failed to make this her break through to the beyond high school acting roles the only bright spot was giovanni ribisi as pete his slightly stupid yet actually smart style was funny and refreshing overall though id recommend just watching the previews instead of seeing the movie and wishing it was more
