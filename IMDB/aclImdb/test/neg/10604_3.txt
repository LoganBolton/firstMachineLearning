this is an astonishingly bad action film id say its primary flaw is that its boring arghh funky wardrobes retro chic set design and decent cinematography cannot prevent this flick from being a snoozer mod squads second major flaw is its lack of character developmentunderscored by the actors lack of talent i tend to like claire daness work so i was quite surprised by her nonexistent performance in this film giovanni ribisi is woefully miscast how could his cottonmouthed bumbling acting style possibly fit into an action flick as for omar epps well he needs to take a few acting lesson to learn how to emote the man had the same facial expression for the entire film my suggestion is to save yourself a few bucks and wait to see this turkey on cable
