ok number onethis film is a 90s version of a crappy show from the 70s that no one remembers number twoas soon as the movie started i was confused it was like i walked in halfway through the movie there was no plot it was very annoying horrible wardrobe call me crazy but its just not believable to me that little skinny omar epps can chase down a big grown man without a gun and scare him into talking its a ridiculous plot im sorry but to me kids these days cant even put their pants on one leg at a time let alone catch some evil underground killers i walked out of the theater and demanded and got my money back i do not reccomend this movie to anyone over 12 years old
