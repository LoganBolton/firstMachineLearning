being a fan of the series i thought how bad can the movie be well i got my answer some movies should never be made why call it a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters the pete character in the series wasnt a whiney little baby as portrayed in the movie the only good thing in this movie besides the music and that clare danes is pretty was that it was short whats with that dance scene the only reason i didnt walk out of this film was because it was so bad it got funny maybe that was the plan its really bad when a cheap 60s tv show is better then a 90s 20 million dollar film el mariachi cost only 7000 and is a much better film dont even waste your money when it comes out on tape its not even worth renting
