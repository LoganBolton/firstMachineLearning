so its friday night and you want to go watch a movieall you want is something entertaining not too artsy or anything that might require a long night of philosophical discussions so you pay 10 to watch the mod squad the trailer to this movie should have tipped me off but come onits three of hollywoods most beautiful peopleeye candy but thats about ita string of moving prada ads and what did hollywood producers forget a plot why are these kids running around the streets after some unknown enemy where are they but dont worry after a while youll just stop caring i was on the verge of walking out of this movie because i thought sitting in my room and staring at the wall might have been more productive and free but by that time it was over 90 minutesits only saving grace so still willing to waste 10 go get yourself a nice hot meal
