well the name in the summary should tell you everything fred olen ray  the modern king of low budget flicks be it for tv or direct to video i doubt he produces for the silver screen anymore  with the death of drivein bmovie double features and allbr br creator of such cult classics like hollywood chainsaw hookers and dinosaur islandbr br well i kind of like this guys stuff its mostly entertaining in a distinctly cheesy campy and especially cheap kind of way and if hes one thing hes a pro  something you cant say for all guys in the movie bizbr br but this one flick here is among the weaker ones in his oevre insipid acting an uninspired script and lame jokes conspire to make your brain go numb in a matter of minutes if you are out for real for goodness or rather badness look out for the above mentioned ones and generally his stuff from the 70s and 80s i think he lost a bit of his edge lately
