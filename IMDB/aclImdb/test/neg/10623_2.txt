when i borrowed this movie i wasnt expecting a highquality performance but this was just sadbr br most of the acting was so unbelievably bad that you couldnt easily get into this movie if you tried theres nothing quite like seeing a kid announce things like oh no my dad is invisible or i wonder what this does in the same monotone that one might announce traffic advisories over the radio with there are some good actors but they are wasted on smaller partsbr br the story is decent though it would be fairly easy to guess considering that there arent too many real plot changes lots of holes too for example the dad is invisible and the inventor figures out what part is needed to make him visible again so the boy goes and steals the part from an electronics store couldnt he just ask his dad for the cashbr br this shows up in the comedy category but most of the comedy in this movie was fairly dumb like the invisible dad taking off his clothes while invisible and then almost reappearing naked during a meeting or walking around with his head covered at all times funny at first but it gets oldbr br 25 because it is watchable and its one of those movies that are funny in their own way like the monotone recitation of lines
