how could a film dealing with illegal mexican immigrants being robbed and beaten over the border be dull well border incident isbr br no wonder that song and dance man george murphys career ended not long after this terrible film came out politics was certainly a way out for this future senator who dies a horrible death in this slowly paced film the film stereotypes the typical mexican migrant farmer worker as dimwitted and awfully dullbr br the film only picks up in intensity once the identities of murphy and ricardo montalban have been discovered as federal agents for the us and mexico respectivelybr br disappointing at best we see similar problems in our very own society today
