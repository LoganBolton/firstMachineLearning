i just saw this on tcm tonight and was shocked at the overacting by jean arthur her bugging her eyes out in surprise and just generally overdoing everything was not in the same style as dietrich and art lund dietrich was marvelous in her restraint and comic timing she being the best thing in this movie the wilder gags were flat and frankly more like something a freshman in college would write trying to get away wbeing wickedwitty and dirty but just sounded boring and not funny at all it seemed the humor was being pushed too hard to be funny the ending was totally contrived br br spoiler ahead never for a moment did i believe that art lund suddenly fell outta love wdietrich and then was suddenly madly in love warthur oh billy get real 3 out of 10
