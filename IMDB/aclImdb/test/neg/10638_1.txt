this movie is so bad and hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great nothing is good bloodline a lot of gore but without meaning and the majority of time without originality the movie is about the past the present 1996 and the future of the puzzle box the creator of the box and his offspring fight against some demon but nothing link up seriously the 3 stories pinhead is in the moviebut it isnt pinhead he is just a boring bad guy who kidnap kids and kill bird and the worsehe talk too much a thing that i really didnt understand is why the dog from hell he cant be a cenobites because he had nothing human why the dog can be killed by the pressure if the other creature from hell can receive bullets without problems bloodline is incoherent with the movie series in many ways for example pinhead and angelique are old friend in this movie but its impossible that pinhead met angelique because pinhead is just a soldier from the first world war and angelique is an old demon and she live in paris since sometimes like 200 years
