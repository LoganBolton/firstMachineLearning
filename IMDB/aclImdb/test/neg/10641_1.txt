its true no one really expects anything from sequels but even by that low standard this is a terrible filmbr br essentially an anthology movie this fourth installment in the hellraiser saga tries to be an origins story and a windup to the entire series at the same time an ambitious idea but none of the cast is given enough screen time to do anything with their characters and rookie director yagher abandoned the film rather than give in to studio meddling the result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending unless youre an alan smithee fan avoid this one
