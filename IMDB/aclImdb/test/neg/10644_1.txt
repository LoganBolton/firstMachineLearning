hellraiser bloodline is only a soso film i believe its the fourth installment in the hellraiser seriesbr br i missed the beginning and all i remember from there was some topless women and a boxshape thing on a computer screen but using my wit and intelligence and the info button i soon found out that the villain pinhead was released from pandoras box which i believe is a gateway straight to hellbr br so anyways pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the toymakers family and thats about it oh and not to mention the random tortures of various people that cross his path yawnbr br what mainly happens in this film is that pinhead captures the kid and then unleashes the dog on his wife and then kills a random person then he husband comes along blah blah blah who cares why it fails is because hellraiser bloodline is too corny to be scary look at pinheads minion of creatures a cheesy dog that looks like its been turned inside out two men whose heads and bodies are connected together siamese twins in a horror film and some person who is supposed to be a princess of some sort i havent seen the previous films now look at the main villain his name is pinhead isnt that the name you call somebody when theyre stupid he has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers and he has blue skin i suppose he would make a decent villain if he didnt have such a corny name and a corny speech somewhere in the film two cops approach him and say dont make us put some pain on you pinhead replies pain how dare you use that word i am pain blah blah blah blah blah it sounds a bit cliché if you ask mebr br dont forget the final half of the movie the characters and audience get to experience more torture when pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum some person who we dont recognize maybe he was in the previous films i dont remember him in the beginning of the movie this scene is basically one thing played over and over again br br a guard goes to inspect a mysterious noisebr br some other guard oh no hes down i will go check on himby myselfbr br after he dies the same thing happens againbr br spoilers heres the thing i didnt get in the film pinhead is supposedly sent to oblivion at the end so how does he come back for another four films are they prequels why hasnt he died in the previous ones geez the makers need to come up with an idea for a different series end of spoilers hellraiser bloodline is gory and full of torture scenes but has little thrill or scare value just forget it bad special effects with badeverything else make this more of a snoozefest than a good horrorbr br good wellsome people may enjoy the topless women in the beginning plus pinheads voice is pretty cool i suppose if you like ultraviolence you might like this toobr br bad none of the reasons above make this a very good film the corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad and who names their villain pinheadbr br feel free to send me a private message regarding this comment
