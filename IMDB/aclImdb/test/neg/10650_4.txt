rarely seen a movie that deviates so much from the original premise and still remains more or less acceptablebloodline is a rather short which is a good thing in this case escapade that focuses on the mysterious hellraiser box who wanted it to be made and how it cast a spell on the entire bloodline of the man who eventually created it were introduced to 3 generations of the merchant family all played by bruce ramsey one in 18th century paris one in the present day and the last one in a future galaxy far far away opinions on this storyline may differ a loteither you think its very idiotic and farfetched ororiginal and dared the initial atmosphere and setting by clive barker has completely vanished yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling hellraiser bloodline contains quite a lot of exquisite slaughtering and the charismatic presence of pinhead doug bradley still is an extra horrorvalue pinhead  accompanied by a pet puppy this time  still knows how to killtoo bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly best aspects in this production are the newly introduced cenobites and the occult parisian portrait giant turnoffs are the weak script the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to barkers initial masterpiece br br although not highly memorable itself bloodline stands as the last watchable hellraiser film after this sequel the series went downhill completely so far 2 more sequels came out 2 more are still in process and neither of those is worth seeing hellraiserbloodline suffered from a lot of production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as alan smitheemeaning he doesnt want to be remembered as the director of it who could blame him
