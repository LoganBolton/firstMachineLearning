the characterization in this movie is among the worst ive ever encountered the dialogue is trite and clich√© to the point of extreme distraction none of the issues the characters face are developed at alltheyre merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point also the depiction of the chinese characters leaves a bit to be desiredi find it hard to believe that the chinese father learns flawless english from a bookor so it is implied in one scene so he can teach it to his daughter etcbr br the smile train is a great organization and its a nice idea to make a heartstringtugging film about the impact a program like this can have on kids lives but overall i found this movie to be more frustrating than anything
