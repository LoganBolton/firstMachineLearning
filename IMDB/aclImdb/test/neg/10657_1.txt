without anything to walk away with this movie starts with scenes in china with the finding of a newborn while this is not a new concept i wasnt going to give up right there then there is a flash forward to adolescence the mans wife and biological child are fed up with the father who has neglected them while this did not seem culturally accurate and the movie made no move to develop these characters or the purpose for the adopted fathers devotion i pressed onbr br next were in malibu where we are bombarded by poorly constructed classroom interaction and terribly lowbudget fill in the blank actingcamera worklightingbr br i wont give away any more of the plot because i suppose the synopsis is accurate the movie is meant to show how a malibu girl who though she seems to innately have the compassion and interest to help others when she immediately asks her teacher about the trip to china is spoiled and inconsiderate finds herself as being a healer and helper of both body and spiritbr br lame lame lame lamebr br now i admittedly am a harsh critic so maybe take one of those lames away and youll be on the mark
