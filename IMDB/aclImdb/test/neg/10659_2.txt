the pace of this movie is quite slow it takes about 70 minutes to get katie to china which we know that she will and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up the storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes nothing surprises you i guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the topbr br katie  a beauty that realizes that looks boys and shopping isnt everything she realizes that she can feel and see the real world touchingbr br the mother  high strung nervous screaming mother wow very innovative that need taking care of by a strong manbr br the father  patient and always understanding and takes care of the incapable womanbr br the boyfriend that only wants to get into her pantsbr br the comedian clown chinese guy that doesnt know how to speak english properly and made a laughing stock thought hollywood dropped those characters in the mid fiftiesbr br the nurse that at times knows everything how to get around in china that in the next moment is a carbon copy of the mother ie a woman who cant handle the situation or knows anythingbr br the deformed chinese girl that with the help of us westerns get help and become a beautiful girl because in china a third world country according to the film dont have anything and hence needs our charity gah wake up and smell what you are shovelingbr br sure that there are some poverty in china but the portrayal of the aid from western countries read usa is so shallow and happy endingish that it is sad and revolting shanghai where the movie is set is the most expanding and evolving city in the world at the momentbr br the chinese father that is so nice and goodhearted that in the end has one wish  to be a cowboy with a white hat br br the teacher sean astin that has this really heart ripping story not that he tells without feel why sean whybr br etc etc it is difficult to actually finding a real person in the entire moviebr br this is nothing but a feel good movie for americans below age 15 if you want to learn anything about the world watch eg hotel rwanda instead for a better life story or coming of age movie i suggest you watch the italian cinema paradiso that won the best foreign film academy reward some years backbr br the only nice thing in the movie were the small town sceneries that truly capture some not all of the beautiful chinese country side i have been there and seen some of it
