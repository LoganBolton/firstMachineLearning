i do not like himesh reshamiya i do not like his singing too but his songs are a craze in india especially among commoners now when he ventured to become an actor  that was a big joke what guts he has to reap as much as he can in his prime time i did never want to see this movie but one thing changed it the movie becoming a superduper hit after 2 weeks aap ka saroor has raked box office collection of 14 crores  compared to apne that has collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks if i can sit through apne and rajnikants absurd sivaji  i should give this movie also a try to understand what stuff this movie has got that made it such a big hit the story is about the real life singer himesh reshamiya hr who has gone to germany for a concert and falls in love with riya hansika motwani a german lawyer ruby mallika sherawat loves himesh now himesh is arrested for a murder the mission of himesh in last 40 minutes after he runs away from jail is to prove himself innocent and find the real murdererbr br let me say that himesh has nothing in him to become a hero he tries hard but fails miserably he is pathetic i was thinking what could have made the movie click so much let me find something positivebr br first the saving grace of the movie is the script till the point himesh runs away from the jail but after that the movie nose dives into unbearable stupid limits second the songs of the movie are good catchy crowd puller numbers third mallika sherawat  she looks gorgeous and acts well too as the second lady i can imagine fans of mallika coming to see the movie just for her fourth the cinematography of the movie is pleasing  especially the german locales are a treat to watch for the eye fifth the major portion of the story is a love story between himesh and riya  with clichéd dialogues that would probably connect to young crowd sixth the director prashant chadha has done a decent job in covering the pathetic acting skills of himesh as much as possible with shots that dont need himesh to act muchbr br the heroine hansika motwani looks like a small budget film heroine raj babbar is wasted in a small role overall the movie is a below averagebr br i was thinking throughout the movie  what if the same movie script was done with salmaan as the main lead i think it would have had been a much better affair may be then i would have given the movie 6 out of 10 but now stars 45 out of 10
