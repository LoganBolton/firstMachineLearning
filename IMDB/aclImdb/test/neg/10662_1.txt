 hr is what himesh is called in the movie i think he likes it too  its amazing how intelligent people talented even fall in to the same trapbr br i really like reshamiya its amazing what he has done no one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himselfbr br and i truly expected a great film  what with the budget of 50 cr and the cute actress  as intense as reshamiya is i thought he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role ironically he is depicted the same but for what care sheer incompetence carelessness awful acting banal background music insensitive direction make it a real painbr br blunders rule  ex how can german police issue public instructions on a loud speaker in english they communicate among themselves in english unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in main line bollywood there are some excellent directors but many a bad ones too the worse thing is that the majority just doesnt carebr br songs are the only saving gracebr br please dont repeat this hr and find yourself a good director  low budget no problembr br the villain should really have shaved his head instead of the wig you know after all its a 50cr movie
