agreed this movie is well shotbut it just makes no sense and no use as to how they made 2 hours seem like 3 just over a small love storybr br this could have been an episode of the bold and the beautiful or the ocin short please dont watch this movie because there is a song every 5 minutes just to wake you up from youre sleepi gave this movie 110 cause that was the lowestand no this is not based completely on a true storymore than half of it is made upi repeat the direction of photography is 7 or 8 out of 10but the movie is just a little too muchthe actors nasal voice just makes me want to go blow my noseunless you are a real him mesh fan this movie is a huge nono
