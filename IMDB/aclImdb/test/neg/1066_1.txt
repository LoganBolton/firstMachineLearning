i truly hate and despise this film and the filmmakers behind itbr br sure im all for making a hard hitting and honest film about youth and youth culture1987s rivers edge is an excellent example of a wellmade teen drama however what i take exception to is the infantile grubby and sensationalist approach that the makers of 237 tookbr br a prime example is how it raises so many issues and yet fails in any significant way to comment or reach a resolution on even one of thembr br my other major problem with this film apart from its complete plagiarism of gus van sants elephant surprised van sant didnt sue is its bull loose in a china shop attitude to quite delicate issues such as incest and particularly suicidebr br in short avoid this film like the plague and anything that this filmmaker ever is involved with subsequently ive heard that his motivation for making 237 may or may not be based on lies having seen the substandard result this doesnt surprise me in the slightest this is a glorified student film exercise that has no place whatsoever being in a cinema or on dvd pure and simple
