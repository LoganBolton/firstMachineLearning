first things first how can someone with his creativity on the right side believe in a movie like this i saw this movie and after end of couple of hours was left scratching my head what exactly is director trying to saybr br if its a thriller there are no thrills if its action there is no action barring a chase sequence there is no drama and the much touted love story it actually never takes off no passion emotion nothing is therebr br actually i never expected wonders from the movie however after the bumper opening it took i thought of giving it a chance i have no problems with himesh reshamiya whatsoever and i am not one of the guys who will bash him at every given opportunity i went in with an open mind and came out with a closed onebr br lets not put the blame of himesh reshamiya he is just a debutant actor but direction screenplay writing makeup everything has gone for a tossbr br himesh is very stiff and would take a lot of time to come up the curve he can do the don kind of roles hansika is just a kid and it shows on screen with her baby fat and the way she walksbr br the only actor who was good was the friend of himesh in the movie i dont know his name but he looks promisingbr br watch it at your own risk not even good to watch it for a time pass viewingbr br  strongly recommend to avoid this movie
