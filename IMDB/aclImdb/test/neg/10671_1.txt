i have to hold my hand up and say that i was one of the first and probably the last to see this film where do i start its a complete mess the main attraction of course was the soundtrack which goes without saying is brilliant  its what himesh does best but as they say dont give up your day job  hr definitely shouldntbr br hrs acting is plain and simply awful even if the film had a plot the thing that baffles you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there two words of advice to hr  give up acting and secondly use chapstickbr br hr has no screen presence no acting skills and the female lead looks just a little too young for him as for malika sherawat  just the same old bollywood vamp crap br br you can package the product as much as you want but if theres no substance it wont hold dont waste your money
