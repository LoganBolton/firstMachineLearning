ego seems its the only reason this movie was made this movie is so wrong in so many ways that its below ones dignity to write much about it every character was only good at self praise and lead actors i use this term liberally as has the director emote in the likeness of stone the little story if that fails on the basic aspects such as logic feeling and drama direction leaves much to be desired blatant flaws are all over the place character motives arent defined prospective husbands are found overnight broken car windows mend themselves among other thingsbr br lets face it himesh cant act neither it seems can hansika motwani in her defense shes still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of makeup raj babbar overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible darshan jariwala laughs a bit too much the actor who plays himeshs friend is the only natural br br a few questions do come to mind how can such a film cost rs500000000 where did the money go granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and mallika sherawat was paid an obscene rs15000000 for her 15 minute appearance and 2 songs but the sheer stupidity of the film boggles the mind including 3 mumbai auto rickshaws that show up and jump on a police carbr br the good himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark topi lets give the devil his due himesh as usual gives good musicbr br the bad direction story himeshs singing is still hard to ignorebr br the ugly dialogs and everything elsebr br final word painful in every sense of the word watch this movie only if you loved subhash ghais yaadein
