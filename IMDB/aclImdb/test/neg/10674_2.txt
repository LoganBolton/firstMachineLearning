well some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin kicking some ass if thats what you want and you wear a cloak file your teeth to points and think that the name lilith silver is cool youll see a fine filmbr br if like most people an assassin dressed in gleaming creaking rubber with huge cleavage thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh then this is one of the best comedies youll see i laughed so hard i nearly cried ridiculous acting dialogue and plotting help to make this a better spoof than dracula dead and loving it could bebr br it tries to be cool and goth and all it succeeds in doing is making each scene hilarious even the tackedon lesbian scene is funny how did she get those boots off that quickly they were laced up to herebr br dont see it if you like good films see it if you like terrible films and want to laugh until you fall over it isnt good its just bad
