the time i wasted seeing this movie i demand back i felt sick afterward but not because it touched me in any way its pretentious trying to get the audience to feel bad for the people involved but i couldnt care less the characters are soulless and stupid you dont get an explanation for some of the scenes and it doesnt leave any thoughts afterward to come up with your own explanation all of the students in the movie has issues but since you dont feel for them you dont believe their problemsbr br if i could write better in english id never stop but i cant so ill stop nowbr br dont watch this
