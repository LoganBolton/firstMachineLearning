i was all ready to hate this but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable  though the mtvstyle of filmmaking shot on dv to boot is quite an eyesore i liked the scripts selfmocking style as well as its central idea of having the female vampire lead doubling as a contract killer as to the cast eileen daly best known as the star of those horrid redemption intros has an undeniable screen presence  and is quite sensual despite her age however christopher adamsons hammy chief villain is obnoxious david warbeck has a brief role as a doctor dubbed the horrormovie man who conducts the autopsy on one of the vampires victims the film seems to have taken quite a long time to shoot as warbeck died in 1997 theres plenty of nudity and violence on hand but not much sense alas especially since its subplot involving a secret society of vampires infiltrating the power structures is barely developed the film is also overlong for its purpose and eventually slips into tedium during the last halfhour
