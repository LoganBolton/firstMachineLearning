i was permanently scarred by this terrible filmbr br the main action of the movie is nothing special it seems theres a tribe of snakeworshipping people in a remote mountain region of northern china where women rather than men are the leaders and decision makers i suppose among some men this is enough to make succubare a horror movie anyway occasionally chinese men would wander into the village take a fancy to the local girls seduce them and then abandon them unfortunately for the men the women had put them under a spell derived from snake venom which would make them die horribly in 100 days  their bellies swollen like a pregnant womans with live worms and snakes  if they did not returnbr br forget the cover of the us video this has nothing to do with vampires though there is one inept blooddrinking scene the title itself is only marginally appropriate succubare is the latin verb meaning to lie beneath and its the root of the word succubus a female demon who would seduce men in their sleep actually its the men who are the seducers herebr br but its not the main action of this ludicrous film thats so objectionable its the little sideincidents ill overlook the slaughter and butchery of an ox thats performed onscreen the participants seem very experienced as though this is an unpleasant duty they actually do in real life and im sure they really ate the animal afterwards though i resent having the act thrust in my face as entertainmentbr br what i wish i could overlook or had overlooked are the numerous totally extraneous shots of an unidentified man who from time to time interrupts the story by eating living animals he starts the movie by tearing apart a live snake with his teeth in the course of the movie he devours a bug a lizard a toad i had to leave the room after this and a whole mouse i stopped watching at this point and lost my appetite for days let me stress that this was totally unexpected and had nothing to do with the movie unless its a cynical reference to love as its portrayed in the film a blind selfish predatory survival mechanism that tears apart the helpless but then again im probably just rationalizing to get the vileness out of my head
