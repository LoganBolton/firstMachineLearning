given the budget and the inexperience of everyone involved livin tha life could have been worse jamal wants to be chris tucker whom ive always found very annoying as a previous commentator has noted but peanut edward d smith while some of his overreactions go on way too long a directors problem has some comparatively subtle and funny moments such as when he is trying to instruct jamal on the proper method of smoking a joint with a buddy throughout he is usually more poised and selfpossessed than jamal which could have been the germ of a nice exploration of the contrasts in the relationship but wasnt developed very farbr br but the inexperience of the writerdirectorcinematographeretc is no excuse for his inattention has he ever seen a movie faces are important has he ever heard of a closeup even ed wood could do a closeup i dont think its much of a budget issue i could only give a general description of what any of the actors look like and not just because of no closeups but the lighting  lights for outdoor shooting may cost too much but you can make a reflector with pieces of paper that would have required moving the camera closer to keep the reflector out of the shot helping to solve the closeup problem at the same time if thats too technical you can turn the actors around so they are not in shadow or you can expose for the shadows and if it hadnt been shot in la id say take advantage of cloudy days it goes without saying that the movies this one steals from are all with the possible exception of weekend at bernies better than this one but livin tha life would have left a much better impression if it hadnt made the viewer squint all the way through just to catch a glimpse of whatever the human element might have beenbr br ps the scene in the barbershop is just stupid
