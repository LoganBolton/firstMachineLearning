i was so looking forward to watching the documentary selfimmolation of the mastermind behind boondock saints one of the most aggravating and pointless movies ive ever seen but the makers of overnight  buddies ex of the mastermind in question  also need to learn how to make a movie various unsavoury remarks yelling obscenities into the phone and enjoying his alcohol do indeed make mr duffy look like a putz but it doesnt shed any insight into why the guy got a contract in the first place what his creative process or vision is  whats boondock saints even about how hard is it to meet patrick swayze what are these strange institutional machinations in which our disgusting heroes are caught because the film doesnt try to answer these questions in any coherent way it doesnt end up having dippitydoo to say about hollywood either so who cares
