this piece of crap is actually the bomb as in bottom of the barrel i cant figure out which is worst norris dull portrayal of anonymity not a great trait in an action protagonist or christopher neames hysterical overacting this film doesnt deliver on any level what so ever the action sequences are tame the plot is paper thin and the scenes that are supposed to be horrific look like a clich√© from the fifties you cant just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits and expect the audience to scream in terrorbr br visually the film does nothing for me it actually looks like an unfortunate mix between a cheap porn flick and a miami vice ripoff with a little sprinkling of hellspawn no wait that should have been hellyawn
