the plot  in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a ychromosometargeting virus a hot female genetic engineer creates a man in a chem lab  is intriguing despite the somewhat promising premise the movie falls flat in nearly every regard the dialogue is laughable the characters are paper thin the exploration of a singlegender world is shallow the worst part of the entire movie is the asian detective who delivers lines so cheesy and contrived that youll want to vomitbr br i cant imagine how on earth this trash got produced most of the movie is male bashing all men are violent all men rape women men are only animals all of the women  even the closet hetero cases  seem to display anger toward fear of and hatred for men if you want to see a scifi film something along the lines of this movies premise youd do best to look elsewhere
