they used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make it seem like these people were cheering for the gendercide of men the funny thing is you can see a man cheering on his own death in the backgroundbr br ok the plot some lady says there should be a society with no men and the crowd in front of her which contains some men think its a great idea so then all the men are killed or something so there are no morebr br then this blonde scientist creates a man but removes some chromosomes so he cant be violent the male grows very quickly and soon is a full grown man not long after he takes the blondes volkswagen beetle and drives into the city where hes discovered now you would think the lone man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest guy ever but no way the police chase himbr br i didnt watch the rest but it probably ends up that theyve got to race against the clock and some people or something bad will probably happen somehow the man ends up in a stadium with some other men who want him to lead the rebellion these brave warriors hiding in a stadium might have had some sort of plan which laid out the details of how theyd single handedly get rid of a planet full of women but i didnt watch and neither should youbr br if youre up late and channel surfing and this happens to come on dont watch watch anything but this youll find those ads for bowflex or the ones with women in bathing suits asking you to pick up the phone to meet women just like these in your area will be more satisfying entertainmentbr br oh yeah theres this funny thing when theyre pulling in with their cars i dont know what they did it looks like they drove in real slow and careful but then tried to speed up the film to compensate but it just looks really weird br br the blonde girl was kind of cute and im feeling generous so 210
