its a male bashing bonanza i saw this on scifi a while ago and the idea seemed interesting it could have been a good movie and the plot itself i dont see as male bashing but certain specific references to men get really annoying i might still watch the movie again though because it does at least try to redeem itself by hinting that maybe the women in the movie arent really as nonviolent as they claim but it still doesnt compensate for the really tiring malebashing i mean i can understand a little its part of the movies plot but come on it gets really tiring after awhile not only that but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept becoming homosexual that easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority as to go in the closet its just too unbelievable there are far too many women out there with cultural or religious restrictions that would balk at this it is totally implausible i mean i know its scifi and i love scifi but the best scifi has at least a hint of it being possible and this is too implausible the phrase truth is stranger than fiction came about because fiction has to at least seem plausible to be welcomed but truth isnt always this movie is not that other than that the movie does have some good acting and the eventual morals of the story that something like what happened was wrong do redeem it a little but not enough
