for three quarters of an hour the story gradually develops towards a pivotal point of some sort although it is overburdened with scenes that just seem to be intended to dull the viewer and lure him away from the actual plot there is something happening it is not much and it certainly is not obvious the combination of palace impressions and storydriving scenes do not add any depth or insight to the whole cast of characters in fact they keep them sterile as there is no character development at all everybody just remains spinning and centered around their own cliché and role  the cute kinda headstrong girl the fighting überwoman the snobby aristocrat the male lead does not seem to have any distinction at all he is a shallow presence which actually doesnt even matter as he is only there because the storyboard required him to  it seemed like he was on vacation and got caught up when the point comes of turning the corner in terms of what happening the movie first snaps completely blank for a couple of minutes and then becomes ridiculous it solves  or better dissolves  itself with a bythebook deus ex machina more clichés and some of the most crude plot devices and choices i have ever seen its history alright first the movies a drama though its supposed to be comedic and then it turns into a farce the protagonists do what they are expected to do and there are no surprises the first set of somewhat serious antagonists however gets replaced by a couple that literally was just bored maybe that was some kind of nod towards the audiencebr br this movie does not get any bonus from me for underlying philosophical meaning since there is none nor for its technical realization the animation and editing is fair and sos the sound mixing but it is by no means outstanding or even above the average japanese productions of the late 1980s in fact the visual treats seem static uninspired and unoriginalbr br worst of all  it totally fails to entertain even if you dont bother with characters and all that stuff theres too little going on here and the rest is corny at best get a real ghibli instead have a feast with it and keep your fingers off this one
