jim carrey is a particular brand of humour and i personally think hes a great actor eternal sunshine for examplebr br however this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a jim carrey vehicle so be aware straight off that if you dont think his style of comedy is funny you will sit stonyfaced throughout this film as it has nothing else to recommend itbr br even if you do like carreys comedy i am not sure you will find this film amusing i went to see it on a saturday night at 1030pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh they giggled throughout the trailers which werent particularly funny but when it came to the film stony silence i think it raised about five genuine laughsbr br the problem with the movie is it doesnt know what it wants to be it cant make up its mind whether its going for slapstick or serious if it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but im guessing its also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central charactersbr br the strong point of the film is the holdups and there was plenty of potential here but these didnt start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped meanwhile you have to sit through the first excruciating 40 minutes as the couples life deterioratesbr br four separate groups walked out of this film while i was there and if my flatmate hadnt asked me to keep away from the house his girlfriend having just returned from a monthlong vacation i would have done the same and in my entire 25 years of movie going i have done that just once before
