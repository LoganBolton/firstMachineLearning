dick and jane harper jim carrey téa leoni wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find jobs the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of povertybr br ive always been a fan of jim carrey its been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy the last one was bruce almighty which was pretty good he has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element fun with dick and jane proves that he still has it even though the film was funny it was still kind of disappointing it wasnt as funny as i thought it would be its worth watching once though unlike most of carreys movies it doesnt have a good repeat value part of the problem is the script i was surprised the script was weak since this is the same guy that made the forty year old virgin some of the jokes just fall flat and other times they seem to be trying too hard if jim carrey wasnt in it than the film would have been a lot worsebr br next to jim carrey is téa leoni shes an okay actress but she just isnt very funny she doesnt match up well with carrey and she seemed to be phoning in her performance they should have gone with someone else the supporting cast includes alec baldwin richard jenkins and aaron michael jenkins the latter plays billy harper and he actually gives a decent performance he wasnt as annoying as most child stars are alec baldwin was okay and richard jenkins tried too hard to be funny to be honest im a little bias here the film altogether was pretty average but i liked it more because of jim carreys performance fans of jim carrey should enjoy it but thats about it in the end fun with dick and jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes but its not very memorable rating 610
