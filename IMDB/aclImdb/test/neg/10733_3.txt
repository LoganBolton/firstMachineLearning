detective sergent vince de carlo james luisi and company are on the case of a vicious serial killerrapist can psychologist carol susan sullivan help or will she become the killers next victim and what is with the killers hilarious white dude afro br br inspired by the case of serial killer ted bundy killers delight aka the dark ride is a rather dull serial killer tale from 1978 that doesnt offer much if anything its more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie as much of the violence occurs off camera sure we get mutilated bodies but we dont get a whole lot in the exploitation departmentespecially considering that they are from the aftermath and not during the crime those hoping for the likes of the toolbox murders or maniac will be very disappointedbr br fortunately there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape the killer that gets the tone right and is quite suspenseful to boot also john karlen is quite effective as the killer though his hilarious hairstyle white guys with afros are always worth a chuckle is more than a bit distractingbr br the dark ride is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation as it lacks the proper exploitation elements and is dated even by the standards of the time those looking for a better example should probably turn to dont go in the house and a few others instead as this just doesnt cut it
