just a few words its a good thing george a romero is still among us cause if he were dead he would be forced to rise from grave to vote against the people who made this political satire and the saddest thing of all is that i actually agree with these peoples sentiments yeah theres zombies in it and they do have a good reason to come back from beyond the grave to vote oh and one of them finishes off the doctor from startrek voyager thats about as scary as it will get people if you are looking for a horrormovie i suggest you keep on looking and if you are looking for a witty political satire youre also in the wrong place and not just because this series is called masters of horror but dont let me hold you back maybe you see something ive missed though chances are youll be wasting your time with it just as i have lets just say i prefer my zombiemovies with the zombies standing in fr√≥nt of the camera
