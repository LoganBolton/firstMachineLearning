i couldnt relate to this film im surprised that people are lauding it for being so realistic how many people at your school were victim to incest how many closet homosexual jocks were there how many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide hmmm ok you wouldnt know even if their were but really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with and yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored but hey wheres the entertainment in thatbr br with regards to the girl who committed suicide  i found this to be exploitative i actually think many people in high school at some stage feel invisible ignored and unwanted but what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed the filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative and the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative i didnt buy it as a real life scenariobr br and the problems of the other students i didnt fully relate to bullying is explored but thats been done to death we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person closet homosexuality pfft another cliché gets rolled out thats the thing really too many clichés i guessed the ending at the start there was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense youve got all these characters with explosive problems and one with apparently none and i thought what is the point of this character unless shes the unsuspecting suicide victim and surely enoughbr br one thing i will say and it is the saving grace of the film is that it does not glamourise suicide the suicide is very graphic and heartbreaking to watch it is a powerful scene regardless of how contrived it isand one that dismisses suicide as the easy option but the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypesbr br not bad but certainly not groundbreaking or worthy of a 17minute standing ovation at cannes
