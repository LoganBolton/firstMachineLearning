homecoming what a huge disappointment after reading the plot summary the dead coming back to vote  against george w bush i couldnt wait to see this it started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention unfortunately though it slowly descended into a boring political satire that i didnt need to see i can just watch some good old aussie comedy for that there was pretty much only one or two scenes of horror and they werent even that scary i couldnt believe this came from joe dante who could easily have pulled it off with an equal balance of thrills and satirebr br the worst episode so farbr br 25
