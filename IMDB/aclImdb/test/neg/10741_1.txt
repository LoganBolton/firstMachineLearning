i disagree with dante portraying the democratsupporting zombies as creatures with an average iq of 23 i do believe their behaviour should reflect a lower iq than that something in the order of a pelosi iq a singledigit figure pleasebr br the moh series is quite uneven and this is the very worst episode dante yet another mindless hollywood liberal or an apolitical nerd who sucks up to the leftist establishment in order to rekindle his pitiful career must have finally realized that his directorial pursuits had been stuck in a low gear for nearly two decades now hence came up with this cringeinducing unsubtle leftwing satire of the bush administration republicans and capitalism perhaps he felt he hadnt been overtly political before he wouldnt exactly be the first notalent to use asinine political propaganda to further his career when all else fails the maker of turds such as piranha the howling and matinee dante has been as useful a contributor to the horror genre as adolf hitler had been to world peacebr br th uses lowestcommondenominator humour cheap and predictable gags which even the bluest of all bluecollar union members wouldnt have trouble understanding or have you ever seen a clever subtle intelligent liberal satire populist manure has the basest of all messages hence the language and manner in which this message is communicated has to be as simple and basic as sean penns name and what better people to send this message to the popcornmunching sheep than a couple of cocainesniffing tinseltown losers whove all fallen so low that theyre forced to write for tvbr br i dont want political propaganda either left or right in any type of movie but placing it in horror  of all genres  is a testament to the endless stupidity that reigns so supreme among hollywoods antiintelligentsia so vapid was dante that he even failed to notice the hilarious suggestion that zombies would vote democrat thats what you get for finishing a movie school not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge by any stretch of the imagination
