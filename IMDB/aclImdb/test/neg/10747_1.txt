the last sentence of this review is a major spoilerbr br i have enjoyed joe dantes work since piranha hes done a great deal of different genre parodies that were both funny and honestbr br but this is pure crap this is the kind of satire  in line with thank you for smoking  that is so literal and direct that it leaves nothing a to be laughed at and b to leave the audience to think aboutbr br its a shame because the plot and the material is so rich timely and ripe for intelligent commentarybr br by the way there is absolutely no reason for the main character to shoot the ann coulter character at the end of the film its just flat out ridiculous
