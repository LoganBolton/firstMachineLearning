there are places for political commentary in film but masters of horror is not one of them i get enough of this stuff from newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper now ive got to watch this in horror movies cmon all i wanted was a good zombie schlock film not another bush is bad rant if joe dante wants to express his politics let him go on air america and if you must insist on making a message film be a little more sly about it this had all the insinuation of being slapped in the face with a dead fishbr br by the way joe do you really want the leftwing voting block to be associated with braindead zombies might want to think about that before making another political horror movie god help us
