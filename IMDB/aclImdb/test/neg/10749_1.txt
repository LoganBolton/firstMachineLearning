i disagree 100 with the reviewer who disagreed 100 with the reviewer who gave this short movie an f grade cashing in heavily on political propaganda only obscures joe dantes lack of ability to pull another howling out of his bag of tricks the masters of horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrifying tales save for this episodebr br despite gaining acclaim from those who wish to promote its political slant homecoming is the least effective episode of moh season one unlike the rest of the series dantes entry is a parody of the genre falling short of both horror and humor in its hamfisted delivery of a hackneyed political pointbr br dante can really only be blamed for pulling this stinker off the shelf as it wasnt his creation the zombie subgenre is very popular this decade and among the crop of predictable george romero tributes and vacuous fantasies are a number of works designed to push political or irreligeous messages such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans maybe dante really isnt a a master of horror either what has he been up to since the howling after allbr br if you want a lame antiwar zombie flick with a few pop culture references passed off as humor homecoming may be just your thing if you are a horror fan looking for something masterful pick up most any other episode of the series my personal favorite was dario argentos jenifer based loosely on a classic comic short by the team of bruce jones and berni wrightson  truly creepy
