i caught 237 at the afi fest in los angeles its a very well shot first film though the dv format begins to show itself in outside scenes and im sure it has good intentions of showing us the dark side of high school  in other words every side of high school but the filmmaker doesnt have the talent to write or direct up to the premises promise there are several characters but none of them are any more than what the plot requires them to be theres no depth to these caricatures beyond the machinations of i am troubled teen x i have y problem the perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally troublesomebr br lets start with the men you have the stoner kid whos gay the jock whos also gay the boy who rapes his sister and mr peepants as the stereotype requires all gay men must be sexually unfulfilled and violent toward women and themselves naturally or unnaturally as the stereotype assumes the two gay male characters beat up women peepants and themselves id be perfectly fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned on their heads or if the characters somehow transcended them yet neither took place and thats all there is to these characters storiesbr br next the ladies one young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife another is the pregnant rapee of the sisterraping brother and theres the girl who kills herself ill get to that later again i dont think theres a requirement of political correctness for filmmakers id be out of a job were that the case but i do think that its only justified if theres more to that character or story if that archetype were being used to reveal something about character other than im a teenager and life sucks id be happy as a clam but nothing new is revealed nothing is subverted or changed or sublimatedbr br finally the girl who kills herself this is blunt and highly sloppy storytelling were supposed to sit through 5 minutes of a girl violently killing herself who weve seen for maybe 30 seconds through the whole film weve followed all these other stories for an hour and a half and now were invited to torture ourselves for a character that isnt part of the story its cheap exploitative and sloppy despite the millions of crappy indie films that came before this you have to earn something like that you cant simply purchase it on credit so this suicide happens we get wrapups from the characters that go similarly nowhere but down and the film ends what have i learned i already knew high school sucked  been there done that i already knew people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women i already knew that kids with disabilities are mockedbr br what else is there then smoke mirrors and some really nice views of leaves oh and the nastiest deus ex machina ive seen in a while
