opposing force 1986 wasnt as good as dr strangelove and it wasnt as good as the bridge on the river kwai heck it wasnt even as good as gi jane which is pretty sadbr br the film revolves around a basic ethical problem in a simulated prisonerofwar situation how far can you go before you start breaking the law what exactly is the law in such a situation how can you simulate the torture of someone without actually torturing someone can you intentionally inflict pain how about breaking bones mock executions sexual abuse severe blood loss real guns with bullets death somewhere between these is a really fuzzy line dividing acceptable from atrociousbr br now what could you do if you found yourself in such a training program and the lines between simulation and reality begin to vanish what could you do this movie attempts to portray this dilemmabr br i found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in resistance training i have a brother who went through the usafs pow training program according to him it was pretty close to the mark technicallybr br the film has a fairly good premise but it doesnt have a particularly good story i wondered if it might be based on some actual event but it became pretty apparent that it wasnt when the explosions started they must have changed scriptwriters three quarters into the film because it takes a real extreme turn and devolves into a somewhat pointless shootemup with lots of distracting explosions br br i found it to have a rather unsatisfying ending again kind of pointless im left wondering what the point of the whole thing was  im beginning to suspect there simply wasnt one it could have been much better with just a little more story to go along with the fireworks
