though its better than most madefortv movies buried alive is nothing more than a runofthemill revenge tale there are so many plot holes in this one it makes you wonder why the screenwriters didnt go through a series of rewrites the ending has a nice twist to it but its hardly believablebr br the acting by jennifer jason leigh is terrific as always but tim matheson hams it up with cheesy oneliners that reminds one of jack nicholson in the shining dont bother with this one
