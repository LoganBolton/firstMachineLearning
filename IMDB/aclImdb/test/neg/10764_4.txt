back in college i studied marketing and even though i missed a whole lot of classes and never really paid any attention i will always remember the main and most essential principle of marketing namely its not what you sell its how you sell it this principle fully applies to the devils triangle as its basically a beautifully wrapped and enticing yet empty package writerdirector richard winer knew exactly that he had to divert the viewers attention away from the major inaccuracies so he threw in some elements that never fail when it comes to providing a creepy atmosphere like the sinister voice of narrator vincent price and the oddball music of king crimson and im guessing richard winers dirty little tricks worked very efficiently as there was a huge bermuda triangle hype going on during the mid70s and literally every movie production  whether it was an inaccurate documentary or a sleazy exploitation flick  covering the topic earned big money at the box office the devils triangle overwhelms you with data that is unstructured and often irrelevant but the severe dramatization of the facts and of course the intimidating stark voice of the almighty vincent price generates an ambiance of fright and creepiness the narration constantly jumps back and forward in time and covers a massive amount of strange occurrences and mysterious vanishings of ships and airplanes in the bermuda triangle throughout a period of nearly one whole century but the reports remain extremely vague at all times and the eloquent mr price invariably ends every chapter with the sinister words  just another unsolved mystery of the devils triangle after a couple of cases the whole formula simply becomes laughable and almost pathetic but i guess it caused genuine mass hysteria back in 1974 the documentary expands a little more on the most notorious bermuda triangle mysteries like the five planes of military flight 19 that inexplicably disappeared all at once and the peculiar case of the vessel uss cyclops but still even in these chapters only a minimum of serviceable information is given the cameras never at one point go underwater to explore the depths of the bermuda area for example and the testimonies of the supposedly reallife witnesses of the dramas suspiciously look like staged acting scenes if youre looking for an informative and objective documentary on the bermuda triangle i certainly wouldnt recommend this movie but in case you want to sit back and listen to vincent prices hypnotizing voice for nearly a full hour this is your chance
