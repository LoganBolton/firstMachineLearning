before i start to tear apart this movie mark youi love the scarlet pimpernel that story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written the movie staring jane grey is very good and the musical on broadway is the hottest thing there so i thought when i heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a bbc filmbr br to my surprise it was a weak totally stupid story that utterly failed in capturing the gorgeous talebr br there were no exciting escapes with daring disguises there was no deep love that made your heart flutter as percy left the room and marguerite sighed as her husband was leaving her againbr br all it had was a confusing plot and a lot of outoftheblue sex and violencebr br sink me what a horrible moviebr br
