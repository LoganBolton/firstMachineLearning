having read the books and seen the 1982 anthony andrewsjanebr br seymour version i have to say that this is not good at allbr br according to the books percy is supposed to be a seeminglybr br foppish aristocrat when hes being percy and witty and cleverbr br when hes being the pimpernel but here he just looks bored asbr br percy and mean as the pimpernel marguerite is supposed to bebr br the most beautiful woman in europe not a tired and frumpylooking matron she looks middleaged probably due tobr br bad makeup richard e grant has done much better things andbr br elizabeth mcgoverns acting is uninspired and flat the wit andbr br dash of the books and the andrewsseymour film is here replacedbr br by brawn and flashy editing that just dont make the cut br br  i might add that to a person who hasnt seen any previous versionbr br or read the book it would probably look ok
