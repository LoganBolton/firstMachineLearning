i tried watching this movie but i didnt make it past the first 15 minutes its a terrible disappointment considering the cast but i cant look past the fact that the dialogue is in english and some of the actors pretending to be indian are not even close read kristin kreuk considering that india alone has 16th of the worlds population and one of the biggest movie industries i dont think it would have been hard for the filmmakers to have found an excellent indian actress to play the part and i dont say so because of some blind patriotism but because its absolutely and totally absurd for a nonindian to play the role of an indianpakistani now some people say that as long as shes convincing who cares but my point is exactly that shes not convincing and never can be  not due to her acting skills but due to her ethnicity for example however good an actor tom hanks may be hell never be able to play an australian aboriginebr br but that is still minor to the biggest faux pas the filmmakers made having the dialogue in english it totally destroys the mood as well as any semblance of authenticity had the same movie been made in native languages hindi urdu punjabi with english subtitles this may have been an excellent movie unfortunately as things stand i would not recommend anyone seeing it apart from film students who want to study what not to do in movies
