the title although singular will undoubtedly remind real horror fans of tod brownings immortal classic about a troop of circus freaks and how they were misunderstood by the outside world i can assure you however that this thing has absolutely nothing to do with freaks or even with the art of professional filmmaking in general this movie was recommended to me supposedly because its raw disturbing and thought provoking despite the low budget production values yeah right the person who recommended it to me may now consider himself to be my personal foe the low budget factor is correct but that about sums it up freak is dreadfully slow poorly made and every character that gets introduced is downright insufferableand that includes the freak too two siblings on their way to a new life encounter a deformed mental patient who escaped from the transport truck to another hospital and heads back to the house where he killed his mother at age 9 this could have been an interesting slasher with good isolated filming locations but instead tyler sharpe decided to make it boring and pointless family drama the lead actress attempts to look emotionally devastated are pretty laughable and the total lack of suspense and action can hardly be blamed to the limited budget total failure
