the italian job is a caper movie done by the numbers riding on the back of every caper cliche it rises to no particular heights and will be a movie footnote by about the end of the monthbr br the biggest problem is that the italian job possesses no imagination at all ive seen it all before and done better then the acting is fine the cinematography is completely acceptable but this film breaks absolutely no new groundbr br lets tick off the clichesbr br   oldschool criminal father figure and his protegebr br   another gang member jealous of protegebr br   a doublecrossbr br   only bad guys use guns while goodguy criminals dont have tobr br   good criminals always outwit the bad guysbr br and thats about the first fifteen minutes everything is so predictable even the heist and car chase scenes supposedly the highlight of the movie seem pretty ordinary this is especially true since they appeared in the trailers for the film so i already knew what to look forbr br for me a caper film works only if it has an element of realism  that maybe just maybe it could be pulled off without relying on a deux ex machina or just because moments parts of the italian job just throws that out the window with computers doing things that computers cant do the good guys not hitting anyone with their driving especially going down the stairs and not one single police car responding to street explosions recklessly driven minis or even a low flying helicopter must be a heck of a city for these things not to rate a responsebr br the acting is passable with the crew seth green jason stratham and mos def being at least fun to watch mark wahlberg is just too smarmy as the nice guy hero while charlize theron is about the only actor called on to display some kind of range donald sutherland is a class act as always and shows up wahlbergs deficiencies every moment they are togetherbr br overall this is a pretty uninteresting film given the imdb ratings its the girls that really love this film which i can understand to some extent but there are such better caper films out there  even the vapidness of the recent oceans eleven outshines the nonevent that is the italian jobbr br spoilerbr br at the conclusion take a moment to think about what is going to happen to nortons character are we meant to be cheering the good guys for causing his demise especially since it would appear to be long and painful he didnt deserve that simpering creep that he wasbr br end spoiler
