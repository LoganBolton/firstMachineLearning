sometimes theres a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe this is one of those films of course i cant help that im biased im from chicago so i watched the scenes closely for accuracy and i dont find billy crystal funny at all and i cant stand all that english style photographytony scott etc with the smoke machine working overtime and all the flourecent soft lighting i suppose were supposed to believe that billy crystal is really from chicago because he wears a cubs jersey oh and the plot if you really think about it these guys should be locked up not the bad guys since theyre more dangerous and of course theres the clich√© of the cops on the verge of retiring but the funniest scene is the climax where the good and bad guys machine gun other to death in the thompson centera state building of course its a cool building but its the equivalent of making a huge drug deal at the white house
