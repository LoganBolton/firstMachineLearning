this movie although well shot and superbly acted was awful i felt as if i was watching a car accidentsure i kept watching but i really wanted to turn my head the plot leaves little to be desired was extremely disjointed and the ending was abysmal although it did fit the tone of the movie i was hoping for something to improve this movie i still dont understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie fifteen minutes of plot that really didnt do much its really sad to see a movie with fine actors and a beautiful set wasted on such an awful awful story theres not much more to say about this movie save yourself the time and watch cspan itll be more uplifting
