this story is about a safari in africa that meets some guy named trentwho convinces them to look for a tribe of white babes naturally they turn out to be amazon warriors and capture the men the rest is pretty predictablebr br this movie has everything youd expect in a bargain basement movie about africathe substantial use of often irrelevant stock footage film of animals that are not native to the continent such as orangutans moose coatamundis and ground hogsa white actor in dark makeup playing a native bad acting particularly from trenta handsome man with the personality of balsa wood comic relief sounding like chico marx a guy dressed up in a gorilla suit and bikiniclad white women with perms who are supposedly fierce jungle warriorslike a tribe of angry female tarzans by the look of it my assumption is that the movie was made for under 4995including developing costs and paying for rental of the gorilla suit but what i didnt expect was an imdb score of 49 this is poor but not that poor considering that this is a schlock production in every possible sense and there is no conceivable reason why the film is rated that high now i am not saying the film isnt worth seeingits campy and stupid enough to make enjoyable viewingparticularly with friends just dont expect anything resembling a professionally made or competent filmbr br finally heres a smattering of the dialog from this jungle classicbr br oolama like strong white man oolama want strong white manbr br oongabunga br br metetonganokeeel kill man
