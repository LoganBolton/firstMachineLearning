abysmal pulp adventure exploitation in the jungle woman genre lousy audio thankfully obscures the dumb dialog and its awfully talky for a movie about people who dont speak english theres no adventure to be found here its a jungle adventure with cliffhangers and one wild animal attack that happens in flashbackbr br three paleface dopes wander the african wilderness and encounter warring manhungry tribes of amazons these wild women have advanced out of the stone age only so far as to invent makeup shoes and underarm hair removal technology despite their desperation for husbahnd the ladies insist that they will fight the men and burn the weaker onesbr br the only thing of interest as if there were any question is the assortment of young women clad in animal skins cleverly designed like the bathing suits of 1951 plenty of wrestling and bad dancing mixed with stripless 1950s stripper moves no nudity or appreciable violence on the other hand you may be humming the catchy native song for days
