the camals are coming is a rather disappointing british comedy from 1934 i purchased this because i like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama it certainly isntbr br it is about a couple who head for egypt to capture some desert drug smugglersbr br this would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy which lets it down a lot it is quite silly in parts depsite this there are some good action and location scenesbr br the cast is lead by jack hulbert with anna lee as the love interestbr br one viewing is enough for this movie overall a disappointmentbr br rating 2 stars out of 5
