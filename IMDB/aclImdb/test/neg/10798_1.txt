that got destroyed quickly by the poor quality acting cinematography numerous pointless scenes and a terrible villain well lets see joe estevez is bad as usual but he isnt the only casting problem writer vivian schilling is no great actress in fact well she sucks her script isnt so bad its just bad directed in fact if the direction had been better and if better actors had been cast this could have been a really good filmbr br  but alas with all of these problems soultaker fails to be even kind of passable as a horror movie plus the pacing is just awful toobr br  the mst crew had some fun with this one but it definitely wasnt one of their better efforts 5 for that nothing for the original
