first off ive read the comments by the director further down and id like to thank him for offering his opinion ive always wondered what the makers of the films lambasted on mst3k felt about their works being shredded not to mention how best brains acquired the rights rissis comments make me curious however as to how much scifi could have cut the film to make it seem different now im thinking i might rent it from netflix of course ive never seen the uncut nonmst3k version of this film but even having seen it on mst3k i never thought of it as a bad film or something unwatchable though i did think it was a pretty funny mst3k episode certainly not as pearl describes it skinpeelinging awful not after seeing the likes of future war and hobgoblins br br as far as cutting the film its been done before on mst3k at least once case in point the joe don baker flick mitchell in which the subplot involving john saxons character is cut in the mst3k version yet joel and the bots comment on saxons absence after his appearance in the beginning of the movie if i may submit a criticism of mst3k if you need to cut the film for time considerations fine but be fair to the film being cut even if it is a film as lousy as mitchell of course such criticism is rather pointless what with the show being over but i think that aspect of the show was kind of unfair but anyway if its the case with soultaker it gets my sympathies br br still i maintain that its an enjoyable mst3k episode though the movie itself even the version thats been hacked in mst3k is no where near terrible br br as a final note in a weird coincidence or perhaps a case of synchronicity i happened to watch the hudsucker proxy the day soultaker aired and wouldnt you know it the guy who played vivian schellings father had a bit part in that movie one of his three other credited roles actually i thought that was kind of weird
