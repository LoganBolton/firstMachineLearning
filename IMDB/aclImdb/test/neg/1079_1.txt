i must admit i was against this movie from the outset but i tried my hardest to be impartial i really did but the very idea of remaking a sophisticated witty entertaining quirky british classic full of character has to be dubious from the outsetbr br people in my house were watching this so i swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional about films i have studied them at uni after allbr br as expected for an american film of this sort the movie began with a chase which wasnt bad indeed many of the action sequences are credible and this alone lifts the markbr br yet the characterisation was abysmal the setpieces could very easily have been spliced from any american schlock blockbuster you might have had the misfortune to watch and it lacked all characterbr br seeming to take a skewed angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery the us version does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of donald sutherlands character this allows our us cousins plenty of opportunity for sycophantic dewyeyed vengeanceseeking against the evildoers which it milks to predictable excesses this is never more so evident as in the scenes featuring charlize theron oh pretty oh so pretty look at her pretty wounded bambi eyes everyone which were thoroughly nauseating her entrance scene particularly was like something out of resident evil or tomb raider which were both a more entertaining and b had better beginnings because they couldnt mess up a game like they could with british cinema which was already chockfull of spark people you genuinely feel something for and moments of inspiration but i digress the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it just seems like the most hamfisted manoeuvre ive seen in some time and exposes cynical hollywood blockbusterlust for what it isbr br if you like any of these actors by the way and you agree with any of the above comments do not go to see this film if i had the opportunity of watching fight club or american history x after seeing ed norton in this i would have declined likewise jason statham with lock stock and i suppose the transporter is okay if you like that sort of thingbr br sadly all the setpieces are designed in the most transparent possible way to get you thinking wow hes smart coo hes cool hey what a tough guy then theres the funny pc guy who has comic relief splattered across his forehead but whose humour content can be anticipated two minutes in advance to be honest if youve seen one or two films like it you might easily confuse the two as clones from the jerry bruckheimer stable not that jerry is irredeemably awful by the way but he just uses the clich√©s to excess as everyone knows or shouldbr br this is where i have to come clean i didnt manage to make it to the end so i couldnt even say whether the brilliant ending in the michael caine version made it but im sorry its just one of those extremely rare films that if id seen it at a cinema i would have walked out and staged a small protest outside its not just that it is another identical bythenumbers oceans 14 or something oceans eleven was fine but dont bother with the rest with all the glitz glamour fake sass and pantomime heroics of such a film but i couldnt recognise anything from the original at allbr br so if you are expecting the italian job and not oceans 14 albeit badly written with a less established cast and characters some disingenuous elements and cardboard cutout scriptwriting then do not watch i dont mind people liking a bit of mindless fun but this is a criminal hatchetjob that does not deserve in any way to parade itself under the title of a classic seriously show some pride i felt thoroughly justified in my outraged and sickened reaction when i first heard that the film would be made avoid at all costsbr br ps some of the action sequences arent bad at all so add an extra 1 to the mark if you like this sort of thing
