soultaker was written by and starred vivian schilling it also starred joe estevez gregg thomsen and robert dzar as the angel of deathbr br the story begins with introduction to soultaker played by joe estevez we quickly learn what soultakers role will be in this moviebr br next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival aptly named summerfest in this film the battle of the classes is omnipresent throughout the film the girls come from a wealthy class and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class the class roles seem to play a role in the film for some reason which isnt really clear or pertinent to the storybr br at summerfest we learn more about the apparent class struggles of why zach isnt encouraged to date natalie soultaker makes an appearance as well with apparently his boss the angel of death here dzars character points out who is to die and whos souls are to be taken its revealed as well that soultaker will have a character conflict regarding natalie and how he deals with her because of someone in his pastbr br meanwhile natalie is ditched by her ride to summerfest and zach convinces her to ride home with them during the ride home soultaker takes an active role causing them to wreck horribly at high speedsbr br the rest of the story surrounds the soultaker collecting the souls of the dead passengers and zach and natalie trying to outwit him to return to their bodies so they can continue to live the class and character conflicts lay in the story but are really never brought to the forefront or resolvedbr br theres an attempt towards the end to drag out some of the drama theres a lot of chasing and running which does tend to be really boring its not really acceptable and it wouldve been nice had this been dealt with differently somehow to maybe increase the drama but not bore the audiencebr br the story and acting are decent the soundtrack is ok and even the production values are goodbr br robert dzar in his brief on screen appearances does a nice job as the angel of death joe estevez does ok however sometimes his role acting a bit flat vivian is pretty and does a decent job as natalie although perhaps over acting a bit in a few scenesbr br this may sound odd but this movie definitely couldve benefited from some pointless nudity vivian teases us a bit but that wasnt enoughbr br in my opinion this was a pretty serious attempt at making a movie the results its worth watching just dont expect a perfect productionbr br 310
