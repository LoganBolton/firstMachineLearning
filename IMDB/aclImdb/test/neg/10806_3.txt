when a movies claim to fame is that martin sheens younger less known brother stars in it you know its not gonna be a real good one soultaker is a low budget silly film about a group of 20something year olds being pursued by an angel of death its a stupid movie but it is pretty entertaining and even somehow slightly likable in its stupiditybr br the plot in the film is very small and its stretched about as far as it possibly can be joe estevez isnt much of an actor so luckily for the audience he has very few lines and his role in mostly just him walking this movie really feels like it was trying to be a horrorfantasy franchise considering it has the same plot layout as a slasher 4 characters each dies one at a timewill any live who really cares though it sounds like i hated this i didnt i just didnt like it very well but i was interested through most of it so i guess that counts for somethingbr br my rating  12 out of  90 mins pg13 for language violence and nudity
