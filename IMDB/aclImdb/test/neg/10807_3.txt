now i did watch this when it first came out on vhs and all my friends and i thought it was a pretty good movie but then again we were teenagers but honestly not that good of a movie in retrospect sort of a hair metal dokken version of carnival of souls but a bad movie does not exactly mean it is unwatchable however this one seems to lack the charm a lot of the regular mst3k fodder usually contains but if it was on cable and i was bored and drinking beersure id watch it again but then again ive watched howling vii about five times now so maybe you really shouldnt be listening to mebr br anyone else think it kind of sad that the director supposedly commented on his own movie and why did he feel the urge to use caps lock so much
