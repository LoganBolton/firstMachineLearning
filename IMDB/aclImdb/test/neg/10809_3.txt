ok i read the directors comment about this movie featured as the frontmost comment and i have to admit that i can identify with his positionbr br micheal i hope your career recovered from this particular setback and you went on to other better things ive seen this movie in the mst3k form even with all the chopped continuity and snotty remarks being tossed out by the robots i saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to struggle out from under the limited budget and limited actors available to it and this is one of those films mitchell is another where the mst3k crew took a lot of cheap shots at the lead character even when she actually deserved better you know they had some unfair fun at the actress expense because it made for a livelier episodebr br imo the fact that the movie actually tried to be about something and had a few decent effective moments here and there should keep it out of the bottom 100 tangentstime chasers is another movie with a plot and a heart that doesnt deserve to be there eitherbr br but it is still not a very good movie i dont blame the writerlead actress for being who she is its just that her acting and writing skills needed a few more years to mature before she could pull off a vanity project such as this or carry a feature film the writing and characterization is amateurish and slapdash and the dialog is often barely up to abc afterschool special standards the cast sincerely gives it their best effort and the acting in general is definitely headandshoulders above abortions like future war or space mutiny but there arent any really professional level performances here with the exception of big joe estevez who is hammy but suitably intense i never saw the full original cut but msts sampling of soultaker was representative enough to make these facts plainbr br oh and the film has robert zdar in it that is imo a real kiss of death for any movie that hopes to be taken seriously yes hes big and scary looking in his role but i just hate the guy as an actor in real life i wish him well and hope he is financially comfortablebr br there were little things i liked about the film for instance the camaraderie between the male lead and his dead buddy added some warmth and humor to the movie and made it a lot more watchable the idea of an elevator in the hospital that opened its doors to the afterlife was an inspired way to invoke some spooky vibes without springing for special effects and i respected whoever worked that into the script in attempt to keep the budget manageable it didnt really work but it might have with just a little more tweakingbr br so anyway mr rissi better luck with your other projects  your involvement with this misfire wouldnt keep me from watching something else you did if the buzz was good and ms miller has nothing to be ashamed of  she was young and ambitious and the movie wasnt that bad
