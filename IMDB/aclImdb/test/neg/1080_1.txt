this is a woeful hollywood remake of a classic british film everything that made the original italian job entertaining has been bled out of this festering sore of a movie scripted by donna and wayne powers and listlessly directed by f gary gray i am amazed that troy kennedy martin the screenwriter of the original film allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pigs ear martin has worked on some of the finest film and tv projects of the last 40odd years even being vaguely associated with this stinker is not a good thingbr br the humour is forced the drama is laboured all the characters are cookiecutter likable crims with the exception of charlize therons implausible beautiful safe crackerrally driverand the plot only matches the original on the following pointsbr br 1 three minis the modern bmwmade versions but minis nonethelessbr br 2 use of the names croker and bridger for 2 of the main charactersbr br 3 disrupting a citys traffic control system to provide a safe route through itbr br 4 er thats itbr br otherwise what you get is a bland and implausible american bythenumbers heist movie in which a gang of jolly pirate chums eventually get the better of their evil associate believe me it feels like an awful long time before they do the cast do their best with what theyre given but it seems that they all accepted it as a turdpolishing exercise after reading the script none of the original films quirky nature and distinctly british flavour has survived being fed into the hollywood hamburger machine br br do yourself a favour and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this sucking chest wound its a wonder that noel coward hasnt done an aunt nelly jumped out of his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this tepid remake halfway down their throatsbr br italian job more like italian jobbie
