thats how i was when i walked staggered out of this film i couldnt leave because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people i was stuck in the middle trappedbr br the tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen the daughter was a stand out performance  stand out in the bad sensebr br thge cinematography was hideous consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting ive witnessedbr br as for the stock footage well at first onebr br waitbr br why am i reviewing this film why do i acknowledge its existence please dont watch it do something useful with two hours of your life and go watch some paint dry
