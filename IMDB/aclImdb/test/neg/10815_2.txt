i cant help but forget that incredible scene in alien when the extra terrestrial burst out of one of the mens chest or even in predator when the invisible monster snuck upon the bewildered soldiers and cut them to pieces both these movies expressed fascinating ideas on the runofthemill creature feature back track to the era of cheesy bmovies and watch big men in phony suits parading around killing people in small towns now recognize that the two movies above revolutionized this genre the cave does nothing to improve on it it tries nothing new and worst of all the cave doesnt even have good gore shame on them shame on them all br br parading around in sexy spandex are the onedimensional characters of the cave all of which seem to not care when they witness the death of their colleagues they just stroll along unbeknownst to the evil creature lurking in the darkness the plot is very easy to understand so you got the two brothers the black guy and the sexy female scientist the rest by the rest i mean all of those meet grisly demises are even more unexciting then the others we have the korean assistant the risky outdoor chick a russian scientist and two divers both lacking a sense of emotion and are stupid enough to wander off by themselves this movie exceeds to be extremely clich√©d since everybody but the black guy one of the brothers and the female scientist meet an end it also seems only americans can survive the terror since the russian and the korean die dont be offended if i give away details theres no real surprise anywaybr br to be straight forward they find this cave they go in the cave they get stuck in the cave they start dying in the cave one of them gets infected in the cave more die in the cave they get out of the cave only to discover that one of them has a parasite that will turn them into a ghastly monster which really doesnt seem to bother them thats the simplicity of the lackluster plot it doesnt even try to be original it even has the part where they decide their leader isnt capable and split up we have just seen this way to many times beforebr br i know in a movie like this people dont care about the performances but its worth mentioning how bad they were everyone is just so dreary cole hauser was especially unsophisticated and dont get me started on eddie cibrian who is frequently a lot better morris chestnut is hands down the best thing in the movie his performance is actually decent he portrays the guy who calms everybody down all the other actors are average at best in a show like this thats really not a bad thingbr br now to the reason we go to this genre of film the action of course well to my regret the action was dull the death scenes are all boring hell the whole movie was there is barely any blood at all its either they disappear and found later or they are attack and die without a bruise seeing the koreans mans death was the only exciting action i could find br br its pretty amazing the bad things over shadow most of the things that are good a good example is to say the special effects were well done which they were the only thing wrong is that since everything takes place in a cave its going to be dark i found it extremely hard to distinguish between the cave walls and the monsters so it was pretty hard to even see the creatures although i liked the special effects there was nothing original about the monsters they all resembled each other and they werent frightening at allbr br the cave marks the directorial debut for bruce hunt i dont see what he was trying to accomplish by making this film he obviously made a huge mistake almost everything about this movie stunk like a stink bomb a stink bomb is probably even more pleasurable than watching this mess again only the most forgiving moviegoer will find this forgivable i gave up all hope in the middle of the film when i heard the phrase what the hell was that for the third time
