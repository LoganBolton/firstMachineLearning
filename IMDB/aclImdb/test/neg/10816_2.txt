the cave got released more or less simultaneously with the english film the descent directed by neil marshall both movies share a similar premise only the cave is dreadfully unoriginal unexciting and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure that is the descent it feels like neil marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and instantly added ingenious ideas depth and a personalized style whereas the cavedirector bruce hunt simply went for the most rudimentary elaboration of the screenplay that was thrown on his desk the result is an unbelievably mediocre film that features every single horror cliché you can think of and in which most of the violence happens offscreen and we all hate that dont we the story introduces a clique of insufferable cavedivers that become trapped in a completely undiscovered romanian underground ecosystem hideous winged creatures that also happen to be parasites soon attack them and escape seems impossible due to a landslide the first half hour is still mildly entertaining if you keep yourself busy with spotting all the clichés and listening to the cheesy textbook dialogs but the whole thing just gets too dire none of the events are even slightly plausible and it looks like the entire cast is competing with each other to deliver the worst performance ive seen better special effects in anonymous bmovies already the filming locations arent used to the fullest and the ending downright sucks very much not recommended
