some sciencey people go down in a cave for some reason and theres some sort of creature thats killing thembr br i usually give a more detailed plot but i wasnt paying too much attention to this overall it was dull and the only time youll be really paying attention is during the action scenes which the director did wonderful onbr br the acting is alright but the characters are so dull and forgettable they blend in your mind youll forget who lived and who died for 2 reasons 1 the kills are boring 2 the characters are boringbr br the ending might have shocked me more if i knew who was whobr br so youre looking for a creaturesincave movie check out the descent instead
