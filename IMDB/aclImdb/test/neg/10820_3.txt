the mission to see the movie the cave was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave some young cave divers and not much else its too bad that the movie didnt change much more than the trailer didbr br the immediate allure of a movie like this is the creature whats he going to look like why does he live in a cave how is this one supposed to be different from the other creatures weve been shown in movies like alien and predator and the relic the cave demons do not look far from the skeletal creature in alien resurrection and even has the sight of predator shame thats a total ripoffbr br well lets look at the plot very confusing and jumps to more and more totally improbable twists as a team of cave divers is sent to find a cave and its dwellers in the carpathian mountains the casting was very much clear that we want young hip tough chicks chiseled guys and the girls who have brains also have to be hot we also have to have one of every racial background in case the audience thinks that the filmmakers are biased to a certain viewpoint totally been done and im totally tired of itbr br the other main problem was the ending as if to say there might be a sequel plase shoot me if there is one the tagged on ending made me wretchbr br i gave this movie 310 stars the points that it did get were more or less appreciation points towards the creaturebuilders for their highquality job spent on the costuming and design for the monsters who dwell within even when they looked totally ripped off and theres an interesting yet labored documentary on the dvd on underwater cave diving go check it out only if you love new creations of monsters and creatures but be warned that youve probably seen this movie before and it was better the first time
