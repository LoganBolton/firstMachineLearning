i rented this film from blockbust because of the cover and title sounded intriguing this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense the monsters needed more face time we needed them to have some sort of special power and definitely more oh sh moments the photography didnt bother me except for the scene where a rebreather blows up there were too many close ups but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom overall i would say everyone put in a lot of time even the writers but this movie is definitely a below average rentbr br there are definitely better picks i would recommend anacondas 1 or 2 over this pick
