i went to see this movie to kill some time i remember cole hauser in tigerland and although his acting is wooden he does portray a tough leader character same here this movie was about a bunch of young hot scientists and divers exploring a cave in romania that one has to dive to see the beginning scene was very interesting with a bunch of romanian or russian men exploring the cave in search of booty flash forward 30 years and we have a team of divers called in by some scientist and his crew to explore some cave for some unknown scientific purpose br br there is a lot of clich√©d useless talk the women are too hot for their jobs lets face it i hate to watch the lips of these women talk about the guys while drinking beer at the precave exploration party i mean it was like we were at some bar with frat and sorority types talking about the opposite sexnot a group of scientists and divers every character had zero personality with perhaps exception of the scientist who at least wasnt one of the young and beautiful people so the acting although workmanlike was not inspiring br br the dialog was pretty bad at one point in the movie cole hauser jack the lead diverhis irises morph into the cingular wireless symbol and stay like that we are led to believe that since he was scratched by one of these monsters that he is turning into one of them fair enough but first of all nobody says the obvious thing to him what is up with your eyes dude no everybody just talked about how hes changed and that he should not be the leader of the group anymore and then this guy says you see how hes not human huh if they really believed he was a friggin monster then why not act like it instead the group splits in twothose who go with jack and those who go their separate ways i guess thinking him to be a monster it makes no sensebr br the best scene in the movie was this blonde diver woman crawls up a cave wall and gets attacked by this goblin her scream really suckedbut she fought like hell to dispatch the goblinbr br the photography was fine when the camera was still but any action sequences the director found it useful to confuse the hell out of us by flashing bubbles flashlights dark space god knows what i wish they would just show us a scene straight once in awhile just because you move the camera all over the place doesnt make the movie any scarier folks br br this movie could have been a lot better if the following changes had been madebr br 1 every actor was replaced by someone who looked real let cole hauser be the lead its ok to let him be the goodlooking one im getting tired of seeing 20something supermodel scientists give me a break peoplebr br 2 the cinematographer was fired and replaced by one who just pointed the camera and sat still this could be the directors fault i dont know jumpy camera as in constant gardener is getting old folksbr br 3 we got to see the goblins actually devour the people how bout some gore theres not much else in this movie we barely got to see the creaturesi felt a little ripped off about that br br 4 the ending was pretty lame during the denouement the sexy british scientist has a secretguess what that is its a bit canned the ending would have been better if they all died instead of the black guy morris chestnut who seemed to breathe a little sympathy into his character just by his worried expressions all the other actors had no expressionbr br i gave it a 4 out of 10 because after all the acting was without noticeable errors and the concept was fairly original id like to see cole do more military roleshes good at it
