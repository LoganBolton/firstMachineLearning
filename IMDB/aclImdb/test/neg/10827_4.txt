i though this film was okayi dint think it was greatit was a bit too slow for my tastelots of dramabut not very much action until close to the end of the filmthis movie was basically a dramatic filmwith the payoffif you can call it thatnot until near the endto methe scenes of the dam bursting and the water flooding the townwere okaybut much too briefthe film itself is done okaythe acting is decentbut it just didnt do it for mein the long runthink it had something to do with the fact that there was very little suspense or tension built through the whole movieat least thats what i thinkthe other factor is that i had just recently watched 105 and its sequel 105apocalypsethese are 2 big budget event movieswhichin my opinion are a very hard act to followin terms of special effects and scenes of destructionas a resulti have to rate killer floodthe day the damn broke at 410
