well how to start i saw the italian job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop i couldnt quite remember why i had a bad feeling about it now i dobr br after voting for the ratings for this film i saw the statistics apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls no wonder they didnt pay enough to charlize to flash and i guess some girls magazine has rated mark wahlbergs abs awesomebr br other than that this film is completely predictable the actors are mainly forever bstars and even the good ones are being misused horribly the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel the first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and its all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeatingtodetail their gold heist all in all lots of noise about nothingbr br i think charlize theron is good and ed norton could be more as hes been before apart from donald sutherlands look im here too appearing in the beginning id say this movie ought to have a pass if youre above 18 all over it
