possibly the worst movie i have ever seen pathetic in almost every waybr br i threw the dvd straight in the bin  i didnt even think it was fair to give it to the local thrift shopbr br the effects are beyond a joke the dam control room looks like cardboard the water looks way out of scale with the backgrounds  nothing worksbr br then there is the limp plot  about as much depth as a scooby doo cartoonbr br i couldnt wait for them all to drown
