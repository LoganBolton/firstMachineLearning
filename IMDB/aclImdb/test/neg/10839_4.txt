it seems on the surface to be a romantic planes trains and automobiles but at times tried for something more where it failed miserably some may like the nontraditional ending but the attempts at deep insight into the world of marriage flopped around not really going anywherebr br but if you were interested by the story the movie tried other methods to distract you the unnecessary special effects of which the falling rain was the most obvious served to do nothing but annoy the camerawork is erratic at bestbr br one note of caution however my movie experience as a whole was less than satisfying sitting in the first row with a group of younguns around
