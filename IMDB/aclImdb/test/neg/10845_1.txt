i rented this movie for about 150  the most complete waste of money and time i have ever spent its lame i couldnt believe how they could come up with something like thisbr br the plot there is no plot everything youd expect to happen it does only in a worse way the acting was horrible my dog couldve done better the special effects have no effect whatsoever  except inducing complete disbelief and the cheesy lines i mean why even bother br br the only credit i can give this piece of sht are the opening scenes they were actually quite pretty and one of the reasons why i decided to rent this the graphics shown there are probably the best and most realistic cg of the entire filmbr br total reality gets 1 out of 10 for not being able to mark it lower
