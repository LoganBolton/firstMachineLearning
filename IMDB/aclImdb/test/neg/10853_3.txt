a very bad film an amalgam of clich√©s and historical inaccuracies a few examples in an early scene soviet infantry are attacked by the germans instead of staying in their trenches to shoot at them they advance into open ground to fight themcontrary to all infantry tactics kate one of the central characters is supposedly the daughter of a white russian and obsessed with her russianness yet she does not speak russian a guiltstricken german airman attacks an antiaircraft gun the gun however does not fire shrapnel shells but scores a direct hit on his plane which doesnt look much like a german plane of wwii in fairness when they could escape the preposterous plot and the consequent absurdities there are some genuinely powerful moments the depiction of people slowly starving to death is convincingly done and moving but these only show up the rest of it even more a film to be avoided
