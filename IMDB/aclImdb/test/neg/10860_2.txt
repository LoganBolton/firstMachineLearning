once upon a time quentin tarantino was a relatively successful filmmakerbr br now unfortunately he not only makes terrible films but puts his names to ones like thisbr br a supposedly cool retro flashback to biker movies of the 60s and 70s this plumbs new depthsbr br believe you me i enjoy it when a blouse falls off in a film more than the next man but even i felt kind of sleazy watching this to use a word i never thought i would its msysoginistic you see i cant even spell it the plot in the vaguest sense of the term is as incomprehensible as vinnie jones accent the fact his terrible acting does not stand our particularly is as damning a testament as one can think ofbr br this is just terrible shocking it almost made me cry in horror
