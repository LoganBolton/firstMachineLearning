this film oh my god this film is so poor  im amazed i managed to watch it all br br first off id like to say that vinny jones should only play a london thug period thats it end of story br br pisttolero is so unconvincing its almost comedy banging in dennis hopper and david carradine did not save this film  in fact i think its a total comedy and as a comedy it deserves its 1 starbr br avoid at all costs  vinny oh my god i thought i saw it all when he played that irish tinker pbr br i think the average viewer will realize that this film is maybe just a never will be type of film i cant see how anybody could actually fall this crap
