when a movie called hell ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker clich√© with character names like pistolero comanche and the gent i braced myself for the worse and was punch in the face by just that the dialogue soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies dusty desert blurred from the heat as bikes coming tearing down the road while cc rider plays and they talk about sex and violence yawn the three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable seeing old men like bishop and madsen in a freaking ruffled shirt riding down a dusty strip of desert highway reminded me of two men trying desperately to relive their youth poor eric balfour tried his best but with such poor material it got lost even an appearance by dennis hopper in full easy rider swing couldnt save it and lets talk about the store bought tans shall we many have compared this to tarantinos work it is not even close what makes tarantinos work so brilliant is he knows its over the top so he just goes balls out and takes it as far over the top as possible bishop took this film so seriously that it became nothing more than a poor copy of the exploitation genre
