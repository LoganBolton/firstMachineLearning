larry bishop directs writes and leads this soft core porn plot less biker movie about nothing to do with anything to call this one of the worst movies of 2008 is being kind to the garbage that i spent money on while in theaters its one of the worst movies i have ever seen i felt sorry for the girls mostly who probably think theyre in the making of a feature film when in all reality theyre making a porno they walk on the set for four days say some sexual lines to disgusting old men  thirty years older than them  then take off their cloths and run around naked for the four days theyre on set i can only assume this was larry bishops only way to get laid you see shot after shot directly on a girls asses shot after shot of bishop walking up to some random chick and grabbing her most intimate parts as if he were shaking her hand how this crap was even funded is beyond me why tarantino has his name on it is beyond me but hes been slowly fading away since 1994 so i cant say i was surprisedbr br after 15 minutes you get that awful feeling that only horrible and i mean horrible movies give you when you see it in theaters the pain you feel is amplified after 15 minutes i wanted to cry for being so stupid and wasting not only my time but my hard earned ten dollars there isnt one redeeming quality or one moment in the movie that creates any kind of reaction or shows any kind of inclination that these people had any idea of what they are doing if you dont see naked women all that often then i guess this movie would be for you if youre elevenyearsold you will probably like it you cant even laugh at it because every idiot making it was laughing about the crap they were making the acting is awful the writing is awful the production is awful and the directing is awful its not even worth your time renting it to see the car crash stay away stay very far away you shouldnt even be reading these reviews i shouldnt even be writing one
