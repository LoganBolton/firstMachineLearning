because thats what hell ride pretty much is larry bishop and tarantino partying on the weinsteins money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line im all for fake boobage and booze as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie really theres nothing worse than the reheated secondhand leftovers of an old trend and im not even talking about 70s grindhouse cinema because hell ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era it purports to pay homage to no this is slick and glossy mtv hollywood through and through the old trend im talking about is the selfconsciously pseudohip quirky cinematic world where tarantino meets guy ritchie and robert rodriguez all three guys were at least talented and found success for a reason hell ride is just a secondhand copy fickle and uninspired polished to the max when it should be raw the supercool aspect coming off forced and sillybr br theres no reason for example why such a simple and utterly inane story has to be told in convoluted backandforth in time fashion its just a posttarantino quirk theres also no reason why the dialogues have to be so mindnumbingly pointless people flapping their gums while saying nothing at least when travolta was talking about cheeseburgers in pulp fiction it felt fresh dialogues here amount to little more than pseudomacho posturing theres also no reason why a grating rocknroll guitar has to twangle aimlessly over the entire movie perhaps the lowest hell ride hits is when it tries to be quasiexistential theres a hilarious dreamillusion scene in the desert where bishop eats peyote and sees colours i was halfexpecting an old indian to come out and offer nuggets of wisdombr br the only saving grace of this abysmal turd is the boobage and vinnie jones monologue about his wings tattooes and maybe some of the desert exterior shots lots of boobage and hot scantily clad babes now thats something i can get behind but a movie they dont make everything else is just an empty shell an imitation of other infinitely more talented imitators
