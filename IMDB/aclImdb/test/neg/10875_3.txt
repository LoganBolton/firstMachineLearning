tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film the acting directing and script are all thirdrate  with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writerdirectorstar larry bishop to get laid the only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with qt the plot of the film is pretty flimsy and basically tries to survive on notsoobscure references to older bmovies and some cameos from guys like david carradine dennis hopper and vinnie jones each one is listless in their performance particularly hopper who is in fullon paycheck mode at this point in his career the saving grace if there is one is that the script is so laughably bad that it can be entertaining bishop tries so hard to get that trademark tarentino banter and just fails miserably which can be pretty humorous at times and grating at others id only check this one out if you love bad moviesor if youre really into biker films
