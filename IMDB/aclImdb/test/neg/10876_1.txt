or thats what the filmmakers would like you to believe anywaybr br this movie tries sooo hard to be cool its ridiculous everything from the look of the film the cinematography the editing the dialogue and the acting is geared in super cool mode from the get go just to make sure that no one misses how cool this film is theres a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll tunes and a twangy westernsurftex mex guitar playing constantly throughout the film as a final reminder of how frickin cool this movie is all the actors have been instructed to speak in a hoarse voice because as we all know thats badassbr br the plot if there indeed is one seems pretty straightforward but as someone else already pointed out the director and star of the film seems fiercely determined not to tell that story instead focusing on a plethora of naked babes and dialogue thats supposed to be badass but grows tired surprisingly quick did they have an contest to see how many times they could cram the words pussy and fck and its derivatives in an 80 minute filmbr br this movie was absolutely horrible
