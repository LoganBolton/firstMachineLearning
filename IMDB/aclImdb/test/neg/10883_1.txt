seriously folksi was getting ready to actually write the razzie council and recommend this movie as razzie champ for 2007until i got on imdbcom and realized its copyright date was 2006 and not 2007 seriously though this movie could have easily been a razzie champ this movie sucked how in the world this piece of crap was overlooked even for a razzie nomination in 2006 is beyond me because it easily could have competed with basically it stinks too for the 2006 razzie championshipbr br i rented this movie on the recommendation of a female neighbor of mine who told me oh my god after seeing this movie its going to be a long long time before i ever stop at a rest stop ever again i couldnt believe how not scary and awful this movie was possible spoilers below not that youll be missing out on anythingbr br ok first of allthe problemthe rest stop itself obviously the director of this piece of crap doesnt know the first thing about women the toilets in that rest stop were on the same level as the one in the movie trainspotting i dont claim to know everything there is to know about women but one thing i do know is that women for the most part are total and complete hygieneneat freaks given the choice between taking a crap on either of those toilets and possibly catching something or squatting in the woods a woman is going to opt for squatting in the woods i know because ive gone camping with them before and they have no problem squatting in the woods so right theremajor plot hole and untruthbr br second of allshe comes out of the rest stop and her boyfriend who drove the car is nowhere to be found not him nor his car he just left she starts screaming his name wondering where he is ummmhello youre standing on wet muddid it ever occur to you to look down for some tire tracks i mean his car is goneit didnt just get up and fly away and actually that makes me thinki actually was looking down at her feet and there werent any tread marks in the mud howexactlydid that happenbr br thirdthe bible thumping mobile home family with the freak midget in the back taking polaroid pictureswtf they made absolutely no sense at all and its as if the director just threw them in to be weird for the sake of being weird they made no sense at all and had no place even being in the moviebr br fourthoh my god thisi mean finallynear the end of the movieshe finally sees the escape hatch on the ceiling inside the rest stop im like youdumbbih youve been locked up in this rest stop for all this timeand you justnowseethe escape hatch on the ceiling i meanits like they threw that in just because the killer tossed gasoline on the floor through the window and was getting ready to light a match so she needs to get to higher ground to avoid being burned andoh look a perfect reason for her to get to higher ground an escape hatch on the ceiling its likewhy didnt she go through that before most people in that situation would have seen that from the moment they were locked in that rest stop and gotten the fk out of dodge when they showed that escape hatch at the end of the movie i was like you have got to be kidding mebr br fifthwhat was the deal with all the of people she encountered continuing to just disappear the girl in the broom closet in the rest stop the dumb cop her at the end of the movie when she ended up in the broom closet herself it was never explained personally when they did this i thought to myself oh christ on a cracker its her shes the killer wonderful she killed all of those people doesnt remember doing it and the writers of this movie just ripped off a certain french horror flick that i cant mention on imdbcom or ill be blacklisted for giving away the ending that movie sucked by the way too people but it wasnt she wasnt the killer and the whole deal with the dead people disappearing was never ever explained oh for the love of god people stay away from this movie this movie sucked balls and i have now got a serious bone to pick with my neighbor its on the 2 for 1 rack at family video dont even rent it if someone gives it to you for free
