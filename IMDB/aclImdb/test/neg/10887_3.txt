spoiler wolfcreek meets texas chainsaw massacreif youve seen those dont waste your time with this one typical slasher movie nothing new here except for the spoiler visions which just add fluff to an already weak plot i would recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing to watch and its either see this movie or stare at a bare wall for 15 hrs the only semiinteresting part spoiler is when the chick starts drinking in the empty sheriffs office i say its interesting because at least she made good use of that liquor instead of stereotypically using it to start a fire to kill the bad guy although she did go that route towards the end all in all lame bad and not worth effort
