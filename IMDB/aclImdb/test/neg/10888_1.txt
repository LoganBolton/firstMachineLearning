this movie has to rank with welcome to the jungle and the hitcher and dream catcher for sheer godawfulness youve got the most irritating heroine in gore history who spends most of her time sobbing and wailing and shriekingall the time in the most horrendous rest stop toilet ever put on film why she spends so much time in this ghastly bathroom from hell is never explained even when the usual killer truck driver is trying to murder her she refuses to leave the crapper when a motorcycle cop comes to her rescue the killer truck driver runs over the cops legs while the heroine just looks on instead of grabbing his gun for protection she drags the poor slob into the crapper and locks the door then the cop orders her to blow his brains out because of the pain she does sowhile wailing and sobbing and keeningand blows the back of his head off thenthe cop still alive beg her to shoot him again because hes still in pain he says this while the entire back of his head is all over the floor the sobbing wailing heroine shoots him again the movie goes on and on like this none of it making any sense the heroine is so dislikable you really want the killer to off her early on i saw this flick on the scifi channel so it didnt cost me anything to watch but still i did watch out of sheer fascination as to how a movie could end up so terribly bad
