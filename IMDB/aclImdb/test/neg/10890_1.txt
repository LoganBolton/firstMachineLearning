i only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish my aim is to help people who want to see great films to spend their time  and money  wiselybr br i also want to stop people wasting their time on garbage and want to publicize the fact that the directorproducer of these garbage films cant get away with it for very long we will find out who you are and will vote with out feet  and walletsbr br this film clearly falls into the garbage categorybr br the director and writer is john shiban its always a bad sign when the writer is also the director maybe he wants two pay cheques he shouldnt get any so remember the name  john shiban and if you see anything else by him forget itbr br i wont say anything about the plot  others have already i am a little worried by how much the director likes to zoom in to the poor girls face when she is crying and screaming these long duration shots are a little worrying and may say something about the state of mind of mr shiban maybe he should get psychiatric helpbr br enough already its crap  dont waste your time on it
