this movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in la who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop actually its really just about the girl nicole since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes the movie gets going extremely fast and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length it isnt long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowherebr br the story is not only paperthin but unstructured stupid and incoherent minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop she sees the flashing of a camera and knows that people are inside but she easily gives up on trying to get their help when no one answers her door knocks after she is informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger she walks around the rest stop doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things this includes turning on a tv and even looking amused when she thinks shes stumbled onto a porno movie even in this dire situation sitting around wandering and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours on end she does all this knowing that her boyfriend has been abducted that the killer is still on the loose and stalking her and without taking any actions to ensure her immediate safety she doesnt bother to lock the doors or remain alert oh yeah she tries using a radio to call for help but why even bother when theres a mobile home with people inside right there at the rest stop it really seems like the script writer forgot about this important fact while writing this part of the storybr br theres no sense of entrapment or everpresent danger in this story the heroine freely wanders in and around the various buildings at the rest stop and the killer only drives in occasionally to scare her before driving off again theres nothing stopping nicole from simply taking off even if the rest stop is a long way from anywhere else thats better than sitting around but she chooses to stay anyway at one point in the movie the main character even acknowledges that she can run off but doesntbr br the story doesnt go anywhere and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment nicole finally gets inside the mobile home and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of sheltered presumably inbred or psychotic religious fanatics they seem willfully ignorant or uncaring about the killers actions but theres no indication that theyre connected to him in any way and then kick nicole out after several minutesbr br in the next irrelevant segment the main character wanders into the bathroom building she discovers one of the killers previous victims a young woman named tracy who is still alive and locked in a closet for some strange reason tracy starts vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood nicole goes off to fetch a crowbar to pry open the closet door and when she returns a minute later both tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without any explanation what was the point nicole finds a bulletin board showing many missing persons and sees that tracy had disappeared in 1971 so was tracy a ghost or something the writer never bothers explainingbr br next a cop shows up in the middle of the night to man the police office at the rest stop which had been conveniently left unattended for the entire day so far nicole tells him all about whats been going on and when the killer drives up in his truck outside the office the cop goes outside to confront him what does the police officer do knowing that something is seriously wrong he goes up and calmly talks to the killer who nicole had even pointed out to be the guy who was stalking her and buys into the killers lie that he was simply driving through and needed directions seriously the cop then talks to nicole outside totally unaware as the pickup truck turns around and runs him overbr br the cop quickly starts telling nicole that hes a goner whos lucky to be breathing still yet he strangely doesnt die for quite a while the two of them do some more pointless talking and the allimportant fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long a time when the two of them finally try to use the gun nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting at a door when the killer was possibly behind it with two bullets left the policeman tells nicole to use one to euthanize him she fires one into his mouth and he lays still for a few moments with a chunk blown out of his head then he suddenly and inexplicably yells out you missed and she has to shoot him again completely cheap attempt at shockbr br nicole finally confronts the killerand fails the movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop in the bathroom building she hears nicole crying for help in the closet locked in like tracy was she gets a policeman to go inside and check it but he finds an apparently normal and clean closet the cop leaves thinking hes been tricked a battered nicole is seen coming out from behind some boxes in the closet she would have been easily spotted if the cop had spent all of 10 seconds looking apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the policeman was there wowbr br this movie is apparently the first in a new line of quality directtodvd movies marketed as being too extreme for theaters in reality its just more cliché bmovie garbage
