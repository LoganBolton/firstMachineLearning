this movie has got to be the biggest disappointment ive ever experienced with a film the acting is horrific the suspense build up minimal and the plot overall is ridiculous i found myself rooting for the victim to just hurry up and become a victim because she obviously needed to be put out of her misery anyone with rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will immediately be disgusted at the leaps were asked to make in logic and the socalled suspenseful buildup would be lucky to get a 3 year old to be mildly worried im dismayed that a sequel is planned because it means theyll be asking us to once again swallow a sub par plot line if this is an example of raw feeds work i think ill be avoiding any and all future films by them
