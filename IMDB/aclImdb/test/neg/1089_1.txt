we have given this film one star for awful however it really depends on how you look at it we are currently watching this on channel 5 at 330am and we havent stopped laughing so perhaps we could give it a 10 just for the entertainment value right from the outset with the manic thoughts of the stalker being relayed in comic fashion we were laughing is it me or does that chick from knotts landing look like one of the characters from the dark crystalbr br im not going to spoil it for you however you would have to be pretty stupid not to see it coming i dont think its clever enough for double bluffsbr br this has to be the worstbest film we have ever seen if wed been playing the spot the clich√© drinking game then we be wasted by now
