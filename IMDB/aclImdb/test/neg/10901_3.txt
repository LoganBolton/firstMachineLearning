young couple on the road minding their own business and having casual sex in their car during broad daylight yet suddenly theyre being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pickup truck hmm where have i seen this premise before oh yeah now i remember weve seen this a thousand times before already and approximately nine hundred and ninetynine of the other cases were much better than rest stop this weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most undemanding horror fans as it doesnt feature a single original twist or memorable gimmick its very sadistic and nasty but every teenkillslasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays so thats no real surprise anymore neither the absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots writerdirector john shiban damn well realized that the ultrathin basic storyline nearly wasnt enough to fill a whole movie with and thus he stuffs up his film like a thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material nicoles boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in california killing off her character right away wouldnt result in a very long movie and thus she subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks suffers from visions  in which she talks to the deranged killers previous victims and she has deeply emotional and boring conversations with a police officer who just wont die even though a truck ran over himtwice the dumb sub plots never lead anywhere and theyre definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch a movies length ive ever seen instead of all the pointless padding shiban should have paid more attention to building up tension and make his lead characters a little more likable jaimie alexanders character nicole is an annoying and brainless girl and you wont really care whether shell survive the ordeal or not her boyfriend jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still werent painful enough if you ask me i counted exactly three sequences all including torture and gratuitous mutilation that were gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile on my face thats still way too few for a nowadays horror movie basically rest stop is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like wolf creek and hostel but youre better off watching the originals this was the first film of the new production company called raw feed theyre promoting themselves as the new name in great horror but theyll have to come up with something much better than rest stop if they want us to believe that
