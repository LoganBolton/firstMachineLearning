awful in a badgood waythis movie has officially become the worst made for tv movie in my bookexcept for the camp value it offers i give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the camp value suggestion watch with friends champagne and plenty of popcornyoull want to throw some at the screen preferably friends who like chris noth from his sex in the city daysthis movie is dreadfully funny this is definitely the lowest point in the careers of all cast membershonestly i dont know how they controlled the laughter as the lines were delivered daniel j travanti is absolutely pathetic everyone participated in the school of over acting and poor joan van ark i believe she was the only one taking this theater of the absurd seriouslyshe is credited as a producer though her mom jeans and bad plastic surgery are scene stealers this movie also crosses the oh so delicate line of social incorrectness when they introduce a mentally challenged character into the plot this is an obscure movie showing on lifetime listed as with harmful intenthas anyone else had the pleasure
