and totally nonscary film the characters doesnt interest at all and most of the time is spent in a car the dog is at best ugly never really scary to interest a more threatening menace would have been needed at least a few people you care for and evokes some emotions in you and not the least something interesting must happen something unexpected as it is this film just drags on and on in what seems like forever maybe a saint bernhard was not that smart to choose as the terrible threat to life and societybr br in most scary moviesthrillersmystery just whatever genre there must be characters that sparks interest and makes you want to know what happens here you really dont care you just wait for it all to stop and wondering if it wouldnt be better to see something else one of the weakest king adaptations
