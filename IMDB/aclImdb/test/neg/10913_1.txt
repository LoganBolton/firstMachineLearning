not me if it came down to it i could kick a dogs ass and thats why this movie doesnt work for me if it was me against the alien or jason or hell i dunno any other horror movie antagonist then thered be no contest and id have my ass handed to me barring divine intervention a horror movie works because it puts people in a situation with a creature person being entity whatever that is more powerful or resourceful or intelligent than they are and then people think well what if that happened to me and they get scared  and thats why this is a horrible idea for a story i cant imagine myself being terrorized by a dog so im not scared
