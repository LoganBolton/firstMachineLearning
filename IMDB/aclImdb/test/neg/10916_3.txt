1983 was a bumper year for stephen king books making it to the big screen christine the dead zone and cujo were all released within a few months of each other while the dead zone was easily the pick of the bunch christine and cujo were both pretty bad and its a closerun thing as to which is the lesser of the two if pushed for an answer id say cujo  marginally  is the weakestbr br donna trenton dee wallace fresh from success as elliots mom in et  the extra terrestrial is a mother whose marriage to husband vic daniel hughkelly is hanging by a thread shes been having an affair with a local worker and is now dwelling on whether or not to leave her husband dragged into the marital heartache is young tad trenton danny pintauro son of donna and vic and a pretty messedup kid with a chronic phobia of the dark which often leads to severe panic attacks donna and tad take the family car to a nearby mechanics yard for repairs but as they arrive their car splutters to a halt things get a heck of a lot worse when they discover that the mechanic joe camber ed lauter isnt there he has been savagely killed by his pet dog cujo a gigantic st bernard which was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat soon the dog has them trapped in their car and is trying everything to get inside the vehicle to tear apart these two hapless victims the weather is swelteringly hot not a living soul knows theyre there the car wont start and the dog seriously wants their bloodbr br cujo has potential to be a genuinely taut siege thriller but it never really clicks into gear ive read the book and it is quite disappointing  certainly for king  so its hardly surprising that the film version amounts to so little on the printed page king was at least able to generate a degree of tension but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a st bernard simply isnt very scary the visualness of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that cujo is a st bernard in the book it was possible to forget this in the book cujo sometimes almost seemed to assume the guise of a monster even with the relatively short runningtime of an hourandahalf cujo becomes a tedious and patiencestraining experience occasionally unintentionally funny and certainly never as suspenseful as it would like to be theyve even omitted the books cruelly downbeat ending and replaced it with an alls well that ends well conclusion so that audiences can go home in a cheerful mood chalk this one down as yet another inferior king adaptation
