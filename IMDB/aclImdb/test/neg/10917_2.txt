it takes an eternity for this typically oversimplistic and idiotic stephen kingbased film to finally get out of the starting blocks about halfanhour is spent on needless introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant little personal problems that might excite bored housewives and apathetic pensioners in soapy dramas but this is supposed to be the horror genre or so i naively thought the mutt fails to look all that fearsome which leonard maltin the notoriously cluelesshopeless and always grinning film critic would disagree with he considers cujo to be genuinely frightening i often do have to wonder if maltin is genuinely thick  or merely likes to do favors for his hollywood friends its both illogical and inconsistent the way wallace survives an attack with only a leg injury and naturally her car breaks down just when she needs it to save her life this is one of the oldest horrorfilm clich√©s trust king to use it to minimum effect the premise is imbecilic too banal even for a horror film a rabid mutt attacks a family is that it this sort of thing barely constitutes a 3minute subsubplot in your average zombie film i think even cujo must have sensed that he was starring in a turkey mutts have terrible agents but what i really dont understand is how people can actually throw themselves at the cujo book and read it from cover to cover these sk fans must be immortal thats the only explanation ie why they treat time as such a meaningless commoditybr br bodycount 3
