why oh why is this trash considered a classic ive seen higher body counts on episodes of the simpsons virtually nothing happens in this film and much of its running time is filled with nearly unbearable melodrama straight out of a lowrent soap operabr br the trenton family are going through tough times and when dad is away mommy and little boy go to get the car fixed but when they get to the ranch they discover that the guard dog has gone mad the rest of the film is just them sitting in the car while the slobbering st bernard circles them over and overbr br regarding the kid i have never ever seen a more annoying child in a film in my life and obviously hes completely aryan since blondehaired and blueeyed kids such as the one prominently featured on packets of kinder chocolate are apparently more sympathetic than people with brown eyes and dark hair like me all he does is cry and whine same goes for mommy she gets out the car she gets in the car she gets out the car she gets in the carbr br i know this was made in 1983 but i just sick to death of horror films where the characters make stupid illogical decisions if mommy just used some common sense shed be able to get away from the icky dogbr br its very poorly written and theres zero tension if you want to see a good bad dog movie then check out john lafias mans best friend its funny inventive has a better dog a higher body count and a more involving story leave this garbage be
