although charlie chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910s others dont quite make it examples like his new job and shanghaied come to mind and i would also the floorwalker in this categorybr br charlie gets mistaken for a manager of a department store and vice versa this manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it and charlie is just an honest costumer but getting blamed for some missing objects stolen by other costumersbr br there arent many laughs in it except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator for the rest quite disappointingbr br 410
