this movie was extremely boring i only laughed a few times i decided to rent it when i noticed william shatners name on the cover its all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates when wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist he meets a prostitute she takes him to a club called the playground where he befriends several pimps when mayor tony gold shatner decides to take over the pimp business lil pimp must lay down for his homiesbr br the animation isnt very good in this it looks like it was made with macromedia which im sure it was it doesnt suck its just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years the humor in this is not very good i didnt think any of it was funny
