it looks like people involved with this movie are stuffing the ballot box to boost its ratings the good news that apparently only 18 people have seen it i suppose that makes me the 19th i have no involvement with the flick and dont know anyone who did and im a longtime imdb user check my vote record and reviews over the past seven years so i promise im giving an honest and unbiased opinion its coming to you from a 30year horror fan who has also appeared in a couple of lowbudget flicks himselfbr br aside from a couple of interesting video effects frankensteins bloody nightmare is incoherent boring and technically flawed beyond all reason it was apparently shot on silent stock and the audio then dubbed in most of it sounds like it was recorded with a tin can and a piece of string anyhow more than three quarters of the dialog is inaudiblebr br i watched this from beginning to end and have no idea of what the story was or even if there was one it seems like the director is mostly impressing himself with long panning shots of the corners of table and dead black spaces that do nothing but pad the film out that would be a problem if one were actually developing a plot and making a film that had some sense of pacing in this case though the rule doesnt apply it doesnt matter how scenes are shot because they dont add up to a storybr br watching this video is an exercise in futility at every level whatever people who worked on it are writing and however theyre trying to influence the ratings here on imdb this is just bad tedious stuffbr br thats the honest truth if youre thinking of spending your money or time on this one think again its easy to find something better because you wont find much worsebr br and thats the unbiased unvarnished truth
