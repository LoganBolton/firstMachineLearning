my husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than fatal attraction well not liking either michael douglas or glenn close i would have to agree not for conventional reasons thoughbr br this is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you dont want to watch something that really requires thought but dont want to go to bed yetbr br yancy butler is a really enjoyable badguy she is not the best of actresses in fact she isnt even good but she is perfect for this role in this film everyone else in it varies from pine to oak including the slightly disturbing boy who comes across as a warped pinocchiobr br spoiler the ending goes a step or two too far complete with the clich√© not quite dead up with a roar still gonna get you moment and then theres a shot of pinocchio with his frozen wooden smirk which makes you wonder if they were going for chilling or just forgot there was botox in the makeupbr br regardless its a hilarious eighty odd minutes and despite being a bad film you would have to be lacking the humour gene to not enjoy it somewhat dont pay for it but if youre in that kind of apathetic telly mood then this is just right
