astounding that something like this could find its way to be viewed by the public i knew it was by uwe boll  i found it in the bargain bin at a store for 2 still pretty steep considering but morbid curiosity led me to view this and br br 1 i am fairly sure this is a ripoff of seven silence of the lambs and american psycho all rolled into one with dialog that may have been written by preteensbr br 2 casper van dien plays the main character and hes so absolutely bizarre and creepy that just about anyone would know he must be the crazed serial killerbr br 3 jennifer rubin plays the good cop that invites a serial killer to her apartment for a home cooked dinner and what does she get for her trouble ill let you guessbr br 4 michael pare plays an intense cop who drives a vw bug newstyle that is with a siren on it a vw bugthatll strike fear into criminals hearts when they see that comingbr br 5 van dien breaks up with his fianc√© but she still has an not engaged party complete with not a wedding cake imagine everyones surprise he shows up he was of course invited and they all get shotbr br 6 actually this should have been 1 really the killer in this is known as the monkey maker this is without a doubt the stupidest killer name anyone could have come up with in a million years presumably it has something to do with the see no evil hear no evil speak no evil saying complete with monkeys its possible that monkeys had something to do with the script toobr br 7 oh yeah and theres a club that van dien visits near the beginning of the film theres bad disco music i mean really bad and a chainlink fenced cage with uh gang members beating the crap out of each other with baseball bats thats what it looked like and of course this is only the tip of the iceberg the really cool stuff  goes on in the basement where some questionable actor talks some woman into signing a confession before she gets shot this being i guess a snuff movie not quite sure how this fits in with the rest of the film and boll probably wasnt either so if he wasnt worried then i wont worrybr br an incredible piece of nonentertainment that will make you feel like youre watching something from a parallel universe a parallel universe thats kind of like ours but where things are just enough off where they dont seem right you have entered the boll zone exit as quickly as possible  dont look backbr br 2 out of 10
