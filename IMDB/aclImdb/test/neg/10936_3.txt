i went into this movie with low expectations knowing uwe bolls legacy as a film director and screenplay writer and i was still disappointed uwe boll finds a way to make each and every movie he is involved in worse and worse the overall concept wasnt a bad one a man bored with his life as a stock broker becomes a serial killer but the problem with the movie is there is no in between he goes straight from stock broker to serial killer the film has noname actors and i can see why after watching the movie i cant see why any actor with a career would want to even be involved in this movie anyone who turned it down did their careers a favor and if you havent seen it do yourself a favor and dontbr br i give sanctimony a 3 out of 10
