oh my oh this is a really bad movie the acting is absolutely atrocious the script is godawful and the photography is simply dreadfulbr br what does make this movie stand out however is that you never once care about a single soul good guy or bad guy living dying or dead in the entire 87 minutes oh she died huh figured they would was the best reaction i could muster after each murder characters are so blackorwhite that with the volume turned off you could still figure out who was who while the casts voices had an odd monotone quality throughout their faces give the impression that youre looking at an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow waggling exaggerated frowns and pensive looks each character is a humorless passionless onedimensional onetrick pony once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco demanded their creation they are summarily dismissedbr br it vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas borch nielsen directorwriter of skyggen american title webmaster decided to do a lowbudget version of american psycho and got kind of distracted along the waybr br this isnt a particularly gruesome movie the cold passionless cast ensures that it isnt an offensive movie the director plays it so safe that no one could possibly find it so it is simply and after all a bad moviebr br avoid it we were not so fortunate and actually paid to watch this bomb on payperview as part of my penance im writing this reviewbr br enough said
