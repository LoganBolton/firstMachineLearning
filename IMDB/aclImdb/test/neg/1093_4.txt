i dont know if this exceptionally dull movie was intended as an unofficial sequel to the french connection but it does have many of the same drawbacks the script is so confusing that the viewer remains uninvolved and feels left out of the picture and the direction is so cold so lacking in energy that even the great chase sequence cant liven things up 12
