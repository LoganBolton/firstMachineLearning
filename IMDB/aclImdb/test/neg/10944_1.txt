most people get the luxury of typing in the title of a film and finding out about the film before watching it but unfortunately ive just never been one of those kind of people i wouldnt even read the synopsis for fear of spoilers but there are two sides to that because if you ignore such warnings and even give a film a chance after it has flopped in theatres youre entering at your own risk and might just end up with a bad taste in your mouth which is exactly how i feel about this stupid moviebr br honestly the only thing good about shakalakacrapcrap are some of it songs and seriously excluding the title track even the ever promising kangana renauts talent metro gangster woh lamhe is seriously wasted here as she plays ruhi the woman who has captured the attention of both the leading male characters played by bobby deol who plays aj a rootless music producer and upen patel who plays reggi an upcoming artist who crosses ajs path celina jaitley provides the right amount of oomph required of a socialite who gets jilted by reggi whom she helped get his foot in the record industrys door this doesnt sound like a mix or movie that should include anupam kher right well youre wrong because hes in it as reggis father another wasted talentbr br the film might not have been so bad had their not overkilled the writing behind deols character the moral message was too preachy revenge had a deadly dark side and the ending was way too overblown that it will make you wonder why you sat down to such a foolish movie in the first place truly this is the epitome of crap
