the film was half over before i managed to figure out what was going on its a dogs breakfast of a movie about four family thanksgiving dinners the cliches and stereotypes tumble over each other when its all over ten hours later  well it seems like ten hours  youre puzzling over what it was all about i dont want to see a movie about dinner table squabbling there is enough of it in my own family the turkeys looked pretty good the rest gave me indigestion
