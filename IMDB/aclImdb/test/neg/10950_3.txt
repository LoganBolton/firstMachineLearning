after watching this movie on a boring saturday afternoon i couldnt quite figure out why so many people liked it it wasnt heartwarming or clever it was merely an amalgam of every other mismatched people coming together during a holiday and despite their ideological differences learning something about each other movie ever madebr br the characters are a stereotype bouillabaisse  we have the blacks the hispanics the jews the asians and the homosexuals  and they never do anything except what everyone expects characters in a movie like this to do the black mother declares that its all right then when its mentioned that another black character is at church instead of helping prepare dinner because all blacks love church the hispanics seem only capable of speaking spanish when the greet each other or make exclamations the lesbians do nothing but cuddle and kiss and one of them wears a bandanna because all lesbians dress like ani difranco and the vietnamese family owns a video store in la imagine thatbr br oh and the movie is called whats cooking because each ethnic family cooks a different version of what they think thanksgiving dinner should be the black mother wants cornbread and macaroni and cheese the hispanics are shown rolling tortillas the vietnamese family is deep frying spring rolls im surprised there wasnt a bottle of manischewitz on the jewish table this is all shown via the timehonored tradition of the musicalmontage where they play the surfaris wipeout rapidly switching the instruments used in the melody to reflect the respective cultures isnt that cute anyway once the director is finished establishing how different everyone is he attempts to show the inner humanity that we as all people of every race religion and culture share by inventing implausible and overly dramatic conflicts for each of the families to deal with it would be a plotkiller to mention what each of these conflicts are but rest assured that they are indeed surprises that is if you have been sleeping for the first half of the movie the theme of disgracing the family runs pretty strong throughoutbr br all in all if youre the type of person who enjoys those newfangled movies that revolve around the stories of unlikely characters intertwining well you still wont like this movie if you like extended montages of food being passed around a table then you need to put this in your netflix queue but if stereotypes and clich√©s are endearing to you then make sure you ask for this for christmas or hanukkah or kwanzaa
