this movie baffled me i could not get a grip on it thought i might be missing something glad to see that most of you agree with me this isnt always the case see my recent review of re extinctionbr br to expound upon the faults of this film any further would be a glorious waste of timeso i willbr br theyre dressed like cowboys but its modern times right no i dont get it when i picked up the box i thought zombie western cool thats how it was presented havent seen that yet hope they did a good jobbr br they didnt they tried to create an iconic character that would spawn a series they didntbr br they tried to make an aussie indie zombie flick on the caliber and perhaps riding on the coat tails of the very well done undead they didntbr br okay maybe they just wanted to make a confusing disjointed mess of film salad that might ultimately be edited into something watchable they didnt this is the new number 2 on my list of worst zombie movies ever there are really just the two so far day of the dead contagium being the first not to be confused with day of the dead which is one of my favorite zombie movies of all time if youre gonna make a zombie movie and im not a zombie movie maker im just a connoisseur make a good one flight of the living dead is a good example of decent recent zombie filmaking fyibr br if youre really forgiving you might think well didnt they at least throw in something to make us feel like we didnt want our money back guess whatthey didnt
