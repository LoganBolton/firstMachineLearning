im no director or writer or anything related to a movie but watching more than 1 movie everyday has given me the idea of what is a good movie or not so here it is the quick and the undead is a ripoff of the quick and the dead i was thinking that it could be a little bit of a parody of a cool movie with lots of starts in it but oh no i was really in for an very big disappointmentbr br to put it simply the movie sucks im a big fan of gore movies but this one just gives you gore here and there but they are not that consistentbr br but i have to give them credit in creating gruesome characters which has given me a little bit of squirmbr br if youre a big fan of zombies watch this if youre notbetter look for other rob zombie films
