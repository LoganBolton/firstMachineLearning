well here we have a zombie movie that perhaps isnt even being much of a zombie movie the entire movie is set in a zombieplagued near future but yet the movie does very little with this concept instead it focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get revenge and his money back from a group of other bounty hunters what good is money anyway when almost the entire world has gone to hell and towns are mostly desolate and why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place as if people would not go on to kill this dangerous threatening monsters when they are not getting paidbr br needless to say that the story for the quick and the undead is far from a tight one it of course also isnt being filled with the most logical and interesting moments characters or dialogbr br still its not a completely horrible movie it certainly aint as bad as some people try to make you believe it is its a rather good looking one or rather said the movie at least doesnt have a cheap look over it its effects may be a bit overused but nevertheless they are quite good looking as are the makeup effects as wellbr br still the movie was not what i hoped of it its title might suggest that the movie is set in the wild wild west during the days of the cowboys but its title is just a misleading one no doubt picked to cash in on it i fell for it expecting this movie to be a combination of a western and a gory zombiehorrorflickbr br for the fans of the zombie movies this movie will mostly be a disappointment to watch it of course adds nothing new to the genre but it also doesnt has enough of the genre itself in it to be considered a good one to watchbr br not totally unwatchable but also far from a recommendable onebr br 410
