the plot of the movie is pretty simple  a viral outbreak turned the population into flesheating zombies those who left became huntersbr br well first of all this is not the worst zombie movie there is among the worst are zombiez and the infamous zombie lakebr br in fact i think the idea for quick and the undead was very good just executed poorly considering the budget they had to work with this movie looks very good i wasnt bored at all while watching it special effects were solid although they did use cgi once fat zombie getting shot in the head but everything else gore guts was rather good acting is awful however our main guy looks like young clint eastwood other actors are not even worth mentioning as far as the plot goes they didnt work enough on the development of the storybr br bad  acting lowbudget good  special effects idea for the moviebr br overall this flick deserves 410 from me its not as bad as people say imagine a zombie western then watch this movie
