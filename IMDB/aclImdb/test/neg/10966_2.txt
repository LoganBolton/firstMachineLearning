the trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre setting it in the old west except its not the real old west of course its some sort of future west in a world where some apocalypse has as apocalypses are known to do killed people and subsequently turned them into zombies its zombie virus time again folks and you know what that means get bitten and become one of thembr br so into this dusty and deadfilled world comes a hero hes a bountyhunter getting paid for taking care of zombies its not exactly clear who is providing the funds but it seems a little cottage industry of zombiehunting has emerged but as the trailer tells us theres a problem they are running out of zombies the only way to keep on earning is to infect new towns and cities with the virusbr br i think thats not a bad idea for a film but unfortunately it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people pawing at windows to make a good zombie film what we actually get is a clint eastwood clone the actors even called clint for crying out loud and his hilarious sidekick trying to bag zombies while trailing some stillliving bad guys to get some big reward the whole subplot about infecting other towns is only mentioned in passing over halfway through the film instead theres a lot of western movie clichés poor zombie makeup and some worldclass bad acting really bad the sort that wouldnt even make it onto hollyoaks both hero and villain chomp on cigars quips are thrown people get bitten as the movie lurches to a conclusion the only thing worth wondering is whether its going to end with the cliché of the hero being the only man alive having killed the one he loves or the cliché of him turning into a zombie in the final frame its the first one by the way this film was written and directed by gerald nott its the only thing he has done and hopefully it will be his last at the start of the film there is a caption that reads nott entertainment at least they got one thing right
