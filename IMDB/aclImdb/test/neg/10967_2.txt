one look at the rating ought to tell you this movie was voted on by shills in an attempt to artificially boost this films ratingsbr br this film brings nothing new to the zombie genre in fact it is laughably bad in acting and cinematography and derivative in its plot the makeup looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when shot lines are stiffly delivered and badly timed with the exception of the female bounty hunter who is the only good actor in this mess of a film the worst offenders are the italian guy hans ryn the protagonist and the lead bad guy ive seen better delivery from pizza truck with a flat tire br br this is a selfproclaimed zombie western but about the only thing that makes this a zombie western is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and the lead actors real name is clint the protagonist isnt cool and mysterious like a traditional eastwood hero and as an antihero he doesnt have the wisecracking attitude to pull it off eitherbr br dont be fooled by the fake glowing reviews this is just another bgrade zombie movie thats competently made for the budget it had it does have some decent lighting but it reeks of lowbudget firsttime directing and bad acting there are a lot of really stupid scenes that make this look really amateurish
