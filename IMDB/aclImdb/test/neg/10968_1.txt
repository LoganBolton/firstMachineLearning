looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic but yet again its just another example of poor independent film makers trying to drum up interest in their movie they arent even being smart about it 1010 in the votes i guess that to buck the curve and offset all the 110s it will get is this better than any decent zombie movie nobr br acting corny and rubbishbr br sound effects cheap and nasty if it wasnt for where the actors looked you wouldnt know where it was coming frombr br cinematography these people act like they have borrowed their dads camera right after watching the matrix less is more but more from this team is absolutely papbr br zombies are rubbish as well i dont doubt most of these people will never be heard from again and it will be for good reason i hope zombies eat their eyes as this was 90 minutes of pap that i wont get backbr br and falsifying ratings just makes it a million times worsebr br one reviewer said it was one of the best horror movies he has seen in the last 30 years i can only assume that his recent cornea transplant was a success thenbr br watch the trailer as thats a warning as to how bad this film is
