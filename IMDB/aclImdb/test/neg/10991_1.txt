like the other comments says this might be surprise to those who havent seen the work of jeunet  caro or emir kusturica but have you already seen delicatessen there is nothing new it this film i thought delicatessen was great when it came out but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest i dont think its a worse film than delicatessen but its a bore to see it now like it probably would be to watch delicatessen again there is really no point to the film nothing that really matter or stays with you there may be a distant similarity to the films of kusturica but hes really in a different league so you should rather go see his films than waste your time on tuvalu
