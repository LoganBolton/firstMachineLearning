one of the worst movie i have seen in 2009 so far the story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedybr br as nothings happens the void is filled with long boring dialogs that dont make any sense br br the cast is famous but doesnt bring any emotions except to fastforward the play br br and it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy in comparison the one of the shining is funfair br br nb a lot of users think that it is located in the french riviera they are wrong it isnt the south of france nice cannes but totally the opposite cabourg  normandy to be simple the beaches of the dday thats why the sea is as grey as the sky and there isnt sun
