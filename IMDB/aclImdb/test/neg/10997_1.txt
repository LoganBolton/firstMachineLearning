i saw this on cable someone had to lose their job for greenlighting this one for air just because a movie is made does not mean it has to be shown savage instinct should be shown in all film classes it is the perfect template for how to not make a movie the editing alone is so jumbled youll think it was assembled by a team of trained poorly monkeys traveling across unpaved canyon road in the back of a jeep blindfolded and drunk the audio is often not legible acting i cant call anything i saw here acting reciting hmmm cant call it that either failing that works all that being saidit is hilarious i cannot stress enough that there is not one redeemable factor in this film other than the hilarity derived from its own incredible ineptness fun in a strictly masochistic sort of way watch itif you dare
