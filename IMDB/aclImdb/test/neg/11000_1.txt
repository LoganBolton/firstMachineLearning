this is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever it really does not qualify for movie status it is very cheap apparently shot on videotape horribly acted and just plain rotten i could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of crap was it looked like a home video i mean i believe a guy i know a few houses down must have dug out his video camera and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours it is that bad i noticed the name from whence this cameasylumand i will never rent anything with that name on it again when you rent a flick check to see if it is from this company one thing is true thoughif you like horribly acted amateur movies then you might like this loser it is absolutely boring and terrible you have been warned
