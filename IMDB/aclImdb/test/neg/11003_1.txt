this film is terrible  honestly the acting is terrible the script made me cringe the effects are completely lousy which i usually dont mind for older films but this was made just two years ago and everything about it just annoys me a few friends go out on halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son of course before that it has the clich√© you really believe that ha ha ha its just a story routine dragged out for a while the witchs cannibal son was made a retard i dont know if it was for comedy or to make it creepy but this film failed at both it has minimal gore and no nudity which made a bad film even worse heck the only good thing about this film is the leg eating scene and even that could of been betterbr br honestly dont even waste your time watching it on cable and certainly dont consider buying or renting this else youll be kicking yourself for wasting time which could of been spent doing something more constructive or entertaining
