i went into this movie with an open mind i had been too lazy to go to the video store to pick out a movie and my friend returned with this i promised him i wouldnt laugh at his choice but within the first five minutes i told him i would have to take back my promise we kept watching just hoping it would get better but no a continual mindrape followedbr br this movie was probably one of the worse ever committed to film and surely deserves a place on the imdb bottom 100 i really dont know how this got distributed the lighting was poor i have seen better acting in elementary school plays there is really nothing positive to say about it
