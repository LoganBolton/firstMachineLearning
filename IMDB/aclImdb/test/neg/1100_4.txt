wicked little things known in australia as zombies is a rare find  a film that promises one thing but delivers another it is one of the few genre films to be made by millennium pictures a european film studio known for making various bgrade action films  thrillers some featuring action star jeanclaude van dammebr br karen tunny  her two daughters sarah  emma arrive in the pennsylvanian town of addytown in order to move into a large house that karens late husband owned after finding a miners deed in his effects once arriving they find that the house is very old  in need of repair but the houses condition is the least of their problems as they discover that the area is prone to disappearances  karen is confronted by the areas owner  ordered to move out once night falls the tunnys find out the reason behind the vanishings a group of zombie children killed in a mine collapse in the area more than 85 years ago come out to kill anything that goes in the woods with the help of a grizzled neighbour karen attempts to end the curse before her  her children become the next victimsbr br i bought the dvd expecting a film with flesheating zombies but was let down by one thing the film is more akin to a ghost story than your usual zombie flick with the dead children being the embodiment of a curse that haunts the woods taking their revenge on anything that moves around at night although the internal logic is somewhat flawed  the children can only be appeased by the sacrifice of animals  are repelled by blood wards on doors in the same manner that vampires are repelled by garlic  mirrors  arent these kids supposed to be zombies the plot as such would not be a problem  would actually be entertaining but the main problem is that the producers adapted a script with the intention of making a zombie film only to fall flat on their faces with this effortbr br as such a film like this would be okay as a ghost story but due to a poor script becomes nothing more than an entirely routine effort the films greatest strength is the acting with the cast giving better performances than the film deserves of particular note is scout taylorcompton who does her role quite well  its a shame she ruins her genre cred with a very poor performance in the halloween remake or maybe its just rob zombies script
