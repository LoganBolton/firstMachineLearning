id heard this japanese flick is edgy creatively interesting a cool new thang on the asian moviemaking scene  maybe even something as innovative as hideo nakatas ringu or chanwook parks oldboy especially the latterbr br you can imagine my disappointment when instead i found the movie disjointed both narratively and cinematically though not in a way that a film aficionado appreciates clich√©ridden even sadly silly instead of funny  on the whole a very bad knock off of the pulp fiction stylebr br i stopped watching after 30 minutes when i gave up on it becoming something more than it is
