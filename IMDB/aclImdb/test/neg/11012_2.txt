ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs watermellons people etc this may be an admirable characteristic because ants carry the film phase iv this is not because they want to but because they have tobr br the movie opens with a narrator cryptically explaining that some cosmic event has come over the earth and that a fellow scientist has been working on the effect this disturbance has on the ant population the movie is broken up in segments the first part after the cosmic event is phase i and so on until the end of the movie which is phase ivbr br what is phase iv who knows we dont get to see that part presumably it has something to do with the bonding of one of the scientists studying the ants and a girl who lived in the area the girl who looks like a cross between alicia silverstone and liv tyler is mad at the ants because they killed her horse but except for one angry outburst goes around the biodome with a blank clueless lookbr br these ants are pretty smart or the scientists are rather dumb ill give credit to the ants why anything that usually ruins my picnics that can then build reflecting towers blow up trucks and adapts to poison with the greatest of ease gets my vote for being the smarter species at least in this moviebr br sterno says stomp on this anthillbr br
