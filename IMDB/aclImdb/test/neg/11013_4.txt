if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirtmirrors eating nonants and conquering the world with a voiceover narrative then this is the movie for you basically a couple of scientists working out of a biodome communicate with highly intelligent ants the most intelligent actors in this film in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination throughout the movie the two scientists and a girl they rescued from the ants use everything at their disposal computers green dye and horrid acting but to no avail i guess they just couldnt afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quicklybr br the title of the movie phase iv is something of a mystery this is not a spoiler but phase i starts right after the opening credits whereas you dont reach phase iv until the end credits roll apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed phases 1  3 throughout the movie as a kind of progress report hang in there buddy only 1 more phase until final credits as a mst3k episode this one wasnt very good for two reasons 1 this one is from the season 0 on ktma when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons and 2 this movie is so bad not even jtb can lighten it up there are one or two gamera references as they had just finished riffing 5 gamera moviesbr br the movie does have a tricksurprise ending but i was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me
