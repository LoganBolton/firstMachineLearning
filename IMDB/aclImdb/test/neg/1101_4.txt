having spent all of her money caring for her terminally ill spouse recently widowed karen tunny lori heuring moves with her two daughters sarah scout taylorcompton and emma chloe moretz to her late husbands rundown family home in rural pennsylvania where local legends speak of zombies who roam the woods at nightbr br just seeing the names of this films writer and director in the opening credits was enough to send shivers up my spine boaz davidson is the genius responsible for penning the scripts for such stv titles as octopus 1  2 spiders and crocodile whilst js cardone gave us the godawful video nasty the slayer and dull vampire flick the forsaken with such dubious talent responsible i didnt expect much from wicked little thingsbr br and having just finished the film im glad i kept my expectations lowbr br although the movie looks good at times with lovely use of the eerie woodland locale and the cast give reasonable performances given the clichéd drivel that they are working with the plot is so laboured poorly written and derivative that its impossible to be enthusiastic about most importantly perhaps the films killers undead children who rise each night from the mine in which they died arent in the least bit scary a smudge of makeup black contacts and some crappy joke shop scars doing very little to add to the sense of menace scout taylorcompton and company do their best to look afraid of the tiny terrors screaming convincingly with every confrontation but their admirable attempts to instill a sense of fear in the audience is to little avail the little blighters just aint got what it takes to chill the bloodbr br there are a few lacklustre zombie chow scenes in a futile bid to win over gorehounds and the final kill which sees the victims blood drench both compton and heuring is suitably tasteless but on the whole wicked little things aka zombies in the uk is instantly forgettable trashjust another clunker in the filmographies of cardone and davidson
