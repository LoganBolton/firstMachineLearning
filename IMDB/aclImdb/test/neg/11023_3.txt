since id bought the dvd i watched as much of this as i did out of a sense of obligation to my walletbr br the plot has kirk douglas as a successful first novelist who hired laraine day as a secretary falls in love and marries her complications ensuebr br douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor given to heavily dramatic roles sometimes hero sometimes rat hes not bad in this thoroughly comic part the problem is that the part isnt particularly comic and neither is anything elsebr br the plot rambles on a dozen quirky characters come and go  most prominently keenan wynn as douglass friend who does nothing but make wry comments thelma ritter was better at this sort of thingbr br well if the plot is weak it could still have been rescued by some sparkle in the dialog but there is none to speak of some gags are silly others dont clear that bar heres what i thought of as an amusing line douglas has just hired day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her day is disturbed and remarks that shes never heard of a writer working in a beach house wynn asks if she liked douglass previous book last years love yes of course she did well most of last years love was done in the beach house ha habr br nice cast including support but a failed comedy there have been better sitcoms on television
