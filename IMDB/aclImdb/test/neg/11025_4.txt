i decided to watch this movie because id not seen carol lombard before in any movie im sorry it had to be this one because quite frankly this is a dog  and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn both of whom were great actorsbr br the problem with the film is simple it tries to put too much too quickly in to a story about a young lawyer john manson played by stewart who marries jane played by lombard within an hour of meeting her whats that cliché marry in haste repent at leisure br br in short the story is a series of episodes that show the couples worsening financial status their troubles with johns livein mother their struggles to pay the bills johns diminished status at the office the arrival of their baby son john jnr unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother the couples angst about their marriage the babys sickness which worsens thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot in a fierce storm to bring a special serum to save the child and finally john being accepted as a junior partner at the law firmbr br how many more clichéd situations could the writers include maybe mother dying soon after there wasnt much comedy the drama was lacklustre at best the dialog was painful to hear only the acting of the four main players was adequatebr br this was the period at the end of the great depression with the usa coming out of its long downturn  during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the moviebr br so it made sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol home spun american values of family relationships heroism perseverance and initiative  all against the backdrop of the average american family who better to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard br br and it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939 so it was planned in 1938  soon after the usa began to get production going for the coming world war ii hence this sort of film was a great booster for the general public at that time many of who would soon have to join england in war as many here would know hollywood and washington formed an uneasy alliance before during and after the warbr br however im glad i saw it  as a piece of disguised sociopolitical propaganda but ill have to see other lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting rangebr br as another reviewer noted see this one just to say that youve seen all of stewarts movies otherwise dont bother
