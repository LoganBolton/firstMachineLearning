when i bought 4 dvds for Â£5oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was not up to the usual standard of david selznick productions with a cast containing such names as james stewart and carole lombard i was looking forward to a real treat as many other commentators have said it is an odd mixture of plot and scenes that doesnt quite convince however i am so glad that i did view this film as i now have the memorable saying never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon to live by this should sum up everyones life pick out those seeds or spit them out or swallow them  and then enjoy the watermelon  life itself
