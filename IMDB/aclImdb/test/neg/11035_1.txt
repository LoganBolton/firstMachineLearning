watched this film with an audience of5 in total had a choice between lakshya and asambhavrealized then i should have gone for lakshya a typical plotindia v pakistanbut just isnt cricket as you have kashmir in the middle an indian super hero goes on a mission to save the president of india from some pakistani rebels who are involved in a mass drug smuggling racket i left the film half way as it was simply boring and the plot was confusing and all over the place the songs were also awful the film tries to hide the flaws with its special effects but unfortunately they are outdated toobr br overallavoid it if you can has to be the worst film ive seen this year
