a pretentious but  to varying degrees  watchable collection of mostly pointless storiesbr br but lets start from the topbr br kaurismaki if one ever wondered what finnish loveromance was like perhaps this dull little oddity is some indication subdued feelings nonemotions apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from finland to siberia i guess the sequel to this story will be for our honeymoon we move from siberia to greenland aki obviously had no clue what to write for this little movie so he just made up some halfassed nonstory centering around a band he particularly likes or maybe theyre his friends because we get to watch them and listen to their music more than the two principal charactersbr br erice first off ive never heard of this guy before  and now i know why nice blackwhite photography and pretty much nothing else  unless being bored silly can be considered an asset but youd be surprised how many moviecritics and film students love boredom in movies so i hotly recommend erices 10minute snoozefest to those two groups of humanoidsbr br herzog not a movie but probably a slice out of his documentaries about tribes in south america this isnt a short film but a report but considering how dull the first two entries were herzogs bit is almost refreshing and does have some interesting moments and if nothing else fits into the movies pretentious time concept very neatlybr br jarmusch as was to be almost expected this onceinteresting filmmaker with the brain of a peanut a talented idiot savant serves us yet another doze of pointlessness he has become lazy and cant be bothered to write anything interesting either for his own movies or a collection such as tmo the only bright side in watching how a dumb veggie actress spends 10 minutes in a trailer is that she is played by the lovely chloe sevigny otherwise skip this nonsense oh and btw i dont believe that any young actress listens to classical music was jarmusch trying to be surreal by making chloe listen to that kind of music does lindsey lohan perhaps listen to opera maybe drew barrymore is a jazz fan who am i to say they arentbr br jim jarmusch is a moron oh right i already mentioned thatbr br wenders here is the actual shock of the whole movie wenders can actually make something good everything else ive seen from this overrated charlatan has so far been dull and pointless however this short little story is done with style  atypical and is the best part of the movie it leaves one wanting to see more of it even though the story has a resolutionbr br spike lee oh dear lord what can i say here lee makes anyone seem talented by comparison like herzog he chooses not a story but submits a report  and a leftwing political propaganda report at that cnn but in black and white and onesided of course naturally we wuz robbed the retarded title of this little sleepinducer is about how the poor gullible and infinitely idealistic democrats wuz robbed by bush and his evil evil team of thieves this is by far the dumbest and dullest entry in this movie and i had to utilize the fastforward button so as not to doze off spike lee truly is a product of affirmative action god knows how many really talented black directors never had a chance to make movies because this pretentious and talentless little runt keeps getting opportunity after opportunity to make them and he gets it wrong every time now that does take some kind of talent right br br kaige the chinese story has a solid premise its okay nothing morebr br all in all there are many and far better movies to spend your time on but if your time isnt that valuable as is apparently the case with my own you can check this little film outbr br ten minutes sure can be an eternity in the hands of antimasters of cinema time is precious waste it on better movies  fedor miklowitz 1588
