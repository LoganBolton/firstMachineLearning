let me get this out of the way before i trash this film i love park chanwooks work as a director while i disagree with the masses saying hes is the best director working in our time i cant deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively i really liked one of his other films sympathy for mr vengeance also minsik chois acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously    for 15 of the runtime that isbr br now the bad the plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinemaliterature ill never understand how critics can trash a hollywood blockbuster for being cliché then hail movies like oldboy which are just as unoriginal and clichéd if not even more so regardless oldboy is flatout one of the most generic unoriginal movies ever conceived spoilers man is held captive man seeks revenge man finds out he had sex with a family member mans life is over end spoilers simply put this plot line has been used in everything from greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless moviesbooks in between it is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the major reveal happens i laughed out loud does that mean im a desensitized freak without emotions as some reviews of this film say about people like me no what it means overdone plots make people laugh the scary movie franchise proved that and oldboy proved it as well why cant people think of something that is truly disturbing instead of just spewing out tried clichés masked with fancy camerawork and classical music that brings up the issue of bloodgore simply put it isnt there the director is too timid to even point the camera at the screen when something gory happens as if were watching a childrens movie or something maybe we were anyway ive heard oldboy called the most brutal movie of all time and the most disturbing movie ever but when i watched it i failed to see anything even remotely gory or disturbing all the gore is offscreen and even then the violence level is nothing you havent seen in pg13 movies like the dark knight or casino royale before why this even got an rrating confuses me much less the most brutal movie of all time seriously ive seen movies that just make oldboy look cute on every level when it comes to violencegorebr br the other huge glaring cheesy flaw is the main villain the majority of his screen time hes showing his bare butt off for the audience in comedic american piestyle but im supposed to think hes ohsoevil when hes wearing clothes his hair is slicked back like a bad asian mix of the cheesiest james bond villain mixed with something out of austin powers he talks like a braindead teenager recovering from an acid overdose and his dialogue is so bad it had me laughing yet again seriously oldboy had me laughing more than any comedy this year   br br in the end oldboy is for those of you who sip fine wine have no sense of humor and talk about how boring your lives are at dinner parties its for those people who are so stuck up in their own ego they forgot how unoriginal they are and consequently forgot how unoriginal and boring the films never movies they enjoy arebr br to those people all i can say is this i like films and also like movies i like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about the human condition and i also like pointless action movies that thrill me into a coma but the thing is for me to like both films and movies they have to be original they have to be something i havent seen so many times i lost count of the number of times the plot has been used when something isnt original its expendable if it does exactly what everyone else does its forgettable and boring before you give oldboy yet another perfect rating because it touched you maybe you should think about something wouldnt a movie equally as touching but at the same time original make you think more i just wish someone other than me would understand thisbr br overall oldboy is forgettable and cheesybr br 110
