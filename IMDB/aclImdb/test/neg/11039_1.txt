 so some people might argue that this cant possible be the worst movie ever made and no its not i have seen movies with weaker plots worse acting and so onbr br so why do i hate this movie Ã¼ber alles well its basically about a man who gets kidnapped for many years and when he comes out he tries to find out who did it and why to get revenge the problem i have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror butbr br major spoilers stop reading if you dont want to know br br our main character basically gets tricked into having sex with his own daughter and he wants to cut out his own tongue so his enemy wont tell her because she didnt know it is so humiliating as he crawls on his knees like a dog in total submission and why did he deserve this because many years ago he saw a brother and a sister have a tender moment  in the wrong way he went on and told some people and as a result she commits suicide and viola its the brother who put our main character through all this just for that i have wondered maybe i hate this movie so much because i think his punishment is way too harsh maybe because i feel this movie doesnt condemn incest but somehow confuses it with love maybe its because i expected something elsebr br end of spoilersbr br believe me nobody deserves what happens to our main character in the end and im very serious you know how some movies just go under your skin and stay there well i felt goddamn dirty after watching this movie and i really wish id never seen it it stayed with me for days and some might ask well isnt that the purpose of a good movie the ability to affect us in such ways yes it can be but this movie not only made me sick it made me feel violated
