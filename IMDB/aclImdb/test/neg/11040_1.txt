when one of my friends recommended this to me raving about how well it was filmed the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film i obviously expected an amazing at least entertaining filmbr br the two hours i spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my timebr br i understand that this movie is meant to be surreal but even in surreal movies there is something which anchors it down even if it is only in the slightest this movie on the other hand felt forced and fake a lot of the shots were unnecessary and watching it made me think the director was trying to hard to be artisticbr br the acting was poor and the relationships between characters were not nearly developed enough maybe thats just me missing something that others could see but i hadnt even realised there was any sort of attraction between dae su and migo before they started getting at it like rabbits randomly half way through the film then again maybe this film was just badbr br i am not against violence in movies but in this one almost all of it was just unnecessary throughout all the fight scenes i felt myself cringing at how painfully clich√© it all wasbr br and the plot the word laughable comes to mind i would be amused if i hadnt wasted two hours of my life following this poorly thought out and ridiculous plot despite all the movies flaws by the end of it i was expecting something interesting to conclude it i wont discuss the ending because i wouldnt want to spoil the movie for those who havent seen it just that the metaphor be it a rock or a grain of sand in water they sink as the same cannot be used as an explanation for everythingbr br this entire movie was made for shock value and shock value only i just hope sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and recognise a bad movie for what it is ive seen many other great korean films and it depresses me that people have hailed oldboy as the best
