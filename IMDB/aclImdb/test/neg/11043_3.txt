oldboy is set in korea  starts as a drunken daesu oh minsik choi is bailed out of the police station by his friend only to be abducted daesu wakes up  finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned in for the next fifteen years daesu is fed  looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room daesu begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he intends to do by scrapping away the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick however before daesu finishes he is gassed  rendered unconscious when he wakes up daesu finds himself free on the roof of a tall building dressed  all moneyed up daesu instantly sets about trying to find out who imprisoned him after meeting the pretty mido hyejeong kang the two fall in love  together with her help daesu finally finds what he is looking for but the truth comes at a pricebr br this south korean production was cowritten  directed by chanwook park  has gotten any number of glowing reviews the sort that distributors can pick quotes out  plaster them on the video box  even won the grand prize of the jury at cannes while it was also nominated for the golden palm so surely oldboy is a true classic well not for me it isnt since as i cant understand why its so liked  i would go as far as to say i pretty much hated it apart from one or two isolated moments for a start i couldnt get into the story at all i just didnt like it as i thought it was slow  boring  while many out there would have you believe oldboy has the bestest most shocking twist ever i thought it was rather plain  not very well executed either the ending in which daesu goes to the new zealand alps to be hypnotised feels tagged on as well almost as if the makers wanted some sort of happy ending at almost two hours i almost fell asleep i was so bored the violence is tame  its the thought of whats happening that i would imagine most people have a problem with rather than what is actually shown in fact oldboy has a very low body count of about seven  one mild sex scene its really not that graphic or memorable i didnt warm to any of the characters  while i accept oldboy has an alright concept  premise it fails to deliver  its one film that i will never understand why so many people seem to likebr br based on a japanese manga of the same name oldboy the film looks alright theres one or two nice visual moments here although while everyone raves about the hallway fight that takes place in one continuous shot i was pretty unimpressed  thought the fight choreography was quite dull the actual onscreen gore violence amounts to very little daesu eats a live octopus which is apparently quite normal in korea anyway there are some fight scenes a severed hand someones teeth are pulled out  theres a bit of blood at the endbr br the budget was supposedly around the 4000000 mark which is actually a fair bit filmed in south korea  new zealand the acting looks alright but its hard to tell when actors are speaking a different languagebr br oldboy is a film that i found an absolute chore to sit through i dont mind subtitled films or foreign films or paying attention to the plot as i followed the thing perfectly but i just didnt like any of it  its as simple  straightforward as that apparently the second in director choiwook parks revenge trilogy which also includes sympathy for mr vengeance 2002  lady vengeance 2005
