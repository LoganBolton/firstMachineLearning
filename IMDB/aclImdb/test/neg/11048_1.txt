i am sorry to rain on everybodys parade just a little background about me i like and know a lot about asian cinema especially japanese chinese and indian admittedly i am a novice when it comes to southkorean cinema but if this is the best of the best sorry i just want you to know that i am not at all narrowminded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and i do not fit the stereotype of the dumb american    well not perfectlybr br i cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon this is a disgusting and ludicrous movie hammy acting  everything is badly done and overdone like begging for the uneducated viewers attention horrible camerawork with an insistence on meaningless closeups derived from the mtv aestheticsbr br the plot is more full of holes than a gigantic piece of swiss cheese nobody expects a thriller to be 100 realistic and for the sake of entertainment id be happy to close my eyes to small unfitting details but excuse me whats happening here that can stand even summary scrutiny this story of an unbelievably intricate and contrite act of revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story one can read in a line at the supermarket dont want to spoil your enjoyment if thats the word so wont go into details of the plot the fighting scenes are violent unbelievable downright stupid the main hero taking on dozens and dozens of opponents in the same time after he only trained while imprisoned punching a wall   the truly outstanding features of this movie are two the lurid and incestuous sex brother on sister and father on daughter well weve evolved since oedipus didnt we and the graphic violence the cut off body parts  hands teeth tongues  together with industrial quantities of spilled blood how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this movie to be made have no esthetical functionmotivation whatsoeverbr br a feast for the s  m inclined admittedly but even for those a feast of no merit nor subtlety heavens even mel gibsons recent and muchdiscussed work on an almost similar theme wasnt that badbr br the invariably good press this pretentious overblown overlong piece of gratuitous gore coming from korean shores obtains makes me wonder whats happening i dont think of myself as being the ultimate paragon of taste and often i am ready to accept that a movie i didnt enjoy may be better than i was able to perceive however i have no scruples whatsoever in calling this one as i see it bad bad bad no redeeming qualities my 2c find something better to do with your time
