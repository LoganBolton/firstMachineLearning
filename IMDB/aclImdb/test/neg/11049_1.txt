this comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its temporarilyhigh user rating which i find frankly puzzling the reasons why i didnt like this title are followingbr br 1 the directer must have had some doubts whether to make a jackiechantype of a flick or a dark oedipian tragedy as a result in terms of genre the film falls between two stools as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel out each other rather than make a harmonious wholebr br 2 the characters motives and behaviors are incoherent and unconvincing psychological truth and logic are sadly missingbr br 3 absurd casting i dont blame the actors for it is a hard thing to create a convincing character by acting alone if there is scarce logic in the script however why is there an apparent age difference of about 15 years between the leading two actors whose ages in the film cant differ by more than 34br br 4 to me the film was poor entertainment primarily because of point 2 if you cant find a character you could sympathize with it is hard to follow the story with interest when you finally learn the reason of what happened to the main protagonist it turns out to make no sensebr br 5 some films apart from being entertaining are also thoughtprovoking having seen this film i began to wonder whether the thought the director tried to provoke was not that incestuous relationships could be perfectly wholesome and delightful i cannot put any other construction on the ending br br 6 the film is rife with totally unnecessary violence violence in a film and elsewhere is a good thing if it serves an important and worthy purpose purposes can be different and i dont want to enter into this broad subject let me just say i dont object to violence in such films as saving private ryan the passion of the christ or the pulp fiction in oldboy the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic or aural what for i do not know personally i dont derive any satisfaction from watching teeth being extracted with a hammer or hear a man cut off his tongue with scissors and then see him choking on his own blood etc etc br br 7 the film reminds me a little of japanese porno mangas in its fixation on incest and young asian girls panties urinating and the like it appears there is a minority who actually enjoy this kind of thing if youre one of them you might find this film enjoyablebr br in short i do not recommend this film either as entertainment or food for thought where it isnt silly it is disgusting dont waste your time
