js cardone directed a little known video nasty in 1982 called the slayer and since then has gone on to have a hand in a handful of feature films including the rubbish 2001 vampire movie the forsaken his latest feature film wicked little things boasts a plot that sounds decent as well as a creepy looking poster that i seem to remember surfacing a couple of years ago in relation to a film that tobe hooper was meant to direct well i guess he felt that this one was too similar to his silly zombie fungus movie mortuary and so turned this one down i dont blame him for it either the plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters that move to an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband however what they dont realise is that around a hundred years earlier a group of children that were being used as miners were trapped down a mineshaft naturally thats not the end of them and they managed to survive their ordeal and now prowl the area in search of revenge br br the film is essentially a collection of clichés from the youngest kid with an imaginary friend the mother who dismisses it and all the usual zombie rubbish js cardone attempts to get the horror fans back on side with shocks and gory scenes mostly involving kids but its not enough the story doesnt play out very well at all either and really did remind me too much of the earlier mortuary and thats not a good thing although mortuary is actually a better film than this one the acting is nothing to write home about either lori heuring is decent looking as is eldest daughter scout taylorcompton but neither manages to provide an interesting performance chloe moretz is slightly better than the usual child actor the plot is given hardly any credibility and indeed the screenplay cant even be bothered to explain the reasons why the kids attack the locals it all boils down to a typical and rather dull ending and overall i have to say that if you know your horror movies then you can feel free to skip this one
