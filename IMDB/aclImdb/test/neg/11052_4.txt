fortunately i havent seen this film in a movie big screen just on a small screen on video i doubt that i would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film after watching the first 30 minutes i became both disappointed and curiousbr br disappointed because of the hard to follow story line the hardly understandable screens the huge amount of aggression  i still dont know why i had been shown the daesu main character pulling out raw the teeth of another person his beastliness on women him cutting out his tongue and also curious to see what will the film say as a conclusion what is the ending summary of all this brutalitybr br unfortunately though the movie was not boring i didnt get any answer to all these cruelty that i had to watch from the beginning to the end to my opinion if you want blood and want to laugh there is kill bill 12 if you want blood with more meaning you can take any recent war movie and if you want an eastern movie there are much better titles out there afterwards i will take the ratings from the cannes film festival with more precaution as while oldboy got a lot of praise from the jury it had not much to say to me and had only 410 on my scalebr br i am hungry to see something beautiful harmonious with true feelings and a clear message
