bottomofthebarrel stinker is so bad its beyond funny the plot is about an american mercenary played by reb brown in the film hes called a military adviser but its not really clear if hes in the american military or not helping the army of a latinamerican country fight guerrillas who winds up joining the guerrillas when the government turns on him imprisons and tortures him shannon tweed is a sports equipment saleswoman he picks up in a bar who gets caught up in all the intrigue that description actually makes the movie sound better than it is because its really a stinker of almost biblical proportions how bad is it well shannon tweed turns in the movies most professional acting job if that isnt an indication of just what a 12thrate piece of junk this turkey is nothing is from mismatched sound effects to a music score that sounds like its from a 1940s zgrade horror flick and may very well be to the same footage ie armored personnel carriers going down the same jungle trail reused constantly to some of the most ineptly staged action scenes in recent memory this laughaminute sludgefest has to be seen to be disbelieved tweed looks bored brown looks hung over and by the time this thing is finishedif you can last that long i couldntyoull know just how they feelbr br although there are a lot of explosions and gunfights this cant be considered an action picture by any stretch of the imagination its boring theres a scene in the back of a truck where everybody just stares at each other for three or four minutes repetitive the same rebels and soldiers being killed over and over illogical when a group of rebels is caught in an open field by a government helicopter gunship instead of breaking for cover they just stand there staring up at it inept soldiers and rebels falling dead when no gunshots are heard a gun battle inside a house where combatants standing against walls are machinegunned but miraculously the walls escape undamaged predictable when the governor says to offer a reward for browns capture because someone might turn him in you know exactly who that someone will be and it turns out to be exactly who you thought it was and just downright stupid pretty much everything else in the picture inept brainless and stupid beyond belief dont waste your time
