i really wanted to like this movie a film with zombie children getting out of a mine to kill people at night really seemed like a great idea for a horror film unfortunately the film was in the bottom 3 of films played at horror festbr br a mother and her two daughters attempt to move on after her husbandfather had passed away from an illness that cost their family a lot of money they have to adapt to their new environment they end up struggling due to all the surroundings for different reasonscrazy zombie kids go into this category the film never gives any sentimental attachment for anyone that lives or dies the film produces no scares or jump worthy moments the film barely shows the children doing what theyre supposed to dokill with a bigger budget and a better cast this film could have hope until then pass on itbr br 3510 actually
