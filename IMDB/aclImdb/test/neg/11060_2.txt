what a shocker for starters i couldnt stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying the jerky camera movements were also annoying the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot and then theres the ending im still not really sure what to make of it i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupidbr br the case had a couple of those little award winnernominations symbols on it so i figured it couldnt be too bad i was wrong if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf
