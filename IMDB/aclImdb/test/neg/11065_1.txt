there seems to have been some money behind this film but it would be impossible to imagine a film this badly planned and executed if i hadnt actually started watching itbr br to begin with once we are in the cavern with the characters the usual young adult stereotypes weve been meeting in horror films since the early 80s the film is shot almost entirely in closeup since the actors are wearing helmet lights this means all we see are glaring lights alternating with utter darkness  we never get to see what the characters see so when they shout out look there we are left to beg what where ultimately the film has a nauseating confusing strobelight effect with no sense to it until we get to the endbr br and i wont tell you what the end means  but you will recognize it if youve ever seen the old early 60s arch hall laugh festeegah with richard kielbr br but what crazy person would ever want to make a variation on a theme like eegahs long remembered as one of the worst films ever made but thats what we have here folks except that unlike eegah the cavern is not anyones idea of goofy fun it is unwatchable i ran it at x2 the normal speed just to get it over with hoping i would actually be able to see something by the end of the film but when i did it was just stupid this film did provide me with one satisfying moment though since it only cost a couple bucks after i got it out of the dvd player i was able to smash it with my own hands  what a relief
