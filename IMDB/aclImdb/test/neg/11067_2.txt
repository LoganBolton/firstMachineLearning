i havent laughed this much in a long time  or seen a film so ineptly made talk about so bad it made me laughbr br firstly i estimate that for about 40 percent of the films length i couldnt tell what was happening or indeed even what i was seeing i can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets lsd there are whole segments minutes long where all you can see are blurred flashes and fragments of cave wall people and various other unidentifiable stuff i spent half the film asking my teenage daughters what was happening but they couldnt follow it any better than mebr br then there are the black moments when in an effort to scare us woooooooo everyones lights go out and the screen turns pitch black  and i dont just mean for a few seconds i think the longest lasted almost two minutes i guess blank film is one way to keep costs downbr br i suspect the director had recently read a book on all the mustdos to make a scary movie and decided to throw them all in  about 20 times eachbr br there are three good things about this film 1 its short at 90 minutes though still an hour and a half too long 2 all the characters die after all its impossible to care about any of them 3 there was one genuinely good scene  when the group are looking up the shaft they came down after discovering their rope fallen to the bottom saw that coming a large boulder is pushed across the opening sealing them in i wasnt expecting that and it was genuinely chillingbr br and whats with the early campfire scenes with the shot after shot after shot panning from behind the camp lights i swear the director used almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutesbr br and im positive that after the first kill the exact same footage of blood on the cave floor is used twice in about 90 secondsbr br all in all a crap piece of film making ill watch almost anything but this is close to where id draw the line
