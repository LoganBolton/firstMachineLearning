horror films are a curious thing sometimes they manage to stumble across a formula that works very well sometimes they try valiantly to tell a worthy story despite time and budget problems sometimes theyre so bad theyre actually kinda funand sometimes theyre the cavernbr br a good horrorsuspense film should contain vagaries that keep you guessing they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their motivations so that you actually have some sort of reaction when they die however the cavern chooses instead to introduce elements that work at first only to be negated by its own lackluster storytellingbr br all the characters are completely forgettable and any actual back story that might make any of them even remotely interesting is blurted out within a 30 second monologue making it impossible to do anything more than laugh as characters are picked off almost at random and on more than one occasion in the least possibly frightening waybr br to spoil a scene a bit one victim is taken during a complete blackout which might have been a little frightening if the sound effect used to indicate his killing wasnt reminiscent of stirring a pot of too thick macaroni and cheese add to this formula the camera that work makes me think the director saw one too many nine inch nails videos and an ending which in an attempt to be shocking serves almost no purpose but to annoy and confuse the viewer and you have an almost completely unwatchable horror film that fails on every levelbr br ill be honest with you if you want a claustrophobic caving horror movie go watch the descent and i feel weird saying that because i didnt particularly enjoy that movie either
