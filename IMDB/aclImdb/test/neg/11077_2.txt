i cant say if the cavern is a ripoff of the cave because i havent seen that ive seen the descent and thats not terrible but it is very hard to watch and so is this one hard to watch as in theres very little light and lots of fast motion so youre hard pressed to say what youre looking at there are times when i guess youre supposed to be scared judging from the music but scared of what bad camera work poor lighting if thats the case than this should be the scariest movie made the story is that a bunch of cave explorers go to a cave in kazakhstan home of borat and make their descent but something is of course in there with them and what is it one guy says its a wolfbear hybrid that is just before he gets ripped apart but whatever it is you cant see it and just when you think or hope the film is ending since the screen goes dark for a bit you see the two remaining cavers the two women wake up somewhere in betty and wilma attire and start trying to find their way out of wherever they are they do drink some water and start eating something until they figure out what it is and start pukingand then the mystery of whats in the cave appears and youll just be astounded maybe maybe not dumb dumb dumbi think im pretty well done with cave movies at this point 2 out of 10
