a group of cavers with a sad history take an author on a hairy adventure through an uncharted cave in kazakhstan in these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components the cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years and that twist seems to be taken from an xfile i like to give every film the benefit of the doubt but there were just too many little annoyances for me here the camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up not being a caver it doesnt really matter to me whether the filming was realistic there is entirely too much unnecessary pannick from supposedly experienced cavers by the last half youre saying out loud one of two things Â– oh just shut up and concentrate on saving yourselves or i hope you all die by the end it must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make this film a moderate amount of gore and nothing special in the dialog or characters while youre pretty confident you know whats going on by the end the last five minutes explain all the details but i would have had a better opinion of the movie if they would have left the last minute on the cutting room floor it just wasnt necessary i suggest you hit eject immediately after your suspicions are confirmed and save yourself the setup for the sequel ive long thought that the film industry should share a modified restaurant industrys checkout scheme you pay for the materials to make the film before you go in but any profits for the film come from the tips you give when you leave the cinema i cant blame what i dont like about this film on its low budget
