one of the few reasons to make these pointlss films is to give some actors a chance to hopefully star in better films if theyre acting is any good the only good thing in this movie is the acting the three female leads are better than most horror films like this theres 2 scenes that may cause an unexpected jumpbr br young small children are use to crawl through holes and lay dynamite to explode mines when one does collapse causing a cave in all the children die becoming zombies the adults in the mine stay dead no reasons are given as why the children become flesh eaters when still alive they looked terrified before the cave in innocent so they must become enraged at any adult which exploited them int he mines only reason that come to mindbr br a mother and her 2 daughters move into a house near the mine along with a land devoloper who wants to build a resort and another of those creepy people who seem to know exactly whats going on yet no one believes himbr br nothing new here youre usual clich√©s predictable a lot of negatives for this film very few positives
