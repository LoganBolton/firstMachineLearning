when i checked out the review for this film after id watched it i was surprised that there were people giving it good ratingsbr br this is a film of bad camerawork everything frightening happens off screen usually accompanied with a closeup of someone yelling did you seehear that well no we didnt see that we cant and when there werent any closeups the camera was doing something weird like rotating upside down or shaking back and forth really really quickly to either convey action or to make us physically sickbr br the characters were unlikeable because every two minutes they started screaming the same thing over and over again i dont care if thats what it would really be like i did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things i expect unreasonable things like aliens demons or good acting they were stupid too lets go have intimate relations in a cave with all of our clothes on speaking of which the ending somewhat contradicts what domingo said immediately before he died this bugged me a bit though not nearly as much as the fact that the ending resulted in a serious invasion of one girls privacybr br no plot no climax no good acting terrible camerawork whats left oh right the ending may have had a twist but generally with horror movies the twist at the end actually has understandable relevance to what occurred during the film sixth sense does it explains a lot hide and seek did too but the cavern had a lame twist that served as an explanation if you could call it that as it doesnt explain anythingbr br dont see it please
