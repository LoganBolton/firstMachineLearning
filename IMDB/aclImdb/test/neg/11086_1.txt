so you have the spoiler warningbut i would argue that you cannot spoil what is already rotten i assume they changed the name to the cavern just in case withins reputation had preceded itbr br after paying the cable rental for this movie i considered saving my household garbage for a month and mailing it to the writerdirector he had his garbage delivered to my home so i thought it only fair that i return the favorbr br the movie opens with a suggestion that the scene is in the desert of kazakhstan im not sure why they picked kazakhstan maybe the writer is a fan of the ali g show but they should have just started inside the cave because the outside was obviously not kazakhstan it was the first clue that i was going to hate the moviebr br the movie has no redeeming qualities save one its consistent everything is terrible the writing the directing the acting the cinematographyevery aspect of this film is just bad and i like bad films goofy films bhorror films    but this was just plain bad and stupid and hackneyed and predictable and boringbr br to get a feel for the film go into your laundry room with 5 of your friends and turn off the lights put a flashlight turned on into your dryer and start it tumbling now all of you start screaming and yelling at the top of your lungs thats itbr br for a complete reenactment have 5 of the 6 people in the laundry room play dead on the floor toss karo syrup on them turn the lights back on stop the dryer now have a guy in a gorilla costume enter the room and rape the last person standingbr br finbr br addendum reading through the other comments many find it remarkable this movie was made on a low budget thats not remarkable making a crap movie on a huge budget is remarkable waterworld making a good movie on a low budget is remarkable like blair witch which i thoroughly enjoyed making a crap movie on a low budget isnt a bit surprising and you can expect more of the same if these people are still making movies because i cant imagine anybody would hand them a pile of cash after watching thisbr br is the low budget an excuse for a terrible film no and its certainly no reason to watch it would you eat a dogdung sandwich just because it was cheap to makebr br the imdb rating for this film over time will be interesting to watch it should trend farther downward but only if the number of unsuspecting innocent viewers can outpace the movie makers ability to beg their personal friends to give it 10 stars
