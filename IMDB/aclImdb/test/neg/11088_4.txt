its hard to write 10 lines of copy about this soso film noir there just isnt a lot to say about it it is not memorable enough to add to your collection and i have a considerable amount of noirsbr br paul henreid plays a tough guy in here hes not one i would think of to play this kind of role but hes fine with it hes a fine actor anywaybr br everything including the cinematography is okaybutnot memorable one thing that stood out the abrupt ending that was a surprise it was also a surprise to see this under the heading hollow triumph ive never seen the film called that its always been called scarbr br if you read about a tense film noir etc dont believe it tense is not an accurate adjective for this film
