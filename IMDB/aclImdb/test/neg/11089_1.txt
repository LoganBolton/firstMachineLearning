very odd this seems like a very average movie to me if not slightly less it is brilliantly shot but together with the performance of r lee ermey thats about the only redeeming aspect i found in the movie which consists of two separate parts br br the first part covers the basic marinetraining which watching it in 2007 comes off like something ive see a zillion times before in dozens of other movies and series and its not particularly gripping after 30 minutes i got the idea and wished they could just get on with it the drill sergeant is about the only believable character while everyone else seem to be just cardboard cutouts the general acting is staggeringly haggard and the screenplay is devoid of anything interesting and consists of little more than the sergeant shouting the boys make it through their training and end up in vietnam oh and the fat weirdo shoots the sergeant what a surprise probably in the mistaken belief that it was actually the scriptwriter br br so one hour passed and nothing worthy of note happened nothingbr br then we have the vietnampartbr br it opens with a bunkscene where reporters of stars and stripes are bored and are making small talk to pass the time at first i thought they were reenacting some movie scenes from old films it sounded pretty bad but no they were actually muttering their script lines then the camp is besieged some 20 vietcong enter the camp through the main gate too bad for them they are being dropped like flies because they simply walk into several manned gun posts with no means of cover is that normal behaviour were the vietnamese all suicidal if so how come the us didnt win this war during the first two months of engagement the rest of the movie continues with even more completely illogical war scenes br br furthermore the whole plot is altogether pointless none of the characters inspire much sympathy and the story is frankly rather uneventful it shows little more other than some warreporters hooking up with a platoon with some guys getting shot because they are disobedient morons and who also seem to think that somehow a gaping hole in a wall will protect you from bulletsbr br what was the message of this moviethat people died in vietnam that people are animals in war situations that if you want to dispose of really dumb people you send them to a war zone or that somehow in vietnam concrete can actually burn br br im sorry but if this movie deserves an 83 then apocalypse now deserves a 383br br 510
