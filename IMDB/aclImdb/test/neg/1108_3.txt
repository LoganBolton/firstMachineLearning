as someone already said the living dead dolls were cute and if they came out as a new series of wicked little things i would buy one or two well basically this film was dark not in the scary sense but in that i cant see kinda way and it was boring three females in a house the youngest told not to go into the woods under any circumstances well that didnt sink in and it would have been better if that advice had involved their death and doesnt anyone do any cleaning or whitewashing or something you would think a lot of coughing would ensue a sexy young mum where you waste your time trying to figure her age by my calculations 34 or 36 and it looked like it had been longer than 20 years since someone had lived there so what was with the fathers young adult photos on much older album i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast teens getting stoned and drunk in car and well you know where that leadsdeath and apparent deafness too as tim seems oblivious to his friends scream i mean i have pushed many a car where the instructing driver did not scream and i heard them cliché weird man in the woods who no one believes plumber who has lived in them there parts for years and this is his first experience with said children so that driving along he avoids pickaxe wielding youngster in dead of night run him over you idiot cliché roaming about in woods without a clue about where you are going armed with knowledge that pickaxe wielding kids yes them again are out and about senseless scene the brutalising of pig why do so many directors see no problem with animal mutilation and slaughter i would have much rather seen the kiddies run up and bit people on the thighs than this zombies dont appear to have that much energy in other filmsthe villain well how ineffectual was he his big part was in the shop tramping in and demanding to be served first what a none eventful man he was why not kill him earlier before the family got there and avoid the movie being made or remake it differently i give my marks to the house the woods and the little goth dollies i want one
