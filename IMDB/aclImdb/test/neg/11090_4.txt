julie delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in france of the 14th century the film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight by showing a rather dreary image of the period defined by psychological dysfunction and violence br br the movie opens with a child françois growing up in the shadow of the hundred years war told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return françois takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed françois murders him in the name of defending his fathers honour like father like son françois grows up and leaves his family also to go to the same war this setting is somewhat of an explanation for the events to come as on his way home we already notice that something is wrong with françois the war has not done well with him he has changedbr br the daughter béatrice de cortemart delpy awaits her beloved father to return from captivity of the english she is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone in her fathers absence béatrice needs to deal with financial difficulties which strengthens béatrices hope that her father will return to save her but upon his return she notices that he lost the will to enjoy life and he tortures and humiliates everything around him even his own daughter from this points the film depicts various ways how françois torments his family starting with humiliating his own son and ending with the rape of his own daughter béatricebr br setting the film in the middle ages supposed to soften the blow as the viewer may tell himself that these kind of violent acts were held in difficult times and indeed many films on the topic of incest such as tim roths the war zone 1999 which are contemporary were more shocking because of thatbr br delpy appears in this film in several daring nude scenes indeed she appears to be angelic and beautifulbr br i was annoyed when i saw some animal torture scenes i believe and this is not confirmed that some birds were killed for the making of this film which really upsets me the quality of a film drops when real violence is used towards animals i would hope that this movie will be rereleased without those cruelty scenes those scenes do not contribute much to the film storylinebr br overall the movie is too long the script is problematic we dont get to see françois and béatrice before the war we dont really get the answer why is he changed to such extreme i would have pass on this film however i have to mention a few scenes that made this film worth watchingbr br  scenes of a young child being able to murder in cold blood is truly shocking i saw it first time on city of god 2002 here françois murders his mothers lover while his father away at war excellent scene and very graphic  the scenes from béatrice being raped by her father till she finds out she is pregnant from him are truly shocking and interesting the scene after the rape where delpy burns her cloths and cleans herself she asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with hopes to have a miscarriagebr br  the brother humiliation scenes where the father dumps his sons head into the food  humiliating him then ranting about the war later dressing his son with womens clothsbr br the film won the césar french oscar for best costume design i agree the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the time period the movie location is château de puivert a real 12th century castle and a historical monument located in aude southcentral france beautiful castle and mountain view really helps you set into the period of this film the film also nominated for 3 more césar awards but they were all snatched to the widely successful french film au revoir les enfants goodbye children 1998br br  released as beatrice in new york city march 1987 only to be screened in france on november 2007 watched it on yes3 on 3 may 2007 1745 at work
