if you thought this is the french the mummy and if youre hoping for another vidocqwell look elsewhere it does have the same kind of story like the mummy concerning this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 missing pieces that are scattered in the louvre i found the movie to be slightly entertaining boring for the most part the special effects arent bad but its nothing spectacular as i was expecting big explosions and perhaps the eiffel tower crumbling down until i realized that those kind of scenes were in the mummy and this is belhpegor apparently based on a french cult tv series belphegor could have been so much better i voted this film a 410 only for the beautiful sophie marceaushe must be almost 40 and she looks breathtaking
