this was a pretty dull movie actually i think the problem with a french horror film is that the french must be easy to scare or something because this movie wasnt just that frightening the special effects with the mummys ghost looked like they didnt even belong in the film as though someone put them in during postproduction to spice them up because the actors barely react to thembr br the plot just kind of meanders which is the opposite of real storytelling i guess this was based on a french tv series where they had to distill it down to a twohour moviebr br the plot is that a mummy is brought out of storage in the louvre which apparently has such weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can break into it multiple times so thats how people keep stealing the mona lisa the boyfriend and the police officer from the 1960s version of this film get together and try to exorcise the demonbr br so im not sure if this mummy was supposed to be a bad guy or not he kills two guards during the course of the movie but he just wants to get to the afterlife
