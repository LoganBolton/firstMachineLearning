horrible script which was apparently directed byno one the marines cant fend off the monster with machine guns however it backs off when a 15 year old girl karate kicks it in the face a few times its supposed to be a luxury liner but the fancy dining room looks like a cafeteria in a hospital it appears that they rented a high school for the summer and pulled out chairs and stuff to decorate the set with in the end shot they are pulled from the water and into a boat and less than 3 seconds later they are apparently about two miles from the ship as it sinkshow do movies like this get made i guess anyone can be in a film these days aaron james nyc
