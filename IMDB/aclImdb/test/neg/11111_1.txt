oh my god where to begin chupacabra terror is one of the worst bhorror movies ever made this crap makes demon slayer look like the exorcist special note a horror bmovie needs to have at least one sex scene dont expect even a hot girl in this one with that inexcusable mistake i should begin with the complete bashbr br first of all if youre going to make a horror monster movie you should spend big part of the budget in creating a cool monster outfit the monster in this movie looks like a 10 halloween costume there is no way the chupacabras yes this is how it is spelled looks menacing in the movie its an actor in a halloween outfit please it looks so cheap it makes me mad br br second the gore effects are the spinal cord of any direct to video monster horror movie again the producers decided not to spend for decent gore effects the blood looks damn fake please take a close look at the guy that gets chopped in two thats probably the best scene in the movie and it lasts for about ten seconds the ending is a very poor scene that wont leave you satisfied br br the acting is the last thing you should expect to have quality in these kind of movies but in this movie its beyond terrible a cast of nobodies with no acting experience make the fool out of themselves for about 85 minutes special mention deserves a blonde guy with curly hair that tries to convince swat members that he is sick the coughing he fakes is beyond laughable hes probably the worst actor ever in a bhorror movie no kidding also captain pe√±a delivers a terrible performance in the first ten minutes of the flick br br the true story behind the chupacabras is not even told all you get to know is that the monster sucks goats blood why bother with this piece of crap plesae do not even watch it even if you have the chance not even if it airs on cable br br i usually support low budget horror movies because the people involved in them at least try to do something different than hollywood but that doesnt means that horror fans like me should accept this kind of garbage
