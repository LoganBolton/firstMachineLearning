i watched this movie knowing that it would be awful but damned if it didnt break new and revolutionary ground in the field of making fecal matter acceptable as entertainment the plot is deep rising with cruddy effects and horrid acting the lines in thiswellwow there really is no way to put this movie down because i think the words have yet to be created in the english language the sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were actually making something good you wont believe your eyes when you see how many movies they ripped off without even trying to hide it there are scenesplot devices straight out of deep rising alien jurassic park predator jeepers creepers and the list could go on forever however unlike any of those movies this one just falls short of celluloid stool the most incredulous thing about this film aside from the way it tries to be competent but fails is that gimli himfreakinself is in it how the hell can they afford john rhysdavies but not decent effects writing actors or sets really awfuland not the type of bad thats good
