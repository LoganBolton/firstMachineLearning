i didnt like this movie for so many reasons i cant even say then alli thought it was poorly made just because of the whole story line i mean who is gonna believe that they captured the chupacabra and it broke loose on a cruise liner lame it was all right for a lame straight to video moviebut not worth spending money on it i cant believe someone actually gave this movie a ten but i guess there are people that like this movie i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 just because it was about the chupacabra and it had the guy off of lord of the rings if you want to see this movie i would stay home and wait till it comes on scifi channel dont waste your money on seeing this movie believe me
