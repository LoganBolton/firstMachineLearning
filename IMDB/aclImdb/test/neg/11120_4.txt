apparently in early 2005 scifi channel threatened to release the incriminating photos they have of john rhysdavies and said we need you to star in another scifi original the scary thing is hes actually pretty damn good in this movie thats really saying something since this is a silly scifi creature feature youve gotta put some feeling into it in order to be wellacted unfortunately nobody else does its your stereotypical mosterrunamok movie on a cruise ship the cryptozoologist wants to keep the creature alive the navy seals think they have everything under control but they dont know what theyre dealing with and they all end up dead a girl jumps into the movie sexpot role as rhysdavies daughter and the creature mauls about 100 or so shipmates what this movie has going for it is its very fastpaced and lively youre never bored or waiting for another kill other than that though it does nothing to distinguish itself and its silly that this thing crawls all over the ceilings and cant be wounded by navy seal machine guns but can be karatekicked into submission by rhysdavies daughter kinda went back and forth on giving this bad boy a 5 but for the above silliness im giving it a 4
