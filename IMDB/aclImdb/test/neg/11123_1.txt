chupacabra dark waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made i had expected at least some passable entertainment because john rhys davies was involved and after seeing this movie i can honestly say i lowered my opinion of mr davies substantiallybr br why the acting is incredibly poor an excellent actor like davies should have demanded more from the cast and the director it was painfully obvious that mr davies was just clockwatching and hoping the check would not bounce to say that he just showed up would be an understatement but at least he did show up the rest of the cast looks like they mailed it in from their respective jobs at the various los angeles restaurants where they work as waiters talk about a cast of unknowns this is the kind of cast that never appears in movies again they act as if they were auditioned while waiting at the unemployment officebr br what about the special effects store bought firecrackers styrofoam a cheap rubber suit and cgi effects that look like they came from my 1980 atari game i have seen some horrible special effects used on scifi channel movies but this stuff looked like cutandpaste done at the kindergarten by someones child i expected mr crabs and spongebob would show up at the end to battle the chupacabra not to mention that all the accounts of the creature describe it as a small gremlinlike critter it would have been a good film for a leprechaunlike character instead we get a gigantic hulking creature that is shown walking with stopaction speededup effects that are laughable the chupacabra is in one place and then it shuffles at superspeed down the hall and it is worth a few laughs just to see this
