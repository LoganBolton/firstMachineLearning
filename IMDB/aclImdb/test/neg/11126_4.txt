a cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a caribbean islandto get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto the cargo bay of a large luxury cruise ship with funny and i think the script intended disastrous resultsbr br lets start with the one thing i really did not like about this movie the monster really just looked like a guy in a rubber suitthe cgi scenes looked like a different movie ok thats off my chest now onto all the enjoyable bits about this b moviebr br the best thing was john rhysdavieshis daughter the eye candy a close secondjohn was intermittently funny and suave and no matter what the writers made him say he said it wellgood job given what he had to work withthe cyptozoologist was over the top and fun to watch toohe had some funny bitsthe marines all were ok and make good cannon fodder for the monster as did some of the crew and gueststhere are a few pretty funny lines in this movieand a pretty amusing sub plot involving a thiefbr br the special effects are generally med to low and i swear they reused the same blood spray on the wall scene in about four different parts of the movie i did like the gore of the legless manreally since this movie was not scary at all i feel a bit more gore would have gone along way in improving the watch ability of this moviebr br all in all if you like b monsters this one is worth a visit
