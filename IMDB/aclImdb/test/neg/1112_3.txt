wicked little things has an excellent synopsis empty house beside abandoned mine in woods with tragic past family moves into house and strange things begin to happen little creepy children begin to pop up here and there doing creepylittlechildrenthings but that is where the cleverness and potential fun ends this group of kids was sealed in the mine many decades earlier and now appear roving the woods poor makeup with weapons looking for flesh to eat oh i get it this is a ghostzombie movie hmmmwhile i can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre this just didnt work what was the childrens motivation in seeking to devour flesh why did they need weapons did anyone else imagine the filmmakers all gathered around the daily footage giggling because they felt this was going to be a coolscary movie i found that after thirty minutes i felt the familiar resignation that i had just wasted my time on another modern crapfest while the acting was good and the settingcinematography of good quality as well the script itself suffered from what seems to be a lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre altogether a bunch of kids walking down the mall is scarier than this pack of poorly disguised rodentsbr br this movie is not scary and while i can appreciate the story perhaps have even enjoyed it if i had read it instead of watched it i still have to say that wicked little things is more accurately called wicked little turd
