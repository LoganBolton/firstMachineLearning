whoa this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the packaging for the film is better than the film itself my girlfriend and i watched it this past weekend and we only continued to watch it in the hopes that it would get betterit didntbr br the picture quality is poor it looks like it was shot on video and transferred to film the lighting is not great which makes it harder to read the actors facial expressions the acting itself was cheesy but i guess its acceptable for yet another teenage horror flick the sound was a huge problem sometimes you have to rewind the video because the sound is unclear andor muffledbr br it holds no real merit of its own trying to ride on the coattails of sleepy hollow dont bother with this one
