this was obviously the worst movie ever madeketchup was the starring role in this movie and would be the only nominee for an awardcause the plot actors and anything related to this farce was absolutely horrible and ridiculous i could have made a better horror flick in my backyard within two hours with a handheld camera using grass stuffed dummies as the actors atleast the acting would have been better dont waste your time or money on this oneits extremely cheesy and horrible
