from the portrayals of andy warhol in the films i shot andy warhol and basquiat this is the type of movie i would predict andy warhol might makeairy illogical snobbish amoral the movies almost nonexistent plot which is sometimes increduously unbelievable is offset by the movies rough reallooking cinematography the film has a way of being unreal yet dictating reality to the viewer the only worthwhile part of the movie is the development of the relationship between joe and holly and every thing in it should be viewed as a characterization device there are a couple of comical scenes that i do admit are funny but trash is really just about a character study of unengaging people that is mildly enjoyable if you do not mind watching nudity and iv drug use
