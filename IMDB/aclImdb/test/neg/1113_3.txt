if you described any of the scenes nightmares of children murdering you in your sleep your infant daughter talking to ghosts searching for your lost child in an abandoned mine at night so petrified with fear that you cant move even though the blood from a murder victim is dripping onto you from the floor above  then id say you had a horror movie but some how wicked little things just wasnt scary i am a horror fan and i loved the location the plot in principal and i liked the three leading ladies i didnt want to see them come to harm i wanted the bad guy to get his just desserts the rest of the cast are always simply cannon fodder so i was indifferent either way with them and it played out every cliché in the book  even down to the torch battery running out in the pitch dark just as you start to here whispering voices closing in on youbr br i would still recommend that you watch it but unless you are new to horror movies or under 12 years you will have seen it all before
