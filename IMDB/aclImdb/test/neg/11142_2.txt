i like underground films when they have something to say or show for that matter i tried hard to like trash i tried to see some artistic achievement or some interesting representation of new york city life in the early 70s or at least being entertained by it but the movie stinks and cant be called either art or entertainmentbr br trash is basically an excuse to expose joe dallesandros nude body for 2 hours while he meets other uninteresting annoying figures i agree thats a gorgeous body but no excuse for a whole movie about it right holly woodlawn as joes girlfriend provides a few good laughs by the end but then its too late to save those wasted couple of hours lou reeds classic song walk on the wild side is a better portrayal of those people and that time even if its more fascinating than they actually were 1510
