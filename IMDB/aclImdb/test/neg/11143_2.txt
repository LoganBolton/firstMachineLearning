quite liked flesh and looking forward to heat but couldnt help but feel morrissey grossly exploited most of the performers featured here stumbling around naked in a narcotic stupor seems to be all dallesandro was capable of in this featurea huge and heartbreaking contrast from flesh his semierection in a few scenes is the only indication that he might be acting mostly it looks like something he did to buy drugs woodlawn is a revelation all rightshe is the embodiment of the lower east side but hers is a one woman showshe rarely engages the other performers though it has to be said her sex scene with a beer bottle definitely leaves halle berry in the shade when it comes to cinematic displays of raw passion when she pounces on a young wouldbe lover it is with the ferocity of a vampire two of the female performers andrea and jane have such annoying voices youll have to mute the sound to get through their scenes the fact that several of these performers committed suicide or were murdered a few years after only adds to the air of exploitation but they were probably desperate to get in front of morrisseys camera anyway there probably isnt a worse way to spend a saturday night but at least it brings a specific time and place vividly to life
