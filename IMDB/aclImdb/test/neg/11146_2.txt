this film sucks a big one so many holes in the plot if the devil is invincible why does he require the protection of arnies bodyguards i couldnt fathom why arnie didnt turn up for work for several days and then suddenly appears takes their entire armoury and disappears again nice work if you can get it its sad that the last 12 hour has to result in the standard arnie uzi 9mm finale arnies interpretation of a depressed cop is to bow his head and sniff i thought he had a bad cold for most of the film dreadfully scripted arnie is called buddy dude etc for 95 of the film and then suddenly we hear him being called by his real name of jericho cane where do they get these names from the ending is so twee youd better get the barf bag ready shame that gladiator pulled off the same ending with 100 more classbr br
