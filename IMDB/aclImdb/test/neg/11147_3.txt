the plot of this boils down to ahnuld versus satan and what i remember most about the movie is a lot of explosions gunfire blood noise and lets not forget that flammable satanic urine the story is nonsensical utterly predictable and so full of holes i couldnt take a bit of it seriously stick to rosemarys baby or the exorcist if you want to see a really good devil movie andum well i cant think of any good action movies at the moment probably because theyre so farandfewbetween so youre on your own in that category this flick does get a 3 out of 10 rating from me for its camp value and for a prettygood performance by gabriel byrne as that old debbil satan
