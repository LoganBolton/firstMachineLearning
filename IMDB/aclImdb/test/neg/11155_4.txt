i really dont know why im writting this i think most people agree that this movie is bad well let me say thisbr br when i first get done watching some movies i like them then as time goes on my opinion changes about the movie this happened with end of days i liked it the first time i saw it i thought it was entertaining but a few weeks later my opinion has changed so to resolve this i watched it again at a friends house well its badbr br im a logic person if i see a logic hole in a movie i try to ignore it if i see two then i start to get annoyed more than two and im ped off end of days made me ped off after my second viewingbr br first off the movie is a bit depressing everything about it is sad everything from arnolds acting to the movies colors but dark looking movies dont bother me but some thing else didbr br if satan can regenerate his wounds how can you possible kill him in his mortal form if you shoot him his skin grows back if you cut off his head a new one should pop back up so question whats the point of even trying to kill him ill tell you why because this is a stupid movie that has a recycled villain this isnt the devil my friends this is a human being reminescent of those bond villains who give away there entire scheme to the herobr br like i said its worth a look but dont see it twice because its crap
