end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen muddling direction meandering script loaded with lame dialogues and gaping plot holes rapidfire mtvstyle editing and poor acting all the waybr br thats not to say end of days isnt watchable the movie kept me interested because i found ahnulds latest action flick laughably stupid for being so inept and silly when it comes to logic without the sense of logic the movie dies quicker which is why end of days deserved a huge drop of box office reception in its second week after the opening in the usbr br i wont go into the details explaining why end of days violates the law of movie logic but here are several problems with this moviebr br spoilerbr br after the devil walks out the restaurant explodes without any trace as to how he did it no snapping finger no tampered energy gas to ignite the fire nothing how could this happenbr br arnold and his annoying sidekick kevin pollack somehow magically comes up with the name christine york after examining the phrase christ in new york carved on a victims body runs the database on the computer and viola christine york the only person with the exact name in all of new york city beyond my suspension of disbelief br br how did the characters who have come in contact with arnolds character turn against him later in the movie i laughed out loud when i recognized the goodstepmotherturnedevilstepmother is the same actress who played a nanny in william shakespeares romeo  juliet her ironic transition from that film to this was absolutely hilarious if you can imaginebr br all the mindlessly huge explosions and gunfires what did you expect in the arnold schwarzenegger vehiclebr br the devil took a mans body comprising of flesh and blood yet hes invisible to bullets and explosions by healing through that body logically this is impossiblebr br as the devil demostrates the illusion in the apartment arnolds character runs into the solid christmas tree that supposedly is an illusion and falls on it physicallybr br the devil is capable of punching the persons brains out and twisting a victims head 180 degree yet he could not kill arnolds character as he always intends tobr br how the devils object of desires parents died and why evil new yorkers run after arnold and the object of desire were never explained at allbr br in the sequence thats a ripoff of speed arnold and the devils object of desire manage to escape the subway train wreck by the short distance inside unscathed this is beyond my comprehension since the force would be enough to throw arnold and the object of desire around violently and die from fatal wounds seconds after impactbr br arnold suffers the brutal beating from the mob sanctioned by the devil and put him on the cross to hang against the wall yet the devil forgot to take the time and opportunity to kill him for conveniences sakebr br at the beginning of the movie after the devil took over a mans body all of a sudden arnold is his bodyguard is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editingbr br arnolds recital of cringeinducing dialogues in the particularly laughable scenes like you are a choirboy compared to me are the perfect fodder for mst3k just as eraser did with the classic line youre the luggagebr br the whole theory about 6661999 is downright ludicrous so are the pseudoreligious babble about the christian theology involving the end of the world at precisely midnight and the fanatic killers who know the location of the devils object of desire br br end spoilersbr br it is highly ironic that end of days uses the scattered profanities abusing the deity while rambling about christian theories the level of violence in the film is excessive and gruesome and is therefore unnecessary to serve the plot the directors indulgence of excess is a factor here he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of moneybr br hence end of days is a worthless film with no redeeming value except for campiness  arnolds worst since hercules in new york br br  br br  br br  br br  br br
