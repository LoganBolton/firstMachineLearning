i saw wicked little things as part of the 8 films to die for horrorfest and this was the only film that disappointed me to wit a mom her little girl and her teenage daughter settle down in an abandoned house in the pennsylvania mountains every night however the vengeful spirits of children killed in a coal mine run about and slaughter anyone they findbr br i guess the director was banking on his viewers being repulsed that children would be capable of pickaxe murders and eating human flesh of which there are lavish closeups as a nice homage to george romero because the film just isnt scary otherwise simply put there are far too many establishing shots of the evil kids jogging to their next murder site if someones gonna get it in the barn there will be a shot of the kids arriving at the barn oh the suspense and then moving in for the killbr br come to think of it why do the kids suddenly walk so slowly when they corner their prey and not that i have any experience in this but i think a shotgun blast will throw a child a lot farther than this film implies nor does it help that the mom is one of the worst parents ive ever seen in any film the lock on the front door is busted you have an eightyearold daughter in the woods with bears and mountain lions fix it you moron plus mom and her oldest daughter look waaaay too close together in age even for a teen pregnancy and theres a pretty unbelievable death which involves sneaking up on somebody trying to push a car out of the mud with their buttbr br im giving this a 3 because it tried as a splatter film its not bad but for good scares go elsewhere
