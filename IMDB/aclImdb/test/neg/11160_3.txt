arnold fans will holler in joy fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment and catholics will just hollerbr br illogically written by andrew w marlowe and hamhandedly directed by peter hyams end of days gets the terminator out of his openbacked hospital gown arnold schwarzeneggers return to the big screen after his heart operation whilst blowing things up in mysterious ways and blaspheming biblical verse to give catholics something more to whine aboutbr br it is 1999 and doomsayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn even as the technological stank of y2k muttons the new york streets excop turned alcoholic security guard jericho cane schwarzenegger with the perfunctory deadwifeandkid backstory for loose cannon effect must brave theological waters to save 20yearold virgin christine robin tunney from being conscripted as  wait for it  the bride of satan dun dah daaaarrrh stupidity ensuesbr br for every antihero there is his antichrist gabriel byrne is the devil here  and hes out to party like its 1999 on a mission to impregnate christine with the antichrist between 11 pm and 12 midnight december 31 1999  ironically in the hour that all porn will be lost  thereby bringing about the end of days being able to read minds conjure hallucinations and employ limitless magic it doesnt occur to satan to expedite the impregnation process by appearing months in advance and courting christine as a teen model and then closing the panty raid easily at the appointed time instead he appears on december 28th like a keyser soze terminator and wonders why she doesnt welcome him with open thighs see above comment re stupidity here is a movie where nothing makes sense the moment it is uttered let alone after contemplating its veracity or mythology a priest rod steiger tells jericho that 666 is really 999 upside down with a 1 in front of it so wait  prince is the antichristbr br satan soze pursues jericho and christine j and c  get it around town at no point doing anything which would actually precipitate their capture in one scene satan recreates jerichos wife and child to tempt him into revealing where he hid christine but if he can see so deeply into jerichos mind in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia why cant he see where jericho hid christine not ten minutes ago br br satan can make an assassin talk without a tongue yet he cant make that assassin unjam a semiautomatic weapon and when jericho shoots satan at point blank range satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds closing so jericho wont worry unduly about satans health  not sanitary to go about with open bullet wounds matter of fact instead of simply possessing jericho himself to get close to christine and rape her satan expends so much unnecessary energy on sideprojects crucifying the tongueless guy blowing up jerichos partner kevin pollak and then saving him and then blowing him up again ridiculously battling jericho when he could snuff him out with the effort of thought that we wonder whether a more efficient assassinlover shouldnt be put on the case  say antonio banderasbr br what i find most precious about end of days is arnolds valiant attempts at the method sad means scrunching up his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent depressed means raising a bottle to his lips and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent deathly scared means widening his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent theres definitely a pattern here if we could only decipher itbr br in the end the devil is dispatched not by the holy men whom catholics pray to for deliverance from apocalypses such as these but from the atheist jericho while the timid men of an impotent god exhort faith and quiver in their cells doing nothing about satan actually walking amongst them the prince of darkness is thwarted by a nullifidian with a big gun and a foreign accent which clearly says something that catholics blindly refuse to hear that even if the devil were to exist those who have been indoctrinated to unconditionally and irrationally fear him would be unable to conjure a belief in his downfall let alone act towards it further they might not truly want him defeated for only through his contrary polarity does their gods existence become tenablebr br for it is written in the book of revelations and the prince of darkness shall descendeth upon the earth without any solid game plan and impregnate a virgin on a date which wont have any significance until the gregorian calendar of the 1500s adopts the day numbering which will put it in sync with the equinoxes and the anno domine syntax which will annoy sensible people for millennia by which time christians will have forgotten christs actual birth date and appropriated the pagan saturnalia festival in its stead and the prince shall effect a revolution through tight purple pants and ambiguouslylesbian band members i can believe the people being drained of blood and crucified and the alcoholic built like a mr universe i can believe that a giant supernatural monster cant kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent i can even believe that the devil needs to perform some hokey thirteenth century celtic druid ritual as foreplay  but what i cannot believe is the 20yearold virgin in new york city in 1999br br especially around prince
