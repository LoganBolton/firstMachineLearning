love the tpbs but this was a lame episode didnt have the same feel that the series or the movie has looked like it was put together in a hurry i didnt enjoy it at all the socalled acting was awful the cast appeared like they knew this was a moneygrab of an episode to get to market quickly i hope we dont have an easter special next because that will be it for me the writing of this episode was definitely mike clattenburgs worst in the history of this show the direction left a lot to be desired and i almost felt bad for the cast and crew of this weak attempt at a christmas special like i said i love the tpbs but this one goes to the trash bin
