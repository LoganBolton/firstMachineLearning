it purports to be the life of paul the apostle it opens with him involved in a loincloth wrestling match with a priest the pharisees were called that because they separated themselves from the hellenism being forced upon the jews by their gentile rulers the point is that saul would never have been involved in grecoroman wrestling periodbr br then we have the two men saul and the priest reuben  a totally extrabiblical fictitious character shown being washed down in the nude in a roman style bath house again the torah which saul adhered to religiously condemned in the strongest possible terms looking upon the nakedness of another manbr br reuben is shown being the one that pushes saul into destroying the church again the text of scripture doesnt matter for their it is paul that says that he laid waste of the church and breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the churchbr br the movie shows barnabas sprinkling paul  not baptizing immersing him when the text of scripture says it was ananias that did itbr br their is no mention of mark or his turning back so the writers of the script are forced to have paul and barnabas argue over pauls desire to preach in rome as the basis of their separationbr br no silas on pauls second and third missions no timothy ever no titus no apollos no no noooo james is said to have known jesus for a long time rather than it saying as the text of scripture does that he is jesus brotherbr br why not just call the movie frank the fictitious apostle at least that would be closer to the text of scripture
