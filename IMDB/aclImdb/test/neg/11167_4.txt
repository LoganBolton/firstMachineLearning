this is a ripoff of already crappy hollywood movies like scream and i know what you did last summer the story is classic some highschool students tries a prank on the class asthmatic misfit but something goes wrong terribly wrong when you watch the movie you know whatll happen before it happens all the time not good if a movie tries to be scary the actors are quite ok and the girls are cute after all theyre asian so ill give it two out of five on the mojaveometer
