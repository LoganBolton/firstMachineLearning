stay far away from this film the fact that youre reading reviews tells me you may have already been tainted by the awfulness it carrys this is a truely horrid movie so lets get down to the problems writing and direction it wouldnt surprise me if these were handled by a group of overactive gradeschoolers that watched scream and i know what you did last summer a few too many times giant gaping plot holes abound while i cant congratulate them for this movie its nice knowing theyre finally potty trained actorsor lack thereof only the finest for this film the finest extras ever to grace a screen now starring in their speaking role debut as a disclaimer i have to note that i am capable of watching and enjoying just about anything i recognize a good movie when i see it but i can still giggle and smirk during bubble boy yes folks its true so when i say to avoid something you know im not kidding
