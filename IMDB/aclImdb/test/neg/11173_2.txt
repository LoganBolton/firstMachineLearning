this is only the fourth effort i’ve watched from this director whom i met and found quite genial at the 2004 venice film festival italian bmovie retrospective and also possibly the worst as was the case with the bronx executioner 1989 which preceded it this is a prime example from the tail end of the eurocult era – prime because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen by this time br br here in fact we get a plot revolving around – i’m not kidding folks – a killer phone pretty but bland charlotte lewis – in her third film after pirates 1986 and the golden child 1986 – is a model who apparently has just ended an affair she keeps expecting her architect lover to call her back but every time the phone rings all she gets is static accompanied by voices from the beyond or some such crap she befriends a new tenant at her apartment block who conveniently knows of an authority on paranormal activity william berger – who hilariously explains that the negative energy which is unleashed say during family arguments can manifest itself via home appliances into a deadly force i swear i ain’t making this up br br among the highlightserlowpoints of the film are the grumpy bartender from whose dingy place the heroine calls a couple of times it seems that the chainofevents can only be broken by having lewis go through her paces again exterminating angel 1962style the sheer variety of preposterouslooking phones on display the apparatus of the heroine’s photographer friend sneaking up on her before the kill the sarcastic cop who greets lewis on reporting the strange occurrences “and what’s the toaster up to i wonder” the wouldbe rapist killed by a barrage of coins shooting out from a telephone booth and berger’s own bloody demise with the phone affecting the pacemaker he’s fitted with and causing the doctor’s heart to explode br br the film’s climax is rather confusing and apparently finally sees all the ‘lost souls’ inhabiting a flock of doves and flying out the window of the ‘possessed’ office a lonelyhearts service for what it’s worth the score – by exgoblin claudio simonetti no less – is effective enough despite the inclusion of dated heavymetal numbers on the soundtrack
