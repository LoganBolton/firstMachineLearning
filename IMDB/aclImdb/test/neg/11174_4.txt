well i was hoping id heard wrong about this film as im a big fan of ruggero deodato and really didnt want to see him slip up but unfortunately this giallostyled supernatural load of nonsense is just as bad as id been lead to believe it would be  and thats pretty terrible the plot doesnt work at all as the film attempts to blend murders and a supernatural theme through a telephone and it all feels very forced and silly furthermore the plot doesnt make much sense at all and you have to ask yourself whats the point numerous times throughout the movie the plot focuses on a young woman living in an apartment block and being terrorised by a telephone the best thing about the movie is undoubtedly the presence of the beautiful english actress charlotte lewis and unfortunately the good points pretty much stop there there are a handful of deaths scenes some of which are gory but all of which are incredibly stupid the one that sees someone get killed by coins sticks out especially in that respect overall i really cant recommend this to anyone nondeodato fans are unlikely to impressed and deodato fans are likely to find the film depressing avoid
