ring ring havebeen horror directors hotline how may we help you umyeahpronto i mean hello my name is rugge err call me by my initials rd okay mr rd what seems to be the problem well the reviews on my latest movie dial help were all negative and harsh and frankly i myself feel like my career has seen better days as well okay mr rd and why do you suppose that is well i gained fame and a welldeserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking movie about savage tribes of cannibals devouring a film crew and another one about relentless thugs terrorizing wealthy people in a house at the edge of the park for which i borrowed the idea from wes craven but dial help revolves on  err never mind no no mr rd go ahead and tell me what the film is about um its about a spiritually possessed phone line stalking a sexy model and killing the people surrounding her ah i see that premise does indeed sound a little silly and not as petrifying as cannibals or rapists but i suppose there are deeper themes in your film right oh yeah sure um what do you mean by that well isnt the phone line symbolism for another kind of terror or perhaps its all just happening in the mind of your female heroine um nope its just about a phone going berserk and murdering people with the cord vibrations electricity or even ordinary coins interesting mr rd but how do you explain all this supernatural stuff to the viewer at the end of the movie you see i figured the slowly unraveling phonemystery plot wouldnt be that important or relevant so i just concentrated on processing all possible phonegimmicks i could think of phone gimmicks what do you mean you know like wind blowing through the horn mindpenetrating dial tones and turntables catapulting into the air very original mr rd but not exactly horrific and as an experienced director you must know that in the end people expect a reasonable clarification of all these events oh but there is it all has to do with negative and unreleased energy if i remember correctly its all a bit fuzzy i admit hmm i see oh well as they always say a good motion picture relies on more elements than just the story did you at least process some of your regular trademarks into the film so that your fans at least recognize your style i tried lord knows i tried but the murders and bloodshed are simply not shocking anyone thats a pity indeed mr rd but what about sex everyone likes a good portion of sleaze and nudity in their horror films and you said yourself the film centered on a sexy fashion model in peril yes but  but what mr rd well to tell you the truth we kind of promoted dial help as an erotic thriller with revealing shots of charlotte lewis on the cover but in reality theres no sex in the film and charlotte even refused to go topless mr rd now im really disappointed thats just shamelessly ripping people off and lure them with false promises i know i know and im ashamed but i just wanted everybody to rent dial help and love it well to round up i can comfort you by saying that every major director is entitled to a few erroneous decisions without it affecting hisher career immediately but be more cautious next time and do some research first okay mr rd i will thank you youre welcome tell me have you got any ideas for upcoming movies already yeah as a matter a fact i do i was thinking about making a giallo with a murderous washing machine doesnt that sound fascinating hello hello
