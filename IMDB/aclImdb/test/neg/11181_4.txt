the thesis of father brown is that a good dose of roman catholicism will solve all of lifes problems a little proselytizing i dont mind but this gets a bit ridiculous at timesbr br some fine actors have played father brown over the years kenneth more and barnard hughes are two good examples alec guinness plays him in this film and does all right by him but you didnt see any great demand for future father brown filmsbr br i suppose if you are a committed roman catholic it all makes perfectly good sense its far more important to catch the thief and convert him to your religion than see hes brought to justice br br but thats what were asked to accept here in fact there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film guinness in clerical garb is caught trying to put back stolen articles that one of his parishioners sidney james had heisted during a robberybr br thats the story he gives the local cops and of course this is something that james has confided in him so he cant break the confessional br br now on to bigger game master thief flambeau played by peter finch has stolen a cross that is entrusted to father brown and was said to belong to st augustine back in the day but father brown is more interested in getting flambeau to go back to his faith than seeing him brought to justice so he misleads the cops so he can accomplish his missionbr br im sorry but this whole thing was just too much for me to swallow father brown id hate to say it was guilty of obstruction and ought to have been arrested and he was under no obligation not to reveal anything he knew about flambeau the man had not come to him as a penitent seeking absolution and spiritual advicebr br author gk chesterton a very noted catholic lay person in his day finds all this very reasonable carried to his logical conclusion we should replace all police forces with an army of priestsbr br guinness borrows from his own reverend ascoyne dascoyne from kind hearts and coronets and from barry fitzgerald in going my way to create father brown granted though brown is a lot shrewder than the other two theres also a bit of colonel nicholson in this portrayal in the bridge on the river kwai guinness also was playing a character whos rather weird interpretation of the rules caused him to lose sight of what was important in the situation nicholson was in br br father browns an entertaining fellow when hes solving mysteries and making the authorities look foolish weve enjoyed brother cadfael do it in a medieval setting and american audiences liked father dowling played by tom bosley a few years back br br this film should have stuck to being entertaining
