on the pure theatrical side last stand was great as the reenactments and soundtrack are very entertaining but there are better accounts of this battle found elsewhere that while not as long or as flashy are far more historically comprehensivebr br certain little details such as the misuse of the word hoplon for the greek hoplite shield and the mispronounciations of various names and words really ate at mebr br my guess would be that because last stand of the 300 was aired the eve of the theatrical release of 300 the history channel was only trying to ride the coattails of the movies hypebr br if youre looking for a depiction thats historically accurate in all respects possible youd have better luck elsewhere
