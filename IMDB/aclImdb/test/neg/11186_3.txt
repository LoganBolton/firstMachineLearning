ok its a piece of historical film making that caused an uproar shocked people and was banned ill give it that which is why i gave it a 3 rather than a 1 it may have been ahead of the times but its certainly way behind the times now i am a big fan of salvador dali and i loved un chien andalou that short was captivating with one creative scene after another lage dor was way too long and dull  just a selfindulgent piece of pompous film making created simply as a feeble attempt to try to outdo un chien andalou by creating a full length movie and shamelessly leverage dalis name and fame even though he had little to do with it total junk except for a very few shots of shocking scenes separated by long stretches of boring nonaction a waste of time and money both of my thumbs are down way down itll go onto my shelf never to be watched again
