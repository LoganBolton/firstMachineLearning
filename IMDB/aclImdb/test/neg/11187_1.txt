when something can be anything you want it to be or mean its bound to register with someone as being rather special but just as the shape of a cloud in the sky may appear to one of us or remind us of a battleship and to another of his aunts rear and yet to another absolutely nothing other than a cloud this does not make this cloud meaningful except for the viewers interpretation anyone who might find throwing a stuffed giraffe out of a window brilliant or worthwhile for that matter without relating it in some context is possibly merely trying to impress us with his or her intellectualitybr br submitting to this movie as the dreams of a madman does quite nicely especially since there is no standard or expectation for what said dreams would be like and even if we were mad ourselves this would hardly give us sane reference points for comparison a love affair with this movie entails the same risk as seriously interpreting nostradamus whatever real meaning was being conveyed at the time might be buried in the private jokes musings or provincial minutiae of its day and to a select few radical intellectuals at that i did spot a bit of an agenda even with my limited capacity thoughbr br the movie is definitely antifascist and to some extent antiitalian i noted that although the years 192930 were years of great public works and urban renewal in italy any indication of this seemed avoided furthermore avantguarde academic spinners take note of this for your next class the very short cropped haired man with the mustache in the party segment near the end is a caricature of victor emmanuel iii and his tall female companion none other than queen helen formerly princess of montenegro without an understanding of potential historical relevance even the apparent irrelevance is beyond the competence of academic or other intellectual poseurs who would bask in irrelevance to impress usbr br i gladly add my own paint buckets to the defacement of this cinematic joke but in an adaptation of the famous mot by the little boy the movie really has no face to deface paint would help it burn though
