im a big fan of surrealist art but this film by bunuel with some ideas from dali left me cold bunuel had a lifelong grudge against the catholic church and delighted in trying to offend catholics in fairly silly ways this is one of the silliest almost like what youd expect from a smartaleck 18yearold in film class the last few minutes of the movie which have nothing to do with anything else are a final nosethumbing at religionbr br if you read the scholars regarding this slowpaced occasionally amusing film its all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression if that is indeed the point then bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible the central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies is this behavior the churchs fault for interrupting his lovemaking or is he just a jerk i vote for the latter i think bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the catholics as the ones to blamebr br there are a few moments where you might cry aha surrealism a cow in a bed a giraffe falling out a window a poor model a man shredding a feather pillow a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava or a mud pithard to tell in bw the rest is forgettable selfindulgence unfortunately bunuel was still chasing the same bogeymen through the rest of his career viridiana discreet charm if youre interested in seeing surrealism on the screen check out jean cocteaus early work
