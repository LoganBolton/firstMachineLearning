some movies youll watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that growbr br some youll watch because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock outside your experience these wont directly feed you but theyll help you situate yourself in a larger world than you otherwise would have and after all the hard parts of life are in what you choose not to acceptbr br and then there are movies that do neither of these things that you will watch out of obligation or because you have a need for historical context these are pretty worthless experiences in terms of building a lifebr br the problem is of course that often you dont know which of the three a film will be going in you might get some indication from people you trust but because a life in film is so personal you really wont know until you go on the blind datebr br for me this was pretty worthless yes yes i know for many bunuel is the epitome of the sublime and rich and you should know if you dont that among my greatest film experiences are some very strange films very strange indeedbr br it isnt that this isnt cinematic or symbolically deep or apoliticallypolitically friendly to the way i think its how it gets there that is off base its the deviance from real deviance that annoys mebr br part of the problem is that this is successful alternative art which means that it is successful commercial art which in turn means that it can be simply explained and the explanation is not only widely acceptable but simply coded in shorthand surely all this is truebr br when the term surreal is used generally it is used incorrectly to denote any film image or world that differs from reality or seems strange but when it is used correctly meaning according to consensus theory it always revolves around bunuel and in particular this film and the one he genuinely did with dali so because they invented surreal cinema they define and control the term that by itself chafes me and i have my own alternative definition that doesnt come from their philosophybr br its because the philosophy is wholly contrary it isnt a philosophy at all but a rejection of philosophy an antiorder its packaged anarchy carefully selecting the things that they use and the things they oppose without clearly differentiating thembr br so okay against linearity against narrative against history against religion an easy one against deliberate love but for an illinear linear narrative for establishing its own history celebrated by countless film school professors what else can they do for a sort of transcendent accidental lovebr br it is its own enemy if there were a bunuel alive today as he sold his image the first thing he would do is attack the church or the surrealbr br my regular readers know that in nearly all matters cinematic i cleave to the spanish and avoid the french but in the matter of the surreal id like to you consider the reverse get your surrealism from alfred jarry not bunuelbr br teds evaluation  2 of 3 has some interesting elements
