this review will have some very obvious spoilers so bewarebr br a friend brought this over and we made it through 45 minutes of the movie before we decided that fast forward 8x speed was the only way that this film should be watched there were points when we were watching the movie at normal speed where i would leave prepare part of lunch and return to find that literally nothing had happened 2 lines of meaningless dialogue were exchanged nothing happened the background no important facial gestures were made nothing but mindnumbing awkward silencebr br this is not how to make a thoughtful film especially when the movies plot follows all the same basic hollywood movie tropes if i told you that disney was making a film about 4 girls starting a band and the singer was a french exchange student what you would expect to be the conflicts that arisebr br the lead singer has to overcome stage fright someone has an unspoken crush the band is late for their performance and a sidecharacter has to buy them timebr br spoiler alertbr br all of those things happen in this moviebr br at no point in this film do you have even the slightest fraction of concern that these girls wont be able to accomplish their goalbr br this ends the section of spoilersbr br i like japanese films ive spent a lot of time in japan i work for a japanese company heck i even know all the bands referenced in the record collections and mds that theyre going through and ive sung along to the title track with friends at karaokebr br this is probably the worst film from japan ive ever seen do not be confused though the characters will have points in the movie where they do typical japanese high school things this is not a typical day in the life of movie this is a day in the life of 4 extremely random heavilyconflicted awkward japanese studentsbr br there are noticeable problems with the dvd as well viz decided that a great extra would be a producer reading aloud the wikipedia entry about the blue hearts what a value in addition they care so little about the subtitling that the bands name in the subtitles paran maum is different than it is in the chapter selection menu paran marum in the final auditorium scene there is a very visible reflectionghosting effect on everything but this seems to be the fault of the original filmbr br 210 do not view if you do not absolutely love awkward silences
