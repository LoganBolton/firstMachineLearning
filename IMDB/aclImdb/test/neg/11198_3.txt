i went to crooked earth to see a piece of new zealand what i found was a badly scripted and badly acted echo of the people i knowbr br great moments between characters  including many of temuera morrison and lawrences makoares scenes together  were often ruined by long and wordy monologues that the actors were forced to stumble through beautiful and illfitting phrases rattled away from lawrence in particular as if he were the new maori messiah at his pulpit of beer cratesbr br when watching any film with maori actors ive found that i can always pick a half dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life with crooked earth i struggled to find one key character that rung true for the entire two hours most  including wiremu and peka  wound up saying or doing things that i didnt understand and couldnt connect with by the end of the movie the writer had succeeded in alienating the audience where the maori werent able to relate to it and the pakeha were therefore given license to dismiss it my feeling is that the movies message  or at least the main one of several that was being lobbed at the audience  is important enough to avoid using character extremities unfortunately no one who read the script before it was filmed thought to pass this piece of advice onbr br the soundtrack was invasive and as irritating as that horrible bingbong noise that they laced through eyes wide shut the audience was not so subtly autocued to laugh cry or be angry when the music changed it reminded me of darth vaders entrance music in star wars obvious and mildly amusingbr br i think that there are some people out there that might enjoy this film its funny in parts has a fair amount of action and has some really powerful scenes calvin tuteao and quentin hita did bang up jobs as well as a whole though i didnt enjoy the experience as much as i know i should have barb wire speed 2 the island of dr moreau and crooked earth look like theyre going to be tems quartet of crap
