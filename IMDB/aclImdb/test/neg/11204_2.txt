gordon scott made some good tarzan movies but this is not one of thembr br as i watched it wincing at the bad obviously interior sets and the hollow wooden clonking sounds as they walked across supposedly dirt trails and cringing at the bad dialog and worse acting among the supporting cast i kept thinking sheesh this is tv show level then i find out it was indeed three tv show pilot episodes woven seamfully into onebr br its nice to see scott get outside alone away from the lame sets in a few of the scenes and the fights do have some pretty nice moves but oh ow and ouch as to the dialog and did i mention the acting heck cheetah or cheta in this version was a better actor than most of the humansbr br and thats not saying muchbr br it is kind of a stitch to see a younger sherman ie scatman carothers acting as a native but probably not worth the overall timeinvestment
