what crack are you smoking this movie while gloriously entertaining is awful br br the action scenes are so obviously fake its kind of sad the colonels daughter is painfully irritating the ninja training camp is so hilarious it is almost not worth mentioning and when joe puts the bucket over his head and beat up the other army guy i just about peed myself i could go onbr br entertaining arguably so good no well made certainly notbr br as a commentary on america as empire its actually pretty good joe as a typical white conqueror isnt all that surprising especially in the context of mid1980s american cinema
