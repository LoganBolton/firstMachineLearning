there are actually some good reasons why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching this show the breasts are nice even though some of them arent that real but they usually come in pairs which is good watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience as it is an ideal place for just taking it easy and not worrying too much about getting eaten by a rubber shark its always good to remember that david hasselhoff is a god not the god but a god its not so much about his acting skills since there are none but his chesthair does a lot of talking also theres no kitt hanging out in this series which is good since mr hasselhoff told in an interview that he always thought kitt was gay naturally that might make him to look like an idiot but considering the other statements he has made lately it shouldnt be surprising to anyonebr br in a nutshell this is the kind of show that is totally harmless to people it gives us a lot to stare at and a lot to laugh at which is something many intentionally humoristic shows really dont give us i have to say its no wonder that borat fell in love with pamela anderson i enjoy watching the show no its not a great show actually its quite horrible but i enjoy watching it its basically like a bmovie stretched to last for a decade
