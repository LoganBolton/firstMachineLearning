i share the same opinion regarding underworld as the previous commentbr br i sat through the 15 hours of this movie wondering what this story was all about and more importantly why the author andor director had made certain decisions for the plot on the whole i found the movie to be unbalanced consisting of strange subplots which imho actually had nothing to do with the movie furthermore when writing a thriller id say you want your viewers to wonder about the story and not about the way the story is filmed
