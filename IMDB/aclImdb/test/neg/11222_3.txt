this movie is an obvious ripoff of underworld usa starring cliff robertson you owe it to yourself to invest a couple of hours and watch the original i found this one to be disjointed and hard to follow with a lot of scenes that didnt make much sense im not opposed to violence in movies but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow away one person after another many of whom were only marginally connected with the storyline with everyone else getting killed all through the movie i wondered why frank didnt just blow johnnys brains out he certainly could have and johnny sure didnt act like someone that could be trusted another thing that bothers me is the sex scenes why do these people have sex with their clothes on is that supposed to turn us on surely they didnt think they had a shot at a pg rating nothing in this movie seemed to play out naturally as if one were watching people in real life instead it was done in a heavyhanded and shallow manner
