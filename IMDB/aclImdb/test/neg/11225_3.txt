i found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic it tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against the system but it doesnt even present a positive solution i guess i didnt feel really for the kids i totally can understand what their gripes were and i know how poor the state of schools are but i found their solution and the way the outside dealt with it to be a big bunch of phooey if this comes on tv dont waste your time watch short circuit again for the 235th time
