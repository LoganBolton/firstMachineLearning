crimes of passion is a film that is disappointing on most counts where should i start from the plot it is despairingly simplistic and full of gaps the direction reminds a cheap bmovie the acting john laughlin is utterly terrible in his role as wellintentionedhusbandofafrozenwife bobby annie pots is unconvincing as frozenwife amy and it is only kathleen turner above average and antony perkins excellent which get passable acting marks more specifically antony perkins gives a great performance as the pervert reverend peter shayne while turner manages to portray the roles of sexy china blue and frail joanna crane satisfactorilybr br unfortunately the performances of turner and perkins alone are insufficient to help get the film a grade higher than 410 watch it if you want to see turner in some sensational scenes although even on this count the film can be easily matched by its competitionbasic instinct for example otherwise avoid
