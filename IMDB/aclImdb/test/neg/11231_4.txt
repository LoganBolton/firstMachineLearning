a few yrs ago i remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned rosalind russell this theorist wrote that the strength of the strong women that rozzie r played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man even when he wasnt worth itbr br i thought of this essay after watching crimes of passionbr br kathleen turner exudes the same strength and style as russell in her portrayal of prostitute china blue shes the object of affection for two men the loony priest played by anthony perkins and a bland whitebread boy whos marriage is slowly fading and she wont let either of them have a piece of her until br br i wont give away the ending  but i will say that this is ultimately bland whitebread boys fantasy no matter how hard ken russell tries he cant disguise the fact that this movie is basically a 1940s melodrama for the mtv generation except its retrogressive class and gender politics make those old blackandwhite films look revolutionary by comparison
