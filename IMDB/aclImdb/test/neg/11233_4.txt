this film is replete with sentimentality unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe and irrelevant material why introduce rachel for instance she has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her follow me truck to run wild and crash into dorindas fence that has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film another is at the end when the aircraft was it a b26 or an a26 both designations are used in the film is left with props whirling and no chocks in place that serves the plot of course but to reveal it would be to commit a dreaded spoiler as it is the aircraft would have begun to taxi sans control the ending again avoiding spoilers involves much too much talk  as at the beginning of sound films in the 30s with all those final speeches here dreyfuss just babbles on and on the ending also incorporates other radical violations of aircraft protocol and a couple of improbabilitiesimpossibilities that i wont describe what a dull and disjointed effort
