i had to watch this movie for a film class i suffered the whole time through i am not asian but was still greatly offended by this film the films basis is racialism overall minorities rex harrison isnt even asian are depicted in narrowminded manner the banning of the film in thailand illustrates the degree inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of asians in addition there has been critical attention given to biography of anna many critics argue that anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good manner some critics of the film and biography have even stated that anna made up the whole story an awful film but good for discussion of biopics as form of metanarrative fiction rather than a work of nonfiction
