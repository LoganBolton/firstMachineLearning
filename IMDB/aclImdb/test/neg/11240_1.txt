i have just given a 10 for thieves highway i mention this for two reasons one to prove im not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the nightbr br we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you cant avoid them all theyll eventually get you pretty woman for me does two things two terrible horrible ghastly things firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer you know with absolutely great friends leg warmers lots of giggling borrowing each others make up you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute were talking about here has a great life shes healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament my feeling is this happy hooker type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it if i make a film about a chef but dont want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have what a cop out really really lame br br secondly pretty woman insults romance itself edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this lady that is without his plastic friend yep dont leave home without it especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another even when he first meets her its the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work necklaces here diamonds there limos over there money money money wheres the charm wheres the charisma dont mention that attempt at the piano pleasebr br girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than a calculator as they probably dont either so it wont have registered more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate thieves highway a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subjectbr br ill finish on a songbr br pretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman the kind i like to treat pretty woman i dont believe you youre not the truth no one could spend as much as you mercybr br pretty woman wont you pardon me pretty woman i couldnt help but see pretty woman and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like mebr br pretty woman shop a while pretty woman talk a while pretty woman sell your smile to me pretty woman yeah yeah yeah pretty woman look my way pretty woman say youll stay with meand ill pay youill treat you right
