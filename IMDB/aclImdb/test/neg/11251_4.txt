the plot involves a new hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from calvins barbershop so he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such sounds real exciting huh as for the rest of the film a lot of it involves the same material from the first film the people that work at calvins stand around talk loud and mouth off to each other and the customers once again cedric the entertainer was mildly funny but it is more like hes doing a standup routine than anything to do with the movie and calvin is faced with another moral issue involving taking a large sum of money hes already shown that he will do the right thing in the endbr br final verdict nothing new i dont recommend it unless you thought the first barbershop was the best thing since sliced bread
