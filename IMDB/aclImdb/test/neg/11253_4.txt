first off i am critical of this movie because i really had high hopes and instead this movie suckedbr br possible spoilers if you havent seen the tv series where to begin well lets start at the quality the movie was barely better than the original tv series and the two fight scenes were very nicely crafted however the cgi was horridbr br then there is the plot holes and questions that still remain after the whole movie is all said and done this movie does not close off as a successful conclusion to a very broad universe known as fma and only returns to expand the universe more before leaving us with nothing but our imaginations to decipher what would happen in the futurebr br and then there is the stories biggest fault adding wwii and hitler why  the series was perfect and didnt need hitler it didnt even need germanybr br overall the entire movie was sorely lacing in what a true fma movie could have been and if i were the directors id scrap cos and make a new more ending ending
