if youve ever listened to any of the james lee burke books on tape or cd and the reader was will patton you may agree with me that will is the personification of dave rbr br tommy lee jones is a native texan or so ive heard and no one portrays a texan better imho but hes not a cajun his delivery is all wrong i lived in the state for several years and i can still hear the strange patois that a louisiana accent contains tlj doesnt have anything like thatbr br i thought marry steenbergen was a good choice for bootsy but i missed seeing cletus who will be cast in this role the rock mickey rourke whoever hell have to be bigbr br overall i thought the movie was only a 4  the plot flopped around like a fish out of water and didnt have the normal interesting yet nonlinear continuity that the book typically hasbr br hopefully hollywood will try another jlb book last car to elysican fields would be a good choice wed get to see some of the best villains from jlb ever
