this is a disappointing adaptation of the james lee burke novel in the electric mist of the confederate dead it is rather poorly acted mainly due to the miscasting of the principal players tommy lee jones a normally fine actor just doesnt capture burkes dave robicheaux as robicheauxs main nemesis john goodman does a sloppy job as the heavy the guy who plays robicheauxs actorbuddy doesnt look like a former a lister leading man the rest of the movie is mainly cast with noname locals who just dont do justice to a bigtime novelbr br the movie and jones performance is way too hurried for one thing robicheaux in burkes series of novels gives one the feeling that he fits well into his environment most of the time being laid back and slowmoving this is just like the deep south and southern louisiana then at times robicheaux is nearly manic in his exertions jones just moves at a fast pace through the whole movie he doesnt vary ned beatty is wasted mary steenburgen is out of place about the only good thing about this is the setting on the whole the movie gives one the impression of a tv movie
