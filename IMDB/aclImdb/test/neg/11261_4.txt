ive read all the dave robicheaux novels and consider james lee burke to be my favorite contemporary fiction writer ive also visited new iberia and much of acadiana to be able to better visualize the setting in most of these books needless to say i greatly anticipated seeing in the electric mist especially since i thought tommy lee jones would be terrific as robicheauxbr br i was greatly disappointed the story was very choppy the interplay with the ghosts of confederate dead was shallow and lost the impact and nobility it added to the book and tommy lee jones was doleful expressionless and difficult to understand as dr the best way to describe this forgettable film is to add my ditto to an earlier user comment that this movie was like one of those old madefortv movies i expected jill st john or cameron mitchell to show up at any timebr br the location settings were accurate and the photography at times captured the essence of the steamy bayous smoky juke joints and eerie aboveground graveyards of south louisiana too bad the storys disjointed presentation and tommy lees subpar performance interfered with the unique mood and spicy zest of the regionbr br next to final comment in the novels dave robicheauxs nickname is streak because of the distinct streak of silvergray hair on one side of his head similar to how the sopranos paulie walnuts would appear if he were seen only in profile tommy lee had no such streak in this film probably because the editors are james lee burke fans and they airbrushed the streak out after witnessing mr joness poor imitation of dave robicheauxbr br final comment while i generally find alec baldwin to be pompous and obnoxious in most roles he was by far a better robicheaux in heavens prisoners than tommy lee was in in the electric mist also heavens prisoners is much more interesting and exciting with uniformly believable performances and more evocative atmosphere than this new moviebr br in the electric mist is okay to watch when one feels like veging out and theres nothing better on tv but then so are infomercials
