i have read and enjoyed many of james lee burkes robicheaux mysteries when i read in the electric mist with the confederate dead was being filmed and tommy lee jones was playing the lead i was thrilled after watching it last night i ending up turning it off with about twenty minutes left not wanting to see any more people shot or beaten up dont get me wrong i dont mind blood and gorei love the untouchables and the godfather trilogy perhaps it was just that i had previously seen birth and what just happened before watching this i know that burkes books are violent lyrical and especially in the case of in the electric mist can be like the cajun swamps he writes about full of things that are never fully explained in a book thats fine in a film thats confusing many of the previous reviewers are also ardent admirers of dave robicheaux which makes it more understandable that they really liked the movie or they are admirers of bernard tavernier or both even as a fan of all the actors and especially vince i felt it was such a waste of their talents overallthey gave good performances in a film that didnt hold together now i say this having only seen the usa dvd and hoping that taverniers cut will make a huge difference on the plus side the soundtrack was wonderful the scenes at robicheauxs place were perfectjust as i imagined the bait shop to look like mary steenburgen was excellent as bootsie as was walter breaux as batist if you read the books you know why robicheaux is an eventempered person in the beginning of the film and then starts whacking people with various instruments overall i wish that they had filmed more of the electric mist and the confederate dead and left out large portions of robicheauxs methods of interrogation explaining elrods gifts and his bond to dave as well as daves to the general then i wouldnt be feeling today as i did last night when i turned it off what just happened
