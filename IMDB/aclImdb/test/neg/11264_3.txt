i have seen this movie last week during the berlin film festival and had mediumhigh expectations  the director is bertrand tavernier and i was familiar with some of his previous work in french cinema i actually enjoyed some of his earlier movies the cast tommy lee jones john goodman peter sarsgard mary steenburgen i was looking forward to see all this talent on screen i wasnt familiar with the book its based upon and i hadnt read anything about the movie beforehand but i was told that it was an investigation movie set in the deep south weve seen a lot of those in the past maybe this ones gonna be as good as the othersbr br 2 hours later the end titles appear thank god it was over  the plot is beyond comprehension if youve read the book you have a significant advantage there were too many minor characters and there were a lot of useless plot arcs we didnt understand a thing  the accents my god tommy lee jones accent is decent but i still have nightmares from mary steenburgens cajunfrench singing  poor casting in my opinion i cant believe old man tommy lee jones can beat the crap out of a linebackerbuilt goon and im not afraid of john goodman  who were these people we barely understand who all these characters are and what they do theres a bait shop tommy lee jones has a girl from guatemala bl√∂rg  the comedic attempts were pathetic the funniest thing about the movie was probably its action and suspense scenes they were horrible no thrills bad acting can tommy lee jones make different faces or is he like derek zoolander  and then theres the scifi stuff no spoilers but it gets ridiculously and annoyingly weirdbr br i usually dont write any comments on imdb but i thought the movie was so bad and disappointing that i felt compelled to share my opinion but thats just me
