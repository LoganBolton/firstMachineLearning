yagyu ichizoku no inbo lets just say the shoguns samurai is somewhere between horrifically boring and mindbogglingly painful to watch as an historical epic it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga but its really no more than just another cheap 70s action flick with a basedonrealevents story and an eyepatchsporting sonny chiba before this movies halfway point i was even tempted to commit seppuku the music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by ennio morricone thats not an insult towards morricone the use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating and in terms of action its really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and ohnotheydidnt shocks what a terrible movie
