thank god i have fastforward i think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls whatever its a stupid clich√© it doesnt make any difference theres this guy javier bardem who constructs buildings or something it doesnt matter he is handsome this javier bardem who cares i think there is a car wreck but i watched this in fastforward so who cares car wrecks and handsome heroes who struggle back from them smells like a melodrama to me javier likes someone  but he marries maria de madeiros insteadshe is magnificently poetically beautiful with a heartshaped face then javier has an oralinterface with maribel verdu who washes her vulva beforehand for some reason you would think maribel verdu with her handwashed vulva would be sexy no she is not this is a tedious story about a bunch of people who dont interest me javier maribel and maria have a threesome how boring this film is annoying i think this might be a minor theme of some spanishlanguage movies the rise and predictable fall of a little guy who succeeds against the odds let me just clear this up this is a highclass melodrama or perhaps soap opera it is not worth your time except for a laugh
