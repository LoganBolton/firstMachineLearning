with some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made huevos de oro seems to aim at the well educated spanish middle class there must be many inside jokes in this movie which you will not understand if you are an outsider this can be pretty annoyingbr br symbols and references to art and popular culture abound the movie alludes to the work of salvador dalí luis buñuel and the surrealists in general a certain infatuation with bidet baths seems to point to duchamps ready mades whats more the main character has also a knack for karaoke tapes with songs of julio iglesias but why all this is mixed together in a rather pretty but also gratuitous way simply eludes me i can only guess that it all serves to highlight the vital impetuous boorish vulgarity of the main character who the director seems to admire and despise at the same time how all the really pretty women run after him the main character i mean is slightly disconcertingbr br the movie has three parts it starts in the spanish enclave of melilla in africa where benito the main character does his military service apparently in the corps of engineers then it moves on to the resort town of benidorm in spanin where benito just wants to build the highest skyscraper of the place and become a vulgarized howard roark for the last part a defeated benito moves to miami florida presumably in order to start a new life but the change of places is not really explained satisfactorily it is also somehow irritating that there is no character development and that the movie descends into a soap opera modus without being convincingly ironic it must be said that javier bardem acquits himself very well playing the young stud who grows limp and deflatedbr br i purchased this movie because i am interested in townscapes and benidorm is a kind of a special place townscapewise in this aspect huevos de oro satisfied me only partially in jess francos she killed in ecstasy 1970 this specific location was used in a more rewarding way
