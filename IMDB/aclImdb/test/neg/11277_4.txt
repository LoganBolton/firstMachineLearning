a previous imdb reviewer has stated that rafter romance is a ripoff thats the other reviewers term of a german musical called me by day you by night apparently that reviewer is unaware that both of these films have borrowed their premise from box and cox an english play written by john maddison morton in 1847 this play deals with two tradesmen who rent the same room from an unscrupulous landlady each man believing himself the sole tenant because the two men have different work schedules the ruse is not discovered straight away this play was once so popular in britain that to box and cox it became a common term for an arrangement in which two people willingly shared accommodations meant for only one personbr br the innovation of rafter romance and its predecessor is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman who inevitably develop a romance as is usual in these cornball movies the guy and the gal detest each other until they fall into each others arms hoo boybr br the landlord in this film is played by george sidney a character actor who specialised in playing jewish stereotypes that were meant to be sympathetic george sidney was never as annoying as the odious harry green the jewish equivalent of stepin fetchit but sidneys depictions of jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing to watchbr br the single most notable thing about rafter romance is that to my knowledge this is the earliest hollywood film to make reference to hitler and the rise of nazism at one point in this movie landlord eckbaum sidney discovers his teenage son julius engaged in chalking swastikas on the walls eckbaum and his son are clearly meant to be jewish admittedly nobody in hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of what hitler was planning for the jews in europe  still its surprising to see a film depicting a jewish teenager who thinks that swastikas are a joke his father is quite properly angered by this display of the nazi symbolbr br a very shameful aspect of hollywood history is the documented fact that all of the major hollywood studios continued to do business with the third reich as late as 1939 hollywoods leading ladies were medically documented as aryan so that their films could be distributed in nazi germany and austria for the same reason hollywoods leading men were documented as aryan and uncircumcised except for darryl zanuck at twentieth centuryfox all the hollywood studio executives who colluded in this policy were jewish  but clearly had no objection to doing business with hitler im surprised that rafter romance contains a scene depicting swastikas unfavourably as this sequence would have rendered the film verboten in germany and austria maybe the scene was cut out for german release it isnt crucial to the movies plot apart from this the movie contains nothing notable robert benchley does his usual unfunny befuddled characterisation ive never understood the appeal of this man ill rate rafter romance 4 out of 10
