for a film made in senegal based i guess loosely on carmen the book by prosper merimee this film doesnt achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other filmsbr br ms gai as the karmen of the title is very good to look at her fiery dancing smolders the screen as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the filmbr br this is a karmen that aims to please to all genders but a real carmen she is notbr br we would like to see ms gai in other films in which her talent is better used than here
