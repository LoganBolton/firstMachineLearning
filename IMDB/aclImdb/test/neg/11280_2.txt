i gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10br br i went into this not realizing what it was  and discovered it is apparently some kind of african musical  since people break into song every few minutesbr br none of the songs rhyme most of them arent really saying anything sensible and they all have the same nonexistent tune  if you could call it a tunebr br karmen is a tall spectacularly built young woman with the longest braids ive ever seen the actress looks as if she has probably done some modelingbr br the film opens in a womens prison although not like any prison ive ever seen or heard of  the inmates wear whatever they wish  and seem to be having a partybr br karmen does some frantic dancing and the woman warden of the prison angeliquea magnificently handsome womanis definitely erotically interested she and karmen dance together later karmen visits the wardens room and they make love  unfortunately the scene is not detailed and is very short although there is some nuditybr br karmen then escapes from the prison and next we see her dancing in front of another group where a man named lamine maybe a colonel  it was never really clear who he was watches her he is with a young woman who dislikes karmens seductive dancing and there is a danceoff between the two womenbr br after that the story such as it is becomes even more muddledbr br with lamine in jail out of jail and who knows wherebr br karmen may be involved with a group of smugglers or thievesbr br there is more singing more dancing and a scene of angelique obviously suffering from heartbreakbr br the film muddles its way to a finish and i heaved a sigh of relief that it had endedbr br  br br
