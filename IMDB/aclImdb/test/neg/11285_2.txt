as someone who loves baseball history especially the early 20th century in which cobb was a main figure along with a ton of colorful characters i was looking forward to seeing this baseball film well it wasnt a baseball film which was disappointing no it was just a sportswriters account of being with cobb in the ballplayers later years while the two collaborated on a book even at that this could have been a more appealing movie than they made itbr br granted cobb was anything but a nice guy an extremely talented player but brutal in that he would do anything to beat youand he was viscous intimidating and had a lot of demons to fight he was so hated his own teammates tried to hinder his chances of winning a batting title one year nonetheless this an overthetop portrayal of the man it makes him into something almost cartoonlike br br watching and listening to an old man rant rave and profane for two hours is entertainment no it isnt some day id love to see a real biopic of cobb showing him in his ballplaying days and if they want to portray him as an evil guy so be it but the way they did it here with just a bitter blasphemous old man making an ass of himself in front of a reporter is not fun to watch
