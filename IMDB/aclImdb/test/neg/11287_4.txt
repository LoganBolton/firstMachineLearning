i dont know about the real cobb but i got the distinct impression that the filmmakers aim was to try to soften his jagged edges and reputation not give us a true portrait of the man himself in the movie besides a few racist remarks hes shown to be just another hardnosed cantakerous old coot hes so full of life with a heart of goldmore or less this is also the worst acting ive seen tljones dohe brings nothing new or subtle to his stereotyped character he just doesnt flesh out cobb in a way that pulls me into the movie not for one minute did i forget that it was tommy lee jones on the screen pretending to be ty cobb robert wuhl didnt impress either the comedic elements in this movie were just distracting and didnt ring true at all a bloody waste of time it is
