the only reason i didnt fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable hannibal is boringboring boring and boring this film is just dreadful not because of any violence or graphic mutilations its actually quite tame in that regard the story moves at the speed of a lazy snail i have the feeling that director ridley scott just phoned this one in the actors are all fine they just needed some direction the music score is also very annoying its especially noticeable since so little is going on in the film it does look good but thats not enough reason to see it by the way did i mention that its boringbr br
