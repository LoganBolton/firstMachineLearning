i completely understand why this movie was made silence of the lambs was an incredible film  a gruesome thriller with a superb story and high jumpfactorbr br what i dont understand is why this movie was made and why anthony hopkins agreed to reprise his role as hannibal the cannibal in this terrible and dissatisfying filmbr br theres no possible way to spoil the movie any further than going to see it could but for those of you who prefer to waste your money dont read on the film is absolutely horrible its so bad that the transition from jodie foster to julianne moore becomes a nonissue br br the only way to truly enjoy the film is to set your watch and leave the theatre exactly two hours into the film because up until that point its quite an interesting thriller the reparte between moore and hopkins is comparable to hopkins and foster and the performances by the other characters are pretty good but literally at the two hour mark the film degrades into nothing but a cheesy dgrade horror flickits sick and its stupid and almost like the crew ran out of filming time and threw together an ending in one day of filmingbr br initial buzz over the thomas harris books unsatisfying and bizarre ending led director ridley scott to order a rewrite and honestly having seen the film and read the books finale i dont know which is worsebr br please  dont waste your money or time on this film unless youre prepared to leave exactly at the two hour point because thats the only way youll feel satisfied about the saga of clarice starling and hannibal lecter continuing the mystery that made the first film and the wait for this one so great
