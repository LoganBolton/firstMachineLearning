im a big fan of thomas harrisi read all his novels at least 5 times and hannibals the book i really love the mosttherefore the movie was my biggest disappointment and i really dont get it why some folks here give it a nine or even a teneither their demands are very low or they havent read the book or botheven if i hadnt read the book id still consider the movie as absolute average and id give it a five the creepymysterious atmosphere from the novel doesnt appear one single time in the moviewhen i saw it first in the cinema i even fell asleepwhy was margot verger a very important character totally omitted why was barney shown as a dumb ignorant whose only ambition is to earn money and most of all why was the psychological process starling went through in the endcaused by the drugs lecter applied to herdescended not to speak about the fact that the ending was omittedtooand totally changed well the reasons why jodie foster refused to play starling again are well known and i accepted italthough like surely many others im very disappointed cause i identified starling with herfor stories like red dragonthe silence of the lambs or hannibal that possess such psychological depth it is very important to identify with a character when theyre adapted for the screenbut as the germans say thats snow of yesterday ridley scott did some incredibly good movies but with this one he doesnt live up to his name jonathan demme had exactly the right feeling for the plot the characters and their relationships towards each other in the silence of the lambs he should have done hannibaltoomy only comfort is that ive seen the movie only two timesits long ago and thank god for that reason im able not to see the scenes from the movie when i read the novel im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone
