hannibal must be the most godawful movie i have seen in a long time in fact i want my money back what a waste of time no plot minimal character development questionable motives poor dialogue substandard acting what else can i say if you havent seen it dont bother i wouldnt even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on tv change the channel the only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype which quite frankly is why they added it if you want to see some gug eating his own brain then fast forward to that bitbr br what was the purpose of this movie its like someone just asked i wonder what hannibal is up to these days and we just went along for the ride he is free in the beginning and hes free at the end in between is a lot of selfindulgence on the part of anthony hopkins and the film makers julianne moore tries valiantly to inject some life into her clarice but they gave her a substandard script and as far as im concerned she was set up to failbr br in my opinion this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word the only reason it made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added which at the end of the day leaves you more with a feeling of contempt than the horror you are supposed to feelbr br i give it a big fat raspberry
