a typical old bw film the dialogues are sometimes good but too often  especially in the second half  they get naive sometimes awfully naive occasionally close to the point where they are unintentionally comical the first third with its background information on ladds gatsby shown with a series of interesting flashbacks is the best part of the movie but once gatsby moves into his new villa and makes his moves on betty field the film gets overly melodramatic the ending is yet another copout ending i dont know whether the novel itself contains this dumb clichéd ending or whether the movies producer made some changes to it but ive always considered caraccidents to be a poor way to add drama to the conclusion of a story ive seen this plotdevice a million times or if its not a car then its a fall from a horse the writer doesnt know how to end the story but he knows that he wants it to be dramatic so he adds in a caraccident lame and to make things worse the accident is outrageously coincidental and preposterous both plotwise and timewise plotwise because fields husbands mistress winters gets killed by field and the fact that winters sort of rushes out from the gasstation into the street as though shed never noticed in the years that she had lived in it that there was a dangerous road right across her house  and of course at the very moment that she comes out she sees ladds car and mistakes it for fields husbands car and then shouts over here im here run me over and make the ending tragic that way timewise because ladd and field get involved in an accident at the very day when they are preparing to tell fields husband about their affair basically there is just too much forced and artificial irony in this accident it also doesnt exactly help this movie how winterss husband da silva goes on a revenge mission to kill the guy who ran over his wife he basically does this by walking around like a zombie going from car to car looking for scratches and acting very badly indeed both da silvas acting and his characters behaviour throughout the film are awful and confusing respectivelybr br scott fitzgerald was upset on a couple of occasions how his novels were adapted for the screen by hollywoods screenwriters and  although he was dead long before this movie was done  he might have been right to complain judging by this films naive script or maybe his novels are even sillier and more naive than this film and were actually improved upon by the screen adaptations or the films are pretty much like the novels i could of course read this particular novel to find out but i just cant be bothered fitzgeralds name doesnt exactly inspire me to read any of his books and i dont mean the way his name sounds he was certainly no heller clavell or twain more like hemingway  a lot of noise about nothing
