i know its rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece  but i am going to anyway i waited for a laugh i tried to give it time i think 20 minutes is long enough to wait in a comedy for a laugh my laugh never came so i gave upbr br its stupid humour not so stupid that you have to laugh though it isnt anywhere near that high grade let me correct that its just stupid  not stupid humour they may have intended for certain scenes to be funny but they werent i suppose if you were really bored you could somehow blend the movie with a hallucination and end up with a mildly entertaining experiencebr br a very pathetic effort
