i enjoyed the mr magoo cartoons i saw while growing up and i enjoy leslie nielsons comic skills so i thought this marriage must produce a funny childbr br i couldnt have been more wrongbr br this movie was just awful i dont recall a single funny moment this is one of the two or three times in hundreds of films over the years ive wanted my money back you will leave this film dejected because you wont ever have that time back to use in a better way in a comedy the plot must draw in the viewer and serve as a framework for gags this plot does neither it just kinda lies there gasping like a beached fish
