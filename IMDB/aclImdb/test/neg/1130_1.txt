i watched this movie last night and let me say its the absolute worst thing i have ever seen the entire film is a train wreck and its not the actors it is the horrible scriptbr br  spoilers  alright eddie loses his job to a monkey his nerdy son is disappointed the bathroom goes crazybr br he gets a free vacation he goes along with uncle nick and the original audry their boats crashes they stay on an island they are stupid and dont even bother to look at the nearby hotelbr br ok so thats that what makes this movie pathetic is the humor it is so horrid hillybillyish and stupid you cant even laugh and its not stupid funny humor either i couldnt laugh the entire thing
