only one word can describe mr magoo  slapstick unfortunately this isnt no airplane looks can decieve and thats exactly what mr magoo does based on the old cartoon leslie nielson plays magoo a bumbling near blind man whop stumbles upon a pair of jewel thieves now he must hunt them down usingblindness basically and thats all this film plays off the blindness of mr magoo now maybe if they had some funny jokes involving this but pretty much its just one of those  droopy dumb grin on your face because youre too ashamed to admit you payed to see this filmsbr br  but mr magoo isnt as bad as its hacked up to be its at least got some funny jokes and its good wholesome fun for the whole family nielson tried to make a naked gun for families in magoo but its no where near as good as that so see it once you might hate it you might love it whatever i personally didnt hate it but i sure didnt like it or even rate it okay 25 stars for mr magoobr br john ulmer
