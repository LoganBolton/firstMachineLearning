this morning i found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed i found myself thinking oh yeah there was a mr magoo movie wasnt there this is more surprising because i remember following the controversy surrounding this movie advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this movie was demeaning i even went to see this movie on the day it opened because i am a fan of both mr magoo and mr nielson and thought he would be an excellent choice to play mr magoo i even remember the opening animated credits because i thought that they were pretty amusingbr br after that though its all a complete blank i think its a pretty sad statement about any movie that it is so lame so bland and so utterly without merit that you cant remember anything from it i understand that leslie nielson isnt always known for appearing in first class comedies but i saw him in spy hard in scary movie 4 and police squad 3 and none of these were great movies but i came away at least remembering something mr magoo though is a complete blankbr br i find myself wondering now if all the controversy surrounding the film wasnt actually generated by the studio that produced it in the hopes of generating at least some small amount of interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie
