leslie nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that i have ever seen there is nothing to like about this film as it is essentially a onejoke film and the joke isnt all that funny how many times are we supposed to laugh at an almost blind man making a fool out of himself thats not funny thats just pitiful nielsen seriously needs to start refusing some of these pathetic scripts and stanley tong needs to stick to making jackie chan films because it doesnt get much worse than this
