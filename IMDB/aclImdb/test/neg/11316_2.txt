leslie nielsen is usually someone whose movies i really like even critically panned flicks like dracula dead and loving it and wrongfully accused so the fact that im slamming mr magoo should show that its a piece of junk it casts nielsen as the myopic title character something gets planted on him and he makes a mess of everything it seems like the combo of nielsen and director stanley tong behind two of jackie chans movies would make this one hilarious movie but it doesnt it seems like they just have people to do anything and theres no real humor herebr br so the original cartoon with jim backus providing the voice was worth seeing so avoid this movie leslie nielsen has also done much better so theres no reason to waste your time on this also starring kelly lynch stephen tobolowsky ernie hudson malcolm mcdowell and miguel ferrer they probably dont wish to emphasize this hunk of junk in their careers
