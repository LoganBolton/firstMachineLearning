itll be a blue christmas indeed if you subject youre family to this i loved the original movie and this one was not worthy of being its sequel actually for all intents and purposes it is not its sequel only one character from the original cast returns granted that character happened to be the hilarious cousin eddie but he simply is not hilarious being the protagonist of a movie his niche is that of the wacky relative who performs zany anticsalongside chevy chase chevy chase was needed in this film for it to be a success and he definitely was not there as far as i am concerned a movie is not a vacation movie unless good ole clark griswold is at the helm
