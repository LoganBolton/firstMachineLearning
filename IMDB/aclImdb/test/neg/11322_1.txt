if we really want to get serious and find osama bin laden then we should take this stinker down to gitmo and force the detainees to watch it theyll be singing within minutes of course im sure that making them watch this godawful dreck violates the geneva convention in several ways br br look my 5 year old daughter isnt allowed to watch tv at home so take her to her grandparents or cousins and shes a little tv zombie she got up and walked away after about ten minutes thats how bad this is br br you know when the person responsible for this garbage was a young writer i bet he or she had dreams of the great american novel now they have to look in the mirror every morning with the realization that they wrote what is possibly the worst hour of television in the history of the mediumbr br and we wonder why the rest of the world hates us
