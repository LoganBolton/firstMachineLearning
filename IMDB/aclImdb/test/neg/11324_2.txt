wow i swear this has never happened to me before i only watched golden temple amazons yesterday and already i havent got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film thats how brilliant this movie is i guess by now i only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive dvd cover art showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target i often get fooled by appealing dvd covers  especially jess franco ones  and i still havent learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences oh well after reading the other usercomments some parts of my memory returned although i still suspect to confuse this film with another jess franco masterpiece i watched the day before namely diamonds of the kilimanjaro and yes that one had an awesome dvd cover as wellbr br golden temple amazons opens with a posse of hot white african amazons  i am aware of the contradiction but dont blame me  slaughtering the parents of a fragile young girl because they were trespassing the turf with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple several years and hormonal changes later the girl returns to the jungle to get her revenge shes accompanied by a bunch of sleazy adventurers who are less interested in the act of vengeance but wouldnt mind taking some gold back home the rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the showcasing of ravishing female nudity and gratuitous sleaze analía ivars eva léon and the other nameless amazons are all regular franco choices and willingly walk around with their breasts proudly exposed you better enjoy gazing at all these perfect female curves as the rest of golden temple amazons is a boring and incompetent mess theres hardly any violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure filler bits and pieces of national geographic documentaries edited into the story and that sort of stuff the awesome dvd cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection but opening the box is utter pointless
