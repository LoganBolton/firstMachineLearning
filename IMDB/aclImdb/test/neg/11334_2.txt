 spoiler alertbr br the point is though that i didnt think this film had an ending to spoil i only started watching it in the middle after matt had gotten into sarahs body but then i became fascinated by the bizarreness of the plot even for a channel 5 movie and couldnt possibly see how matt wld end up happy what about his fiancee at one stage looked like he was gonna get with his best friend surely icky and wrong and then the whole oggi oggi oggi thing does not work as a touching buddybuddy catchphrase tis just ridiculous so was going surely he cant just come back to life and yet how can he live as a woman and then the film just got over that by ending and not explaining anything at all whats that about i was so cross wasted a whole hour of my life for no reason at all  but was one of the funniest films ive ever seen so swings and roundabouts
