this film has possibly the worst title for a stooge short ever dreamed up somewhat fitting given the actual fifteen minute contentbr br i can do without any of the shemp ad stuff but i will admit to having a few lol moments from the twoman comedy offered by moe and larry in some of the new footage and kudos to those guys for trying to give it their all considering the position they were forced into in even making these dogsbr br another bright spot to this and the last ad debacle commotion on the ocean is the decided lack of screen time for joe palma and the back of his head no attempts to have him speak or flap his arms like a chickensee hot stuff may be worth an extra rating pointbr br 210
