stumbled over this film on amazoncom had never heard of its release but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews so being a lover of german movies i bought a copybr br have to say that i was not impressed the production values are cheap the story is derivative the characters are less than engaging and for a comedy it is surprisingly short on laughsbr br i wanted to like this but i just found it lackluster and dull or maybe i expected more of independent german cinema than a gay spin on the full monty and a cast of stereotypesbr br there are bits in the film that make no sense at all like one of the leather bears trying to get ecki in a sling like hed even look at him twice or the vengeful exwife turning up at the match but ending up cheering for her estranged gay husband bunkum is not the word well at least it explains the movies uk title i suppose
