thunder alley finds fabian banned from nascar tracks after causing the death of another driver stanley adams might want to put him on his team of racers but the other drivers arent for having him aroundbr br desperate for employment fabian hooks up with an auto stunt show owner jan murray whos paying him peanuts and trying to capitalize on fabians bad rep hes got to take it but annette funicello whos murrays daughter provides another reason to stick aroundbr br the rest of the film is fabians struggle to get back to the nascar circuit while at the same time juggling both annette and his current girl friend diane mcbain personally i would have taken mcbain she has it all over annettebr br thunder alley is helped by location shooting at the southern nascar tracks and good film footage of nascar racing not helped by a rather silly story which delves into the real reason for fabians problems and his rather unrealistic recovery from samebr br still fans of nascar might go for this
