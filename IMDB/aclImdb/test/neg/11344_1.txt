i am a regular reader of kathy reichs temperance brennan novels as such i am extremely surprised she even consulted on this showbr br it is horrible by comparison to the books the temperance brennan character is in the books a down to earth recovering alcoholic and divorced mom of a college aged daughter in bones she is an arrogant rhymes with rich who in typical p c fashion is not a mother the emphasis on her assisting staff complete with lurid details of who has had how many sexual exploits is totally in contrast with the booksbr br in total deference to the p c movement she portrays the enemies of the u s as peace lovers  some of the information isnt even correct for example having a character from afghanistan as an active member of an arabamerican friendship group since when is an afghan an arab im sure if negative references were made to disadvantaged minorities or women or glbts the shows producerswritersdirectors would have to issue an apology however in typical far left fashion all of the racial slurs go to the highest achieving minority groupasians as david boreanaz agent booth continually refers to angela montenegro as a squintbr br forget that stuff and forget this show after the man in the suv episode i thought id try a second episode to see if it got any better it only got worse i dont even care if the teenager in question was murdered or committed suicide and i wont be watching the show ever again
