this is so bad i dont know where to beginbr br the lead role is a good starting point it is a supreme mary sue character that has few things in common with the original one from the book who was a bit more credible no this one is invincible infallible indomitable and insipid even beyond the overinflated standards that this chicks with swords era that our medias are spinning out of late she is a twentysomething topmodel thin as a match yet rich already a leader in her academic field a kungfu master a natural sniper and seems to have enough authority to naturally trump anyone official like puny fbi agents she is godbr br to balance it out she is supposed to be socially awkward due to her typically harsh upbringing that transformed her into a spock which gives us some delighted moments where she wonders what is star wars or american idol but yet when its really important she can conveniently reveal herself as a top negotiator and diplomat because she is so superior ya know to top it out she is played by a wooden actressbr br the more talented boreanaz serves as a fairevaloir token for this construct acting as a bumbling comicrelief and house watson in fact everything in there is a popparody of better works like sherlock holmes csi and xfiles from which it tries to emulate the sexual tension between main protagonists it is however cheaper as this is delivered with all the subtlety of an elbow poke in the ribs but a million million poor factory girls will doubtlessly buy into it hence the crazy rating this turkey getsbr br in fact the lowest common denominator goes a long way in this sad puppy resulting in titillating sex details from the legion of sidekicks that aim to pass it out as daring and trendy while the overall tone of the show carries an obvious neoconservative view on thingsbr br storywise theres not much here to feast upon as crimes that always start out with some gruesome remains are resolved using nonexistent technology while the squints lovable but so wrong the women less than the guys goes on varied theories all of them futile as the main character has it all from the start and once it is established she goes out and then punch the guy typically a real tough hombre with a spin kick here and a slapper there the end
