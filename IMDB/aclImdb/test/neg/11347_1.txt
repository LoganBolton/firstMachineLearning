the first season of bones is playing in finland and i cant believe the amount of bullshit that this show puts on  the characters are shallow poorly directed and clumsybr br its a poor mans csi or actually csi without coherent plot although bones has potential it fails due to the lacking of the director who hasnt been able to extract the essence of the show from the actors its actually sad to see a show throw it all away when it could had been a descent show with just a pinch more thought from the start you get the feeling how awkward the acting isbr br long story short  dont waste your time on bones
