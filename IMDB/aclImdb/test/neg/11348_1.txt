i just finished watching one episodes15 a boy in a bush so maybe my review is not very fairbr br but based on that episode this is a very poor version of csi the acting is crap the main character dr whatever her name is is so fake it actually hurts i wouldnt cast her to do an add for dog foodbr br the other hurtful thing is david boreanaz of the angel fame a good actor does a great job but wasted coz of the idiotic acting of that womanbr br supporting cast is ok but all is ruined due to this stupid acting of emily deschanel br br very disappointing version of csi very sorry to see it appear on the filmography of some of the potential talents involved in itbr br that woman is really sht at least in that episode but based on this one view i will not even invest watching it even if it was shown on an elevator screen
