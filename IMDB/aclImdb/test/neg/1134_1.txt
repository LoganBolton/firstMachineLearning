note i only saw approximately the last half of this movie so feel free to take my review with whatever grain of salt you deem appropriate that being said seeing what i saw was more than enough to make me quite convinced that a onestar rating for this is enoughbr br in short its a dismalplot slaughter of the wonderful precursor nl christmas vacation with chevy chase only it doesnt have chevy chase in it and it takes place in a generic tropical island essentially with no connection to christmas at allbr br ol chevy probably didnt want in because the plot is that devoid of actual fun instead they got the screwy cousin eddie who again was great in the original but in this he is just over the top and an extremely poor basis for any movie considering the plot and acting the attempts at humor are generic to a degree where even contemporary television comedy trumps it and considering that this is supposed to be comedy i doubt i need to say morebr br this is not to be seen for its qualities for it has none but for its failings and again how hollywood is spilling its lifes blood of the past in the pursuit of a quick buckbr br i think ill watch the original before the upcoming christmas season just to try to regain my childhood innocence from a lost time when motion pictures were more than just highbudget but mindless garbage
