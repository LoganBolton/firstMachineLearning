one chinese gang attacks and wipes out another gang in the beginning of the film unfortunately the patriarch of the winning family is killed in the process oddly and without any discernible reason the gang solicits a volunteer to blame the massacre on and he leaves until the police decide to stop investigating now how one man alone is the one responsible for about 50 deaths is beyond me so sending this one guy away just seemed silly but thats the plot later when this man comes home betrayals and scheming have occurredleading to almost one hour and fifteen minutes of nonstop killingbr br if you are looking for a chinese martial arts film with much of a plot then you should probably skip this movie as its practically nonstop action and practically no plot or character developmenteven when compared to other martial arts films i would estimate that 8090 of the film are fight scenesendless and reasonably well made fight scenes using knives again and again and again fight scenes if you want a film with a body count perhaps running into the hundreds as people are slashed kicked and slashed then this is the film for you the problem was by the end of the film there are literally no people left to kill and the film really lost my interest deep it aint but if you want to see excitement and action only then this film is for you br br by the way this movie is set in contemporary times and no one thinks of shooting the hero until just near the end and when they finally do the logical thing its too late and the effort is really really lame logical errors like this and the ladys suicide why make this a turn off your brain type of film
