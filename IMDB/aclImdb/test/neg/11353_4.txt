mararía really disappointed me i cant consider it as a bad movie but the development just seemed too rushed and nonbelievable for it to evoke any emotions dr fermín displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one cant really understand where it was born from i mean how many times does he ever have a conversation with mararía maybe once also mararía never appeared to be a real character instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie or else another title was needed some of the best acting came from a role that wasnt really important to the story that of marcial the subintelligent yet humble drunkard of course the scenery the cultural tidbits of the canary islands and other wow moments were interesting but the movie fell short of a documentary in case this was its real intention and most importantly as a solid drama
