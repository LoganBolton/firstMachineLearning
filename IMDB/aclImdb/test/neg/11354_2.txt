i was looking forward to this based on the reviews on this and the fairly good rating this was a big disappointment this doesnt hold a candle to contemporary zombie flicks like shaun of the deadday of the dead land of the dead etc horror flicks sometimes take a while to get going you have to build up the characters so when they snuff ityou feel some empathy etc but even so theres a full 45 minutes to sit through here even before you sniff a corpse up to that pointits like watching a bad soap opera nothing of any interest or relevance happens and if you are going to watch this for the first timeyou can honestly start watching after 45 minutes you wont miss anything plot wise when things do get going its all very subpar stuff some of the kills and make up are done well others are done very poorly consistency is lacking here and there are some really shocking continuity errors and some of the most wooden acting ive ever seenbr br this could all be passable if you really believed this was all taking place on a plane but with guns being fired firebombs being let offno pilots in the cockpit in a violent storm yet the plane stays in the air cmon were not all simpletonsbr br oh and does it really take a whole minute for a fighter jets missile to hit a plane that is a few hundred yards away i know its a zombie film and you have to stretch things but this film along with the other main defects listed above had zero credibility one to miss
