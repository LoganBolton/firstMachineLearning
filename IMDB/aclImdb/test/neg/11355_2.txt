i never really thought about watching this film i kept seeing it perched on the horror movie shelf in my local video rental shop and never thought much about it just your run of the mill bland zombie flick with a bit of gore and a sex scene nothing special might as well watch pythonoh no wait thats a terrible filmbr br i only decided to watch it when some of my friends saw it on tv and said it was an awful piece of trash so i decided to verify these tales and only then did i realise how terrible the film hiding behind the bland and uninteresting dvd box cover wasbr br not that the idea is bad in itself a plane is a confined area and would be a real death trap for the people on board should zombies make their appearancea good premise for a zombie film but this film took a good setting and crapped all over it with poor acting unsteady camera work annoying characters and a terrible scorebr br the characters all have different levels of hatefulness there are two young couples who are basically friends going on a vacation in france one couple is composed of a jock and his annoying bitchy girlfriend who is having an affair with mr jocks best friend who came along with his girlfriend who is a blonde psycho there is also a policeman escorting a conman an effeminate and highly annoying conman the policeman is probably one of the least irritating characters of the lot then there is a bunch of air hostesses who mostly end up as zombie chowno i didnt watch the whole film it was just too painful an experience to carry through almost as bad as watching cannibal holocaust oh and theres also a golfer on holiday with his wife some strange air marshal who really does not appear to be important until hes summoned to help deal with the zombie escapees a trio of scientists who all fall victim to the undead and a couple of pilots the camera work is often shaky and although many people dont seem to mind it can really get on your nerves after a while like having a small fly buzz constantly around your head its small but its there and its annoyingbr br the adulterous couple are genuinely annoying all they do is have sex in the planes toilets while their spouses arent lookingin fact all the young adults in this film are insanely annoying they whine bitch argue and have some of the most inane and mindbuggeringly boring dialogue in the movieyes it makes you glad to see them diebr br the score is atrocious it is so generic and uninspired it kills any kind of suspense a scene could have generated and replaces it with the feeling that someone is scraping a blackboard with their nails and laughing at you in fact it sounds like the score frompython that film will never stop haunting mebr br there is also a character that the film makers seemed incredibly intent on having in as many shots as possible a nun sitting near the young adults and clutching her bible who is included in so many shots you start to wonder if she plays any major part in the filmbut no she doesnt so why have her in so many scenes was it because the films creators original project was a nun porn flick nobody will ever knowbr br the zombies look pretty good their makeup is good and they are probably far better actors than the living characters they are far more convincing and likable the guard responsible for keeping an eye on the scientists illegal cargo was quite funny a large crate appears to fall on him and the camera briefly shows the audience that his leg has been pierced with some kind of sharp objectyet he doesnt scream wince or moan in pain he just grunts and squirms in an attempt to get the thing out of his legin fact he sounds more like an overweight man trying to scratch his back than a man in painbr br ah well all in all i give it 1 for the interesting setting and 1 for the zombiesbr br watch this movie only if you like young adults bickering and throwing things at each other and sadly there really isnt anything funny about the whole thing so watching for a laugh would probably fail unless youre high on some kind of psychoactive drug
