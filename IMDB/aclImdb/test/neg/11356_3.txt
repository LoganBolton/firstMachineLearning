this review contains spoilersbr br i was searching through horror movie dvds on amazon when i came across flight of the living dead i already knew from the name that it was going to be abysmally naff and most probably a ripoff of snakes on a plane but it was selling brand new for 69p so i figured i didnt really have much to losebr br the music played over the opening credits didnt fit at all although i did like the song itself a poprock song isnt really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie it started off surprisingly well the opening scenes werent too bad some of the acting was a little cringeworthy but not as bad as i initially thought it would bebr br it all goes well until laura cayouette rocket from kill bill vol 2 enters the picture she is supposed to be playing a scientist if she is shes not a very bright one luckily shes polished off pretty quicklybr br i actually physically laughed out loud when the camera panned over the passengers of the plane during some turbulence there was a nun have you ever been on a plane with a nun i was surprised she wasnt clutching a crucifixbr br finally after 35 minutes we get to some zombie action and use the word action loosely the special effects are pretty below standard but thats to be expected from a movie with this budget being covered in blood and having yellow contact lenses does not make you look like a zombie though it makes you look pretty amusing using slow motion doesnt work particularly well either i think this movie is probably guilty of trying to add too much story trying to pass off the problem as a variant of the malaria virus wasnt an especially good move either considering malaria isnt a virusbr br the rest of the movie pretty much plays out like any other zombie movie most of the characters are killed off and it eventually ends up with a handful of people fighting to stay alive possibly the worst part of flight of the living dead is the utterly inconceivable ending i know its a movie about people who come back to life and feast on the living but the ending was just ridiculous rating ★★
