im a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one i find the best features of zombie flicks to be the sense of solidarity and a need to survive this movie focused more on a lets just make it gory viewbr br the movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects when the zombies emerge from the floor and take the guy down there is blood just spraying out of the hole i wasnt aware that holes in airplane floors bleed so extensively and the original zombie lady kelly or something displayed the worst acting i have ever seen when she woke up and began feeling sick i laughed quite hard when she died deserved it in every waybr br i was a little confused as to why dr kelly could talk after becoming a zombie but then there wasnt anything uttered by another zombie because annoying screams and shrieks and they seemed to be killing the zombies pretty efficiently by shooting them in the abdomen yet when dr bennett is expelled from the airplane and into the engine removing most of his lower half he is still able to live at the endbr br i kinda felt that they altered things to make a good scene when one of the bitchy girlfriends i didnt take the time to learn their names they played a pointless role was in the bathroom she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror was it a twoway mirror to watch milehigh clubbers ive never broken a mirror on an airplane bad luck and all that but i doubt there is that much room behind there with the insanely confined space of the actually bathroom and allbr br the few redeeming qualities were too little too late sadly one thing the movie had going for it was the smoking hot flight attendants yet they felt the need to kill all but one off and i will admit that i laughed pretty damn hard when the old lady chomps down on franks arm and he says shes gumming me to death or something to that degreebr br honestly im sad i wasted my nine dollars on this movie the fact that i bought it underage kinda redeems that but still it failed on so many levels stick with dawn of the dead and 28 days later
