i dont understand why some of you or many have given this film upward of 8 stars out of 10 do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason sure this may be a zombie flick with some splatter but thats it im not a hater on zombie films but this was awful really actually i should call it more like a zombiesoap because thats how the acting is production is well okay barely an attempt at plot development awful acting silly effects clich√©s and an abrupt ending go ahead and like zombie movies but dont ever give this above a 50 honestly though the only reason you should want to watch this movie is to laugh seriously
