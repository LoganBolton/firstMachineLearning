this has to be the worst movie ive seen this year and i watch a lot of cable the plot is just ridiculous the scenes are just thrown at you with no action no start or ending of any scene its just random idiots with makeup that scream in some plane the special effects  spielberg would laugh his ass off  are horrible the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though i have to admin that i couldnt bear to watch it to the end the scene where the great scientist bennett was holding for dear life by the engine body was too much for me im sorry for my bad english i am from romania  and this is my first post  i had to sign up just to make a comment on this movie because i just cant believe that this is a movie released in 2007
