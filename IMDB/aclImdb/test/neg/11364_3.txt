an obvious cashin on the insert monster here on a plane gimmick flight of the living dead is about what youd expect it to be br br the film has little or no plot which is what youd expect from a film of this type although it is fun in parts i must say the zombieaction is particularly entertaining once the film picks up it never stops the pacing is solidbr br the practical special effects are pretty good but the cgi is terrible and distracting br br the ending seems to leave the film open to a sequel lets hope that doesnt come to fruition br br if youre a diehard fan of the zombie subgenre of horror films id recommend it to you its worth at least one watch however if youre just an avid fan of the genre leave it on the shelf br br 310
