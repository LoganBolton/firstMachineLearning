this was the worst tv movie i had ever seen the visuals were so dang choppy it made me dizzy i hated the constant zoom in and zoom out and the frequent black and white to color switch i also thought that the story didnt make any sense what so ever and it was another clich√©d action movie with a hero a bad guy and a few hostages i could make a better movie than that with my own camera why i can hold it steady something the director couldnt do over all truly the worst i have ever seen you thought disney was bad i didnt even bother to watch the whole thing because im sure i could guess the outcome and the visual were the worst i have ever seen
