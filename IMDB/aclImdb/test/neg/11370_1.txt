director jeremiah checheck who brought us big budget debacles like the avengers and the remake of diabolique has directed this ripoff of the die hard concept done on  what looks like  a blair witch budget br br a california nuclear reactor is overtaken by arab terrorists but  are you ready  the terrorists arent arab theyre really disgruntled american soldiers masquerading as arabs we find out that they dont really intend to blow up the reactor just make a statement were not sure what the statement is but never mind so theres really no threat but then one of the terrorists decides to go it alone and actually blow up the plant because hes kind of crazy so maybe there is a threat after all but the army goes in and all the bad guys are killed so there was no threat oh and a good guy is killed too let that be a lesson to everybodybr br if all of this sounds muddled and kinda of a waste of time then you got the idea of what watching meltdown is all aboutbr br the script never bothers to introduce the characters or to even give any personal details that might flesh them out or emotionally involve the audience so were left with one dimensional characters theexpertthatnobodywilllistento thetriggerhappysergeant theslimypoliticians thedweebyengineers the story skips from one clich√© incident to the next in a formula composite of practically every action movie youve ever seen but at nearly every turn just when we think something may be at stake the script flinches and we find out theres actually nothing to worry aboutbr br like die hard theres an police officer whos on the inside unbenownst to the bad guys the big twist is that the cop here isa woman oh and shes injured too but not that bad just enough to make her wince a couple times oh and instead of the walkie talkie that bruce willis had this cop has a magic cell phone that works everywhereeven underground when hes not yelling at everybody else bruce greenwood  his jaw made out of granite  tries to soothe her over the walkie talkie he even makes a joke once but were afraid his face might crack after all this is serious businessbr br but mostly its scene after scene of people arguing the military expert is arguing to wait it out his reasoning doesnt seem particularly sound but hes supposed to be the smart guy in this movie so okaaaay the people at the white house argue with him the army sergeant argues with him too the nice pakistani nuclear engineer argues with the main terrorist the dialogue is absolutely b movie all the way and lines like stop the broadcast stop the broadcast may have you in rolling off your sofa as you wonder if the characters are actually referring to this sillinessbr br maybe to compensate for the lack of production quality the camerawork is kept jittery in that faux documentary 21 grams style thats supposed to lend immediacy and energy to the scenes but the way its indiscriminately and amateurishly applied here its downright annoying even pretentious further attempts to ratchet up the tempo are made with the inclusion of nonsensical black and white footage thats randomly intercut with the main action but this too is pretentious and annoying in that blair witch kinda way in short the stylistic attempts look very amateurishbr br the music lives up to the visuals  its synthy and cheap sounding sort of like a porn movie but with less melody and lots more heart beat sounds the graphic treatment is howlingly bad too cheesy graphics in huge red font scream out to us 928 pm as though the timeclock actually makes some kind of differencebr br meltdown may work as a marketing concept but its clear that the script was a second thought fx  part of fox  put this cheesy production together and dropped several million dollars on it now thats what i call a meltdown
