i gave it a rating of 3 out of 10br br and whats sad is i made a point of looking up the movie schedule for that channel so i wouldnt miss seeing it i wanted to watch this film because it is based on a book by one of my favorite authors barbara wilson as a lesbian i expected to love this filmbr br i dont know how ms wilson felt about the film but i found it a major disappointmentbr br it should have been intriguing  it was a mystery  set in spain and the main character cassandra is a language translator who gets contacted by a mysterious beautiful woman who offers cassandra a great deal of money to locate her exhusband benbr br there are secrets galore revealed but for some reason it just didnt matter it was like oh so what i could not get involved with these characters or come to care about them or feel for them i couldnt even identify with these charactersbr br i think a large part of the films failure was the actress playing the main character she looked old tired worn out and as dull as dishwater her hair was a perpetual mess her baggy clothes were boring and she just was not appealing or interestingbr br the best part of the film was getting to hear a dean martin recording but even that was ruined by the weird makeup worn by the man who was dancing and lipsynching to the song believe me  it was nothing like getting to see the suavely handsome mr martin performing itbr br the ending is so syrupy youll wish you had some pancakes to go with the syrupbr br
