comparing this movie to anything by almodovar is an insult to almodovar the best thing i can say about it is it tries desperately to be like an almodovar movie and fails miserably the script is dreadful the characters are onedimensional and the performances are the quality of highschool drama except marcia gay hardens which is pretty good given the material she has to work with furthermore the cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the whimsical beauty of gaudis architecture or the infectious charm of barcelona if you enjoy the grit pathos and dark quirky comedy of almodovars movies youll find none of them here spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid
