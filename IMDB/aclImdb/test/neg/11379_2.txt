i just get exited when the movie startbecause i saw juliette lewis name on the screenthe script seemed very complicated first but as the movie continued it became understandably cleari concentrated well on it but the result was disappointingbecause the object of sex used too much on the film unnecessarily and it seemed to me that the director ignore ones who has tendency upon opposite sexin my opinion the well prepared script couldnt be embodiedas we look at the castthe movie promises something in the beginning or i just expected too much and finally the endthe end is so so much mediocre that i wouldnt expectthe main character cassandra wants to give message about having baby and how a baby can change a lifein my opinion that scene is the real disaster for the film all in all the characters are funny and acted beautifullybut only cast cant save a movie
