ghost son is lamberto bavas best film and at the same time also his worst i suppose that statement requires some slight clarification its his best because its well directed ambitious accessible and very stylish but his worst because its a dull unoriginal movie and undeniably a huge letdown to all the real fans of bavas past efforts lets face it many fans myself certainly included wouldnt have been interested in this film judging by the plot the famous names attached to it and even the boring sounding title the only motivation here was lamberto bava who brought us large amounts of convoluted gialli and fun splatter films in the past ghost son is a bit of his comeback film alongside the torturer and although the latter definitely isnt a good film it at least lives up to his fans lines of expectations with excessive amounts of sleaze blood and sadism ghost son is a weak and intolerably soft horror film even talking in terms of mainstream ghost stories the emphasis lies too much on sentimentality and this badly affects the already limited number of horrific  creepily atmospheric moments the basic premise might feature one or two potentially good ideas but the film is overall dull and far too clichéd john hannah and laura harring star as a happy couple living on a remote ranch in south africa and breeding horses for a living the joy and happiness couldnt possibly improve so naturally something tragic is bound to happen and it does mark dies in a car accident but the inconsolable stacey remains at the ranch where shes in constant contact with marks spirit she even gets pregnant with his child but shortly after baby martins birth mysterious events begin to occur it seems as if marks restless and selfish ghost possessed the baby and uses him to encourage stacy into committing suicide with all the focus on the couples relationship many of the events and sub plots are underdeveloped andor remains unexplained like the whole background of the youthful maid thandi theres too little action and the only real frightmoments are too obviously borrowed from classic films such as the exorcist and rosemarys baby vomiting green goo self moving furniture purely talking in terms of horrific entertainment ghost son is a painful misfire but it has to be said its a beautiful and enchanting looking failure the cinematography is extremely elegant and many camera angles are truly inventive and suggestive the moody score sometimes even manages to create an ominous atmosphere even though theres nothing of any significance happening on screen there are several beautiful images of the south african wildlife to admire but if that interests you i suppose youre better off watching national geographic instead not much to recommend here fans of atmospheredriven ghost stories have much better options to choose from and diehard bava fanatics are advised to rewatch demons macabre or blade in the dark
