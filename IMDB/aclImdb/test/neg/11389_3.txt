spoiler or two not that is mattersbr br two things stand out about this movie first is its been titled both bruno and the dress code and if youve seen this movie youll catch the irony in thatbr br second is its addressing issues completely off the wall the adventures of a grade school cross dresser isnt something that there was a crying need for a movie about nor a topic that i think most people would be interested in shirley maclaine manages to walk around the issues of gender by tying brunos desire to wear a dress to religion which probably opens up an even thornier can of wormswhat was she thinking br br yes theres some humor and its not directly offensive but the kind of unsettling feeling in the beginning just keeps on growing it doesnt do much except repeat the liberal mantra that different people should be accepted or maybe excepted no matter what br br which is finebut in order for people to live in a society everyone has to give a little to get along bruno doesnt just want to wear a dress he wants to show up looking like a miniature gladys knight on awards night and his final costume makes him resemble a cabbage patch cowgirl doll yet all the other kids dress and behave well like regular kids so what gives if it came down to it we all could declare ourselves special or different and behave any way we felt like and the result would be total chaos br br this accepting of people who are different is also pretty narrowly defined i doubt we will ever see a movie about a kid finding his true self and wanting to wear overalls hunt geese and go to tractor pulls and demanding everyone else just accept him as he is bruno is one stupid movie and a complete waste of time
