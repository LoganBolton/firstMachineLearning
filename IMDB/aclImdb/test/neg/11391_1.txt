this is a horrific remake of the french movie ma vie en rose httpimdbcomtitlett0119590 the only scenario that i can imagine in which anyone sinise bates butler what were they thinking agreed to be associated with it is maclaine seeing the original being rightly impressed and enlisting a friend with no writing credits  or talent  to his name to translate the themes for american audiences  whom they both agreed are stupid stupid stupid then she enlisted other friends to sign up and they did so as friends  certainly not on the merits of this pathetically contrived everythingbutthekitchensink scriptbr br im not a kneejerk fan of french film but ma vie en rose is a subtle thoughtful and thought provoking treatment of sensitive cultural issues i would love to see it get wider exposure among englishspeaking audiences  and if that means an american remake so be it but puhleeze a little respect for the issues and the intelligence of the audience  and better direction for the actors who couldnt seem to decide if they were working for tennessee williams or jerry lewis
