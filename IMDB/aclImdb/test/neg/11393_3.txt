this movie was disturbing not because of the subject matter but because of the way it was handled the extremely overweight mother angela did not even make it on the cover of the video case when most of the rest of the cast did this is not fair but is a statement in itself i also notice her picture is missing from imdb maybe her own choice and it looks like this is her only film ever the language in this movie was crude beyond necessity watched with my 10yr old son because it was rated pg in canada and the language coming out of their mouths was shameful  disgusting never did appreciate shirley maclain like so many others seem tobr br love kathy bates and always will sineses part was annoyingbr br the little boy alex is a great little actor ill have to see what else hes been up to lately
