after watching this film i thought to myself they really glossed up errol flynns life the movie is really nice eye candy they really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of hollywood just right the costumes were great all the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonairbr br is this a serious film about errol flynns life nah its a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his lifebr br why am i critiquing this film this is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver duncan reagher was really good as errol flynn he was not as good looking as the original but he made you believe that flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously but as a man who although gifted with great talent was kind of disturbed and unhappy inside flynns love life was a disaster considering he had so many failed marriages he also lost a lot of good friends during his life he also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant olivia dehavilland the last scene of the film showed errol kind of begging for olivia to stay with him and instead she walks away he is shown in his tux looking really empty and slowly walking around the pool as he pours his drink into the pool it was a sad way to end the film but kind of fitting because everyone knows by now how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestylebr br this film couldve had much more depth couldve been better wellwritten sure they showed all the scandals but they never showed errol flynns human center surprisingly duncan reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the character of errol flynn even though the film writing didnt put any depth therebr br ill probably never see this film again but i can still remember after viewing this film gosh this couldve been so much more i give this film a d
