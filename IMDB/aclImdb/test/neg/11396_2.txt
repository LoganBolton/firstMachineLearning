if you read errol flynns autobiography my wicked wicked ways you will see that this film is full of poetic licence not that that makes much of a difference because errol flynn was pretty generous with poetic licence in the autobiography anyway no need to worry about spoilers since there is nothing there to spoilbr br to me it would seem more sensible to use the story about a fictitious hollywood actor then you could go out and find a better actor than duncan regehr to play him and you wouldnt have to worry about the audience saying things like but he didnt have a moustaches in captain blood another failing of this film is that it shows flynn as a twodimensional character flynn was an intelligent man well educated well read this film only concentrates on his funster imagebr br regehr is a disaster the rest of the cast struggle with their scripts hal linden is ok as warner and barbara hershey makes a believable damita although lili damita herself did not think sobr br the best thing to do with this film is to forget about it and let it gently slip away to oblivion so what i am writing this for i cant imagine
