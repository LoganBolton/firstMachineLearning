they said it would be a film greater than turks fruit how darebr br they its not even 10 of this classic bad acting the only character i felt sympathy for was the onebr br played by angela schijf her acting was the best in the whole film the story couldve been interesting but it wasnt some scenes were very beautiful filmed lights and camera thebr br opening scene for example but the bad acting made the magicbr br disappearbr br i really dont understand why so many people voted this film sobr br good
