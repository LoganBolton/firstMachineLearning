you can generally ask two questions concerning 80s lowbudget horror films and this demon wind in particular 1 is it a good film no 2 is it a fun film you bet demon wind is a gruesomely filthy and nauseating tale filled with cheesy makeup effects and nasty violence the story is pretty much nonexistent and involves a group of young people revealing the horrible secrets of one of the groups ancestors apparently his grandparents used to live in a devilworshiping neighborhood and evil in the form of demons and fog still dwells around there but i got to hand it to this filmfrom start to finish it breathes morbidity the diabolical undertones the playful gore and the relatively decent acting all together make this film raise high above the mainstream uninspired 80s slashers for sure it shows some creativity and guts literally where other productions from this decade fall into routine and oblivion more easily this creators clearly got inspired by the success of the evil dead and perhaps even lamberto bavas demons but what the heck its fun and made with lots of enthusiasm althoughthis film does have a pretty high what the f standard at times especially near the end when flashbacks and laser shows are happily being mixed and what the hell is the story on those two wannabe magicians nonetheless demon wind gets my recommendation if your likes arent too high concerning crap horror
