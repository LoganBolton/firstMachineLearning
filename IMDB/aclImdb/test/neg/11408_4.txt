i truly love horror films  try to give every one i see as much credit or sometimes more as possible but this is really pushing the ticketmost of the cast were very likeable but hardly any of them could act at all  but then again think about the writingdialogue of this messsome good makeup but absolutely ridiculous special fx all in all i give it 3 out of 10   am having second thoughts about that
