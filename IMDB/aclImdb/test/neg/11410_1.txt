ive seen this movie about 6 or 7 times and it truly gets funnier every time perhaps what i enjoy most is the tired character paradigms that the movie offers us the somber allamerican male protagonist his blonde girlfriend the theater nerd with glasses a brunette girl the antagonistic jock and brunette girl 2 however were then presented with two magician martial arts experts with mullets driving a convertible if anyone can explain that please contact me among other highlights are bobby johnstons portrayal of the jock character dell and his trademark line thats why i keep her around in watching johnstons performance it comes as no surprise that his career quickly descended into the realm of softcore porn spoiler also after multiple viewings i still have absolutely no idea what that big demon at the end says at any point its just electronically muffled noises oh well thats probably for the better and lastly why are all the demons so slippery is wet skin scarier it certainly didnt help in this film
