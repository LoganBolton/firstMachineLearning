wow i just saw demon wind a little while ago and i dont think ill ever be the same it has the power to inspire nightmares but for all the wrong reasons actuallybr br never before has humanity seen such a gratuitous change in makeup for no damn reason or similarly so much bad zombie  makeup that makes you hungry for those halloween green marshmallowsbr br or so much naked old lady for that matter but then there was the shiningbr br the plot here is so amateurish that it actually almost holds a little bit of charm as does the dialog the last shot of the film is just so silly that its beyond description its like some drunk college student got together with some pals and decided to throw bruce willis type dialog together with i guess teenybopper dialog from some elm street film the result is jarring and itd be truly funny if it was intended that waybr br ah what the hey ill laugh anywaybr br hell get together with your friends and watch this but make absolutely sure youre drunk first or you may go insane particularly if youre a college film studentbr br cheers
