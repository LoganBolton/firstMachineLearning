another son of sam is definitely not an oscar winner technically its horrible the acting is not too good either but there is something about it that makes you want to watch more sort of like a car wreck the ridiculous closeups of the killers eyes are more funny than anything if you are looking for a scarethis aint the flick for you its very obscure and nearly impossible to find im sure theres a reason for that for a while it was titled hostage it dont matter what you call it its still a poor choice for entertainment it might be good for a mst3000 party or something can you believe they would use such a title as another son of sam if that dont have exploitation written all over it ill eat my hat i remember when this was shot in belmont nc a lot of local personalities were used as talent
