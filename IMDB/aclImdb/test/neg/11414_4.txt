im really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie dont get me wrong its not that i dont like these kind of moviesbr br while i very well can enjoy a good mindless hollywood action blockbuster like die hard 40 i like the dogma kind of movies or reallifeasitismovies just as much if they are well madebr br a good example is festen 1998 no music no dramatic camera angles no special fx no fancy locations just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent moviebr br is nine lives devoid of dramatic camera angles special fx and fancy locations yes is it a good movie im glad you asked br br the answer is absolutely notbr br first of all everyone is raving about the acting performances im terribly sorry but you can act all you want but if the story and the dialogue is not believable the acting falls on its behind immediately and that is exactly the case with nine livesbr br not once did i have the feeling while watching nine lives that i was watching real people having a real conversation i had the feeling i was watching actors trying to come across as real characters while they were were saying things a real person would never say under the circumstancesbr br you can hardly call it a spoiler but there are some dialogue excerpts below if you think that reading ten lines of ridiculous dialogue will ruin your movie experience stop reading here if you want a good laugh continue readingbr br the dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragical you want examples plenty of those in nine livesbr br example1br br picture this couple visits their filthy rich friends in their new mansion woman sees this castle of a house and says to her husbandbr br woman i could get used to this meaning the expensive house man dont woman why not it could be man no they are who they are and we are who we are woman i like the sound of that  we are who we arebr br she likes the sound of that her man is acting like a jerk but she likes the sound of that then an elderly couple walks past them holding hands this is what the woman comes up withbr br woman look they are like children after school they lived through so much shared everything i love youbr br they are like children after school and then the most overused clich√© lines you ever heard finishing with i love you she says this while her man is being a jerk to her yes very logical very realistic not if anything this kind of dialogue made me wanna strangle some of the characters in the movie for saying these horrible horrible thingsbr br example 2br br elderly mom dad and younger daughter at a funeral dad i didnt realize andrew was religious mom its for comfort daughter its for strength mom life is fleeting dad and daughter burst out laughing br br yeah this oneliner cracks me up any time especially at a funeral sorry i must have missed the joke herebr br and it goes on and on and onbr br how about the camera work dont even go there boring would be a compliment it supposed to come across as realistic instead you miss half of the actors facial expressions the only thing left to watch in this movie while half the time the camera is aimed at someones back or side instead of the facebr br conclusion well dont say i didnt warn you its a good movie to rent if you want to make out with your date or something during the movie because you wont even care whether the movie is playing or not after the first five minutesbr br overrated and more boring than watching grass grow kinda sums it up
