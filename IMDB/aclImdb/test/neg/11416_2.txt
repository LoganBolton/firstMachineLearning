quit while your ahead is a phrase they never learn typical hollywood sequel scenario if the first film was only shocking the second wasnt expect the third to be the worst thing to hit the screen this year even worse are the prequels events of which were already explained in detail if you havent seen to first two films you will not like this one its like starting to watch lord of the rings or star wars with the last trilogy movie so stand alone this film is notbr br remember in the first movie about lucians revenge remember the second about the long lost savage brother well if you saw those two 5 min moments and paste them together you would get a 5 min prequel but the creators ether thought these 5 min were vital historical events or just wanted to give a job to some actors cast and crew and maybe make some money in the process i have a loot of money i make movies for a living and im bored what will i do i know ill make a movie so anyway you get this 5 min prequel and you stretch it for 90 min  thats this movie and you know what will happen to the main immortal characters so there is little suspense by the way all the drama of the movie is in those 5 min the only thing that made my eyebrow rise was mom killing in the begging of the movie sick the rest was braveheart remix if you want a comedy see braveheart first then this moviebr br now im going to rant a bit  the movie put me in the mood who invented the concept of vampire vs werewolf in the first place its older than i am and got old just as fast and why do vampires look like goth girls in heat while werewolves look like psycho bears hiding bad films behind cleavage fails isnt it about time we got some sane slimmer werewolves with an upright posture how can their unchangeable werewolves even breed if they rip everybody into shreds and why with all their powers the vampires didnt rule the world blaa blaa blaa what a waste
