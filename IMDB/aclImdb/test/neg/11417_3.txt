to put it simply this was a pompous piece of canine poopie overly stagey and everyone being the total melodramatic drama queen at every single moment after a while i was starting to wish that every character in the movie wasnt such a stuffedup anal retentivebr br and this movie has another one of those truly annoying things that has recently come into vogue and shouldnt have all the scenes are in a sort of washedout bluesteelgreyishness hmmm the last time i checked candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly wide spectrum of colors in fact the light they put out tends to be more in the warmish yellowishorange range of the spectrum so wheres all the bluesteelgrey light coming frombr br this movie has fancy sets and glitzy cgi fx but its still dreck its pathetic junk put out for todays moviegoers who are easily placated by pathetic junkbr br i very much enjoy vampires and werewolves as movie plot devices but this was a total hack jobbr br universal studios 1941 the wolfman is infinitely superior to this even though its fx is pretty primitive compared to what could be done nowadaysbr br im done with this franchise the first movie was reasonably decent the second still somewhat entertaining but this one i couldnt even finish all the way to the end because it was so boring
