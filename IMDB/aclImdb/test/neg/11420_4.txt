there are rumours that a fourth underworld is going to happen if so than the third part which is also a prequel would be in the middle of the franchise with prequels that succeed the original movies you always ask yourself in what order should you watch the movies so that it makes sense br br in this case i guess it doesnt matter that much the third underworld movie isnt up to par with the other two they had their obvious flaws too but this one lacks a few things and it feels like a cash in it seems like its not going full throttle which is a shame because the actors sure couldve used better material to work withbr br the story is ok but its nothing special a nice movie but rhona mitra couldnt fill the shoes of beckinsale yes she plays another character i mean the void that kate b left
