there wasnt much thought put into the story line on many fronts this is a good action movie but thats about itbr br  the movie states that the lycans were kept to protect the vampires during the day yet they are kept in cages and have collars on their necks so they cant turn into their wolf form or do anything any other slave cant do how does this protect the vampires during the day who are they protecting the vampires from the uncontrollable lycans the slaves in human form are nothing more than peasantsbr br  my understanding is that vampires are immortals and dont age yet sonya ages from child to adult do they just stop aging at a certain age i understand that viktor is old because he was turned as explained in the second movie but vampire babies age strangebr br  i didnt realize that vampires needed torches to see at night yet we see them carrying torches throughout the moviebr br  silver was the only thing that was supposedly able to harm lycan yet wooden steaks fired from the huge crossbows kill the lycan toobr br these are just some of the things that show just a lack of thought put into the story telling
