i cant believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on imdb of course ive come to conclude that imdb is somewhat worthless for actually finding out if a movie is good or not as 99 of films are rated from 6 to 7 its the conclusion and failure of crowdsourcing on the internet for this purpose an average is taken of most people and unfortunately most people are simple minded easily entertained fast food lifestyle morons but i digress the movie i really dont want to waste my time writing about it lets just say i found it to be tailor made for seemingly two groups of people young teens at the age where violent action movies of any sort just hit the spot and goth types that just love to choke down whatever gothic vampire fantasy they can get their hands on if you arent in one of those categories you will find this movie absurd i did enjoy the first underworld it was fresh at the time and held a sort of edgy quality the second was a bit trying in plot but i did enjoy the direction and cinematography at times but this whole movie felt like a scifi channel production or even a tv series i found the actors to be overdirected their body language stiffened into unnatural idealistic poses that seemed contrived lines were spit out like young actors would spit out lines of shakespeare reveling in their own egoistic glory at being in such a role but in doing so crudely bludgeoning the role the plot was dry and predictable right from the start i found myself wishing things to just move along as it was so easy to tell what was going to happen i tried to care at first but my brain was forced to shut off by the end climax i actually caught myself falling asleep there were so many parts that were inconsistent and didnt make sense that its not even worth listing them all if youre a pimple faced teen or a chronic goth sure have at it for the rest of us forget it like im about to do right now
