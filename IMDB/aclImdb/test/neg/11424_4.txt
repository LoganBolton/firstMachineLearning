i like many this evening braved the frigid winter and long lines to see what i had anticipated to be one of the best movies of this year however i was left sadly wanting in many ways after the credits rolled but to be fair there were redeemable qualities although very few lets start with what worked first the lycans on point in every way  from their terrifying physicality to their sheer ferocity the action sublimely visceral  when it did occur nighyvictor and sheenlucian perfect now what did not and there is plenty this was less a movie and more a collage of sequences and do not expect to see any supporting characters from the other movies except raze and tannis profoundly missing was a well written storyline and anything of real substance to bring these pieces of film together the story seemed to start right in the middle  at the cusp where lucian had made up his mind to rebel therefore there was no context no tension no sense of betrayal  the devices needed to make everything else work moreover it ended at where the climax should have begun which needed to be after the feud had simmered for a bit oh and it was way too short purist will also find offense in some liberties taken to certain facts previously revealed in the first two moviesbut judge that for yourself in the end this movie lingered to long on what should have been brief background scenes eg various council scenes and as a consequence we never really got to know or care about the principal playersor the movie ouch d
