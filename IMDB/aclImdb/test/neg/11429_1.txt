ah here it is a movie which is said by people to remind me of the epic trainspotting ouch was i a fool to believe that and ouch how my buttocks hurt after having forced myself to watch this cp from beginning to end after the first 1015 minutes i just wanted it all to end or at least they couldve put some nudity or action or cool acid house music into it to make it worth the time but no when i was through with it i put it into my cd shelf and i hope i will never have to pick it out again just to show it to some friend who is so anxious to see it that heshe dont want to listen to my warnings
