the filmmakers went well out of their way to find only the following demographics palestinians that have the appearance of peaceloving solutionseeking good will palestinians particularly older women and families with children who are especially inconvenienced by the security fence and israelis that dont believe in the security fence sympathize heavily with its alleged effect on palestinians and consider it unnecessarily divisive andor a waste of money oh yes they do put in one member of the israeli government that does support the fence but they do what they can to portray him as inhumane and uncaring and ask him very leading questions that are really statements eg the wall is bad for the environmentit is destroying everythingbr br i have no problem with any well most of this being presented in the movie however much i may disagree with the people they interview their opinions are valid enough for a documentary however there are at least two sides to the issue of israels security fence and despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of israelis and many others support the construction of the fence and believe it is having an overall positive influence this documentary does not present the opinion of even one such person they even go so far as to interview an israeli jew who claims that all israelis support the fence and are thus insane and then stubbornly refuse to interview even one such crazy israeli oh and to top all this off they set the tone for the film by interviewing a couple of young israeli children truly exceptions to the rule  ive been there that are laughing atabout their arab neighbors from across the fencebr br a documentary is a film that explores an issue and presents a full array of facts opinions and perspectives unfortunately this is not a documentary this is an unabashed propaganda film that very clearly very pointedly offers a battery of support for only one side of a heavily disputed emotionally and politically charged issue it is no more of a documentary than say fahrenheit 911
