i was told jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences i guessed the film will be interestingin fact isnt at all not so much profound for a such subject eternity neverending life experiences after death and dejavu the film is not as a comedy but isnt funny at all at least not express yet its so naive charming film but naive film a must to avoid the middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and its not the matter at all eileen davidson is so charming and voight is doing his best normal is a co producer and screenwriter of this movie the film was launched straight on video so i discovered it on a video store its a pity cause i well know voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the film isnt so much profound about it
