i cant figure out what jon voight could possibly have been thinking when he got involved in this tenthrate incoherent pretentious mindnumbing slop he helped to write the alleged script himself and he should be damn well ashamed of it the film i cant call it a movie because it barely moves at all is rambling embarrassingly pretentious drivelsort of like a really bad oprah winfrey show but worse it meanders senselessly back and forth from medieval times to modernday los angeles with voight as a television producer who thinks he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the machinations of his evil brother and somehow this gets transferred to modern times where voight has to save the country from the evil machinations of an oil company executive if the bizarre casting wilfrid brimley frankie valli  kaye ballard and armand assante among others isnt enough to kill it the stupefyingly inept direction the washedout photography it looks like it was shot with a really cheap 16mm camera the almost complete lack of editing scenes either go on and on endlessly or are chopped off in the middle of a sentence and voights embarrassing apparently streamofconsciousness acting are enough to bury it which is exactly what should have been done with it a jawdropping experience avoid this dog at all costs
