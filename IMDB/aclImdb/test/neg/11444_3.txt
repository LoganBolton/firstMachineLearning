this movie has it all it is a thriller a chase movie a romance story a mob tale a comedy a road movie well in fact its none of this at all br br all the time you are waiting for something interesting to happen but no you are still watching the same dull uninspiring and superficial clich√© of a movie with a very bad soundtrack even the star cast acting is lacking in credibility a hit man with his quirks a girl whos playing hard to get mob guys acting tough and incapable cops yawnbr br id recommend not to watch backtrack if you want to see a good movie directed by a famous actor go and see the three burials of melquiades estrada by tommy lee jones now thats what i call worth watching
