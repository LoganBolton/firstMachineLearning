this movie really left me thinking  but not about the plot the direction the characters an underlying message or a clever script far from it i was left wondering what in sam hill went wrong behind the scenes clearly something was badly amiss from the beginningbr br im amazed at the positive comments for the movie and for jodie fosters performance from the getgo it was clear that foster had phoned this one in one earlier comment even made a favorable mention of her facial expressions i must have been watching a different movie since ms foster usually a personal favorite seemed to be totally disinterestedbr br in one of his first scenes with foster fred ward looks as though he also is distracted by her lack of energy and he struggles to deliver his own lines with any enthusiasm by the time hes called upon to take part in a supposedly desperate search for runaway foster ward also seems to have become embarrassingly halfhearted about the projectbr br in my opinion dennis hopper has always been a unidimensional performer so i wasnt expecting much from him  and he deliveredbr br yes this one left me thinking long after it ended the fact that joe pesci and charlie sheen refused to have their names attached to the project suggests that this was a real stinker for everyone involved but to then learn that the director preferred to hide behind a pseudonym speaks volumesbr br but why listen to me i always think foster looks ridiculous in a dress yet shes sensational in lacy underwear
