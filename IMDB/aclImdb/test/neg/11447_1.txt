aaran is one of the movies where you find the loop holes in indian cinema here is one good example to show how excellent writers directors and actors succumb to the producers here is one of the most wonderful actors mohanlal acting in a movie about a real story in kashmir the seriousness of the film is slaughtered with sub standard comic scenes and songs there is this character havaldar jaykumar who in reality is the son of the producer of the film hence he doesnt have a hair cut despite his officer asking him to do so this kid doesnt know what is acting and he is the hero of the movie god help indian cinema with such producersbr br this movie is a pathetic display of what happens in kashmir a sensible viewer can intuitively understand the constraints of such wonderful writers actors and directors who want to share their real life experiences but the unfortunate part is that a movie about the highest ranks in indian militia turns out to be a pathetic display that only makes one think that the movie was stupidbr br we should oust such producers in the film industry and pave way for good cinema
