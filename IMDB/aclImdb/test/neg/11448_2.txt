ive seen this movie n i can say that this is really a bad movie the directors gone nuts of course he does know a lot about the army but then he certainly is a cheap guy there are a lotta technical flaws in the movies as wellbr br okay heres my doubt in the end when they rescue the family including a girl who was just raped why do they leave them there outside their place i didnt see any ambulance around there are a lot of aspects in the movie that are real but then i just wish the major had narratedhelpedassisted some other good director n made the moviebr br mohanlal surely does deserve a better director
