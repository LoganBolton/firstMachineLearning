this movie is dated in so many ways its sensational you can either laugh at it or shake your fists in ragebr br this movie deals with many problems of american history but with the typical whitemalechristianamerican paternalism the main character is one of those icandoitallandyouvegottolovemeforitkindofguy he is so pompous and not to be taken serious at any time what a horrid creature his wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the movie and a still very weepy but stronger character in the end too bad she still forgives his cocky ways after hes left her for the second time its just sad that the character didnt really change at all even though she is supposed to portray a strong and independent woman in the end she is consumed by worry about her adventureseeking husband so 2 out of 10 points from the feminists among us and those are only for the good intentions the problem of indian suppression is dealt with quite nicely but there is that patronizing storytelling again and the fact that all africanamerican characters are the typical stereotypes makes the movie even more hypocritical i was so enraged most of the time so one point for trying from the civil rights movementbr br i know that the movie was done at a different time i love old movies and i have a lot of patience with some of those dated point of views but this was just disgustingbr br what saves this movie are the parts without the main character mr dixs acting is way over the top and smug maybe thats why his character is so disagreeable i liked mrs dunnes performance even though her character enraged me at times br br but i must say the famous land rush scene was incredibly done and the way that the oklahoma settlement was portrayed made the movie worthwhile its just amazing how civilization rose out of the dirt and dust of the 19th century and i dont understand the problem some have with that church scene i thought it was quite funny and amusing maybe it wasnt supposed to be but i liked it so 9 points for those scenes and the impressive storytelling of the development of the oklahoma state that makes about 4 points altogether
