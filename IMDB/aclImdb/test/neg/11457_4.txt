not all films made in 1931 are this creaky and the fact that this was best picture must have given even greater impetus to the development of televisionbr br typical of all ferber novels it isnt possible to bring the entire story to the screen to say nothing of developing character dix  so stolid in the first third of the movie  does an about face but no one knows why and it makes no sense and what is there about dunne that makes makes her so stoical edna may olivers scenes are priceless as usualbr br this film has a role to play in the history of cinema but it is long and boring
