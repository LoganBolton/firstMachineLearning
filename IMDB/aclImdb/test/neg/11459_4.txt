the mummys curse is the last in the series of the kharis mummy films and it seems that creativity had run somewhat dry by the time they made this one kharis and his mate ananka both end up in the bayous of louisiana and on his resurrection he searches out his beloved princess how they end up in louisiana isnt made entirely clear but with various people trying to find them the viewer can be assured of some mummy murdersbr br the mummys curse was watchable but it really wasnt anything special i had the feeling throughout the movie that id seen this before quite frankly apart from the original the mummy with boris karloff the mummy movies are not my favorites among the old universal horrors theyre not bad but they do get a bit repetitivebr br there are some great scenes in the movie the scene with ananka coming to life in the swamp for instance but overall this didnt do much for mebr br its worth seeing if you want to be completest and see all of the mummy movies but otherwise you might want to pass on this one
