i realize most people dont know who solomon kane is and that the film is pitched at that much larger audience but then why bother to call it solomon kane in the first place when the name has no marketable value the characters certainly has nothing whatsoever to do with the re howard character except he has a big hat thats where the resemblance endsbr br its always a bad sign when any superherofantasyscifi movie lingers over an origin story but when you invent one whole cloth like this for a character who didnt have one at all youve already missed the point completely kane is no longer even the fanatical christian warrior of the stories but rather a formerly bad guy who is trying to save his soul this part is in the opening scenebr br with the most basic character elements changed or simply ignored the use of the name solomon kane is simply perplexing is it just so they can say from the creator of conan and hope to plug into a budding franchise if the new conan movie gets off the ground ignoring the complete departure from the stories the movie is competent if utterly generic for the first half but then devolves into sheer stupidity in the climactic scene which involves multiple super baddies think three boss levels at the same time none of whom is the least bit interesting or menacingbr br if i wasnt a kane fan who was disappointed that they completely ignored the source material id probably give the film a 3 or 4 instead of a 1 even for the majority of viewers who will come into this knowing nothing about kane its pretty thin gruel
