this movie is called solomon kane which it isnt the main character wears a hat but thats all he has in common with robert howards character solomon kane as known from early pulp magazines and lots of publications ever since these days it is a fantasy movie not really that bad and it might easily have passed with a rather good review  if it hadnt been called solomon kane the hero is a newly invented character who definitely is not sk the story is not robert howard neitherbr br as a fantasy movie it is one more movie following the traditions of the genre simple story poor cgi poor actors poor directing yet it can be fun you know the cheaper they are the better they are but since it is called solomon kane i cannot accept it imagine a lordoftherings movie with a hero bilbo who fights the black sorcerer saugalf with the help of his dwarf friend aragorn and the beautiful heroine shadowfax and with a final fight where the three use a magical ring to kill the evil sorcerer who has transformed into the dragon gondorian imagine that this is exactly what this movie has done with robert howards character solomon kanebr br id give it a 4 stars review if it was just another horror movie but since it is called solomon kane i can only rate it 3 stars
