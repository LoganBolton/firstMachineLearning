michael bassetts film solomon kane based on the character of the same name created by robert e howard is a disappointing fantasy actionadventure film that despite having a few scenes of genius falls flat with its awkward pacing poor characterisation and general dullness solomon kane james purefoy is a mercenary of queen elizabeths army fighting in africa where he comes facetoface with the devils reaper  a demon who collects the devils debts ie souls  refusing to go to hell just yet he evades the reaper and starts a new life in an english monastery with this new life solomon has leftbehind his culture of violence and bloodshed and instead now embraces the values of peace and nonvalues but once he is expelled from the monastery due to the fear of the devils reaper returning he must travel back to his home in devon and along the way he befriends a travelling family of puritans heading to the new world on their journey through the british counties the family is attacked and their daughter meredith rachel hurdwood is abducted by the evil sorcerer malachis army which is lead on the front lines by the mysterious masked rider now a man of peace solomon must go back to his former life as a man of unrepentant violence and destruction to save meredithbr br despite having great source material to work from and build upon to create potentially an exciting and enduring medieval actionadventure film the film fails in three key areas the pacing of this film is terrible which may have a lot to do with its incredibly short run time of only one hour and forty minutes and this is most likely a consequence of the fact that they wish to turn this film into a trilogy constantly jumping between of drama and selfcharacterisation to that of action and muddy bloodshed somewhat kills the excitement of the action sequences instead of keeping the audience on the edge of their seats frothing with the eagleeyed anticipation the film instead feels incredibly subdued and this follows on the next piece of criticism dull despite being touted as an actionadventure film or in some circles an actionepic solomon kane is almost most certainly not the action is mundane and dull and is generally finished before you have the chance to admire the beauty of a decapitation finally aside from solomon himself there is very little characterisation within this film for example we know little and because of this care little about the young woman that soloman sets out on his journey to save and i imagine again the filmmaker would refer this criticism to the fact that there is most likely going to be a second film which will hopefully touch upon these aspects that this film surely missedbr br it isnt an entirely terrible film however james purefoy is gives a fantastic performance as solomon the mercenary who must decide whether or not to fall back on his conscience or his blade and how his decisions will impact not just upon himself but those around him as well while respect admiration and acknowledgement must also go to bassett and his crew as well for creating vivid locations that beautifully reflects the period in which they are filming at times it is hard not to get carried away with admiring the beauty of the locations shot composition and miseenscene at show here which certainly shows that a lot of time and effort has been placed into this film unfortunately however that is not to say the same for the story and characters at hand solomon kane certainly had the potential to be something more than simply an actionepic however it seems that once again the lack of any real depth in the story and characters has resulted in michael bassett creating nothing more than a onedimensional look at swordplay during the medieval period
