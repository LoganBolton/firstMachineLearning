i was looking forward to this flick being an old robert e howard fan mainly from a conan standpoint br br i was not expecting a great deal and thought they could not mess it up too much oh dear  how wrong was ibr br the main flaw was it was fairly dull it needed to zip along with a nice helping of supernatural goingson swordfights and the likebr br you got some gore but everything else was just pretty lifeless the middle section just seemed to involve 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slow plodding horsedrawn carts and even slower dialogue and character developmentbr br on the plus side  costumes and effects were fine but not enough to keep your interestbr br i think it would have been better to tone down the gore up the tempo and go for a 12a rating as a ten year old boy i may have liked this movie probably about the age i was first reading the conan stories funny enough perhaps that says a lot about my anticipation of the filmbr br or go really arthouse with tone direction etc but thats fairly highrisk as far as box office is concernedbr br oh well perhaps the next conan movie will make up for it
