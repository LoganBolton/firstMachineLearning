watched the directors cut last nightglad it was free rental even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to watch this attempt at film noir the anachronisms modern telephones were annoying to me not clever seeming more like budget constraints than anything else the nontraditional casting i also found distracting if i have to stop following the story to wonder what the heck is the black chickdrag queen doing there then the storyteller has failed me again not clever in my opinion but annoying and irritating and very film school final projectish and for petes sake if you are going to shoot in black and white at least use some of the techniques used in old films that take full advantage of not having color there was no use of nuance in the lighting no shades of gray no depth no texturejust black and just whiteboring
