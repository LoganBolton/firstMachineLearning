i had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing but i just found it annoying its been a while since ive seen it and hopefully i wont find out all my memories are wrong and im unjustly condemning this movie but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray leopold and loeb as victimized by an antigay society and that this somehow caused their horrible crime i totally disagree with this point of view and think its unfair both to homosexuals and to bobby franks the real victim of the story i cant imagine why anyone would want to claim those two as martyrs i also thought ll were portrayed as a bit more sophisticated than they actually wereafter all they were teenagers who lived at home the film places them in a kind of fantasy world that seems like it should be scored by morrisseybr br i just read an interview with one of the filmmakers that implied the films anachronisms such as the pushbutton phones that characters used were meant to add brechtian distance they certainly do that but i happened to find it highly irksomebr br apparently a number of people found this movie interesting but i would have preferred a less stylish and more realistic examination of the part homosexuality may have played in the leopold  loeb case
