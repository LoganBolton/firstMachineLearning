the adventures of sebastian cole is about a boy named sebastian adrian grenier who fancies himself becoming a writer at some point given he actually puts effort into it this movie is presumably the years where he gets his material for writing the adventure years hence the title and the previous quote in it we experience the very typical coming of age stories and warnings of loves drugs and sexchanges yeah theres a slight twist here that is very interesting and that is that sebastians step dad clark gregg very early on makes a rough decision to get a sexchange that has a huge impact on sebastians family and his relationship with his stepdadbr br clark gregg plays hankhenrietta sebastians stepfather and is very good in the part very believable without being over the top which is a route this film couldve taken rather easily thankfully they didnt adrien grenier who im only familiar with from entourage is also very good in his part as sebastian and together he and gregg have a great relationship on screen its always quite engaging to watch these guys  relationship as it develops and is genuinely heartbreaking at timesbr br and thats the best of what this film has to offer unfortunately it brings with it some mediocre camera work direction and cinematography its not bad but its a far cry from being good or memorable in the slightest the characters are also thinly written and its clear from the get go how most of the arcs will pan out the only truly fascinating character through and through is clark greggs hankhenrietta ive already said grenier did well actingwise but the character of sebastian is not only not engaging but is completely unlikeable i dont honestly see why anyone in the audience would route for his character in anything he does he mopes whines cheats lies and lacks any aspirations other than to be a complete slacker itd be different if he was maybe a sidecharacter or comic relief but to have him as the main focus and to be asked to take the character seriously come onbr br and i dont really hold it against this film but i just want to saypick a different song in all these films hollywood no more where is my mind by the pixies we all know its a good song stop using it in every other filmbr br i feel like i could just keep tearing more and more of this film apart but in all honesty i didnt hate it i just didnt really care for it and i wouldnt recommend it to anyone the adventures of sebastian cole isnt a bad or boring film its just not a very good or engaging one either its very uneven and the script couldve used quite a bit of work i guess the point of the film is to be a loose sort of look at the life of a writer before he made it and it workedif that writer put out pieces of fiction that i wouldnt want to read
