i would like to say something different about this movie i saw comments how beautiful is russia and the views from russia have been great hey guys this is not russia its bulgaria more specific the capital sofia so this is not russia its my country about the movie  well in bulgaria maybe except the grey zone  all movies from american directors are in one word awful like this one of course its a shame that patrick swayze has to play in such a low budget movies most of the actors are bulgarians but really this movie has no plot twist has no energy what can i sayweak and boring movie a clich√© not more hey people remember its not russia in reality its bulgaria
