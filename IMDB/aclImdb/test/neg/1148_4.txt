arthur miller has always been known as one of americas great playwrights for works such as death of a salesman and the crucible focus is one of his lesser known plays brought to the silver screen however knowing what a great playwright arthur miller is i doubt that his original play was very much like the movie the movie comes across as empty and formulaic with william h macy as a nonjew mistaken for a jew by antisemitic neighbors in wwii brooklyn dont get me wrong the acting is ok and i presume that the people behind this movie were probably trying to make a point about racism but the movie just doesnt work macy laura dern and david paymer just cant create an effective story with the material here
