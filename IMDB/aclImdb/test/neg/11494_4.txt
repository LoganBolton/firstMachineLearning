i just finished reading forsyths novel icon i thought it was one of the most in depth detailed and pageturning books i ever read definitely in my top 10 i acquired a dvd version of the book starring mr swayze ok let me first point out that to fit a decent adaptation of the novel into 25 hours film time would of been impossible so i understand the teams reason to sway from the book version and differ however when i say differ what i really should say is take the characters from the book add a few leave a few out take away the books plot add a modern new plot add frederick forsyths name in there somewhere im not saying this was a bad picture far from it some of the effects were top notch and the acting wasnt half bad the story sucked and didnt rely on logic or reality forsyths novel was so good and real and altered the facts of reality instead of exaggerating them this could of been so much more if it had taken its time and been made into say a 10 part series if you havent read the book then expect a decent tv movie with a good acting cast if you have read the book then try and forget it when watching this
