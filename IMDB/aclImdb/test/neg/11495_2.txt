i just have watched icon on dvd and despite being a great book the movie is a weak substrate from it those responsible for the writing should be banished to siberia why they maul the great story with all kind of cfilm subploys which are totally irrelevant to the story is totally beyond mebr br yet the filmmakers and cast do there best to make something out of it but at the end the film was not satisfying at allbr br can someone please make a decent movie out of this to show how it is done im sure that the crowds will rally for such a masterpiece novel turned into a book not into a cheap cmovie
