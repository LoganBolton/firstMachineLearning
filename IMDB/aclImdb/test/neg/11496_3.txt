i recently rented this promising mini series i didnt even know they had adapted it for television i was really looking forward to it since the book icon is one of the best spy thrillers i have ever read what a disappointment it was the plot only loosely resembles the one in the book the characters are completely miscast and theres some appalling acting a shame really the story behind icon is perfect for the silver screen but i think television budgets just arent big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular bookbr br forsyth deserves much much better than this avoid and stick to the book which is a mustread
