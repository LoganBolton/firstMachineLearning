frederick forsyths books are always so intricately plotted with twists and turns and usually a great surprise ending this adaptation had none of thatbr br so much of what was great in the book the history of monk and the betrayed agents the plot to influence the outcome of the russian election were completely missing in this adaptation instead theres this completely new plot about bioweapons that was a yawnerbr br forsyths protagonists always operated in the shadows forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists the joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission this film resigned itself to gunfights and car chases early onbr br swayzes monk might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying i am a secret agent for all the attention that he called to himself during the film and with all of that attention the amount of time that it took the bad guys to catch up to him was surprisingbr br granted there was some energy to this film which is why im giving it a 3 instead of a 1 it was also great to see some underutilized pros like patrick bergin ben cross michael york and barry morsebr br i hope that someday someone will once again do justice to a forsyth film adaptation like day of the jackal did
