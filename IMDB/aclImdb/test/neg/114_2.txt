i saw the mogul video vhs of this thats another one of those old 1980s distributors whose catalog i wish i hadbr br this movie was pretty poor though retitled dont look in the attic the main admonition that is repeated in this is dont go to the villa just getting on the grounds of the villa is a bad idea a character doesnt go into the attic until an hour into the movie and actually should have done it earlier because of what is learned therebr br the movie starts in turin italy in the 1950s two men are fighting and a woman is telling them the villa is making them do it one man kills the other then regrets it and the woman pulls out the knife and stabs him with it she flees the villa and after shes left a chair moves by itself whats the point of that but when in the garden a hand comes up through the ground and drags he into the earthbr br from there its the present day thirty years later theres a s√©ance that appears suddenly and doesnt appear to have anything to do with the movie the children of the woman from the prologue are inheriting the house the main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother at least one of the two men from the prologue seems to reoccur as another character too shes haunted by some warnings not to go to the villa but they all do since if they do not use it they forfeit it people die a lawyer who has won all his cases tries to investigate a little the ending is pretty poor why was the family cursed an unfortunately boring moviebr br theres an amusing smallprint disclaimer on the back of the video box that reads the scenes depicted on this packaging may be an artists impression and may not necessarily represent actual scenes from the film in this case the cover of the box is an illustration that does more or less accurately depict the aforementioned woman dragged underground scene although there are two hands and the woman is different its true sometimes the cover art has nothing to do with the movie i also recall seeing a reviewer who had a bad movie predictor scale in which movies with illustrations on the cover instead of photos got at least one point for that
