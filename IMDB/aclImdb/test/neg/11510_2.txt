the first time i saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the kim possible movie the commercial showed sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothingit is one of the stupidest commercials ive ever seen basically they go back and forth with lines like nothing is a thing so technically nothing is something when i saw that i figured it would be yet another lame lizzie maguire knockoff by disney but i had no idea how badbr br fast forward about 3 weeks when my sister turns on the tv naturally sadie happened to be on what i saw had to be one of the most unintentionally funny shows ive ever seen howd it go something like thisbr br sadie a vegetarian tree hugger has an incredibly unhealthyobsessive crush on the very monotone and poorly acted acted out owen for some reason her friend margret decides that owen needs to be tested to see if he is as good as he seems what exactly do these tests involve well one thing they do is put a cockroach on her notebook why so that she can be squeamish and ask her monotone knight in shining armor to get it offhow is this a test because if he squishes it hes mean and uncaring and doesnt believe that bugs as sadie puts it are innocent animals too they spread disease and pestilance they deserve to be squished but of course owen just brushes it out the window and sadie is still in love but thats not all margret says he needs to be challenged one more time on something that no guy can pass this one involves shoving scarves down their pants yes you read that rightand walking buy him to see if he notices their large butts predictably he doesnt notice and we see sadie in her bizarre and strange notebook world sadie decides that she wants to be with owen foreverraise a family with him and as she puts it live like wood ducks with their brood thats just plain wrongbr br bottom line this is the strangest most insane show ive watched for those who like to make fun of dumb stuff youll love it for anyone else skip this show
