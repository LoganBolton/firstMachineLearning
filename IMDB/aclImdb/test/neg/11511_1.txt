i do not find this show at all funny i actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible disney channel sitcoms right now charlotte arnold is an interesting choice to play sadie because she cant act the jokes on this show are terribly unfunny and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit and i mean little bit of acting talent is justin bradley as sadies brother hal jasmine richards and michael dascenzo portray sadies friends there both really stupid and just terrible actors two words that can really describe this show is terribly corny its corny humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not developed yet now ive explained my hatred for the acting and the horrible humor whats next the whole premise of the show is a stupid idea she changed again not so sciencey an benloving and suddenly nobody recognizes her its moronic in summation i hate this show however little girls who do not have a concept of funny will enjoy it so i guess thats what theyre going for over quality although i can say as much as the first season is clearly better than the secondbr br bottom line just dont watch any of itbr br my rating awful show tv g 30 mins
