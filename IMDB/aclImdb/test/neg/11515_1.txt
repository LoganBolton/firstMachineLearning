i literally ran to watch it expecting a film that will make me cry or touch my heartbr br what i found was not heartrending but a lame exploitation of 1 strong human characterbr br interwined between a pair of young lesbians and an obese manbr br in a setting that is substantially devoid of sound not to mention acting of the most commonbr br it was not entirely bad as i have seen worst  and i left the cinema 10 poorer but wiser  that a film well advertised is not the same as a film wellmade
