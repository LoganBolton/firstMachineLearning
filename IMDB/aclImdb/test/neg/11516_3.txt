be with me is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie just leave it running in the background chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point itll end br br alas as i watched it alone and so i felt like i almost watched the worlds worst longest and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time i just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled and i then managed just a a few more moments of wakefulness to witness a thank you to the movies sponsors  which included asia pacific breweries aha methought how surprising is that  given all the shots of tiger beer interspersed throughout this most forgettable washout of a movie br br meanwhile dialogue spurts between individuals with occasional stabs at depth but all too usually nothing of any particular advancement to the movies overall story is said or witnessed its as if one could switch off at any moment and return at any later point and youd really have missed nothing which would have been an unmissable contingency or part of its plot as far as the movies overall progression was concerned thus the ultimate wallpaper moviebr br well i wonder what movie were those who positively reviewed this one watching i wonder and continue to wonder it certainly couldnt have been this arty to the point of artless singaporean excuse for a cameras rolling allegedly be with me is supposed to be woven around the themes of love tragedy and redemption but all i witnessed was boredom a half baked screenplay with a smattering of gormless text messages and the only redemption was that which occurred when this utterly useless movie ended what a wistful waste of time it ended up being it was also said that the characters in this movie were fictitious except for theresa chan who is a remarkable woman who has triumphed over adversities well no disrespect to ms chan but given that she was such a marvellous  amazing character why at all did the screenplay have to involve the stories of other characters without the most tenuous attempt to connect their lives together yet it still proved to be an almost insufferably boring movie whose highlights included the credits rolling rather than tying in the fates of all characters i really felt that the movie ended up attempting the near impossible and evidently fell between stools as far as any viewer engagement could be concernedbr br i am generally an arthouse movie fan and dont usually object to slow pacing of which here there is no shortage believe you me i hate such movies as 300 transformers fight club but consider eg eric rohmer as a great film maker so i hope that puts my criticism into some perspective nonetheless there was no redeemable feature whatsoever in the entire movies conception and delivery which could prevent ones eyelids slowly drooping downwards as each minute of be with me dripped by watch this movie if you need to feel like wasting time otherwise your life would be none the richer for having missed it 310
