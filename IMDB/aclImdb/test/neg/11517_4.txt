when i saw this movie three years ago i thought it exemplified a lot of the traits found in singapore arthouse movies slowmoving with a minimal of plot and dialogue depending on film composition to make it workbr br during then amongst local cineastes the inability to appreciate be with me is tantamount to panning citizen kane or any of ozus late films ive no idea how be with me reached such hallowed heights in singapores cinematic consciousness but i always felt that khoos 12 storeys is a better film even though the latter film does not boast as good a cinematographer as adrian tan khoos dp for be with me 12 storeys has a story that better relates to most singaporeans and has bite too something that be with mes threadbare wistfulness doesnt havebr br be with me is basically a barely interlinked trio of narratives strung together into a film by khoo and his screenwriter wong kim hoh it deals with a security guard who falls in love with a girl whom he only sees in the distance two girls in a horoerotic relationship and the story of deafandblind teresa chanbr br be with me is very well filmed by tan using a varicam camera the film compositions are masterful the film almost entirely silent has next to no dialogue characters move around not in a realistic manner but almost as if they are models under the instruction of a director almost always looking into the screen and emoting either loneliness or sadness unfortunately the characters dont act against each other this kind of film has been seen before many times in tsai mingliangs films in khoos protégé royston tans 430 and elsewhere sadly its ultraslowness essentially plot less and use of a lento piano soundtrack simply doesnt appeal to mebr br to criticize be with me seems almost to negate the inspirational story behind it that of teresa chan who is blind and deaf and yet lives a fulfilling life despite all this yet im afraid this film doesnt do anything much to me im willing to applaud chans steadfast and courageous march in life and tans striking cinematography but for a better take on the same subjectmatter with more meat without the two other tedious and distracting subplots try werner herzogs land of silence and darkness 1971
