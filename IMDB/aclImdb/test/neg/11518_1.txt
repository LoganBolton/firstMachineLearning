i am in a movie club at my school and i was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal film the films story is not dismal but the entire movie itself is exceedingly dismal the acting was absolutely dreadful the children were overly whiny a metal pole could have done a better job i wanted desperately to fall asleep but because the television was so loud i was kept from peace the monkeys are neither cute nor are they funny the drama is laughworthy i cannot remember when i saw a more dreadful film the story is weak thin predictable and completely fake the adults try to be good actors but they just cant seem to break through stereotypes the girl even appears to want to leave the film via falling off a hill during the movie in order to leave it i dont blame her micheal anderson should publicly apologize for this film not just to me but to everyone else who was forced to sit through this awful film in fact i apologize to you even if i had nothing to do with this project i apologize for this film because this means at least someone will this film even surpasses the dismalness of films that of rob schneider and the cheetah girls i would even go as far to say that it is even worse that hilary duffs collection of films but thats pushing it just please dont see this film or else youll be pushed to write a review similar to this one on how awful this film is im very sorry
