poorly acted poorly written and poorly directed special effects are cheap best performance is by yvette napir but thats not saying much story is a confusing mess about corporate greed leading to sabotage of a space station and an attempt to rescue those stranded aboardbr br  there is little suspense and even less action theres one car chase thats not bad but the rest of the movie is simply a waste of everyones time
