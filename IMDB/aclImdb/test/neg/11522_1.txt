rented this tonite from my local video store it was titled black horizon i guess someone felt this was good enough for a 2004 rereleasebr br micheal dudikoff is unfortunetly not a ninja in this movie one of the major flaws of this film right off the bat another major flaw would be that icets action scenes are stolen from other movies particularly the first scene of his rescue which is directly from the wesley snipes movie the art of war with icet edited in i hope they paid for that footagebr br the plot is awful the special effects had little effort put into them love those wires holding them in space the acting is wooden also love those new yorkrussian accents icet being in the movie is pointless these guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in space but i guess they werent worried about itbr br micheal dudikoff should go back to doing what hes good at and make american ninja 6
