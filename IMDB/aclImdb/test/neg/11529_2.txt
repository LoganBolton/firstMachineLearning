well i set out with a few friends to see this movie we went an hour before the show started to get good seats so as you can probably imagine we where exited to see this movie  but that excitement soon turned to horror this movie is a complete failure it just trys to hard to be funny that its sad the script is poorly written and relies to heavy on the actors to make up for itbr br the only good acting in the whole movie was from stefan c schaefer who was great the plot was weak and even the funny scenes felt forced and unnatural considering that the main actors are some of icelands best comedians its well specialbr br i would not recommend this movie to any one because it trys to hard and never really delivers
