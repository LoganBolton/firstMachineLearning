badly shot badly edited clumsy dialogue flat characters unsuccessful adaption of a novel it doesnt really get much worse decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half  felt more like three hours  of boredom occasional good onelinersbr br david is a dimwitted young man who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age he puts his faith in a chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video although that doesnt seem to help him much in real life david is a member of a debtcollectors gang where every member has an iq below sea level a lacking script along with uncreative shooting and even worse editing make what could have been quite funny incidents of failed debtcollecting look like a amateurish homemade reality showbr br david rents an apartment from an elementary school teacher haraldur who by dropping a couple of sentences about his own importance convinces david he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in iceland a severely lacking script doesnt offer david anything to base his opinion on a couple of scenes showing haraldur doing something that david could have misinterpreted would have done the work the potentials of film as media as opposed to the text of the book this film is based on are not exploitedbr br at first davids connection with haraldur raises his status within the debtcollectors gang but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces david to show where his loyalty liesbr br the plot of the film is fine but then it is based on the book this could have been a much better film a good screenwriter could have made something of this material sadly that is not the casebr br the acting is generally good pétur jóhann is excellent and credible as david eggert þorleifsson doesnt get much to work with but does his best with what little material he has ingvar sigurðsson and michael imperioli in a tiny role manage alrightbr br overall opinion what could have been quite a funny and entertaining film about a dimwitted antihero in a debtcollectors gang becomes a boring badlycrafted film made after a poor manuscript staring at your toes for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable
