as a fan of henriksen i liked him in the millennium series and of course lorenzo renegade lamas i had expected at least something from this film sadly the plot is predictable the acting is bad and the computergraphics used for most stunts dont work out sometimes it even looks like theyve captured some shots from microsoft flight simulatorbr br the cinematography sucks as well unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts from the cheesy dialogue and gives the film a cheap madeforvideolook it works in hiphopmovies and jet li movies but seems out of place in this flickbr br i would have liked this film 10 years ago i was 11 then
