i absolutely hated this movie even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message it was done in such a clich√© ridden and melodramatic way like a mexican soap operabr br also the acting was terrible especially charityn and her son thats one of the problems with dominican movies they use celebrities that cant even act just to attract the masses br br im even more ashamed about the positive reviews here which sadly means dominicans are just being condescending to whats done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself on quality
