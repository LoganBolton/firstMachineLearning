princess warrior is a science fiction action movie with a pretty thin plotessentially on the death of their queen mother two sisters one evil and one good fight for control of the throne the good sister is being beaten so she escapes to earth where she appears buck naked in a strip club in the middle of a wet tshirt contest the rest of the movie is basically one long chase scene as the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger good sister but the younger sister is helped by bob a goodhearted dj and everything is complicated by police involvement and the good sisters ignorance of earth customs and culture the older sister catches up to her younger sibling several times but the latter manages to escape and go on the run again throughout all of this action there is a cult of women on the home planet having some kind of a space age s√©ance to bring the good sister back sadly a good portion of this film seems to be rather boring car chase scenes as they drive around los angeles and what was that sound effect when the police car crashed the film culminates in another physical fight between the sisters with a predictable endingbr br it seems to borrow elements from star wars the light sabers and the look of the girls home planet in the opening and subsequent scenes dr who the phone booth like means of transportation and some of the costumes from the cult on the home planet could have been taken from star trek episodesbr br ms dana fredsti the evil sister in the movie in another user comment mentioned the endless and dull wet tshirt contest it is seriously the longest wet tshirt contest in cinema history and the only one where the contestants were wearing industrial strength cottonpolyester shirts that defied all efforts to get them wet and translucent i couldnt state it any better the only thing i would add is that the music in this scene is just plain annoyingbr br most of the acting is pretty over the top but that seems to suit the whole style of the movie the actors playing vinnie and vito were just too much for mei just found them annoying ms fredsti curette seemed to be enjoying herself and not taking the whole thing too seriously in contrast to sharon lee jones who acted decently but seemed to be taking everything more seriously all of the police were portrayed as bumbling idiots presumably to add comic relief which is a bit unnecessary given that the whole movie was rather comicalbr br from a ratings perspective this film had a lot of foul language some topless women and others scantily clad in thongs but not enough skin to satisfy those who are looking for nudity one sex scene that was portrayed in a nongraphic arty dreamlike fashion and little violencewhile there were threats of violence throughout the scenes of both sword fighting and brawling were exaggerated and too camp to be offensive though it looked like the actors were having a lot of fun with itbr br i have to wonder who came up with the character names ovule a small egg curette a surgical instrument used for scraping and cleaning exzema suspiciously similar to a disease characterized by scaling skin and pruritus bulemia an eating disorder with binging and purging and rickettsia another disease br br overall this is a bad low budget campy scifi action movie but it did keep me entertained though i might need a few drinks before watching it again
