this movie cant decide what it is  a soft porno or a sf movie not enough plot for a real movie but way too much for a pornobr br in a galaxy far far away a good princess we know shes good because she has long blonde hair wears a white toga is polite and is mooning wistfully about her dying mother when we first see her inherits the kingdom over her elder sister who is evil and we know this because she has dark hair and wears too much makeup abuses her male sexual slaves sneers and curls her lip all the time and talks imperiously about the horrors shell perpetrate when shes queen the evil princess gets upset and tries to stage a coup but the good sister gets away to earth of course she materializes buck naked in a bar during a wet tshirt contest it really goes downhill from there the acting is ludicrous the dialog sounds like it was written for a porno and the general storyline is ridiculous theres not even enough skin to make happy the sort of person whod watch this for skin i love good bad movies and this ones not even enjoyable on a bad movie level
