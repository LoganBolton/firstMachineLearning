admittedly i tuned into this in the hopes of seeing some beefcake shots of james brolin unfortunately there was only one early on and the rest of the movie was very tame and ultimately made little sensebr br the story what there is of it centers on nick and julie atkins a couple whose marriage of many years is beginning to grow stale nick a successful businessman is focused on work to the point of neglecting julie who tries to fill the void by going back to school julies longing for the passion that she and nick had early in their marriage begins to take shape in the form of powerful sexual fantasies which block out reality for minutes at a time causing her to do things like burning breakfast and misplace her husbands papers at first she fantasizes about her husband but as the movie progresses she begins to fantasize about other men and about encounters with random strangers whom she meets this culminates in her acting out her fantasies with disastrous consequences for her marriage can she and her husband rebuild their relationship is it worth saving br br this could have been an interesting premise but the execution is so bland that you wonder why they even bothered characters arent developed motives arent explained background information isnt given no exploration is made of how julie got to the point where she couldnt control herself and no explanation is offered as to how she will do so in the future the end product is a muddled mess which is just as confusing as julies fantasies which are surprisingly underdevelopedbr br the acting is a mixed bag donna mills as julie does well with the material she is given although her continual self pity does become strident after awhile james brolin acts as though he is reading his lines from cue cards and even his anger over his wifes infidelity is hard to buy into he shows so little passion over the whole issue the supporting roles are mostly forgettablebr br disappointing treatment of what could have been an interesting story mores the pity since it doesnt even offer the eye candy it promised
