it is inconceivable to me how anyone could have enjoyed or laughed at this movie id say its the worst movie ive seen in years and i see a lot of them maybe ive forgotten junior high its also very hard to believe that this is the same jeff daniels to did such a brilliant performance of george washington in the crossing seems like ever since he did dumber hes gone into the tank can you believe he even wrote and directed this junk
