having lived in michigans upper peninsula 30 miles from escanaba in the mid1990s i was eager to see this film it begins promisingly enough with some superficial understanding of the values and quirks of up life but jeff daniels apparently was not content with a lowkey approach that would have been fitting given the place and the people instead he introduces extremely crude humor and some wildly inappropriate mysticalsupernatural elements although there is a good movie to be made about this practically unknown region of the us this is not it
