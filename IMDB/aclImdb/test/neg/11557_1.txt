i think i can safely say without really giving anything away that this movie had no robots in it the guys in robot costumes didnt act or speak as such and the evil entity behind the whole plot isnt a robot eitherbr br the whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set i cant even use words to describe the actingbr br this couldnt even offer the hilarious ending of star crystal in short it is clearly one of the worst scifi movies of the 80s and i would be so bold as to say of all time
