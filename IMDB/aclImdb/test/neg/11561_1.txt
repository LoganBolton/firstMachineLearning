robot holocaust is about the lamest most pathetic attempt at making a postapocalyptic movie that ive seen and i thought the italians were the masters of wretched mad max wannabes some of those movies like escape 2000 are positively brilliant in comparison with this piece of poo the plot is nonsensical  even with a narrator setting up every scene and boy does it drag scene after scene with nothing of any interest happening the special effects and i use the word special loosely consist of sock puppets yes thats right  sock puppets the acting is abysmal angelika jager is in the running for worst performance ive ever seen sure shes french or german or whatever  but man is she bad i cannot think of a single positive thing to say about the movie so ill stop there because ten sentences on this junk is about ten too manybr br however and fortunately for me i saw the mst3k version of robot holocaust some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this mst3k episode a winner for a season one episode the riffs come fast and furious and hit their mark just about every time on my mst3k rating scale i give this episode a 45  seek it out
