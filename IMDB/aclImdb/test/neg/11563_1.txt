this movie is really bad most of it looks like it was filmed either in a park or a basement theres a giant spider but all we see of it is one leg there are some worms that live in a cave that are just cheap sock puppets with cardboard teeth and the plot is a bunch of postapocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense at all the whole thing is just laughable
