i am not familiar with the producers other works but this movie is a piece of crap br br i never saw the mst3k version but i can tell you mike and the bots probably didnt save it br br i love a gradez movie as much as the next bad movie fan but this was almost unwatchablebr br there was no credit for who did the voice of the dark one sounded a bit like patrick stewart at timesbr br a group of high school students who found a junk super8 camera in the trash heap could make a better movie than that
