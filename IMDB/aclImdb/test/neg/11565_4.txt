all right theres no way to sugarcoat this the plot was ridiculous the premise was ridiculous the acting was unconscionable the effects were laughable and all of the outdoor scenes appear to have been filmed in new yorks central park that having been said there was something about this movie that i couldnt walk away from maybe it was the atmosphere or maybe it was the evil supervixen or the amazon wenchesbr br anyway im not one to sit on the margins and criticise without pointing out a few redeeming qualities so here they arebr br a violent offshoot of the womens lib movement is portrayed in a wilderness setting central park of course and all of the masochistic young men out there will be very impressed furthermore some of the scenes in which certain characters lose consciousness are amusingly dramatic youll note that i write dramatic rather than convincingbr br all i can say is that some people like b movies and im one of them if youre one of them too then give it a go cheers mr kincaid this is one for the ages
