in fact it was awful the main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director at the time it was shot at some warehouse most likely owned by family or friends also they chose not to bother coming up with a story sure these are ways to cut cost but are they smart ways of keeping costs down no they arent at the very least they could have found a middle school student in a creative writing course those kids may have at least had a lesson about story structure at the very least they could have read up on 3 act structure but acting obviously wasnt a priority either watching these jerks run around in funny clothing that was stupid by 1980s standards was an embarrassment the fact that none of these actors committed suicide in humiliation is probably a testament to the limited distribution this film received had the actors actually seen the final result of their hard work there would have been a line of people waiting to jump off the brooklyn bridgebr br id give this movie 1010 stars but it only deserves 1 for being released at all this movie should be shown to film students everywhere its better than 90 of student films ive seen and wow is this movie a piece of shiiiit
