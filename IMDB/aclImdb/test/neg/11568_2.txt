cheap gloriously bad cheese from the 80s the decade of cheese i watched this one first uncut and unmst3ked and it was pretty much laugh out loud funny even without the commentsbr br the plotsuch as it is revolves around a postapocalyptic world in which the ai robots revoltedsound familiar and destroyed pretty much everything leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it the few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the dark one which seems to be part computer and part organic being the air slaves work to produce energy for this being in return for breathable air every once in a while the dark one has the strongest of the air slaves fight to the death so that no one will rise as a leader in a revolt against the dark onebr br okay thats the socalled serious stuff on to the silly stuff such as the ridiculous quasifuturistic clothing that everyone sports including car seat cover fur garments loin cloths and spangly stuff and feather boasworn mostly by the dark ones henchwoman a chick with an unrecognizable and almost nonunderstandable accent or the wooden acting and stilted lines sported by all of the socalled actors whos dialog is high on pretension and low on sense or the dime store special fx including pink socks with teeth glued onto them for deadly sewer snakes a bomb made of strung piano wire and a tin can and terrible mutants with halloween rubber masks onbr br a band of air slaves follow their leader a mysterious wanderer who has adapted to the air outside to go to the energy plant to destroy the dark one the guys name is neo which explains where the wachowski brothers got the idea for the matrix they meet up with a group of amazons along the way with the obligatory fight scene in which the female is bestedof course has anyone else ever noticed that in every amazon movie or tv show ever produced these socalled amazing warriors always get their butts kicked by either men or women amazons are just pansies i guessbr br this band of determined warriors makes their way through central parkerrrthe ravaged lands beyond the last standing citygood way to save money on the matte paintings of a destroyed new york city anyway and journey into the sewers leading to the power station where the dark one and his gogo girl henchwoman valeria hang out here they vanquish such ferocious beasts as the sock puppet worms a giant spider no one sees and the goofy lobster robot who is one of the dark ones personal guard br br the final showdown is pretty sad one of the slaves a girl whos father was taken by the dark one because hed produced a way for people to breathe the foul air sees that her father has been consumed by the dark ones true form which involves him being eaten by a giant avocado until only his head is sticking out the three remaining adventurers destroy the dark one by turning off a few switches and the robot holocaust dies not with a bang but with a whimper the two humans exchange some amazingly wooden last lines and thats it the end
