28 years before 911 there was another 911 which represented a key date in the history of chile south america and the whole world this was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in chile deposed salvador allende the first marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palacebr br unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of allendes rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history the times were troubled and allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world true he was democratically elected but his policies plunged chile into economic crisis he was deposed by a coup and a rightwing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses but he was also an ally of castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution well never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded the authors of the movie take a completely proallende position there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by castro the tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic almost propagandistic people who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future
