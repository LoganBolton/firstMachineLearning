bad bad movie so bad it is worth watching as long as you watch this movie knowing that it is bad and youll be spending 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie its worth it the special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is bad but watching the faces of the actors as they try to look frightened is just very funny if your sister is about to be eaten by a giant komodo dragon wouldnt you do a little something to try and save her if she did get eaten wouldnt you fall on your knees crying your heart out this guy just sat in a chair and ran his fingers through his hair how anticlimatic is that maybe he was supposed to be in shock or something he does join his sister in the komodos belly  oh didnt mean to spoil it for you
