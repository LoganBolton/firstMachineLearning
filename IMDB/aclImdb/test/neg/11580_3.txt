a team of amateur journalists and treehuggers catches wind of a secret government project project carnivore on a remote south pacific island the scientists there are producing giantsized corn but the genes are spreading to other species creating abnormally large komodo dragons and a cobra one thats bulletproof and swims underwater with the help of the scientists daughter can they escape the island and tell the world even if i hadnt seen this film on the scifi channel which sadly i did it would scream scifi channel with its low production value weak acting and some of the worst special effects in history the effects here are comparable to another creature film raptor island although not nearly as bad i would suspect that there must be at least a handful of people that worked on both films but i havent bothered to confirm that and probably wont it will be a sad day when i see either of them films againbr br which is not to say its not enjoyable i watched it at two in the morning with my sisters boyfriend and i cant speak for him but i thought it was a pretty good use of time as bad the whole thing is its a fun picture if you like to make fun of movies and the scientists daughter is attractive enough to carry the film i believe the actress name is michelle borth michael pare also appears as a ship captain and his poor choice of roles here actually makes his work on furnace look respectable even if that movie is intolerably badbr br i cant be too hard on this film simply because it was more or less exactly what i thought it would be bad effects low budget noname actors i didnt have any higher hopes yet this doesnt mean that its awesome either coming in at par is nothing to be proud of and this one will slowly fade into the distant memory department for the one fan who likes this film and calls it kvc hold on to your copy because youll have a heck of a time getting a replacement
