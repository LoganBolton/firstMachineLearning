when moviegoers hear two popular villainscharacters will be fighting they flock to the theaters to see how the battle will end theres freddy vs jason in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other and more similarly to this theres godzilla vs insert name here but the very generic komodo vs python is just a horrible title and an even worse premise obviously the movies a dlist picture but at least come up with a more compelling name maybe something that can trick the unsuspecting viewer into watching it with a name like this you know what youre getting in tobr br a group of military menwomen including a 20something year old sexy scientist woman are left for dead by the military on an island inhabited by a giant komodo dragon as long as they can make it off the island and to the boat theyll be fine butnotheres a giant python guarding the ocean and the way off lets hope all these guys can make it off the island and that the python and komodo dont verse each other in some sort of horrible special effect battlebr br really this movie is bad in almost every way the acting is pretty bad or maybe its that the special effects are so cheesy that the acting is unbelievable because no one believes that these people are in any danger with creatures that look like they were made on an early 90s computer nonetheless this movie is actually pretty funny the creatures are so clunky looking and the actors really give it their all pretending like theyre in dangerbr br id like to say that this movie is a steaming pile of shsquawkbut i cant this pg13 rated film actually bleeps itself out every time a curse word comes a parrot noise beeps out the word even words that can be said on network television how squawking cheap that they bleep out words and with a parrot no less eventually these parrot noises got to me and i couldnt help but laugh at the incompetencebr br this movie is bad from the silly beginning to the ridiculous night of the living dead style ending but its also kind of funny as a horror movie it fails miserably as an action movie it fails slightly less but still pretty bad and as a comedy it shinesbr br my rating  out of  95 mins pg13 for some violence and squawked out cursing
