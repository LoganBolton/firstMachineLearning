another laughably lame and senseless lowbudget scifi tv presentation but actually its kind of amusing kind of in a passably undemanding way am i being soft i dont know why they come up with these titles yes theres a komodo and yes theres a cobra however whats the deal with versus in between sure they do come to blows in only two sequences one recapping an incident and the other being the dodgy climax and quite boring exchanges i might add the getup is the same old routine of a scientific experiment getting out of hand on a secluded island no dinosaurs about and some innocent bystanders environmentalists hoping to expose animal testing getting caught up in it this sees a komodo dragon and cobra becoming massive in statue with the government soon wanting to destroy any sort of the evidence including witnesses of its existence by blowing up the island so this leaves the survivors racing against time to find a way off the prominent staples existed of awful video game cgi hack script few dingy sets although the tropical island setting was easy on the eyes throwaway characters but i found the performances faired up lifelessly tacky thrills which for some reason kept using the same repetitive shot of the victim just standing there in terror which implied im waiting please eat me now im not going anywhere and eventually they were swallowed whole well almost as it seemed to always take a second gulp to finish them off or just save the hassle by stupidly squashing them and a very hysterical edge with some sort of wretch message amongst the acts of survival director jim wynorski seems to be on cruise control throughout michael paré has fun with his gruff dialogues and michelle borth added much needed sparks renee talbert is there to pout a lot quite successfully too
