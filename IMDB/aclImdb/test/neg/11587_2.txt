laughable would be a good term to describe this movie but since this movie deserves nothing good said of it ill use the term godawful insteadbr br centering around the adventures of a bunch of ecowarriors investigating the nefarious doings of the military on a semitropical island the lack of a budget rapidly becomes apparent michael pare a real actor but only in the sense that pinocchio was a real boy leads the bunch of fools through a series of monster chaseandgobblehaplessvictim scenes there is some vague attempt at pseudoscience to explain the presence of the giant reptiles but it convinces the viewer about as well as the acting doesbr br as if this doesnt insult the viewer enough the movie also features what ill call guns of neverending ammunition i never saw mickey parrot or his female sidekick change clips once during the entire film yet i can positively report they cap off at least 40 rounds each in any scene where they are required to fire their weapon forty rounds may not seem like that many but we are talking standard handguns here i figure 15 round clip tops and remember they never change clips nor even appear to carry any extra ammobr br its dumbassery like this which consigns movies to the eternal fires of celluloid hell and rightly so the thirdrate cgi does little to help matters and the acting is best laughed at else youll start crying why scifi channel repeatedly churns out this mush is anyones guessbr br my advicegive this one a wide bertha very wide berth
