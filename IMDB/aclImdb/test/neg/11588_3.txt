i just found out before writing this review that komodo vs cobra and another movie called curse of the komodo were both directed by the same guy jim wynorski that might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises they both feature a militarygoverned island a colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees people racing to get to a chopper that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island and giant komodo dragons created through genetic experiments running amok what differences are there well the intruders on the island are now capitalists wanting to expose the government secret and theres a giant cobra on the island as well hence the title komodo vs cobra even though the conflict between the two monsters is hardly relevant to the story komodo vs cobra is more or less what youd expect given its title and its channel origin the scifi channel although every now and again you will find one that for one reason or another may appeal to you i liked a movie called komodo i hardly doubt this one willbr br komodo vs cobra is not only a boring film but its also one of the least enthusiastic scifi flicks ive seen in a long time in some of these movies there is an air to them that indicates the filmmakers were giving at least a certain level of effort but i see very little here thats indicated again by it just being a rehash of curse of the komodo the cgi for the monsters look as if they came straight out of a secondrate video game the cinematography and misc en scene is poor the acting ranges from passable to poor the action scenes are dull and then there are some parts that are frankly put unforgivably bad i see a lot movies where a person will shoot a gun many times without reloading and i can deal with this but in this movie where michael paré takes a single thirtyeight handgun and fires it approximately fifty times nonstop without reloading oncewell at first i laughed but even then it just became tiring that would be the action a monster appears people scream paré fires nonstop without reloading his gun once throughout the entire picture and somebody gets eatenbr br komodo vs cobra is a very bad movie the only thing in the movie that is worth mentioning in a charitable manner is an actress named michelle borth who is not only very beautiful but a surprisingly strong performer even with the trashy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the screenplay she was given michelle borth managed to pull off a surprisingly good performance and it just appalls me that an actress as good as her can get stuck in a film as junky as this she obviously took it for the paycheck but it wont boost her career any im afraid
