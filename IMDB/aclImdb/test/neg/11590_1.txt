where do i start first off the story sucks the acting sucks the effects really suck i guess ill start with the story the story for komodo vs cobra number one it doesnt explain how or when the komodo and the cobra even got there or for that matter how it was created the acting terrible it seems like the director just pulled a few people from the street which is probably what he did and last and definitely the least the effects they are so horrible that the komodo doesnt even look like a komodo just a dinosaur that looks incredibly unrealistic the water doesnt even move when the cobra appears all in all terrible piece of crap dont even think about renting it
