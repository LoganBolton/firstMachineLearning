komodo vs cobra starts as one planet environmentalist jerry ryan ryan mctavish  his girlfriend carrie renee talbert hire captain michael stoddard executive producer michael paré to take them to an island in the south pacific at first stoddard is reluctant since the island is a top secret military research base but soon changes his mind when a load of cash is offered along with tv news reporter sandra crescent jeri manthey they set sail for the island  once ashore find out that the military have been funding illegal dna genetic experiments which have resulted in huge komodo dragons  king cobras that have eaten almost every other living thing there  stoddard  co are next on the menubr br cowritten  directed by the ever awful jim wynorski under his jay andrews pseudonym this is just plain awful this is just plain hard to sit through  is even worse than the usual rubbish creature features the scifi channel have the nerve to air if thats possible the script is terrible predictable  utterly boring some giant monsters of some sort are created by scientists messing around with dna a group of people are trapped with said monsters  have to try to escape being eaten thats it thats the whole plot of komodo vs cobra maybe this was trying to ripoff avp alien vs predator 2004 with the title but all the vs bit amounts to is a rubbish thirty second standoff between the two titular beasts at the very end boring as hell  surely a big disappointment to anyone hoping to have a full on monster mash the characters are poor the dialogue is awful the pace is slow the story is predictable  cliché ridden  the whole film just sucks really with a lazy script that states wrongly that both komodo dragons  cobras are amphibious which they are not hell komodo vs cobra isnt even worth watching for any unintentional laughs since its so dull  hardly anything ever happens although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach from the cobra is quite funny for the wrong reasonsbr br how does wynorski keep getting directing jobs he is probably consistently the worst director currently working how can he keep getting fun sounding films set on beautiful locations with half decent casts  still churn out such an awful film i think this was cut to get a pg or for its tv showing since every time someone swears its masked by a parrot squeak theres zero gore or violence  the monster scenes are limp people just sort of stand there the monsters just sort of stands there too hissing or roaring  thats about it the cgi computer effects are terrible this is really poor stuff that just looks horriblebr br with a supposed budget of about 450000 this looks as cheap as it was the hawaiian locations are nice to look at but thats about it the acting is poor from an uninterested looking castbr br komodo vs cobra is an absolutely terrible scifi channel creature feature from jim wynorski films dont get much worse than this
