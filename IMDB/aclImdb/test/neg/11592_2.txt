if youre looking for a movie thats fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the not so great acting cheesy special effects and typical scifi plotthen this is the movie for you not at the acting was bad in fact a few actors were actually fairly decent the special effects werent the greatest to say the least the animals looked completely computer animated there was an annoying squawking to cover up the swearing and there was only one song played over and over again throughout the entire movie overall a good movie if youre looking for something completely cheesy and fun to make fun of not a good movie to watch if youre looking for something serious
