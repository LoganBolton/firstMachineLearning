so wynorski remakes curse of the komodo a second time this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a bunch of obnoxious environmentalists  anticapitalists and he adds a cobra most of the movie is spent listening to the selfrighteous characters prattle on about the evil capitalist pigs while sandwiched between this cavalcade of condescension are flashbacks to what happened on the island before they got there dna experiments were conducted critters started to grow people spoke to each other without coming off as being morally superior jerks etc needless to say it would have been a much better movie if they would have made the flashbacks the movie and forgotten about the sanctimonious dogooders lest i forget there are a few short scenes scattered here and there where the holierthanthou posse gets picked off one by one but they probably comprise less than 2 of the film the main event pitting our title characters against each other lasts about one minute and is as exciting as watching the previews for the latest dinocrisis video gamebr br the acting is pretty bad overall even for this sort of film half the actors seem like theyre more concerned with pronouncing every last syllable of every word than speaking their dialog in any sort of believable mannerbr br i actually did make it through to the end but its one of those movies i wish i would have recorded and then watched later because there are plenty of parts that need to be fast forwarded through overall i give this effort one star it has absolutely none of the elements that make a bmovie fun to watch its a sad day indeed when you can say with sincerity that the makers of this movie could have learned a thing or two from watching boa vs python
