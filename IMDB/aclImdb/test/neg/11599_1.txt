the good things first i agree with another viewer who said that gene raymond has a marvelous drunk scene he does  i was tickled to finally get a chance to laugh and there were other moments i found amusing  raymonds parents in the bathroom with the defective plumbing and the scene in the restaurant with robert montgomery trying to make carole lombard jealous by mouthing sweet nothings to a stranger br br but overall i was dismayed i love carol lombard and most of hitchcock and i understand the restrictions laid on productions by the hays code but this was embarrassing and awful to watch of course i knew theyd end up together this is a romantic comedy after all but it made no sense it happened too fast plus i cant believe the professions of love when confronted with such hurtful behavior both physical and confrontational
