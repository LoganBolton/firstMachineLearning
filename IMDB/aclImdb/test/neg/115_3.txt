i first watched this movie back in the midlate 80s when i was a kid we couldnt even get all the way through it the dialog the acting everything about it was just beyond lamebr br here are a few examples imagine these spoken real dramatically way overacted oreegon youre going to oreegon why would anyone want to go to oreegonbr br survivalists nobody ever told us about any survivalistsbr br this movie was so bad my sister and i rented it again for her 16th birthday party just so our friends could sit around and laugh at how awful it was i dont think we were able to finish it then either
