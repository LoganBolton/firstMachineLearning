first a warningbr br i recently saw this movie on dvd in the universal hitchcock collection series the source print looks to be in immaculate condition but the image is a bit soft suggesting it might be a second generation copy straight from video the framing is far too tight so all the compositions are terrible even the title of the movie is cropped i gather from other imdb reviews that there is a much better version availablebr br mr and mrs smith is just a footnote to hitchcocks careerbr br in his lengthy interviews with francois truffaut in the sixties hitchcock gave a comprehensive overview of his whole body of work but all he could say about this picture is that he did it as a favour to carole lombard and that he didnt understand the characters so just photographed norman krasnas screenplaybr br in truth there is not much more that needs to be saidbr br it is a screwball comedy out of the same mould as it happened one night his girl friday and philapdelphia story carole lombard is a typically feisty wife who learns that her marriage is technically invalid falls out with with her husband on the flimsiest of pretexts and spends most of the picture being adorably unreasonablebr br robert montgomery does well enough as the put upon husband but it is hard not to lose patience with him long before the end of the movie the audience is saying dump the silly cow shes not worth itbr br gene raymond plays the best friend with whom she becomes engaged he is supposed to be a courtly old family southerner although this is not obvious from his accent and only really becomes apparent in the drunk scene which he otherwise plays very well he is an honourable generous teetotal gentleman so of course he is bullied and patronised by robert montgomery and made the butt of many of the jokes  although he is not as badly treated as the similar ralph bellamy character in his girl fridaybr br this movie feels like it was made by people who only knew of screwball comedies by reputation but hadnt actually seen one for example a good screwball comedy has a strong central idea with a number of ongoing comic threads that continually intertwine and overlap here all the comedy elements are just strung out like beads on a necklace this is screwball comedy by the numbersbr br it is the same with the direction typically these comedies race along at an ever increasing pace that rises to near hysteria by the end hitchcock doesnt get this his direction is somewhat lethargic and the picture becomes a stately succession of scenes that all seem slightly overwritten but undernourished and slightly too long he was never a particularly good director of actors so he just lets the cast get on with it they do okbr br hitchcock had a good sense of humour which he frequently used in his thrillers but he had no feel for comedy as a genre his later trouble with harry was also a misfire for similar reasons to this movie but at least he was involved in that picture here he is just going through the motionsbr br all the people connected with this movie were good solid professionals so it is not especially bad it just feels a bit derivative overfamiliar overlong and ultimately rather flatbr br mr and mrs smith is one for carole lombard fans and hitchcock completists only
