i only voted it 210 mainly because hitchcock agreed to direct ithe certainly had an offday with predictable plot lines stupid childish characters who are desperately trying to be funnythere were twee hygenic sanitised emasculated sex scenes at a time when the hollywood production code was in full forcelazy male characters in the film who like soap characters never do a stroke of work for which they are paidit always irritates me when food is usually never eaten by actors one exception was in the eating scene in tom jones 1963 although copious amounts of drink are consumed  actors have to leave their mouths free for the next line carole lombard certainly fitted hitchcocks cool blond idealised image of a heroine but what ever possessed him to direct this worthless unfunny script he should have stuck to his thrillersit certainly has not worn well over the last 69 yearsi couldnt wait for it to end as it gradually irritated me no end
