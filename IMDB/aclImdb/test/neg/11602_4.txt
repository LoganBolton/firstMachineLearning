this was hitchcocks third hollywood feature and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in rebecca to espionage thriller in foreign correspondent and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the screwball pictures of the 1930sbr br hitchcocks formal method on the other hand had by now settled into something consistent so much so that he was unable or at least unwilling to deviate from it it was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate in rebecca it was actually great to see hitchcock constrained by his producer and the source text forced to turn his technique to heavy gothic drama but for mr and mrs smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content in other words hitchcock was no ernst lubitschbr br first lets look at the romantic angle the best love scenes in hitchcock films were wild passionate and slightly dangerous  the ever fallen in love with someone you shouldnt have situation and he was great at depicting that this is something that makes a much earlier film rich and strange one of the few hitchcock nonthrillers that really works hitch is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story a light tender touch is required and hitch doesnt have itbr br secondly take the comedy of course hitchcock films could be funny  the lady vanishes is probably the best example  but only when the jokes were sprinkled throughout the story the master of suspense simply isnt enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones he cuts up scenes as he would in a thriller  snappy opposing angles of people talking inserted closeups of hands and feet pointofview shots  but doesnt allow for comic timing or focus on gags for example the business with carole lombards dress bursting at the seems is shown to us with a couple of closeups but these are timed more as if he were revealing some crucial plot point and have no comedic impact occasionally hitchcocks style does roughly coincide with the comedy  for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club where robert montgomery tries to make it look as if he is with the attractive sophisticated woman at the next table  but such moments are few and far betweenbr br even the cast of mr and mrs smith are not up to standard im not sure this was robert montgomerys strength lay and he is boring here this was of course exactly where queen of screwball carole lombards strength lay and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances even jack carson who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to let go before the camera fails to perk things up at all of course neither of these fine comedy actors is helped by the screenplay which isnt exactly bursting with laughs in the first place even if the basic story is a fairly good premisebr br the only fullon comedy hitchcock made after this was the trouble with harry and that sort of worked because it played upon his familiar suspensefulness however it was only when the story could exist independently of the humour when the basic framework was suspense  as it is in the lady vanishes or family plot  that hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well
