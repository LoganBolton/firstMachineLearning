alfred hitchcock made this comedy of mismarriage in 1941 but his heart doesnt appear to be in it carole lombard and robert montgomery are the couple who discover they were never legally married and spend the movie bickering their way back to true love it doesnt have much of a reputation and it is easy to see why the jokes are familiar from better films but here they dont gel and the leads are uncharismatic lombards performance is clipped and starchy and its doubly sad to think she was dead only a year later robert montgomery seems to know hes in a sows ear and tries his damnest to make a silk purse out of it without much success the best performance comes from gene raymond as the other man he has a lovely drunk scene this is one of the few really bad hitchcock films
