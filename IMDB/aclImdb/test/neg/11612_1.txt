the storyline seemed fine the actors seemed fine the movie shouldbr br have been fine but it sure wasnt  it didnt lead us anywhere thebr br scenes are weird maybe it was meant to create something new to makebr br us think that atleast it did where is the rest of this film to me itbr br was waste of money time and talent someone might want to see thisbr br for curiosity to see if they can figure it out other i personallybr br wouldnt recommend this to anyone
