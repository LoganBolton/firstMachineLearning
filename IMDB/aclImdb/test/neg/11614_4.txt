after an intriguing start this little drama quickly descends into the ranks of sheer mediocrity the start of the movie sees two women heather graham and natasha gregson wagner meet each other while waiting for their boyfriends to get home from their holidays natasha gregson wagner is a lovely looking actress and she plays louise a cute girl whose beloved boyfriend is an all round entertainer music movies you name it he does it while shes telling the other girl carla heather graham all about her wonderful boyfriend it soon becomes apparent that the similarities between their two male friends are too much and its obvious that the two girls are dating the same guy oh dear enter robert downey jnr the sleazebag that has two girlfriends while some poor guy somewhere has to go without one downey plays the sort of guy that the ladies like but men find repulsively annoying he is basically a mummys boy the worst kind too on the phone ringing mother all the time continually showering his girlfriends with ambitious albeit empty promises etc its enough to make a normal guy sickbr br the film knowingly rips off superior threeway love triangle films such as jules et jim this film doesnt work though mostly due to the fact that its story is so unbelievable seriously if two women had just found that they were dating the same guythey wouldnt stick around to talk about it another reason why it falls down is that its just so turgid theres no end of possibilities for the outcome of the situation that this movie presents especially with the claustrophobia of setting it all in a small apartment but all the movie does is get lost in masses of dialogue badly written and poorly delivered dialogue that is the film is also massively overacted it just isnt believable that people would act like they do in this film after finding themselves in this situation robert downey jnr is one of the many things that is wasted in the film with natural born killers he proved that he could give brilliantly entertaining performances and that is something that this movie could do with the two females arent wasted because nobody expected anything from them anyway but downey could definitely have been better utilised overall a waste of time dont bother see jules et jim or natural born killers instead thats my advice
