wow i truly regret watching this picture funny i agreed to see it just for my wife who endured the torture of seeing it about a half an hour before retiring while i stayed in front of the tv but only to feed the the masochistic in me and i because i wanted to know if this movie was so bad in its entirety or if there were some redeemable aspects which might alleviate the feeling i had of being a stupid for watching this  called two girls and a guybr br everything in this picture is wrong totally wrong since the initial absurd premise of two women stupid enough to stay with their common boyfriend until the awful but merciful end not forgetting the horrible acting of the three actors dont believe the rumors the junkies acting is bad and i dont see how graham has made herself a known name within the movie industrybr br i wonder why after the producers saved some bucks with just three actors and an only location they didnt hire a person to write the script instead of putting a monkey to do it with his br br at least i felt a little fine when i destroyed the dvd and threw it to the trash anyway i liked somehow and just a little the brunette actress natasha something but that was not enough to beat the incredibly stupid and crazy premise of faceoff changing faces so two girls and a guy to the bottom goes br br stay away from this
