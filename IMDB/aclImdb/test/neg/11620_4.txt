theres only 2 reasons i watch this showi invested the time already in previous episodes and col tigh for all you supposed scifi fans out there who love the new bsg give me a break go read some classic scifi novels by the true greats or watch some of the milestone films and tv shows from days gone by and youll see what hacks these bsg writers are their only gimmick is who is the fifth cylon poor writing and really truly no sense of character development if adama resigns or tries to take power or cries again or discovers the inner father he should have been one more timeahhhhh and roslin is as annoying a character thats ever been put aboard a starship out the airlock with her i could care less if its six more months before they conclude these wannabe writers were out of tricks in season one if you dont know that you just dont know writing
