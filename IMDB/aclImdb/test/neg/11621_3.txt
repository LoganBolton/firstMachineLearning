i really enjoyed bg seasons 13 and really couldnt understand those who didnt like it but i cant defend this nonsense spoilers followbr br the first problem is that the characters are now doing inexplicably stupid things on a regular basis br br so if starbuck thinks she knows where earth is why not send her out in a raptor would the admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer would the quorum elect their newest member the nonelected adama junior he has about three weeks political experience under his belt and is the son of a man they distrust would adama send gaeta and halo along with starbuck leaving himself short of senior officers would adama put a man into having sex with cylon prisoners in charge of the fleetbr br i just dont buy any of thisbr br secondly while i accept there have been miracles and references to god up to the end of season 3 its now all totally over the top i started watching bg because i thought it was sci fi not some biblical epic i expected the characters to continue to behave reasonably intelligently and wanted some satisfying explanations regarding some of the odder developments in the series br br baltar was the best character in the show but he now seems to be totally insane not illogical considering what hes been through but very unsatisfyingbr br all the characters appear to be just puppets dancing to an unknown third partys behest some godlike entity this isnt good drama its annoying and a writing cop out br br ok so what are the good points nice battle at the start of 41 some good dramatic scenes well acted when viewed in isolation a good final scene a nice cliffhanging curve ball of a developmentbr br but this isnt sci fi its turned into fantasy i cant imagine how the writers can recover this one
