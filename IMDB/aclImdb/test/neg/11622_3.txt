the plot outline of this movie is similar to the original someone gets kidnapped the prince is incest with saving her odet turns into a swan the turtlefrogpuffin first the bad magician as best they can and in the end anyways there is not much new here with the exception of a lack of well known voice talent sorry no palance nor cleese and thus jeanbob was a disapointment
