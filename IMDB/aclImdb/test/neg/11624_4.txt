i was disappointed with the sequel to the swan princess i can see what they were trying to do with the story show how married life was going for odette and derek but the story wasnt interesting enough to hold my attention and it seemed to cover the same bases as the originalbr br it isnt funny the only bit i found humorous was when jeanbob was turned into a prince and then back into a frog and noone saw it happen and he was trying to convince them that it really didbr br the villain is rubbish and the animation isnt as impressive as the first filmbr br the queen is a very irritating character and instead of cheering with derek to rescue his mother youre hoping that the villain puts a spell on her voice box to stop her talkingbr br it is a shame because i really liked the first movie but it didnt live up to my expectations
