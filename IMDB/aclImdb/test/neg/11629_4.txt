lets get things straight i was raised catholic and in a very religious family and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home that was useful for two things to make a convinced atheist out of me and to give me deep insightful knowledge about the church and its dogmas and i say if a catholic priest witnesses a murder and clearly sees the face of the killer he can report it to the police even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards he can not reveal what hes told in confession but he can talk about anything he sees outside that and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut so here we have a movie entirely sustained on a lie and another lie is theres no absolution for murder according to the catholic church theres absolution for any sin as long as theres sincere repentance so far the biggest plot holes in this weak thrillerbr br as people frequently say this movie would have improved if bob hoskins and alan bates had switched roles hoskins is naturally suitable to play gangsters i will never lament enough that he lost al capone in favor of one of de niros weakest performances in the untouchables and bates features would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past but above that i think the film would have been much better had reallife ulster native liam neeson back then mostly unknown to big audiences played mickey rourkes part not only his face is perfect to play tormented characters but hed make us believe the character as real something rourke just cant back in the 80s rourke was not a bad actor afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his looks but he was one of those performers like brad dourif whos as good as the director he works with and as a former ira terrorist rourkes acting comes across more like a pimp sad to think that had this movie been made just some three to six years later when neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with sam raimis enjoyable darkman and superstardom in 1993 with schindlers list while rourke became pretty much of a forgotten hasbeen liam and mickey could have switched parts to greater benefit rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of docherty but just cant carry this movie along as the lead yet another missed opportunity and yet another film with the potential of being a classic that became instantly forgettable farebr br ironically enough the often criticized score by underrated composer bill conti worked for me i didnt find it overlymelodramatic but suitably gritty and beautiful it reminded me of howard shores score for the silence of the lambs heres to mike hodges talent who made get carter yes but dont forget hes the mastermind behind flash gordon as wellbr br it seems the film was massacred in the cutting room it shows as some parts are really choppy and confusing and others just dont glue and a directors cut is waiting to see the light ok but i seriously doubt that will make it a great movie as well still have the bad casting and the false premise there 410
