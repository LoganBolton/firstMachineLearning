i enjoy sciencefiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film nana 1926 this jean renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire produced on a budget that couldnt have been much more than zero in the year 2028 following a great war africa has become the most civilised region on earth and what was formerly europe has been designated terres inconnues unknown land an african explorer  played by johnny huggins a black man dressed up as a white man dressed up as a black man if you follow me  travels to the ruins of paris in his spherical aircraft and lands outside the lair of a parisian savage catherine hessling then the directors wife and her primate companion perhaps the creepiest apeman costume ive ever seen the savage as part of some bizarre sexual initiation ritual starts showing the explorer the charleston dance which he is delighted to learn himselfbr br it doesnt help the film that hessling who was wonderful the following year in renoirs the little match girl 1928 isnt much of a dancer though the extensive use of slowmotion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony furthermore im quite shocked that renoir would exploit his own wife as such a blatant sexual object  it doesnt come as a surprise to learn of their divorce just three years later on the plus side i did like the general scifi concept behind the film and the slyly satiric touch of the reversing the racial roles usually typical in such stories as this however why renoir decided to dress up his black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery for all of time silly crude and quite pointless charleston parade 1927 is a cinematic oddity from one of cinemas most respected directors and is perhaps an effort that he would have liked to forget the dvd version came without a musical soundtrack but i compromised with a selection of pieces from dmitri shostakovich
