made with film stock left over from the production of nana 1927s sur un air de charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned and thats the best way to view it jean renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together the plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes  in 2028 a black explorer travels to a postholocaust paris where a white native girl teaches him the charleston naturally he assumes shes a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of white aborigine music there are plenty of surreal touches be it the pet gorilla eating the flowers in catherine hesslings hair the angels the girl telephones renoir and producer pierre braunberger among them or the fact that black performer johnny huggins plays his part in minstrel blackface while hesslings dancing ability is almost completely nonexistent and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion but theres not really enough to sustain it for two reels an additional air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this silent musical has absolutely no score at all on lions gates new dvd
