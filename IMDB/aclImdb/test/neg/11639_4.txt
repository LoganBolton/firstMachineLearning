a man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a monkey he hooks her up with a telephone and she teaches him how to charleston then they fly off in the spaceship leaving the monkey behind cringeinducing blackface aside this short film makes no sense i think thats the plot but im not sure by a long shot you cant tell that this is renoir at work despite his characteristic humanism good use of slowmotion though can be found on the ny film annexs series of experimental film videos no 18 i believe
