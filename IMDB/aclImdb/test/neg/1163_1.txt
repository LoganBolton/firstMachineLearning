all of the great horror movies of the 70s 80s and even the early 90s from psycho to texas chainsaw masacre the original not that warmed over wb crap to silence of the lambs the characters in these movies were based upon the crimes of ed gein the writers and directors tapped into the true story for the inspiration for creating some of the greatest fictional movie killers of all timebr br the old horror films were great because even though the crimes were loosely based upon the facts of the case of ed gein they were truly fictional and far removed from the true storybr br in the case of this movie theyve created a fictional horror film in which they tried to capitalize on the true story in order to sell a cheap poorly acted love story between two characters that nobody really cares about in fact in a good horror film these two characters would have been excellent victimsbr br end of lecturebr br in short this film was like wearing clammy underwear on a cold afternoon sipping on a nice cup of chilled vomit
