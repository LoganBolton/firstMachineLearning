why are there no good reviews because this film is hysterically badbr br set in a japanese prison camp in world war ii we have jim brown as the hero who puts up with a hysterically unbelievable racist officer and just as hysterical is the way the japanese officers brown nose jim browns characterbr br this is probably the worst film any of these actors ever did stereotypes not only abound but they dominate this film the sixtiesseventies music may be the best thing about the film maybe because it has nothing to do with the filmbr br this is even difficult to sit back and enjoy as mindless fun this film is even more racist than the message of racism it tries to deliver and believe me i was alive in the seventies and we thought crap like this was just as stupid then it was never popular
