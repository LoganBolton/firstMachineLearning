the best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from the pearl harbor attack in tora tora tora my favorite was the shot of the p40 crashing into the row of parked p40s but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane unfortunately it just gets worse from therebr br theres two black guys and two white guys as american pows as well as some filipinos pows and japanese guards the ranking pow of the americans is a white naval lieutenant which is of course an o3 in the navy at any rate hes in need of a haircut badly distractingly badly hockey hair does not belong in a wwii movie oh and hes a racist he doesnt want to share quarters with the negros of course in real life he wouldnt want to share quarters with the white enlisted guy either i think the geneva convention has a clause about officers quarters and enlisted but that wasnt the point here oh well i think plot is secondary to other issues in this flick he gets put in his place and pretty much spends the rest of the movie as a look out and running the air pump for the diversbr br but once you get going its not a bad story line the japs want the divers to raise the silver thrown out by the americans before corrigador fell the filipino resistance wants them to take their time and the pows do their best to help a potentially good story and not that badly done i guess a bit unbelievable when the pows use camp made rebreathers to swim between the pow camp and the filipino village every night maybe im not that picky when i know going in that this is not a blockbuster film i guess thats why it comes on a 20pack dvd war movie collection for five bucksbr br the 70s music did not belong in this movie or any wwii movie its quite distracting to say the least the acting was not that bad probably better than i could dobr br not being a fan of football at least i found out that jim brown is a real person and not somebody richard pryor made up that in itself was worth the 25Â¢ i paid for this moviebr br worth watching on tcm or paying a quarter for br br one star for being a war movie another for being wwii and one more because im feeling generous
