what was i thinking when i rented this one what did the distributor think when he copied the tape and shipped it all the way to holland that anyone really wanted to see this sbr br its about some astronauts getting into trouble outer space apollo 13 flashback but never even in the shadow of this fine film and they want to return to home if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possiblebr br this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere deep impact and armageddon werent perfect either far from it but they were at least worth watching once and maybe one more time when were all old they gave some fun max q doesnt it gives irritation okay okay its a tv movie but does that mean youre allowed to come up with such a messbr br if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of timebr br it gets at its worst at the end when the space shuttle lands on no i cant spoil this one imdb guidelines forbid it so you have to see for yourself no dont see it sorry but rent a movie which is worth renting like battlefield earth just kiddingbr br probably the worst one i have ever seen
