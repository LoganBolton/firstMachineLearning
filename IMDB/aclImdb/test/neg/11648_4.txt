the plot was not goodbr br the special effects werentbr br the acting was not very good at allbr br like others i felt there were numerous holes in the plot that you could fly well a space shuttle throughbr br i thought the ending was rather unbelievablebr br by the way guys about the blow torch in spacebr br blow torches have their own supply of oxygen hence the name oxyacetylene torch two hoses run from the torch one to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen bottlebr br so a blow torch would work just fine in space
