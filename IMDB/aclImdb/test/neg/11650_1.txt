im sorry but this really does feel like a modern day apollo 13 knockoff totally implausible at least armageddon felt like a comic book this felt like a bad high school film project acting was about as cliché as one can get andlanding a space shuttle on an la freeway come on seriously jerry what were you thinking and all the clichés the pregnant astronauts wife the nosy reporter who gets in everyones way the stalwart manager with go fever and its one thing to twist the laws of physics or politics or whatever to make an entertaining story but at least make it good fact and science were totally butchered for this the space shuttle doesnt have fuel tanks in its wings and even if it did it couldnt steer by shifting fuel between them and neither could a dc10br br if you like bad acting bad storytelling low realism and cheesy clichés this one cant be beat
