this movie was pointless i cant even call it scifi since that requires more from a movie than merely taking place in space max q isnt even set in space for the entire movie the storyplot is unoriginal the cast isnt anything to write home about although it would be strange with a top cast in a mediocre film furthermore its not particularly exciting or welltold at least its evenly balanced in a low quality sort of way in that nothing or no one stands out everything is equally bland i usually find some quality in space flicks even if its just 90 minutes of semilame entertainment bordering on lowbudget pathetic but max q didnt even give me that satisfaction all in all  a complete waste of time
