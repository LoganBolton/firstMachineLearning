based on the comments made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it i think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a great movie it has its interesting moments for one thing it was filmed on location in colorado was it breckinridge or telluride i cant remember but it is in the credits the location is absolutely stunning and spectacular its beautiful even to me who lived in colorado for several yearsbr br next it has disneys penchant for wonderful character actors harry morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a disney movie he is literally hysterical also remember the wonderful mary wickes although she has a bit part in this movie she is great as always if you dont know who she is think of the animated disney version of hunchback from notre dame she was one of the gargoyles and she was also the most interesting nun in sister act as well as the best nun in the trouble with angels she has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deservebr br in addition to character actors and allstar casts in the 1960s1970s disney may have not had the greatest movies but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end you will notice that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it the entire movie may not be funny but there is always a comic gem at least 1 or 2 in every single liveaction movie disney ever made whether its harry morgan in one of his bellowing tones of voice or tim conway floundering around or joe flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror it is all good the whole film may not be good but there are always hysterical moments in every disney film from this period that i have ever seen disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile despite the dumbness of the filmbr br bsed on these comments i disagree with viewers who say every disney movie in this time period is awful that statement it not quite accurate rather it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plotsbr br some liveaction disney movies are true classics old yeller bedknobs and broomsticks mary poppins but for those that arent i am able to appreciate them for what they were  good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar crude and offensive
