this was included on the disk shorts volume 2a rather dull collection of short films shorts are among my favorite style of films but somehow the people assembling this second collection had a hard time finding quality contentand it wasnt nearly as good as the first volume or other shorts collections br br this short film feels like its woefully incomplete there is a story but so much in unanswered that the viewer like me feels a bit left out and unfulfilledbr br the film begins with a woman her boyfriend and her westie thats a dog by the way going to a lonely beach the lady speaks with an accent that at times is a bit difficult to follow given that i am hard of hearing i sure would have loved if it had been closed captioned anyway the boyfriend goes for a swim while she naps when she awakens her dog is gone she panics and makes the guy follow her all about looking for the dog they spend most of the time arguing and being disagreeable then out of the blue they stop to have sex later they find the dogend of storybr br as far as the characters go both seemed rather dysfunctional and unlikable she was a fussy and demanding lady and he seemed to have contempt for her when you wondered why they were together their little sex break showed what bond kept them togetherbr br some might like the characterizationsi kept finding the people irritating and unrealmore like caricatures than people you might meet or know also the payoff for all this just isnt worth the wait unless you want to see the guy naked
