like most musicals of the era one must check reality at the door broadway melody of 1938 is not remotely believable nor plausible but kind of fun in its strange way this movie is really just an excuse to execute the talents of the stars some scenes just happen as if they were in a review not a plot driven moviebr br judy garland shines and its a pity she has so little to do unless much was left on the cutting room floorbr br one of the most inane happenings are the way eleanor powell get a lead role in a broadway show and robert taylor says its going to be work work work from dawn til dusk several scenes go by and theres no work no rehearsalsnothing she needs money to win a horse in an auction she has no money isnt she getting paid while she rehearses taylor has to borrow money to help hes supposed to be a big time producer he has no money anyway thats just two elements in this strange storybr br the musical numbers are quite wonderful which saves this from being a total loss broadway melody of 1940 is much better as is broadway melody of 1936
