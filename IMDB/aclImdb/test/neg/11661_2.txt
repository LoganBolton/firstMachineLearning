the hindi remake of mrs doubtfire starring and directed by kamal hassan is a somewhat shoddy version and not as good as expectedbr br kamal hassan clearly struggles with hindi dialogs even after all these years and cannot handle even one scene effortlessly the guy has aged and should give it a rest hassan doesnt bring anything new to the role or to the character as say dustin hoffman does to tootsie or marathi actor macchindranath kambli does to mavshis aunts character in moruchi mavshi morus auntie comedy playbr br what was the kid doing playing with firecrackers when it wasnt diwali most of chachis romantic crossconnections  vs amrish paresh and then johny walker seem redundant to the main storyline tabus bathing scene was unnecessary the family is north indian but must be reminded of karva chauth night by a maharashtrian chachi yeah rightbr br the fine acting skills of not one but four actors namely tabu om puri the late amrish puri and paresh rawal have been wasted in this filmbr br watch the original mrs doubtfire  clean crisp and crackling with fun quite unlike chachi 420
