now i remember what the indie filmmakers were ripping off before pulp fiction it was david lynch rightbr br i hunted this thing down to see kyle secor what a waste of a perfectly good bayliss it was so painful to watch him sort of like when someone you love is horribly sick and theres nothing you can dobr br nearly every cliche in the book the desert the psycho the quirky mob boss the biker tracy walker who fortunately was only in one scene but i kept expecting him to reappear and say something strange and profound like if a man wants to know where hes going hes got to look at where hes been or some contrived garbage like that i have a theory as to why so many indies are short on location in the desert i think its because they can save money on lightingbr br if you like to be in pain find this movie and give it a viewing if youre a fan of kyle secor watch reruns of homicide on court tv if you want a good quirky road thriller check out wild at heartbr br there is a reason that no one has heard of delusion my god what a waste of a good title
