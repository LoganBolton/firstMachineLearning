originally i wrote what was a sarcasticscathing review of this pathetic piece of dungbut every time i submitted the review i got this contains a very long word which is not allowed also words that were not misspelled were judged incorrect br br now the word that was judged too long was never identifiedafter numerous attempts at eliminating words eventually i got the sneaking suspicion that the imdb site is politically sensitive and set to reject certain words automaticallynothing i wrote was obscene or racist in itselfbut after eliminating all of the longest words the same message was repeated again and againalso words that werent judged misspelled were all the sudden considered misspelledbr br the pc police are everywhere
