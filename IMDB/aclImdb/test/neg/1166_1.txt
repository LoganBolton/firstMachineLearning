when deranged was made the filmmakers saw fit to turn ed gein into ezra cobb even though the resultant film was actually quite close to the facts of the notorious case i presume that enough was fictionalised that they thought they should change names and suchbr br ed gein  the butcher of plainfield masquerades as a true story retelling of the gein case but actually bears very little resemblance to the history as a biopic type film it is a travesty if ever a film needed names changing it is this one far more so than deranged it is as close to the true crime story as dirty harry was to the true story of the zodiac killingsbr br ok so that annoyance aside how is it as a horror film well as a horror film well as a film generally it is quite appalling one of the worst films i have sat through in months issues run thus 1 kane hodder is quite astonishingly miscast as ed gein utterly unsuitable in the part hodder just lumbers through glowering menacingly very badbr br 2 kane hodder is the best actor in the film the rest of the cast are rather amateur dramatics and utterly unengaging it is painful to witness some lines being deliveredbr br 3 the occasional efforts of stylish filmmaking seem to come from the big book of moody cinematography clich√© youve seen it all before better executed aside from the efforts at style the rest of the filmmaking is largely inept cameras shake framing is bad there are overlong pointless shots holding back the pacewhich leads me tobr br 4 it seems to go on forever it is under 90 minutes in length but sitting through it is an ordeal youd swear it ran two and a half hoursbr br 5 ed gein almost seems secondary mostly the film is concerned with the family affairs of a newly promoted deputy sheriff said deputy is played by an abysmal actor upon whose shoulders no film should restbr br is anything good about it well the gore fx are very good some convincing wounds are in display and the makeup is generally excellent none of this however makes up for the massive failings of the filmbr br it doesnt even have any kitsch value its just bad not enjoyably bad not so bad its good just genuinely bad a film to avoid and despise
