intelligent summary isnt itbr br if mad max was something of a simple straight forward nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film they totally made up for it with its sequel the road warrior so in theory with a third great film it wouldve been a great trilogy now its notbr br such a huge disappointment beyond thunderdome was its main premise is pretty cool with an underworld think a mix between metropolis and the time machine but it all isnt carried out with too much conviction add the obnoxious tina turner and the no good storyline of the people waiting for a plane and this is just one huge stinkerbr br maybe they can brighten things up again with part 4 although that one is just probably gonna be 1 huge budgetexplosion kinda thing because this just isnt rightbr br 310
