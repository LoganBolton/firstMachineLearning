every time ive seen this movie i get the same impression some parts of it are so amazingly stupidbad that they crack me up they arent intentional and there are a lot of them the rest is just plain bad stupid andor irrelevant a movie like evil dead gets credit for being bad at its own expense because its the intended resultit stupid and cheesy because sam raimi succeeded at what he was trying to do this movie doesnt have that excuse its stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers failed so miserably the crap result gets heaped on top of the crap writing and crap performances to make it a shame that the lowest rating a movie can be given is one for awful watching this movie has the same effect as listening to a billy madison essayeveryone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i should be able to give this movie something around a 5
