my wife and i met doing a professional production of the merry widow in 1982  in english but a straight translationbr br only the very basic skeleton of the original plot is visible in this adaptation most of the characters have been deleted along with the entire b plot and all but one of the characters remaining have been renamed most of the characters in the movie arent in the operetta either the action has been moved from paris to at first washington dc and then to the fictional country of pontevedro which the movie has renamed marshovia and only later to paris the net result is that we dont reach the beginning of the original play until about 45 minutes inbr br and the main source of tension in the plot is deleted too in the original years before count danilo and the heroine were very much in love but his family refused to allow them to marry because she was poor its his broken heart that has rendered him a careless playboy now that as a widow shes the richest woman in the world she still loves him and he still loves her but his pride wont let him admit it to anyone even himself and she must spend three acts playing mind games to break him down the trope of the aristocrat with money problems who wont admit that hes in love with a rich woman for fear of what people will think supplied the main plots of a substantial fraction of viennese operettas for decades after the 1906 widow in this movie theyve never met before which rips out not only the heart of the whole thing but nearly all the comedybr br lamas does a pretty decent job thoughbr br an interesting musical point is that several times we hear a snippet or so of trés parisien an extra song written in english despite the title for the london première which was not as far as i know usually found in american productions until the 1980s or so
