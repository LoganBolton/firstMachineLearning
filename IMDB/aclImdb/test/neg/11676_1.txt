okay i really tried to tap into the so called silly  surreal humor that this film sets out to be im told that the japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one shipped to america go figure and has less political references apart from all that i found this sexualpolitical farce just as boring and pointless as standard porn the central female lead is easy on the eyes and could actually act i would love to see her in a non pink film where she could actually flex her acting muscles and nonot the ones youre thinking of its obvious that japan can and doesproduce just as much crap as other countries i couldnt recommend this to anyone with the distant possibility of someone who has a jones for asian porn go see a real japanese film
