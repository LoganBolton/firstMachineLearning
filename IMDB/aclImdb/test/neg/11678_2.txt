the movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willynilly crisscrosses the lives and timelines of its 3 central characters to what purpose one may ask the problem with this film is that the script becomes the story not characters or their livesbr br it starts off with a bunch of rich aimless college kids and a couple of notsorich too drawn into the naxalite movement affair rejection and separation follows people go their own ways seemingly only till the heroine forces herself upon them not once but twice after a pause in the movement the next hurdle for these 3 is the emergency imposed on the country by indira gandhi lots of political figures roam around for no obvious reason the subplots are too contrived and dont add up to make a logical wholebr br the movie tries to impose a false pace but never reaches a true rhythm barely coherent at times there is no maturation and growth whatsoever in the arcs of the 3 excollege buddies even after they are presumably married engaged settled or whatever they are ever too eager to just ditch it all and head off to a village to have sex with the exlover or exflame what fertile imagination the screenwriter possesses so many 4letter words are used without any rhyme or reason that its downright abusivebr br chitrangda singh has a horrible american accent that she doesnt try to hide its hideous hearing her mouth clich√©ridden dialog like whats up i didnt think youd come this after the hellish nightmare shes just been thru or in the beginning i appreciate your concern but i can take care of myself yikes what kind of clown wrote the dialogs for this she invites her friend in to have a cup of south indian no less coffee wishes someone good morning and then is wished good night by someone else in the family now whats up with thatbr br the countless uncredited villagers and tribals are the best actors the editing is really erratic with too many cuts obviously trying hard to make a bold statement sudhir misra screwed up bigtime on this one
