hmmm not a patch on the original from shaw brothers the fighting is average and looks very clunky the story line is as to be expected from a 70s kung fu film confusing and daft stupid voices for womendubbed in posh english accents for men i turned this off early and i love martial arts flicks get the original its so much better than this average movie dont be fooled i bought the wrong flick what i wanted was the shaw brothers movie i have just started commenting im only doing foreign and martial arts films this is just the beginning of my movie collection i personally own most modern martial arts flicks hope you dont waste time watching this one its for die hard fans of 70s kung fu only
