well the first thing i saw after looking at the dvd box was best screenplay and thought this would be a good rental wow was i mistaken im sure at one time there was a good movie in here but after the incredibly poor acting and video game production values this ends up looking like trons retarded halfbrother the first scene sets up the overall atmosphere of the entire movie five minutes into it youll be asking yourself what the hell am i watching and it will just snowball from there an awful soundtrack that makes every song sound like rob zombies dragula rounds out this miserable piece of crap into a laughably bad movie on a side note 3 most romantic quote in a movie  i think youre the final destination
