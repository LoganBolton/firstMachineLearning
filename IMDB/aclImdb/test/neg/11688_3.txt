what on earth was that my family and i just waisted 2 hours of our life for this piece of rubbish  there was no plot no tension only a lot of boredom  my kids could do better movies with our videocamerabr br but maybe we just did not get the point of the movieoh wait my mum did she was the only one who liked it for the following reason at least a film with no cars screeching if you are looking for a warfilm with no fighting in it is still interesting and gripping and has a strong antiwarmessage then you should watch the trenchbr br i give this film 3 out of 10 because it is good enough for an afternoonnap and because i am too nice
