oh how awfully this movie is i dont know if it is a horror film or a drama cause the story and the both genres are not established very well the story is not moving it is slow boring and sleepy from the beginning to end this movie really bores me but i really liked the camera work it is authentic fresh and clear the acting is great too the little boy was the great performer in this movie but it hasnt made me to jump from my seat but this movie makes me grab a pillow lay on the bed and sleep until the credits rollbr br boring not worth watching i tell you this movie suckedbr br 110
