from the acclaim it got i was expecting more from a korean horror if its going to be viewed in the same caliber as a tale of two sisters as some other reviews have stated this movie isnt in the same caliber except in budget spent on special effects think amytiville horror with a tree and sparse dialoguebr br if youre going to have a movie with limited dialogue the plot line and characters have to carry the film this film could have been told quite well in a 30 minute short film concept 2 hours with a lot of staring at trees and terror scenes that make you not only not scared but detract in a what the sort of way does not a good horror movie makebr br those people who are stating that this film gave them lasting impressions must literally have heart attacks when decent horror films lay it in
