having just watched acacia i find that i have to agree with the negative reviews here i like asian and korean horror and i had great expectations for this film man was i disappointed watching this i kept thinking surely they just do this to catch me off guard later on and for a while i expected something ingenious to happen however i slowly realised that the film really is that bad it is the cheapest cash in into the asian horror market i have seen so far br br the basic story is perhaps not even that bad but the way it is filmed it seems like the most laughable plot ever the tree as a scary device might be okay if used cleverly but all the filmmaker does is giving us different shots ofyes a tree over and over again he seems to hope that the tree will do all the work for him in terms of tension and buildup but it just feels like what it is shots of a tree for goodness sakebr br slow buildups can be very effective and a film that presents the viewer with only few glimpses of what is wrong might deliver good scares but not acacia sure we get a glimpse of a child on a tricycle disappearing around a corner and yet again meaningful shots of the tree from above or underneath or the side but these scenes are just not scary they feel silly especially because you realise that the director means them to be scary they simply arent br br apart from that i agree with some of the other reviewers that the characters are ridiculous in particular the one characters descent into madness is laughable however what really breaks acacia is the terrible editing its hard to see why scenes were cut together the way they are but its bad and it kills any spark of interrest it might have had it also makes me feel patronised because i can see what they are trying to achieve with it but i cannot believe that they think i would fall for such cheap ploysbr br there are lots of great asian ghost films and lots of bad ones but this is by far the worst i have seen they must have been going through the list of what to put into ghost movies and ticked them all off but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie
