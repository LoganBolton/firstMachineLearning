maybe its because i read peter straubs wonderful book before seeing the film but i was terribly disappointed by this movie in my opinion the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique and replaced it with more common hollywoodstyle elementsbr br its too bad too since this movie has a terrific cast particularly fred astaire douglas fairbanks jr melvyn douglas john houseman and the thenlargelyunknown alice krige theyre just not given very much worthwhile to dobr br in fact i was all for leaving halfway through but a friend convinced me to stay to the end as he was sure it had to get better he apologised to me during the closing credits
