this film gives new meaning to the term uneven giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few wellplaced stingers to deliver the majority of the thrillsbr br the plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparation that causes death she also may be seducing their sonsbr br it is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film but unfortunately theyre not very convincing particularly the scene where melvyn douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him its no shock then that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible especially the giggling ricky they deliver the worst geearentwealldrunk scene ive ever watchedbr br the movie has a few saving graces namely dick smiths great ghost makeups however misplaced they are in this film and alice kriges fascinating performance as almaeva ive never read the novel that this film was taken from but i intend to after reading some of the other reviews on this page you dont have to have read the book however to realize that this is only a shadow of the original tale there is a good story here but it seems lost somewhere amid exposition that shows the men having nightmares over and over again and making unsubtle references to the secret they all share br br as it stands it appears as if there was about half an hour of footage removed from this print particularly near the climax after allhow is it that fred astaire manages to mount an excavation of the pond so quickly what did gregory bate and the kid have to do with eva and while were at itwhat the hell was she anyway why did letting her out of the car cause the apparition to disappear if it was an apparition how could it have sex with two men and have them not knowbr br these and other questions will never be answered at least not by this film unless some restored footage is discovered somewhere it will probably forever remain a curiosity with some oozing makeup bizarre sex scenes and nudity and a few attractive performances
