the other boleyn girl  not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon this movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation i could understand them changing or elaborating on a few things the book is not perfection but it was wellwritten and became very popular i could understand if the bbc wanted to make this a little more faithful to what actually happened who anne boleyn really was  but its not even close to being historically accurate either its just fluff mindless madeup fluff a real shamebr br to begin with the writer and director seemed to think it was a good idea to setup the story like it was a reality tv show seriously they have the boleyns sitting in front of the camera confessing how they really feel about whats happening in their lives anne boleyn sits in a confessional not the church kind the real world kind and chooses what she wants to tell and what she wants to just sit and smile about she looks stupid having to use such a modern cinematic device in a film set in the 1500s its the real world tudor england br br jodhi may is a very good actress and after the aristocrats and a turn of the screw i was becoming a real fan of hers but she should never have been cast as anne actually i think she would have been a better mary natascha mcelhone was a poor choice shes a good actress sure but she has very modern features and does not appear convincing in period costume honestly i spent the first half of the film trying to figure out if she was that girl from the truman show she was shes also too old to play the teenaged mary so for some unknown reason they made mary the oldest of the sisters it makes no sense i know its like the bbc seemed to forget that these people actually lived theyre twisting the story around and making things up left and right i feel ridiculous having to correct the bbc on historical inaccuracies but really br br apart from the two sisters the rest of the cast was actually very well chosen steven mackintosh struck me as a brilliant choice for george and his casting was the real reason i decided to seek out this movie big mistake he does a great job sure but hes hardly in this how can anyone pretend theyre adapting the other boleyn girl and hardly mention george boleyn thats just absurd philip glenister was another very good casting decision but yet again was hardly in the finished product br br the real problem with this is the script theres just no getting around that its bad its really really bad its too melodramatic and not engaging anne is portrayed as an airhead mary as the ringleader and george as the follower marys first husband is hardly mentioned her relationship with the king is never explained  they simply do not tell the story phillippa gregory wrote the whole thing comes across as a great big waste i have no desire to see this thing a second time i guess ill just have to read the book again and hope that the natalie portman version due out next year will be much betterbr br note as of this writing the only way of obtaining this miniseries in the usa is on the last disc of the miniseries the six wives of henry viii thats a great miniseries but can cost 50 to 60 and thats way to much to spend if youre just looking for this piece of garbage
