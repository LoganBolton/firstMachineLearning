this movie was included in the six wives of henry viii bbc miniseries dvd i loved those six movies they were wellacted wellscripted and historically accurate i did actually read gregorys book and liked it well enough despite its huge historical inaccuracies i mean the whole fake homosexual angle with george boleyn in particular but this movie didnt even mention that that angle was one of the pivotal points of the book br br above all this movie just leaves me asking why why do we see as someone else aptly put the real world tudor england why are the camera angles so bad in general br br why is the script so bad i mean i know it was improv but come on the actors at time stutter and stammer over their lines and its obvious that theyre making them up as they go alongbr br why are the sex scenes so awkward the way they were done in the book made them at least somewhat interesting in the movie theyre just bad verging on being absolutely hilarious at one point the actress playing mary boleyn was having sex with the actor playing henry viii hes thrusting away and shes got this look on her face that says hmi need to go to the store is he done yet maybe if he finishes i can go pick up some cheese real quick its just badbr br why does catherine of aragon play such a small role in this movie her refusal to get a divorce was one of the leading causes for the scandal that rocked christiandom shes the reason why henry viii and anne boleyn couldnt get immediately married why is she not present here over all this movie is just bad
