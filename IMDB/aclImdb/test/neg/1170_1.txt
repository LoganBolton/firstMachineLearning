the title tells it all  ed gein the butcher of plainfieldbr br its not a zappy actionfilled slasher movie made for teens high on energy drinks that would fit it into a wellestablished genre the kind that some people find entertaining something along the lines of halloween or the texas chain saw massacrebr br this is dark slow filled with choppedup corpses and quietly evil there are few shock cuts no monsters pointofview shots no loud electronic score i dont know who its aimed at  ghouls maybebr br beneath the credits we already see still photos of skulls carcasses hung up skins draped across the backs of chairs that sort of thing and theyre sufficiently revolting that i couldnt help thinking this movie had better be pretty good to make up for this grand guignol openingbr br alas its not the acting is uniformly terrible as in a high school play the script does its best to sink below vulgarity ed gein who killed only two middleaged women and maybe his brother chases a screaming bloody young woman through the woodland of weir and shes wearing only a modern bra and bikini rather than period underwear gein also decapitates a night watchman which he never did in any historical sensebr br the direction you could do a better job in the first few minutes law officers discover an abandoned car with blood spattered all over the windshield there is no body the handsome young deputy sheriff turns to his boss and suggests they search for the victim who may still be in the vicinity and living the sheriff lacking any motivation shouts at him now you just forget that i dont want you going off half cocked on anything it should be no more than a businesslike exchange of views why does the director have the sheriff so angry characters of diverse sorts listen to radio programs or records that play old jazzy pop songs  louis armstrongs aint misbehaving for instance this is  what  rural wisconsin in the 1950s and the characters insist on music that would appeal to customers of the cotton club in harlem in the 30s or new york intellectuals like woody allen nope the radio would be playing kitty kallens wheel of fortune or theresa brewer or equally likely lefty frizell not that the dysfunction between the music and the events adds anything to our understanding of whats going on beneath the images someone involved in the production just liked old jazzy pop songs thats allbr br of course theres only so much you can do with a low budget but it can be light years ahead of this butchery see ed gein with steven railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this lunatic and his penchant for dead bodies and on a budget that couldnt have exceeded this one by muchbr br these comments are all based on the first twenty minutes of the movie thats about as far as i could get if anyone finds this tale to be wellexecuted and fascinating in any way he should try to find some insight into his tastes its beneath mine  and i consider myself pretty warped
