this movie twists the facts of anne and marys lives into something unrecognizable to make mary boleyn who in fact was a rather dim and foolish creature and make her the good sister is just silly it is anne who was in fact the far more interesting character and that is why it is her life and not marys that has been told so oftenbr br in response to an earlier review i fail to see how annes life was so criminal to me its henry who was the real criminal whatever annes motives for winning the king and withholding her affections in order to gain a crown and husband has to be taken into context of the time in which these reallife events took place anne in comparison to the majority of most of the courtiers in her time was a relatively innocent figure most modern historians discount or have disproven most of the myths and slanders that this movie perpetuate about her and i have never heard of anyone who actually believes the rumour than she slept with her brother this movie is so sensational and false that it is maddening to think that someone without knowing anything about this period in history could walk away believing anything this movie has presented as factbr br i wont even get into the weird filming of the movie but im pretty sure that cameras werent invented in the 16th century so i dont understand why anne and mary are talking to one throughout the movie its a really bad plot devise and is jarring and annoying to put it mildlybr br anne of the thousand days is not accurate either but is infinitely more entertaining and at least comes closer to telling the story of one of the most intriguing women of history dont even think about renting this its two hours youll never get back
