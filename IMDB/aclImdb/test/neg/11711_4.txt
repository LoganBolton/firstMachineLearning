i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about tudor englandbr br the writing directing and editing of this tv movie for the most part was truly awful i felt as if i was watching a really bad drama doc about the period rater then a moviebr br first there were too many cuts between important parts and leaving out important events which happened at the time one is henrys fall out with rome over his desire to divorce katherine of aragon which led to englands breaking away from rome and establishing her own church they barely stuck to the book at all im all for creative freedom but to a limit especially when your dealing with a well written book as your starter point in the book mary gives birth to young catherine first and then she has young henry is born both their father is henrys the eight in the movie they show harrys first then catherine and suggest that catherine father is william careybr br there are too many bad moments in the movie to write them allbr br i will however say that jodhi may and natascha mcelhone portrayal as the boleyn sisters was probably the best part of the moviebr br if you havent read the book and know nothing about hennrys the 8 court i will recommend to stay away from this movie and for those who read the book the movie will annoy you for its lack of details and important plots
