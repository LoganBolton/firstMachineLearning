i saw this film for one reason the tagline is upset the headÂ… and youre dead cracking its not surprising that this silly horror comedy runs out of steam before the tape is out of the box but it wrings a few laughs from its oddball premise and cast of characters an eagleeyed human radar a huge strongman and a bigbreasted sexual magnet are all mindcontrolled by a huge head in a chair whos not happy about his family being blackmailed by a murderous scumbag this looks like being a promising mixture of ham and cheese before it becomes clear that the characters are one joke wonders and the plot is pretty ordinary if you erm ignore the giant head
