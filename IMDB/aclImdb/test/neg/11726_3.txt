awful in a whole new way anything but love probably should be seen by movie buffsif only as a cautionary measure that proves all that can go wrong with a vanity production i am guessing a vanity production since there is no other reason on gods green earth to cast as talentfree and not particularly attractive nonsingeractress as isabel gold in the leading lady rolevied for yet by the likes of lookers like cameron bancroft and andrew mccarthyexcept that she also helped write this bizarre little movie her singing leaves much to be desired and yet unbelievable as it is all the other characters in the film think shes terrific there are a few moments here of actual charm or humor but very few otherwise this is a silly sad fiasco that veers from paintbynumbers to paintbywrongnumbers you know how it is when people look at a piece of modern art and someone says my kid could do better than that well this is a movie the likes of which youror anyoneskid might do better
