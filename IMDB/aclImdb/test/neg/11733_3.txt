honestly how hard can it be to make a good remake obviously pretty hard i was soooo excited to see this because i loved the original and my friends go and see it and tell me it really sucks well i finally see it and i was sooo disapointed ok the shower scene was more realisticthats why i gave it a 3 otherwise it did suck vince vaughn does a terrible job playing norman hes just too dense or something i dont know it was just terrible dont see it
