normanally i dont mind remakes there are some pretty good ones out there but this one is a stinker considering it was practically scene for scene it had a good story and great actors van sant copied als direction virtually flawlessly and it added color im not one of those who think it has to be bw to be classic it should have been at least a mediocre movie but it was peepee caacaa i dont understand how it could have been screwed up so badly if you must watch it as a curiosity but i would suggest that you not bother
