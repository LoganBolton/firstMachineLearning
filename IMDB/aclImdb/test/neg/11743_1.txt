a horrendous film illconceived and crude the acting of anne heche and vince vaughan is so inferior to that of perkins and leigh in the original version they have to be seen to be believed there was no reason to make this picture which only highlights how accomplished and brilliant hitchcock was and how inimitable also theres a creeping pervasive insensitivity in the film that isnt there in the first film hitchcocks psycho was scary and shocking but one could genuinely feel for all concerned even the pitiful norman bates there were moments of pathos irony and fey humor the remake doesnt have one of the best things about hitchcocks film was its incredible and intuitive depth and sense of nuance of when to cut away and when to show something on whether to use a closeup or long shot on whether to make an actor sympathetic and when to make him frightening and so forth the remake has none of these qualities and doesnt even try for them its an idiotic exercise that im amazed even got released
