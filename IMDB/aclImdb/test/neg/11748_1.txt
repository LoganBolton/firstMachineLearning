first of allthe whole idea of remaking a classic such as psycho is nothing short of ludicrousa lot of time and effort was wasted herei am sure they are smart enough to know that they could not improve on the originalso they must have had a tribute to alfred hitchcock on their mindshoweverthe idea that began as a well intentioned tribute results in being a slap in the face to the horror masterthis movie is poorly producedpoorly actedand unnecessary to begin withthe original classic stands well on its owneven after 40 yearsthe event of hitch returning from the grave and coming after the people responsible for this piece of trash is unlikelybut if i were themi would sleep with one eye open just in casedont waste your time
