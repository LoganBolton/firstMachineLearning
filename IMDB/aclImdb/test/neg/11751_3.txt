well i have to agree with the critics on this one who all said leave it alone why they had to make this remake of the 1960 psycho i dont know my guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modernday actors were the answer since those were the main changes the dialog was the same and the story the samebr br on one hand i applaud them for not making this over with a lot of profanity and nudity and making it a sleazy film yet if they were going to keep everything the same why bother when you werent going to improve on tony perkins janet leigh and the original castbr br did they honestly think vince vaughn was going to be as good or better than perkins are you kidding ann heche with her short mannishhaircut is going to be better than leigh i dont think sobr br yes the colors were pretty in here but its the blackandwhite photography that helped make the 1960 version so creepy to begin with its perfect for the story not a bunch of greens and pinks once again i guess the filmmakers were banking on an audience that never saw the originalbr br this was just a stupid project that never should have gotten off the ground
