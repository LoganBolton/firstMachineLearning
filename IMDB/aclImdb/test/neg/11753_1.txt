hitchcocks original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of but also the look of anthony perkins he projected a kind of cleancut innocence a young teenidol type of persona he was not an actor who had portrayed baddies before this nor was he physically suited to the role of what the public might have imagined a psychopath to look like especially in the 50s when this ultrachilling aspect of mental illness split personality psychosis was relatively unexplored in film which is exactly why the casting of him as norman bates was a slice of true hitchcockian genius audiences were taken by surprise to put it mildlybr br thats why this remake does not work even a little bit in spite of trying to be an exact copy whereas anthony perkins looked like someone you would never think of as being a serial killer vince vaughn is easily imaginable as one he lacks the frail look of perkins and his acting chops are clearly inferior as well at least in this role honestly  has there ever been an actor who could convey nervousness as genuinely as anthony perkins while it was a pointless remake to begin with the miscasting of the storys most important character sucks this film down completelybr br as a side note i feel that hollywoods propensity for remaking great movies because young people refuse to watch anything thats not filmed in color not only stinks to high heaven of corporate greed but is exceptionally disrespectful to the original work as for viewers who cant watch black and white  its their loss hopefully theyll mature sometime in the future and no longer require shiny colours to hold their attention when they do theyll discover that sometimes black and white works far better with the background muted the story and performances are that much more front and center and in many cases the mood or atmosphere created through black and white cinematography is just not attainable in colour
