i know curiosity killed the cat but i simply had to see the remake of psycho especially after being on such a hitchcok journey recently and knowing his work ive watched the original psycho though since i was a kid i knew how to respect it and not only that it was an excellent movie one of the best in fact the first thing i said when i heard about the remake was how do you remake perfection i stuck to that as well but i think i have a more open mind now and figured maybe it was a way of introducing psycho to a new generationbr br but this turned into a total insult and slap to the face of the original psycho i know this has been said but i watched the making of this film and the director was like oh i just want to update it and shoot each scene shot by shot like the original whats the friggin point ok but i want to judge this movie on its own despite its insulting blows the original i mean the acting wasnt up to par but honestly it looked like the actors just watched the original and just memorized the lines from there and made it their crappy ownbr br watching the making of this film i wanted to slap anne hasche she said ive never seen the original i just wanted to work with gus ooh that made me angry because frankly its not just that she really sucked in this role as marian she wasnt convincing not to mention her shower scene really was horrible vince vaughn didnt make lets just put it this way the film was horribly miscasted this was a sin against film and on its own this was actually a bad movie it was too much and destroyed what couldve been a new introduction for a new generation but to gus leave the film making the ones who know what theyre doingbr br 110
