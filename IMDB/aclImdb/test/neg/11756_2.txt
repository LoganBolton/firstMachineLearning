this is per se an above average film but why in the name of bog was it made its impossible to treat it as a thing unto itself because it is an almost shotforshot remake of an alfred hitchcock classic of 1960 you cant watch it without the 1960 film nudging into your consciousnessbr br what does the word credit mean how can we credit van sandt and his associates with anything except deciding to use different actors slightly different sets and colorbr br anne heche is attractive but lacks janet leighs stolid determination to become a respectable middleclass woman and heche is younger than leigh who brought to her fruitless attempt to marry and settle down the desperation of a woman facing forty and heche doesnt project anxiety the way leigh did the scene with the chp officer looking in her car window illustrates the weakness in the role in the original the officer asks is there something wrong leigh of course not am i acting as if something were wrong the officer hesitates before replying well frankly yes that exchange is omitted from the remake for the simple reason that heche isnt nervous enoughbr br the worst change without a doubt is the substitution of vince vaughn for anthony perkins it may not be vaughns fault who could match perkins in the role perkins is twitchy birdlike longnecked cloaked in an externally charming exterior that masks an inner vacuum his every move eating candy corn with his adams apple bobbing and every utterance the faint laugh the arid chuckle is spot on he just cant be improved upon vaughn brings to the role the presence of a shorthaired beefy guy who was just discharged as a lance corporal from the u s army to suggest his psychosis all he can do is superimpose a maniacal giggle on top of what appears otherwise a perfectly normal norman in speech and manner unlike the original norman vaughn doesnt even stumble over the word fallacy because it resembles phallus he could be just hanging around the motel waiting to hear about his application for a football scholarship to uclabr br the direction deserves a few comments i dont see what it adds to the story when we see norman masturbating while peeping in on anne heche i dont object to it i wonder why its there just as i wonder why the rest of the movie is therebr br and i suppose in order to impress us with how much color adds to the visual experience van sant seems to have missed a bit of hitchcocks more subtle stuff heche is given underwear of all different colors  green pink orange and  mango is that a color if so what the hell color is it never mind the point is that in the original when the traveling camera first peeks through the window of the phoenix hotel it captures janet leigh in bed wearing a pure white half slip and a white bra later after she has stolen the money we see her in her underwear again  this time both her slip and bra are black tis a small thing but hitchs ownbr br at that the idea of shooting in color might not have been bad except that the blackandwhite shooting of the original was superb the color and odd lighting effects in this version turn the ordinary dull and subliminally ominous motel into something that looks like it belongs in the seedier part of las vegasbr br most of all the 1960 film was shocking in more ways than one i can remember seeing it in a drivein in san diego and staring aghast at the screen when it became clear that the central character was actually dead  halfway through the movie nothing like it had ever been done beforebr br that murder in the shower in both movies was a big improvement over robert blochs original novel by the way in which the author writes something like the murderer then entered the bathroom and cut off her head with a knife im not making that up well not entirely even here van sants movie gives us excess there is more blood and more bare flesh and where hitchcock closed in first on the blood circling the bathtub drain and dissolved to marians blankly open eye then pulled the camera back slowly to reveal her face he rotated his camera from a slight tilt to the proper vertical giving the viewer a sense of not just disbelief at the murder but a dizzying disbelief van sant doesnt tilt his camera a delicate 10 or 20 degrees as hitchcock did he practically twirls it on its axisbr br it wont do to call this a bow to hitchcock because its not its a pecuniary plundering of hitchcocks material already ripped off in psycho i ii iii iv and psycho the beginning years and come into my parlor mrs bates revenge and hand me that knife would you the true story of norman bates a rehashing of and grinding away at truly original stuff a crumenal act if not a criminal one and thats not to mention the many homages in other films especially the french such as the notorious ocean of boredom scenes between marcel brulee and jeanne gateau in the muchadmired la mere de la nuit maybe id better add that that last sentence is a terrible attempt at a parody of academic critics and when a chickens guts grind corn its a crumenal act i wont go on except to say these gags shabby as they are are more fun than the moviebr br so who was it made for id have to guess kids who are too young to know about the original and who dont like movies in black and white kids who are hoping to see another ordinary slasher movie chimpanzees
