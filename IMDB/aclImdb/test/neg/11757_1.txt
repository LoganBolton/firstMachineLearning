yes why among the filmmakers that came out in the 80s and 90s gus van sant is one of my idols there are others a few steven sodebergh pt anderson tim hunter danny boyle martin donovan harmony korine wes anderson idiosyncratic infuriating some times but consistent surprising unpredictable their names make me switch on the tv go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater van sants psycho however gives me pause why i wonder a shot by shot massacre of one of the perennial classics the color was jarring the performances atrocious what was vince vaughn doing was it a parody a bad joke what the hell was it anne heche as janet leigh who dressed her viggo mortensen with a cowboy hat viggo is a superb actor but in this case he couldnt make us forget john gavin and if julianne moore had been introduced to the world through this performance there wouldnt have been any the hours for her the minutes maybe so here i am bad mouthing the work of one of my idols the crashing question remains why mr van sant maybe in the words of president clinton because he could im afraid thats no excuse
