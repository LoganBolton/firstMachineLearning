this movie really starts strong we know that roberts is an atlanta hotshot sent to australia to fix cokes marketing problems we also know he is an eccentric genius roberts fine acting convinces us of this rather quicklybr br unfortunately the plot is so flimsy that whatever fine character development has been achieved it is negated by voids inconsistencies and downright boring film sequencesbr br usually i am a sucker for bold and far out plots examples which i am fond of include dark star oc  stiggs and popeye coupled with the fact that i must admit that this film was well acted it surprises even myself that i cannot recommend this filmbr br the utter breakdown in this movie occurs about midway through the film all comedy is instantly lost and the film turns dark afterwards the film plods along the films attempt to get the comedy rolling again is not successful more surprises await the viewer and they are darker stillbr br to be sure mixing drama with comedy can be a formula for success however with this movie the result is about as successful as new coke
