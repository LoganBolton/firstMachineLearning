che is a bad movie and deserves it reputation as an unintentionally funny film it takes a serious subject and presents it like the cliff notes version or classic comics because there isnt much emotion or a proper narrativejust episodic segments stitched together with mostly stupid true stories relayed by a variety of yutzesbr br this is a deservedly derided film as it is poorly written and acted however what i have found most interesting about the film is its apparent gay subtext instead of che guevarra and fidel castro working towards a communist cuba they seem to be more of a gay couplewith che behaving coy and aloof and fidel as the ardent suitor again and again the film abounds with great lines such as when fidel implores che cuba needs youi need you i am not sure if the studio intended this homosexual undercurrent but it doesnt take a brain surgeon to recognize it i am very surprised that the other reviewers didnt point this out however if you remember this when you watch the film it makes viewing much more exciting and even funnierbr br a final note in recent years che has been very chiceven a fashion statement with hoards of braindead teens who have no idea who he was wearing shirts emblazoned with his face considering he was a coldblooded killer and nihilist an odd combination for a doctor this new reverence for the man is gross what will they do next put hitler or dr mengele on tshirts and posters even communists with consciences should be appalled by the bloodshed guevara was responsible for and i find it ironic that people with computers are championing a man who might likely have killed them given half a chance br br considering how stupid and unintentionally funny this movie was it does nothing to further the message that guevara was no hero i would love to see a realistic film done of his lifewith the good and the bad but also with dialog and a plot that werent apparently created by chimps
