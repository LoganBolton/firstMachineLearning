this movie is essentially a howto on how to be a wellconnected pedophile im amazed that so many people especially other gay men have seen this movie and read the book and no one has brought up the fact that if weber was not an influential photographer he would be in jail doing time for child abuse poor peter johnson weber took this poor naive although incredibly handsome teenager whom he found at a training camp for high school wrestlers in the midwest brought him to live in his home and took thousands of homoerotic photos of him many of them fullfrontal nudes all through johnsons teenage years that aint art its child abuse and whats worse weber made lots of money off of it and poor johnson is going to have serious issues the rest of his life webers lecherous love of the boy is downright creepy as are his ramblings about famous and not so famous people hes known as he tries to complete johnsons education creepy and then just plain boring the only redeeming thing i can say about the movie is that it is a fascinating study of selfdeception but i cant help but wonder why no one ever considered the effect this was having on chop suey webers nickname for johnson himself
