if you can stomach the campiness this movie should make you laugh out loud several times it did for me at least ill only mention one of my favorite elements the underwater shots of the fish swimming the sound which accompanies those shots is great toobr br one last note william katt is actually a pretty decent actor i hope he gets another day in the sun watching him as the greatest american hero was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago and he hasnt been very visible since he seemed kind of depressed in this movie somebody give him a fun job on a good show or something
