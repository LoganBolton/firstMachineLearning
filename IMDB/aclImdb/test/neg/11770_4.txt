i guess my biggest mistake was to watch this remake of 95 piranha backtoback with joe dantes 78 original i did the same last week with the omen curiously enough watching the remake right after the 76 original really made me appreciate the 2006 version quite a bit for various reasonsbr br but this approach sort of backfired on the 95 piranha version it enhanced the fact that it really is a lesser picture basically the 95 version is more or less the exact same film as it tells the same story and follows it practically scenebyscene only barabara steeles character and the military intervention were written out of it but the cinematography wasnt as good the acting was worse too especially alexandra paul playing heather menzies character showed me again what a horrible actress she is bradford dillman from the 78 version had his charlton heston way of acting going which was amusing while in the 95 version william katt does a good job at being william katt so i didnt mind him really but the whole cast is pretty much inferior and the only worthwhile event was spotting james karen return of the living dead parts 1  2 in a cameo john carl buechlers makeup effects arent as neat as rob bottins the musical score had some ring to it but pino donaggios score was much more memorable in the original so all these shortcomings really shone through with having just rewatched the original as part of this double billbr br since scott p levys remake does follow dantes original i guess it is entertaining enough to sit through though its lacking the wit dantes original had but what really made me not like levys version very much is the fact that quite a bit of stock footage from the first film was reused during the piranha attack scenes i never like it when filmmakers do this and im not talking about using footage for flashbacks or other valid reasons i mean if you dont have the budget or imagination to come up with newly shot material then for petes sake dont do a frickin remake but roger corman produced this cheaper remake so i guess i shouldnt be all that surprised about the reuse of footagebr br if you do decide to watch piranha then make sure its been a while since youve seen the original you might enjoy this remake a little more then and oh yes that cool little stopmotion creature from the original is nowhere to be found in this film as to be expected but whats worse there also isnt any female nudity in this one the original really had quite some tittyshots going for it and that blonde girl from the openingscene even accidentally pulled her underwear a bit down too far when removing her jeans figures as this 95 version was made for tv
