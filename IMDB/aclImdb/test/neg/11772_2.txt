its not often i give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre a movie can be bad in that it isnt a masterpiece but can be enjoyable on the basis of unintentional humour bizarre characters etc a case in point are a great number of horrorscifiction movies from the 1940s to 1980s era they are enjoyable for genrebuffs and guiltypleasure seekers because their badness is entertaining however this movie has none of the humour or effective gory scenes of the piranha 1978 original br br i suppose in 1995 it was the heyday of political correctness so gore on tv was at a minimum now in the mid2000s with the csi shows tvs an absolute bloodfest good for us horror fansbr br william katt and alexandra paul are no bradford dillman and heather menzies the original 1978 stars its not katts and pauls faults but the writers and director who created this tepid turkey how the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie i wont say how because that is part of the plot br br this tv movie probably had a bigger budget than the original but flopped as good horror as can be seen from the user votes here stick with the 1978 original if youre in the mood for a killerfish movie
