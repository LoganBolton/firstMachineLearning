i saw this one at sundance and i cant figure out why it won the directing award it was painfully slow and literally colorless its the type of movie that is only appreciated by film fest snobs who think any movie that a lot of people like must be beneath thembr br the jury at sundance this year seemed to be making a conscious effort to reward the underdog ultralowbudget films thats all well and good but this wandering dragging mess looks like a home movie minidv shot in a snowcovered gray winter results in a drab look for a drab moviebr br certain motifs snakes are beaten to death in spite of the fact that they add nothing to the story and make no sense as symbolsbr br now it wasnt all bad vera farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem she will be going places and she deserves it her costar hugh dillon also does a fine job frankly there are many fine moments in this movie but they just dont fit together very well
