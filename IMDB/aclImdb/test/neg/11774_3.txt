what is it about drug addiction that so draws firsttime filmmakers to offer their own take on the subject this subject has been done to death drug abuse is bad we get it drug addiction is painful to watch we get that too but the bleak subject matter doesnt give the filmmaker license to make a sloppy film every film need not be hitchcockian masterpiece of cinematic excellence or use orson wellesian deep focus but its still a narrative movie verite does not mean pseudodocumentary even consumer minidv cameras are capable of producing white whites and black blacks and this filmmaker is just being lazy by shooting no contrast scenes with existing lighting the subject is bleak enough without artificially forcing it with sloppy cinematography and even documentary films have a sound mix vera farmiga is very talented given the right material but the director obviously overdirected her and sucked all the life out of her performance addicts may live in a fog but they still have emotions but none of these characters seem to exist offscreen the supporting players merely delivered their lines without creating real people sorry to be so harsh debra but some things are true whether want to believe them or not im sure your next film will be better  but please not another drug movie
