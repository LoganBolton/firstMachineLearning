nothing to watch here its all been done and better before who cares about this woman  deficient in every way  as a mother as a wife and as a friend in one instant when she could have taken the high road  she jumped into readdiction with both feet and held her breath  for no better a reason than me too if she wasnt the pretty and young person she portrays on screen  but looked more like the real human wreckage that is represented by our family members neighbors and friends who really suffer from additions wed change channels in a nanosecondbr br this movie starts out at the bottom and goes downhill nothing redeeming no lessons taught  nothing uplifting in any way none of the main characters even evoke sympathy let alone empathy well maybe the snake i would have had more fun if id shut a door on my hand who needs drivel like this
