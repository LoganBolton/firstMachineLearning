i saw this movie when it was first released in 1986 at the time i was young and enjoyed all the normal comedy available ie monty python jim belushi  snl steve martin cheech  chong so i believe that my judgment represents most sane individualsbr br the absolute best part of this movie was the trailer played at the beginning of the movie for the new my little pony movie that was coming outbr br this movie was so atrocious that it was actually yanked from most theaters before the initial week run was completedbr br im surprised that anyone would waste there corporate money to duplicate this steaming pile of human wastebr br dont waste your time or money to rent or watch this movie
