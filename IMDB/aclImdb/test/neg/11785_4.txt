i think walter pidgeon was badly miscast in this film just not believable in the role barbara eden was beautiful and acted her part well enough no one else was at all memorable br br i remember the tv series spun off from this movie when i was a small child i even think i had a plastic seaview that would submerse and was great for playing with in the bathtub long time agobr br as for some of the other criticism ive read for this film its certainly unfair to judge special effects or science knowledge of 4 decades ago by todays standards the effects were ok for 1961 not great but ok as for the science that was ludicrous even for 1961 theres no excuse also the sub was awfully roomy i understand that the navy refused any help at all for this film so maybe the filmmakers just had no ideabr br overall the film bored me and im a scifi fan cant recommend this one grade d
