its hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoonlike epic that for some reason has become a cult classic it certainly cant be because of the totally artificial look of the set designs or the limpid acting of an allstar cast these days its shown much too frequently on fox movie channel or amcbr br it pains me to report that veteran actors like walter pigeon and joan fontaine are even cast in this muddled science fiction travesty none of which rings true its like watching an expensive budget being spent on a saturday afternoon kiddie show full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialog its a comic book version of the jules verne novelbr br the maturing fontaine was still attractive but wears a pained expression on her face perhaps regretting that she had accepted the role of the psychiatrist before reading the script she contributes absolutely nothing to her cardboard role but an imperial and uncomfortable presence and looks totally out of place most of the time faring no better are robert sterling barbara eden andmost of all peter lorreas well as frankie avalon who gets to sing the title tune whichits safe to saydid not become anyones favorite title tunebr br an awfully frustrating experience to sit through a film like this which wastes an attractive cast and is an insult to almost anyones intelligence totally unconvincing from start to finish the film as well as the fantastic submarine sinks to the bottom of the sea long before the fight with a rubber octopus brings the film to a dreary conclusion
