i suppose for 1961 this film was supposed to be  cool   but looking back now  45 years  its charm was just as silly as its entertainment value  granted  the special effects do well on tv with the series that started in 1964  but for the big screen  i once had a fish tank that was equally as exciting  i must agree about the octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the seaview obviously not well stagedor trained  overall  its pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and i still do recommend it  for fun laughs sake this was probably one of irwin allens biggest films and i think he thought a lot of it  barabara eden went on to play  genie  on tv micheal ansara was her husband  now that is a cool part about this film  i always enjoyed seeing real life husband and wife teams star in the same movie  neat
