this film is a good companion to blair witch because it does so much wrong that bw did right like bw this one pretends to be a documentary of ghostly events with each member of the team manning hisher own camera br br the sense of reality is never there however the participants are poorly written clichéd characters and the events that take place are equally clichéd the cat jumping out of a closet falling chandelier etc also the stilted dialog and inept improv work by the overlyattractive cast detracts from the docu feel and worst of all the supposedly participantheld cameras record too many events too perfectly to be even remotely believable actually with some reediting this thing could have been a blair witch parody in fact there is a scene in which the blond historian is eating a sandwich with a huge roach on it that is actually pretty funny as is reminding me of a similar gross out scene from austin powers the spy who shagged me but in the end the event is played straight with no punchline its hard to tell what the intent was with the st francisville experiment other than to glom a few stray bw bucks but its pretty sad when the only real interest i could find in it was whether the blond historian was going to have her tshirt tied up off her belly in a particular shot or not
