obviously someone was looking at catching onto the blair witch wavebr br this movie was set up like all the reality haunted shows that are popping up on tv lately and i must admit i get a kick out of these but this movie is much cheesier probably the first threequarters of the movie is filled with the participants going through the house whining give me a break spending 10 minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time any paranormal happenings are blatant setups no strings but too perfectly caught on camera to be real the participants were not very likeable either two goofy guys who dont take it seriously one girl who scares at the drop of a hat and the quintessential overplayed paranormal person is this becoming the clich√©dformula for a ghost moviebr br i have to admit the last 15 minutes or so were pure tension they took every ounce of tension in the movie and stuck it in those 15 minutes i admit i spent that time pacing in the kitchen i really wouldnt recommend this movie to younger viewers even if it is pg13br br if youre looking for some entertainment if you dont take it seriously you will get a kick out of this movie theres tons of situations to make cracks about if youre looking for an great storyline look elsewhere
