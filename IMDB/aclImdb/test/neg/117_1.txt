this flick is a waste of timei expect from an action movie to have more than 2 explosions and some shootingvan dammes acting is awful he never was much of an actor but here it is worsehe was definitely better in his earlier movies his screenplay part for the whole movie was probably not more than one page of stupid nonsense one linersthe whole dialog in the film is a disaster same as the plotthe title the shepherd makes no sense why didnt they just call it border patrol the fighting scenes could have been better but either they werent able to afford it or the fighting choreographer was suffering from lack of ideasthis is a cheap low type of action cinema
