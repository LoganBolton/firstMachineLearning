i rented this one by accident i lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought shameless blair witch ripoff then in a moment of carelessness i grabbed the francisville experiment thinking it was something else my horror upon arriving home and realizing my mistake was far more terrifying than anything this film had to offer boring characters bad acting and a feeling of we saw the blair witch project and could do the same permeate the action to the point where watching on fast forward will lead you straight to the credits im not one to fault film makers for being lazy or desperate but after this yawnfest i felt the need to warn everyone dont waste your time you have a life
