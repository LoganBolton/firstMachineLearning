the characters are annoying immature and flakymadison being the most annoying of all ooha cold spot such a dire threat any ghost in that house would have fled in selfdefense to make a long story short this movie is boring seeing a chair flying across a room may be creepy but thats about as intriguing as it gets i watched it once and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again i was tempted to take a baseball bat to the tv set rather than watch this rubbish again if you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy this isnt it the only good part of the whole thing was the roach scene and by the end of the movie you ended up feeling sorry for the roach
