i just saw this movie and all i can say is where are the drive ins these days this seems like it would have been a great 2nd feature at a drive in in 1977 maybe playing with one of those joan collins movies but its only worth watching now if youre feeling nostalgic for the 70s silly plot that is full of holes but it does remind one of the era it was made in interesting to see melanie griffith so young and anne lockhart is quite attractive though not much of an actress in fact there is not much acting going on in this movie at all its sort of a dukes of hazzard adventure without a twang or a 1969 dodge charger jumping over stuff in the woods but there is a mecrury comet jumping over a garbage dump in this one
