a prenerd robert carradine a preautoman desi arnaz jr and an almost prepubescent melanie griffith take to the road and head for alaska with romantic dreams of becoming wealthy salmon fishers well their dream is about as exciting as this lackluster youth road movie they arent particularly interesting and the film doesnt exactly have much of a point beyond we got together the spawn of some famous people and made a low budget film about their misadventures out of the cannon of 60s and 70s road films and rebel youth films this one is mediocre under developed uninvolving characters not much wit not much freshness to the story which is as bland as the films muddy landscapebr br but for those who care they head to alaska and apparently alaska was like the wild west in the 70s because everyone carries a gun and is rough and tumble robert carradine says charming things like i hope we can find a shower my nuts sure itch and hes the one with melanie griffith they are quickly robbed and forced to take jobs and the local bigwig their employer puts the moves on melanie and eventually fires desi for not being corrupt thats when they arent smart and do not leave town opting instead to eat dog food or go hungry get beat up by the guys goons and then take a joyride in the bigwigs car the final half of the film abandons the evil bigwig as the trio commit a robbery go on the run and hatch a kidnapping scheme and so forth the film just sort of ends annoyingly and ambiguously but seeing as how they didnt bother to have much character development and story in the first place its rather appropriate worth a look if you are really into low budget 70s fare but ultimately pretty forgettable
