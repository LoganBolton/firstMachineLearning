what a waste of time to watch this movie poor picture quality poor sound poor acting and definitely not based on actual facts the deputys girlfriend did so much overacting as did the sheriff that it was more comedy than horror the deputy tries to make an emergency phone call by dialing 911problemin 1957 that emergency number was not in existence that is just one example of glaring inconsistenciesbr br the scary aspect was way underdone just did not come across as horrificbr br i did think that the actor playing gein did the most admirable acting job in the whole movie i could well see mental disturbances in his character portrayalbr br sorrythis one just does not get it
