ken burns baseball is a decent documentary it presents a clear origin of the game a great depiction of baseballs early years and heroes theres plenty in this movie for any baseball fan that said the film has several glaring flawsbr br 18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span its clear that burns stretched his film out to fit his nine inning concept its not even a tight 18 hours the pace on every segment is slow almost morose the music always nostalgic and wistful isnt baseball ever exciting and fun why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak yakking about baseball as a metaphor baseball as americana the psychology and theology of baseball enough this is syrupy mawkish drivel billy crystal is here to sell us all the yankee hokum hes sold us before ken burns uses the national anthem as the series theme song and manages to play take me out to the ballgame so many times you might vomit we get it dudebr br clearly burns is a neohollywood fauxliberal so he spends probably a third of the film on the negro leagues these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as openminded as kenny is today for shame he chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that america was segregated in those times burns falls head over heels in love with buck oneil a former negroleague player and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly oneil waxes poetic about his playing days nonsensebr br burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down baseball winds up as mushy gushy civilrights propaganda disguised as americana its clear that burns is not a baseball fan otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering not weeping and reciting soliloquies are you listening mr burns theres no crying in baseball
