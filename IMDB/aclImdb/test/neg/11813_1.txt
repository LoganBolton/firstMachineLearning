the worst part about this film is that it did not have to be so terriblebr br they had a nice budget though so do many films they made it look slick and pretty and best of all they had the 21st century lesbiansavvy audiences who would embrace a lesbian positive film and yet the writer and director went out of their way to lift every single redone film bit about lesbian torment and confusion at boarding schools you know the place all lesbian love lives and dies br br this is a theme that has been done again and again and again in film but something that viewersif one uses this voting forum as a clue cannot seem to get enough ofbr br every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through the lead characters say it all the crazy abandoned genius rebel lesbian tough girl well they took a super pretty femme like piper perabo and tried to rough her up but it didnt stick much seduces pretty rich girl who is destined to betray her br br watching them every step of the way is character 3 a dopey wellmeaning wideeyed good girl observer i say every step because she shares her every thought with the audience via the stiffest most inane monologuesbr br her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk hearing them make love with their noises was um you know like well okay she says about her 2 wanton roommates who roll around in the bed next to herbr br later she asks graham greene the accomplished native american actor who is completely wasted in a roll as a gardener  is it wrong to care what people thinkbr br sorry but is she a teenager or is she age 7br br granted piper perabo as polly the tortured dyke  others do an okay job for the horrible lines they are forced to utter perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera she would do well in a decent project so this is in no way a criticism of the actingbr br but this story is shameless in perpetuating every single stereotype about lesbians all rolled into one character they couldnt stop with her polly being an angry crazypassionate secret genius who finished math problems for the speechless teacher oh but thats after she argues with the teacher who dares accuse her of gabbingbr br thats a word they males use against us women she says stomping out of the classroombr br is this all the writer could come up with or maybe we should ask why stop there br br poole and co went on and made polly a poetic dark child who communicates with wild hawks by screaming their name in the woodsbr br cue the slow motion scifi xena atmospherebr br then we have her writing to her birth mother most lesbians are lovestarved orphans in case you were in the darkbr br then we have two teachers one uptight one a zany type with loose neck ties who hover around all of the action the school looks awfully big for just 2 teachers and give dark child seductressbird girl tense looks hmmmm i wonder if something well you know um funny is happening between these two teachersbr br there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done heartbreak happens but surely the writer and director know that lesbians exist in much more sophisticated times than this schlockbr br i cannot reveal the ending out of respect to those who force themselves to sit through til the end but if you are not laughing i can only guess you are crying and not for the right reason and i dont mean the wimpy make out scenes
