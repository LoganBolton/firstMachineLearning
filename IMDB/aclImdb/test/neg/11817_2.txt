this is one heck of a sleazy film like so many women in chains films this one is chock full of lesbianism however unlike most prior films which strongly implied this black mama white mama shows an awful lot of skin as a horny female prison guard leers at the women as they shower as well as has sex with one of the inmates for the early 1970s this is definitely a softcore pornographic filmsort of like girls gone wild goes to prison its also a bad ripoff of the defiant ones though in this case its two hot females who hate each other who are chained together when they escape whereas the original film is considered a classic this one can only be considered a classic example of bad taste thats because there is no subtlety and the movie is just cheapcheap thrills cheap writing and very cheap actingbr br pam grier is the black inmate with an attitudea lady who was set up and sent to prison on this hellish island margaret markov is a revolutionary when they escape they both cant stand each other and have opposite goals however since it is clich√©driven theres really no surprise in how the film endswith their both becoming gag me friends
