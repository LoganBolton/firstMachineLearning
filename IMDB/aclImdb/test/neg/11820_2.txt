some of the films produced by roger cormans new world film company in the 1970s represent the best kind of bmovie where the limitations of the genre actually act as a kind of freeing influence on the writers and directors  such classic drivein films as deathrace 2000 hollywood boulevard grand theft auto and caged heat emerged from this environment unfortunately his former confederates at american international pictures were running out of steam in the 1970s particularly in the absence of jim nicholson and they often produced second rate imitations of cormans films sometimes featuring his selfmade stars black mama white mama is one of those films its basically a cheaper imitation of the big doll house with some of the same stars doing a lot of the same things yes this is a john ashley coproduction yes the same john ashley who was the hilarious elvis wannabe in how to make a monster and paired up with debbie walley in beach blanket bingo with all the signature marks of his productions  womens prisons where everyone except maybe 2 or 3 lead characters including the inmates and the guards are filipino actors in mostly nonspeaking roles where we see supermodeltype women taking on the roles of revolutionary militants and where the primary joy of the film is derived through rudimentary sm exploitationbr br the print i saw most recently was horribly lightdamaged good ole will viharo described it as yellow mama yellow mama but i think even in the best conditions the photography and directing are extremely routine theres also very little visual value here corman must not have had very much to do with the film itself because he was always canny enough to at least give his films some extra production value by filming in free public spaces that would make the film look more impressive this film doesnt look impressive it doesnt have an impressive soundtrack and you just feel embarrassed for anyone who shows a shred of talent the only remotely interesting performances come from pam grier as a feisty whore out to escape the life filipino actor dindo fernando as her grotesquely selfindulgent pimp and sid haig as a cowboy styled mercenary the story places grier and costar margaret markov in a low budget female version of the defiant ones but does very little with the melodramatic possibilities afforded by that premise its basically just an excuse to ensure that the two protagonists can still stop for a good mud wrestling match while theyre trying to escape the prison together this is all in the spirit of good fun but the film ultimately fails even as exploitation because theres a certain edge and rawness that should be present in such scenes that is instead replaced under this directors hand with a kind of yawning predictabilitybr br so the film will have little value for fans of hardcore exploitation value  at least in the version i saw its no more explicit than faster pussycat kill kill from over a decade earlier and far less interesting visually and thematically for those who just enjoy getting a laugh out of so bad its good films this one might provide some fun but its not in the upper tier people would be more advised to seek out caged heat or some of the others that revel in their own brutality to the point that it becomes camp this one is more similar to less ambitious efforts like cirio santiagos the muthers sadly the best thing about this particular film is the title and the presence of pam grier who was better in other films around the same time particularly jack hills coffy this film perhaps illustrates a midway point in miss griers journey from corman secretary to bmovie queenforaday but other than its historical significance as such it will have little value even to griers big fans because she is given very little to work with herebr br worth skipping unless of course you get to see it in a movie theater with a lot of friends and a lot of beer like i did and even then its value is questionable
