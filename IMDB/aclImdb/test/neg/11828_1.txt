ah animorphs i loved the book series and eagerly devoured each one in middle school and when i heard that there was a television adaptation i was very excitedbr br boy what a let down the final product was i think for me this was the moment when nickelodeon stopped being about cool programming and more genericbr br so what was wrong with the series let me count the ways 1 the characters were horrifically miscast in the books the animorphs were somewhere between 1214 the television cast were at least 18 i remember being horrified when i first saw the cast photosbr br 2 horrific actingbad writing i dunno which was to blame so im lumping into the lumpy mass that it was perhaps it was the fact that the accelerated age of the cast hampered the humor that is at least cute coming out of a 13 year old because marco  not funny in fact i dont remember a single comical moment from the group and there were a few the actors were certainly not helped by the writing which was bland at its best and head smackingly pathetic at its worstbr br 3 my lord they were stingy with the budget the final result of the andalites alone should have convinced viacom to pull the plugtheir heads had clefts that clearly showed which was the helmetbr br 4 back to the cast  rachel by far was the biggest let down far from being the warrior woman in the books the best equivalent in the tv series was scarecrow also i know cassie was an idealist but there is a difference between idealist and idiotbr br 5 one of the worst opening titles ever did the music have to be that obvious 6 answering question 6 yes because everything else was dumbed down so why shouldnt the expectedly less intelligent viewers receive a thick as a brick song from a lame raprock ripoff or whatever the hell that wasbr br since then there have been bigger let downs iraq 2004 but in case i havent made myself clear  this show sucked and was an abomination to the book series it was supposed to be based from
