films about the mundane are often the most interesting of all films to me in the hands of an insightful artist who examines all the twisted little details of the mundane the french cinema seems to often be very good at this sort of thing and i love the french cinemabr br this film was about the mundane it didnt have a much of a plot it was just characters who lived in a town very normal people and stuff just happened but it wasnt very interesting stuff and it wasnt examined very insightfully the film did capture a bit of a mood but it wasnt a particularly captivating mood and while i cant think of much that the film did specifically wrong it failed on just about every level to do anything rightbr br there were a lot of characters in this film a lot of them kind of looked alike so it was hard to figure out who was who and what were their relations to one another i dont mind putting some effort into understanding a film or even watching an especially complex film more than one time to iron out the details but this one was a puzzle not worth the solving for mebr br the only good thing i can really say about this film is that the cinematography was pleasantfunctional not brilliant but pleasant the camera often captured some nice postcardtype shots but it rarely found the really interesting little detailsbr br ive seen a handful of notsogood films so far at the seattle international film festival but this was the only one that failed to get any applause when the credits rolled i sensed a big collective sigh of relief when the film was finally over but i suppose there are probably some people out there who would like itbr br 410
