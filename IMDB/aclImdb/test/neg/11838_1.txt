this movie doesnt even deserve a 110 this movie was a scambr br i swear that at least 30 minutes of the film were deliberetly copied from carnosaur 1 2  3the whole movie raptor was based of the movie and that was really a pathetic attempt to be a thriller action packed dinosaur copy i loved that movie series and seeing it be put on a movie that cant even afford or willing copy it without doing there own models is what america is coming toi recommend you see the carnosaur movie first all of them and then watch this and you will know what i meanbr br  spencer
