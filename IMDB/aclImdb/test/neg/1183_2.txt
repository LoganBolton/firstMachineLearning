may contain spoilersbr br i had very high expectations for this film based on the trailer i knew a bit about the real ed gein so i figured this was a mediumbudget hollywood version of the real events man was i wrongbr br first the writing apparently came from an eightgrader who barely knew anything about eds history and cranked out the script in about 20 minutes the movie completely passes over the most interesting facets of ed and his relationship with his mother not to mention what the real police found in his house and decides to focus primarily on the young deputy who looks like he just wandered onto the set likewise all of the male characters seem to be adlibbing their dialog throughout the entire movie im not exaggeratingbr br dont even get me started with the historical goofs in this movie seriously who the hell directed this this movie is supposed to take place around 1957 but the cops are carrying modern sidehandled batons some of the stuff in the hardware store look like they came from lowes and when the cop gets to a payphone he dials 911 didnt exist back then also ed was a small guy scary like anthony perkins character in psycho who was supposedly based on reallife ed not this burly dude who ended up looking way too much like the bad guy in men in blackbr br another thing that really bugged me was the appearance that the makers of this film shot the whole thing in an abandoned 3 building set because of the clever camera angles you never see any actual town and the interior of the sets looked like old longabandoned shacks pop a cash register on a sawhorse and baminstant hardware storebr br im usually pretty forgiving of lowbudget horror films but this one just begs for it all you had to do was include most of the real events even embellish them pay five good actors instead of 15 crappy ones and for petes sake take 5 minutes and think about the time period once in a while my advice google ed gein youll be far more entertained
