the storyline of this movie is clich√© and obviously has been ripped off from jurassic park the filmmakers didnt even try to hide that it seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaurdolls so instead the viewer sees some robotlike toydinos from a cheap toystore which move in a very unnatural way its funny though because its so bad the acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos are no one seems really excited to be in this movie which i totally understand especially the last half hour is extremely boring and its almost impossible to watch it without falling asleep the one positive comment note id like to make about raptor is that it doesnt take a full 90 minutes
