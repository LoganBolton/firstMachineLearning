this movie is an abortive stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extrabad movie it fails at even this since theres way too much plot and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore seriously the puppets are sweet and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good the performances are cgrade at best and lame throughout with special props to the specops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre east coastvenusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher not that you really care what he says as only the curse words are distinct cinematographically its nonoffensive pretty much what youd expect from lowrent straighttovideo offal just like the script the fact that new concorde used footage from the carnosaur films is offensive and quite confusing for shame new concorde for shame carnosaur is one of my favorite terrible movies and they somehow screwed it up and made it nigh unwatchable see the carnosaur films if you want to see shoestring dinosaur mayhembr br i give it one star because i am so fond of the movies it steals from and also because the scale doesnt have a zero
