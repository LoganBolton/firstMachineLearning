i just dont get these reviews i cant help thinking they are written by the sort of log fan who would worship anything they ever do without questioning whether it is actually any goodbr br im a massive fan of the programme but thought this film was a pointless project i could forgive the ridiculous plot if i had come out of the cinema having laughed more than twice at one point i thought it might just me before i realised hardly any laughs were minting from the rest of audiencebr br i wasnt expecting much of a plot very few tv comedies stand up to being stretched over 90 minutes but thought the odd bit of classic log dialogue or visual joke like at the start of each programme would carry a film after 5 minutes of the 17th century plot i was begging for it to end little did i know it would carry on for the rest of the film it just wasnt funnybr br i was just massively disappointed and cant see history being too kind to it even if a few diehard fans write enthusiastic reviews
