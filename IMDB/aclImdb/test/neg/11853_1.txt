this film was really terriblebr br however  its worth seeing  as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene ever i mean  this thing went on for about 7  8 minutes repeating the same moves over and over thats almost 10  of the whole film i havent laughed as hard as i laughed at that for a long timebr br there were some seriously strange and pointless goings on in this film but the one that i found funniest was when for no reason whatsoever a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run in to the complex near the end 2 minutes later they run out again what the hell was that for also  the tiny white forklift that magically changed into a huge yellow digger was pretty classic im led to beleive that this is because they used footage from the carnosaur trilogy to patch up this absolute donkey im gonna have to see those nowbr br the film is worth watching for a laugh or two  but if you dont find bad movies funny stay away
