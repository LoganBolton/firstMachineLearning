the only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is not because i havent seen every film released in 2001 thus far its because this film was only made partly in 2001 the rest of it was stolen from roger cormans other dinosaur films carnosaur 13br br i have a confession to make carnosaur 2 is perhaps one of my favorite bmovies it borrows so much from james camerons aliens its not even funny but i love it i cant explain exactly why it just works for me i liked the sets i liked the cinematography i liked how they borrowed from aliens its all a bit ironic that cameron at one point was an understudy of cormans with films like battle beyond the stars 1980br br i own the carnosaur trilogy on dvd and the most i can say for part one is that it has moments the most i can say for the third is that it took me five years to find it watchablebr br now we have raptor which does not continue that series instead it borrows entire scenes from the carnosaur trilogy and builds a movie around it and somehow roger corman was able to get eric roberts and corbin bernsen to do it now im not saying either roberts or bernsen are at any kind of career high but they were both at one point what could be called respectable actors not here sure actors react to effects they wont even see while filming all the time here however they are reacting to mismatched footage from films that are between five and eight years old theres even a sherrif whose costume was modeled directly after a character in carnosaur 1 apparently it made too much sense to get the original guy backbr br when raptor was announced i was a wee bit excited i was however disappointed when corman said that theyd be using the old dinosaur models from carnosaur apparently corman decided after this interview was conducted that he wouldnt even do that and its not that he couldnt find an fx crew to do it the script for this was clearly written keeping in mind that the story had to be built around preexisting stock footagebr br dont compare this to ed wood ed did better than this at least he only used the stock footage of bela once in one film there are ways of incorporating stock footage into a movie and raptor takes this frownedupon technique to a new low even if you liked carnosaur 3 primal species stay away from raptor
