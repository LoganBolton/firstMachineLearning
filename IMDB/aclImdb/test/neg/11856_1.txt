so bad its entertaining especially during cocktail hour and believe me youll need a beer a drink or whatever to get through this turkey where do they get the financial backing for such paintbythenumbers horror flicks the fun in this movie is predicting which characters will get eaten and in what order and trashing the socalled uniforms the military jokers wear the raptors by the way are not the same raptors we met in jurassic park but a cousin species sorry no spoilers here youll have to watch it to find out for yourself dont expect the plot to make sense simple as it is just go along for the ride you could make it a game take another drink each time you hear a certain sound or better yet every time someone gets crunched by a raptor with a little luck you wont even remember having seen this cgrade madefortv movie
