roger corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious lowbudget career spanning over 300 movies while few if any would call him great his films obscure connections to underground culture via reference tribute or influence have ensured him a warped legacy of sorts throughout his career he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films piranha humanoids from the deep the black scorpion etc without improving on them in the slightest raptor written and directed by jay andrews jim wynorski the man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty pleasures chopping mall takes that practice to a disturbing new low regarding cormans mid90s carnosaur trilogybr br 	wynorskis credits are in quotes because raptor isnt a tribute to the carnosaur films and not even a remake raptor is the carnosaur films or at least the films dinosaurinduced death scenes haphazardly spliced together with trace elements of the original plot and some newly shot scenes many of which consist of dinos eye view shots in a lame attempt to make the inserted scenes look less obvious the new material was written around the footage instead of vice versa and is totally unremarkable with huge gaps of logic eg two separate teams are sent in by the military simply so footage from parts 2 and 3 where the soldiers had different uniforms could be included which is amazing considering how little logic plays into any of the carnosaur films already the actors lack of any feeling in their characters though in fairness any character dimension is only presented in the script once maybe twice brings to mind the terribly wooden acting in 1950s bfilms and it certainly doesnt make anything between the rippedoff attack scenes worth watching even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes is when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical build between the new actor and the actor in the original scene when the only scene evoking any response in a film is the oldest trick in the horror book the springloaded animal something is seriously wrongbr br 	as it stands this is a despicable practice in two bgrade figures who need not worry about ruining their reputations because they havent got one ripping off their own material for the cheapest and quickest of dirty tricks simply because they can why else would anyone feel possessed to rip off a series meant to be a rip off of the jurassic park series there isnt much more i can say other than that this film carries my very highest recommendations against viewing the only good thing about it besides gazing at melissa braselles navel is that now i dont have to see any of the carnosaur movies
