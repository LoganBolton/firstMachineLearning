my brotherinlaw and his wife brought the movie over one night to watch on video this should have given me the first clue that it would be horrible it was from the very first frame to the last this movie is terrible it does not even quite register as a b movie maybe an n or a p one of the worst 5 movies ive ever seen from the rubber raptoronastick to the stillbreathing corpses in the car to the beyond horrible closing lines this movie isnt worth watching if youve received it for freebr br skip this one altogetherunless you want to play mystery science theatre with your friends it will provide good ammunition
