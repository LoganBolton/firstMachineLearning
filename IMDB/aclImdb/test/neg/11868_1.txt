at first sight i must say already watch the contractor 2007 with wesley snipes too a better action movie and with a more dramatic plotbr br the detonator has an horrendous plot focusing in some sort of atomic bomb set in romania and with awful directing for an action movie there is no thrilling moments and an action movie is turned in to boredombr br really what you expect wesley snipes to do when awful screenplays like this one are offered to him dont blame him he needs the moneybr br this was the first impression when i saw the movie 3 years ago but i wont see it again no way screw it it sucks there i said itbr br ps i dont think i ever said this movie sucks on a imdb review thank you detonator
