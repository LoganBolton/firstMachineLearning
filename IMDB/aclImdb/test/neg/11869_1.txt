ok ill be brief this film wasnt just bad it was very very bad with line4s like  if you deal with the devil you expect to get sht on your shoes you know your in hideous film territory after watching this film i wanted to kill myself and my entire family it gave me such a vast feeling of selfloathing i wanted to do murder dont watch this film i will kill again but when i do it will be terribly edited with a pathetic soundtrack and stock shot for hire action sequences and bad shirtsbr br fortunately there is a flipside its the first action film to feature a three door ford sierrabr br unfortunately it ends up trashed on its roof br br ps worse than the marksman
