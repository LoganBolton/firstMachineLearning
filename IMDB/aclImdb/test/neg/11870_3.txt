i am from romania  and for that i apologize if my english is not so goodbr br i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i am extremely disappointed i always liked wesley snipess movies but this one is terrible i regret that i spent over 3 hours downloading this film there are a lot mistakes in the film for example the stadium in the film is not lia manoliu the name of the stadium is ghencea the name of the soccer team is called steaua bucuresti not ulithe scoreboard of the stadium is not capable of showing graphical images video replays live images etc its a simple scoreboard that can only display letters and numbers the uliseaua teams opponents are displayed on the scoreboard as din  probably from dinamo bucuresti  who are steauas main rivals in the romanian soccer championship the images from the soccer match are from a match between steaua bucuresti and poli timisoara my favorite team and my only love  look it up on the internet and you will see why the police cars in the movie are not properly made there isnt a single darkblue police car in romania they are all white the mistake list can go on and on and on  but i will stop here in short terms this movie is horrible it does not worth renting it it does not worth buying a cinema ticket for it it does not worth downloading it i honestly feel sorry that wesley snipes played in this movie a previous movie of his  7 seconds  also filmed in romania  was ok but this is terrible
