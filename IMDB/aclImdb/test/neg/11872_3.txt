the detonator is set in bucharest where some sort of ex cia government agent named sonni griffith wesley snipes has tracked down a arms dealer named dimitru matthew leitch things go wrong though  dimitru finds out that sonni is working for the us government after a big shootout most of dimitrus men have been killed by sonni which the local romanian police force are unhappy about top man flint michael brandon decides to send sonni back to the us  at the same time protect a woman named nadia cominski silvia colloca who is also being sent back to the us however it turns out that nadia is wanted by dimitru  his football club owning boss jozef tim dutton who need her in order to complete a deal for a nerve gas bomb which they intend to set off in washington killing millions of peoplebr br this american  romanian coproduction was directed by pochih leong  the detonator confirms beyond any shadow of a doubt that wesely snipes has joined the washed up action film stars club who are relegated to making generic action films in eastern european locations yep snipes has joined such luminaries as jeanclaude van damme steven seagal dolph lundgren rutger hauer  chuck norris i give snipes a bit of credit since he held on a little longer than the rest with the excellent blade trinity 2004 still fresh in a lot of cinema goers minds every film he has made since has gone straighttodvd but it had to happen sooner or later like a lot of the names ive mentioned snipes has lived off the reputation of a few great films  if you look at his career hes been in more bad films that good ones like the recent films of jcvd  seagal the detonator is pretty awful the script by martin wheeler is as predictable boring  bythenumbers as anything out there the detonator is the sort of film you expect to see on an obscure cable tv channel playing at 2 oclock in the morning the detonator is chock full of clichés snipes is forced into a situation where he has to protect a woman  at first they dislike each other but by the end they are in love his closest friend at the cia turns out to be a traitor while the obnoxious by the book boss noone likes actually turns out to be a pretty decent guy snipes character is allowed to run around bucharest shooting killing  blowing people up like it doesnt matter  he never gets arrested the action is dull  forgettable the bad guy own a football club so there are lots of annoying football terminology  there arent even any funny onelinersbr br director leong doesnt do anything anything to liven things up the detonator looks cheap with a car chase in which the two cars never seem to get over the 30mph mark ok the action scenes are relatively well staged but they are few  far between  utterly forgettable in a bad guy shoots at snipes  misses in return snipes shoots at bad guy  kills him sort of way theres a half decent car crash  explosion but very little else it seems some of the detonator was shot in a romanian football stadium i think id rather have watched the game for 90 minutes rather than this filmbr br with a supposed budget of about 15000000 the detonator is reasonably well made but not that much really happens set  filmed in bucharest in romania the acting isnt that great snipes just doesnt seem interested  feels like he is just there for the money which i dont blame him for at allbr br the detonator is yet another poor clichéd action film starring a has been actor  set in eastern europe why do sony keep making these things not recommend there are much better action fare out there
