unlike some of the reviews written here i didnt hate this movie it is a movie that could have been much better than it was not oscar material true but much better than it wasbr br i thought the plot had a good hook and through line granted this movie was badly written and terribly directed and produced i mean how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have why were we there what exactly is the point of the opening sequence it seems like the producers watched american beauty a few too many times and thought ill use that in an action movie i thought the movie wasnt that badly acted wesley snipes did a credible job he just ran afoul of some bad direction and once this movie hit the production room things just got worse the main actress i think had the same problems some of the other acting was suspect yes but it was a lowbudget flick again i would say it is the directors job to pick that up and correct itbr br as an overall recommendation i would agree with the first review i read that this movie is not worth seeing or maybe it is worth seeing if you are a film student and want to see what not to dobr br 310 and thats giving it praise
