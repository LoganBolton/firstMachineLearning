this review took longer to write than i took to watch this film its just plain bad the plot is terrible in comparison to the tv shows it is flat unfunny and boringbr br it is clear that the log ran out of ideas long before this film was green lit viewers should read this as an example of not knowing when to stopbr br bad editing bad music bad acting zero dynamism zilch chemistrybr br a film that doesnt know what it is made without any love to some mysterious end that leaves you depressed and feeling kind of angry that so much money was wastedbr br the log obviously were made an offer they couldnt refuse or perhaps their egos have simply got the better of them its a bleak marketing push that perhaps would have been better when the log were fresher and more inspiredbr br i however did know when to stop and didbr br please someone try to convince me of this films finer points
