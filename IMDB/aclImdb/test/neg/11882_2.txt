in terms of historical accuracy this is the absolute worst roman film i have ever seen the list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the threehour film but just to give you an ideabr br julius caesar and augustus are presented as liberal democrats taking the side of the people against the nobles this is patently absurd the caesars were as noble as you could get their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been wrecked by 150 years of civil war there had been reformers notably the gracchi brothers who lived about 100 years earlier and to some extent advocated for the rights of ordinary citizensbr br there are several scenes that are utterly ridiculous if you know anything about the period cleopatra with richard burton will give you a much better idea of how events unfolded fanciful though it isbr br historical accuracy is one thing acting and dialogue are something else and here this film veers perilously close to being a bad junior high school production i burst out laughing several times especially when julia the daughter of augustus meets a lover they clutch passionately as she breathes my father ah your father your father your father would disapprove peter otoole is at his worst forced to gnaw his way through some very pompous and silly lines the actor who plays augustus as a young man is such a nebbish  and the character is written as such  its impossible to envision him as the cunning crafty machiavellian politician who created the roman empire here hes just a whiner who has to be told what to do most of the timebr br charlotte rampling does manage to emerge from an underwritten role as livia augustuss wife with dignity had she been given a fuller role to play she might have rescued this production from absurditybr br there is some nice photography and battle footage helped by plenty of standard issue cgi oddly this was made for british tv and appears to be a britishitalian coproduction but is labeled with an r ratingbr br the dvd picture is excellent and the dolby digital soundtrack is very nice although you only notice it during the few action sequences as the movie is mostly talkbr br almost any roman movie even cleopatra or the fall of the roman empire has more historicity  to say nothing of compelling drama  than this bizarre classics illustrated jr adaptation this one gives new meaning to the muchabused phrase based on a true story in this case they could have said suggested by real events
