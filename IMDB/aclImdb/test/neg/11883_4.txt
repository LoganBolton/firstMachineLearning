this is a voice of a person who just finished watching the second season of rome almost at one go and grabbed the opportunity to see what happened next  this film conveniently takes off where rome ends if you find rome an abomination a foul mouthed screwfest of little historical accuracy then you might enjoy imperium augustus but if you feel rome is a good thing if you enjoy the complicated intrigue the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors then imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factorsbr br there are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in rome i especially disliked romes image of cleopatra as a drugsoaked sex addict there must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman and the actress in imperium suits the part much better otoole and rampling are good and so are some others but then if you have come to know  and love  atia as the super cool bitch youll find the depiction of her in imperium  as a tearjerking mother goose in an apron  absolutely ridiculous there are supposed to be some bitchy characters in imperium but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more youll find no interesting female characters in this epic theres also the painfully comic maecenas whom we see as a screeching drag queen even though there is little historical evidence that he was such hes once referred to as being effeminate in his pleasures in the annalsbr br the interiors are rather meager and rely on clichés upon clichés cleopatras big hall looks like something out of a computer game or a childrens play room in an egyptian theme park theres a looooooooot of really poor 3d graphics not up to 2003 standardsbr br the action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged augustus is reliving so we get a quick look at some historical events some of which are presented well whereas some are not an disproportional amount of time is wasted to show livia as the eternal flame of augustus this affair doesnt sizzle for even a moment the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tearinducing musical score whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing most of the actors are non english speakersbr br everything is lukewarm in this epic true there are more historical accuracies than in rome but dramatically speaking its plain boring the characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness camerawork is often reduced to static shots and lighting offers nothing to please your eyebr br theres really noone to love and noone to hate in imperium regardless of whether you liked or disliked rome there are much better films and miniseries around ancient rome the rise and fall of an empire would be one thing i recommend
