my wife and i couldnt even finish the film truly it was rather painfulbr br first the historical accuracy is compromised not so much by the events themselves as the ridiculous onedimensionality of the characters for instance augustus takes the burden of power only with great reluctance indeed he is portrayed as if hes some sort of great humanist and believer in democracybr br second the camp my lord the dialog is horrifically bad i recall the soap opera my mother watched when i was a child having better dialog than this the constant exposition and pontificating grates upon the ears like fingernails on chalkboard ugh okay i exaggerate a bit but the dialog truly is bad the hbo series rome is superior for no other reason than that its characters were at least believable regardless of their historicitybr br rome was also wise enough to know they couldnt stage epic battle scenes the creators of this film did not when caesar attacks munda the battle scene is practically farcicalbr br i will grant that the costumes are perfectly good the sets are fine though their cgi backdrops can be a bit jarring at times the sound is bad thoughÂ—both in terms of the music the foley work and the dubbing of so many of the side charactersbr br anyway its completely not worth renting as a history major i was hoping for an alternative approach to augustus than hbos rome which i feel failed to capture his overall feel quite as well as they did caesar or antony instead i should have just stuck to my reading
