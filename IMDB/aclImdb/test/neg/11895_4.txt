i saw this last night at the tribeca film fest and holy god was it bad from the script to the editing to the acting to the cinematography none of it worked not to mention the set designcostumes were so distractingly wrong for the time period it spans the years from the late 70s up until 2006 or so even john hurt whos usually an amazing actor was so overthe top ridiculous granted quinten crisp is an overthetop guy to begin with but hurt was given nothing to work with here i dont know much else to say except the audience i saw it with absolutely loved it so maybe its just me but audiences love anything at film festivals when theyre sitting next to the director and all the actors its not a very accurate test of how good the movie is or how well it will play personally i thought this movie was terrible on the other hand it was so terrible that it was hilarious get drunk and give it a shot when its on hbo in 2 years if it ever makes it that far
