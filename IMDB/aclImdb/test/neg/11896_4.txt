in this follow up to the naked civil servant we see the final years of quentin crisps life in new york john hurt is again crisp come on who else could play the part and its a role he inhabits to the point of disappearing for me hurt is crisp and ive always found it very hard to take the man himself because hurt was more him than he was himself its masterful performance his equal is denis ohare as phillip steele crisps long time friend and confidantbr br unfortunately outside of the performances the film has little to recommend it to be certain the film gets the details right filmed in and around new york the film the film looks and feels like new york and its environs but dramatically its kind of inert its crisp talking to people being wittytrying to come to terms with the world as it is he ended up regretting some poorly chosen words concerning aids and dealing with the infirmities that old aged thrust upon him quentin the man is always interesting but his life as portrayed is really notbr br i am disappointed by the film ive always admired the man and his unique point of view i just wish he was better served by this film about his life
