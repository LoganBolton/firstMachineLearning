one would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking naked civil servant of 30plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision but no here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no style whatsoever true the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors  and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with everything in the infrastructure of this film is wrong starting with the script which is another one of those tvmovie condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a famous quote by the subject and every other scene is an inyourface introduction to the next pivotal character in the subjects life we get swoozie kurtz as a pr maven who promotes crisp as a stateside entertainer denis ohare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires crisp as film reviewer becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80s aids activists and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian jonathan tucker in a fine performance as a shy insecure painter of gaythemed canvases who is befriended by crisp and finally cynthia nixon as performance artist and womanaboutbohemia penny arcade who intrigued by crisps persona offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer but is given no chance by the script to embody the downtoearth and streetwise arcade crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a oneroom flat in an old tenement building in manhattans east village he famously said that he never cleaned because after a few years the dust doesnt get any worse or something like that but looking at the depiction of that flat in this film youd never get the flavor of that dustiness he frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by in this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th avenue by the hudson river most of the streets of new york scenes have a sterile unreal look with no sense of the period br br the soul of this film is the great john hurt in the title role after nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar postedwardian englishman and put it across to third millennarians his every line every gesture is exquisite in the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very very old ones skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death one senses that feeling in hurts performance so for him and him alone this film is worth a look
