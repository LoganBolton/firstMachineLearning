i rented this type of soft core before but i can honestly say i wasnt expecting this to be in the same type as rod steele you only live until you diewhich was both sexy and funny it had a good script a sincere leading man and a sense of purpose it also has gabriella hall who is hot the reason why i didnt expect this movie was because the box was missing the must be 18 to rent sticker i was looking for more cheese and less cheesecakebr br first of all i think movies shouldnt be allowed to start with actors rehearsing for a part at a talent agency or wherever actors rehearse in this movies seeing the actors rehearsing highlights the lack of preparation that went into acting out the real characters in the moviebr br okay having found out that this was a soft core movie i didnt necessarily turn it off and demand my money back but the dizzying way the extended video erotic scenes are added to what was probably a late night paycable release are very annoying and easy to fastforward through without the sustained quality of say rod steele you know they mustve had some money because i think some of it is filmed overseasbr br i will have to say the main actor trying not to spill the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most baffling acting jobs ive ever seen and ive seen torgo from manos it may actually have been worth the dollar rental fee that and gabriella hall still there are better corny movies to rent with your friends
