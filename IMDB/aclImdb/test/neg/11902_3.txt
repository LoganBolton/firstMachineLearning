this is a bad film as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts as a result it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film miss dunne or mr huston should have been proud of making however the film is worth watching if you are a fan of precode films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls do put outeven if they arent married and even if their partner is br br the film begins with miss dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to europe for wwi in the process she meets a scalawag bruce cabot who eventually convinces her to sleep with him she becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman however miss dunne does not want him back as she realizes hes not worth it but later her baby dies at child birth while all these very controversial plot elements are used they are always alluded toalmost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way kids in the audience will be clueless after all films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this timebr br surprisingly this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and cabot ends about 14 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to it was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned ittacking it on to still another film in this second phase of the film miss dunne unexpectedly begins working at a womens prison though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there what we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate and as a result of all this violence miss dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writerbr br but then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the womens prison reform business goes by the wayside dunne meets a judge walter huston who is married but he desperately wants her now throughout the film dunne is portrayed as a very good girleven though she did have unmarried sex with cabot she was more or less tricked into it but now single irene who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man he tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only but she never thinks to investigate if this is true and with his assurance off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business but while shes pregnant with his love child hes indicted for being a crooked judge he assures her hes innocent but hes convicted and it sure sounds like hes a scoundrelusing inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune then in the final moments of the film miss dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until huston is released the film then endsbr br so we basically have three separate films and a bizarre early 30s idea of what a nice girl should be like i gathered that she should be a strongminded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships this really undoes all the positives about dunnes character and its really hard to imagine anyone liking the film a strong womens rights advocate might easily be offended at how weakminded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect with a decent rewrite this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film but it couldnt make up its mind what it wanted to be and was just another dull precode film
