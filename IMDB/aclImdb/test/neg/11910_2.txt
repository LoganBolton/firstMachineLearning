jack lemmon was one of our great actors his performances in days of wine and roses the apartment some like it hot missing to name the first ones that come to mind were all worthy of best actor nomination his only win was for save the tiger and thats a shame he gets melancholy down to a science but never brings it into balance with the driver in his character he actually did a similar character much better toward the end of his career in the onenote glengarry glen ross br br as for the movie wonderful supporting work by jack gilford as lemmons partner and thayer david as an arsonist go for naught because the rest of the script is a muddled jumble of cliched vignettes angst neurotic nostalgia and pointless moralizing worth seeing once as a time capsule into 1970s style experimental direction by avildsen
