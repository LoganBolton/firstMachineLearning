jack lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen he could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic with ease making most of his peers green with envy while his performance in save the tiger is oscarworthy i feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other better roles that had preceded this current onebr br this is also one of those pretentious movies that comes out to basically showcase the talent of the cast or in this case one particular member its too bad the screenwriters output didnt match that of lemmons dont waste your time with this one
