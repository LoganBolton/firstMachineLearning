i just spent the last half an hour reading through the other reviews and i dont know if i want to laugh or cry theres no way that adjl is like harry potter danny phantom fairly oddparents other then a secret magical world which has been close to overdone also no way is adjl anime anime is very much a drawing styleand some will say more such as plot and japanese origin either way adjl is not anime so stop saying it is and if youre looking for something that is like anime look else where like teen titans and avatarbr br adjl is typical its just like all the other disney shows an arrogant main character kid who thinks he knows everything and doesnt bother to listen to people whore older than him and continues to make the same mistakes best friend sidekicks repeative plot with a hint of a twist and sibling rivalry cant they once make a character that has brains and isnt full of himself cant they have kids respect their elders cant they think of something different with the plot cant they have the siblings get along and not hate each other adjl is just too generic because you also have bad guys that get defeated and come back again and are also complete idiots that have no background for their hate cmon youll think that someone whos at least 30 will be able to outwit a 13 year oldbr br watching adjl is like watching nearly anything else on tv these day same thing over and over again nothing special just new designs characters and one small idea that has been used again and again
