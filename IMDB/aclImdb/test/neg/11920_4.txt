 mild spoilers br br the premise goes like this  a store gets burnt down and assistant sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which sergio agrees br br so far so good  but theres a fair lapse of logic involved sergio agrees to do this for the sum of 25000 dollars but why  come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail  a very real possibilty for arson  for the sake of 25 grand  i know i wouldnt  and seeing as youd have a criminal record no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole so is 25000 dollars all that much for a life of workfare and welfare cheques  theres also something else that seems to have gone without notice from the premise  since mister lumpke has told sergio that his son did the fire he seems unware of the possibility that he may know too much  wouldnt alarm bells be ringing in your mind about someone wanting to keep you quite if they told you something  br br i guess were not suppossed to think about such details since a pyromaniacs love story isnt suppossed to be an intelligent thriller  its a light hearted romantic comedy chick flick thats probably best apprieciated as a girls night in  looking through this comments page it is obvious that the movie has its defenders but as a cynical male i wasnt too impressed and william baldwin does go way over the top
