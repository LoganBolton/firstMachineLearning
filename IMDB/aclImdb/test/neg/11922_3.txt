laughablebr br clichédbr br overdoses on style to compensate for poor writingbr br remember when mtv actually used to air music videos and other shows besides reality shows aeon flux 2005 is based upon one such show  a cartoon from the mid90s  featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing aeon played by the lovely charlize theron in this adaptation is a cold detached rebel who is as dexterous as a linedancer and as deadly as a vipersnake she needs to be if she expects to kick the asses of the totalitarian governmentbr br i love science fiction but hate the sudden influx of halfassed futuristic dystopian technologyoverdosed films like the island 2005 and equilibrium 2002 bottom of the pile aeon flux has all the problems that are present in these films but amplified that is there is nothing original left to show so they compensate for it with the sleek style that matrix 1999 catalyzed the special effects are therefore sensational in aeon flux which earns it a few points but scratch the surface and there is literally nothing therebr br to make matters worse all performances in this film are atrocious and some actually wound me to watch charlize therons character aeon flux is interwoven with the most cheesy toughchick schtick and it seems as though the director karyn kusama cannot quite decide where to go with her next  should she make her more detached or more emotional she doesnt know lets go both ways imagine you take a shotgun load it chockfull of character developments of different sorts and there fire into a random mess this is the character of aeon fluxbr br the film aeon flux puts forward all the mandatory ideas in a dystopian society  individual vs society nature vs science emotion vs cold reason etc youve seen all of this before and better done at that go read orwell bradbury or huxley or even watch logans run 1976 or blade runner 1982 anything avoid this viciously uninvolving cheesefest for as long as you canbr br 310
