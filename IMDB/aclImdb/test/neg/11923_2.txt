i got to know æon back in the early 90s via television and i loved itbr br what did you like about it  the cranky drawing style  the flawless artistic action involved  the absurd and deadpan communication between the characters  the whole layout of the surrounding future world  no matter what you loved about itbr br the aeon flux film of late 2005 has nothing of thatbr br karyn kusama the so called director of the film was hopelessly overstrained with transporting the original content to a new film if you re not familiar with the original series you wont understand anything during for the first 60minutes of the filmthe story is inscrutable and the vapid characters do not develop during the filmbr br kusamas attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters is not only a lame attempt to cover up her flaws as a storyteller  its simply unworthy of the original æon conceptbr br charlize theron might be an attractive woman but she cant impersonate the æon character although she was attached to strings doing action scenes her lack of talent for physical motion simply ruins the action sequences in the film the result is a tremendous amount of hectic picture cuts to cover up the sheer lameness of her physiquebr br forget about all the rest its not worth talking aboutbr br i give 1point for mstheron showing her boobs and 1point for the nice architectural photography in the film thats it
