right up or down there with toys and jurassic park 2 and the phantom menacebr br the premise sounded cool some of the commercials looked semipromising but alas the entire movie had about 30 seconds of neat shotness and that was shown on the small screens 30 second slotbr br if you want amateur writing secondrate effects ridiculous costumes and an allaround snoozefest by all means watch it the plot is recycled scifi fodder too bad too because coming in i thought it would be bad but held out hope it may be the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen a lot br br bottom line  dont watch itbr br unless of course you liked any of the above 3 movies
