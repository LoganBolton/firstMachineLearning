its a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into wide release that many movies suck is no surprise but when a studio itself admits as much ahead of time the process of moviegoing becomes a passion play of sorts consider it an early christmas gift from hollywood then that aeon flux isnt nearly the affront to taste and decency one might expect given the above though ultimately overwhelmed by its flaws it at least has sort of an idea with which to toy around too bad director karyn kusama seems to have little clue how to execute it allbr br its the future theres been a plague there is a dictatorship and there are rebels the latter are known as the monicans and far from being a cult of beret or tennis racket worshipers theyre into attempts to overthrow the former called the goodchild regime the regime is occasionally mean to the citizenry which is more than aeon flux charlize theron and her pals can stand through some sort of biochemical virtual reality technology the monicans receive orders from their dear leader frances mcdormand a mystical priestesstype who appears to have been crossbred with a carrot it falls to aeon to strap on some formfitting futuristic spandex getups to carry out the high carrots orders which are of course some version of destroy the regime having years earlier watched her sister get liquidated by the goodchilds she needs little convincingbr br not surprisingly things get complicated the goodchilds might not be quite what they seem and aeon herself might have an unexpected history with them though occasionally muddled the films central conceit of which i wont reveal more contains some neat notions about the nature of human existence and survival theres room for much more examination of which the film doesnt take advantage but the ideas are there at least the big problems of aeon flux are technical kusama has made the baffling decision to film nearly all the action so close that we can rarely follow whats going on to make matters worse its edited in a flurry of jump cuts that leave us completely lost the result is some serious spacial disorientation that takes over the film aeon fluxs aesthetic is one of sleek costume oddlyangled architecture and nimble characters much of the action occurs in minimalist open spaces that beg for some unbroken long shots that might convey the grace and athleticism implied by the above instead we get split seconds of flying limbs breaking glass and accompanying sound effectsbr br there is a pretty good movie trying to get out of the morass of aeon flux put this stuff in the hands of the wachowski brothers say and the results could be quite different as it is though i felt like aeon flux was willfully pushing me away from a movie i wanted to enjoy this film is unattuned to its own strengths like a novice poker player dealt a royal flush it somehow finds a way to lose in spite of its potential
