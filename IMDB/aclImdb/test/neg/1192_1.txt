dont get me wrong i love the tv series of league of gentlemen it was funny twisted and completely inspired i was looking forward to the movie the premise was interesting and i looked forward to see what they had done with the characters and where the bizarre storyline would take thembr br it was a total disappointment for starters the three weakest characters in the series were the leads and it only contained bit parts for the other characters why not pick mickey  pauline papa lazaro or tubs and edward for the main parts it was unfunny throughout half baked gags and poor slapstick humourbr br the real clincher was the plain ridiculous period drama  comedy and i will use the word comedy loosely it distracted from the main storyline and felt awkward not to mention painfully unfunny the direction of the movie is appalling and often feels that the lines were delivered by the characters within one take very rushedbr br then  the three headed plasticineesquire monster what the hell was all that about plain ridiculous it felt like the league of gentlemen tagged it on at the endbr br all in all i found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout my experience of the film what was once an amazing television series has been tainted by a terribly unfunny film br br if i could give it 0 out of 10 i would do not waste your money seeing this
