the series finally hits rockbottom with this lousy fourth installment which was thank god the last one none of the three sequels did justice to the highly entertaining original but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to exploit the name of the magnificent seven and bernsteins rousing music theme the production values resemble those of a madefortv movie and the characters are forgettable and indistinguishable in parts ii and iii you couldnt remember their names here you cant even remember their faces lee van cleef was an inappropriate choice for the role of chris but nobody could have replaced yul brynner in our minds anyway dont waste your time
