i would bet a months salary the magnificent seven returns msr was madefortv other reviewers attest that msr was a theatrical movie and ill take their word for it the logical answer must assume it was originally shot for tv and after a changeofstudioheart it was released theatrically instead every actor is primarily a tv actor mariette hartley michael callen ralfe waite stephanie powers tv performers all lee van cleef split his time between tv and theater screens stephanie powers has only made 3 or 4 real movie appearances in the last thirty years of a very prolific television career  proof positive this was shot for tv minor players are veteran smallscreen actors who can be seen on old reruns of gunsmoke wild wild west streets of san francisco and so onbr br the hohum sets are identical to the universal studios tour sets often seen in old episodic tv and the editing betrays the oneortwotakeshurriedness of tv with limited camera movements positioning cutting and lighting the sound track exclusive of the original berstein themes are straight from seventies television yep id bet money it was shot for tvbr br thats an important point in evaluating msr initially i watched msr on cable assuming it was an old theatrical release in comparison to the original magnificent seven its a joke a cartoon an amateurish attempt at movie making acting lighting writing settings action cinematography music exempting the berstein themes editing pacingon and onall pale in comparison to the classic magnificent seven which is close to the perfect 60s western and one of the great action movies of all time br br however viewed as an early 70s madefortv movie as i suspect the film is actually better than average those unfortunate enough to live through the 70s as an adult know what im talking about msr would have competed against alias smith and jones and similarly bland network shows during the seventies gunsmoke was a quality show concentrating on character development rather than action deemphasizing gun play to two shootouts a week the first shooting usually a murder sets the hours plot into motion  the second shootout climaxes the episode by killing the guest star his nemesis or otherwise resolving the conflict with marshal matt dillon msr has more action than a whole season of gunsmoke in this light  in this frame of reference  msr is passable entertainment a cut above the tv fare from that decade
