i guess i should now comment upon a 4th flick in the magnificent seven franchise the sequels still surprise or amaze meby their sleaze and deliberate absurdism they constitute or forge a 4th waynot classic not revisionist not europeanbut a sleaze americana kindred to the violent vigilante 70s movies absurd trash this installment too is bombastic sleazeinexplicably awkward and even somewhat strangebr br now what i find disturbing that these sequels not only have their opportunist fans but that the fans simply do not sense any difference between the originals style and the sequelsbr br these sequels are not boring or insipidbut bizarre they are of course very badly writtenmessy scripts rubbish lines its straight crazy in this installment each gunman gets several women van cleefs young wife begs him to release a young prisoner he finally does the young man resumes his life shoots van cleef kidnaps the wife rapes and kills herthen joins a wrongdoer van cleef who has previously refused to help defending a village now assembles a small bunch and charges the wrongdoers hacienda then the wrongdoers charge the village where van cleef has setbr br i liked the castbr br van cleef is chris stefanie powers pretty active in the 70s screwy westerns is van cleefs darling callan very antipathetic is noah a writer and chris sidekick the rest of the aggressive bunch are askew one of the only three survivors armendariz lucking lauter rita rogers is truly hot fleshy beauty
