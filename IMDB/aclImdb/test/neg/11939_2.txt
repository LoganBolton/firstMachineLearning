im really not going to waste my time with in depth analysis im just going to say that im extremely disappointed that catherine zetajones made the mistake of being in the main role in this absurd nonsense in this full of clichés boring to death thoughtless pathetic try in filmmaking there is no point in trying to find the positive sides of this movie because as a whole it is poor in every single way and the saddest thing is that zetajones is dragged so uncompromisingly into the clichés that she has absolutely no chance of showing even 1 of her talentbr br avoid this movie even at the opportunity of spending the night at home starring at the wall
