when i saw the trailers for this movie it looked like a good romantic comedy i expected some light fluffy fun instead i was bored and a little depressedbr br honestly there was no chemistry between the leads at all and the movie had little if anything that was funny about it the little girl was adorable  when she cried i cried  but i thought they might have used someone a little bit younger in the rolebr br either way the movie was filled with long dull silences or swelling opera music im not antiopera but i would have preferred them to spend that time letting us get to know the characters who were all stiff and underdevelopedbr br i was really disappointed in this movie the whole time i watched it i kept thinking of how much better it could have been
