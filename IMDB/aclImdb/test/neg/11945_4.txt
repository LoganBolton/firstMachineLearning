i am a longtime fan of the original of this movie bella marthamostly martha and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one i miss the slow pace the buildup of characters and their style in small gestures the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog i dont think that the story itself is enough marthakate is more secluded and marionick is not a clown in most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original its is not working in its copy here the small alterations take away the tension my opinion is that you should go and see the original itll worth the inconvenience of subtitles
