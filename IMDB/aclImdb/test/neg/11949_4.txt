much as i really like catherine zetajones i wondered once again why remake a good movie this version lacked the tension and passion of mostly martha it was a clear rip off maxime foerste was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love i couldnt believe abigail breslin martina gedeck owned this role unfortunately zetajones should have found another one that she could own she has other roles she does own sergio castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful italian aaron eckhart seemed passionless in comparison this version was pleasant but blandbr br the love between mario and martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying the therapist added an interesting bit of color that didnt seem important i liked it when at the end he said hed be back but the movie was over before he returned i have mostly martha at home every now and then i revisit it
