this movie had all the potential and makings of a great feel good great love storythe cast is perfect the visuals work the original premise works the characters workbut the story moves from one chess move to the next in a most predictable waynot one character in the movie has any depth or has any depth explained by the director all we know about catherine zetajones character is she is obsessed with her worldnobody is allowed in and nobody challenges her worldthat much is obviousbut the remaining characters all have their own dimensions that are really never explored or exposedaaron eckharts character had so much more to offer to the story but wasnt allowed abigail breslins character is so easy to understand that her performance comes across somewhat predictable and phonyin the end everything reverts back to the forced turbulent world of catherine zetajones which the audience never totally falls forhonestly her turbulent world is not much more than a portrayal of a selfish self obsessed spoiled lady who most people would not have much time or sympathy for in the real world the director needed to make her a hero and never doesin the end it is eckharts character that ultimately wins because he winsbr br not a lousy movie just a movie that could have been a lot better with more depth of personalities allowed in explained and exposedbr br cheers
