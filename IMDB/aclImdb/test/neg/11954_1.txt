i have a friend that works at blockbuster and he gets 5 free movie rentals a week so one day as we were scouring the aisles for something interesting i stumbled across 18 weapons of kung fu and judging by the box alone this movie seemed pretty wack but nonetheless we gave into temptation and rented it  afterall it was freeand thank god it wasthis is by far the worst movie i have ever seenthe budget must have been a pickle and a piece of stringthe plot was ridiculous the only mention of the 18 weapons is that there is some book that teaches the ways of the 18 weapons that some bad guy is after  and thats it there isnt even any weapon fighting in this moviethat and the action sequences are just flatout bad9 times out of 10 the other guys punches and kicks come about a foot away from landing on the other guys and there are many times when the the movie will skip frames a result of ridiculously poor editingthe dubbing is as well laughable and it is hardly even understandableand we wont even get into the actingthe ending will definitely leave you saying wtf however to be fair i must mention that the fighting techniques used by the actors were somewhat decent and the old guy is a mad chumpbut thats about itthankfully i didnt have to pay for this movie but i guess at least now i know exactly how bad a movie can actually be
