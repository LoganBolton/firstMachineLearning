this is an excellent example of an entreatingly bad bmovie there are worse movies than this one titanic for example but this definitely shares the pile of steaming crap moviesbr br ok this was apparently shot in kansas city which explains why everyone is so lame the main guy looks like steve guttenberg and is even more lame than him i didnt even think that was possible in fact him and the main girl in the movie are responsible for the worst drama ever its not just that there acting was waaaaaaaaay overdramatic well actually it was of course the script was terrible which combines for a deadly onetwo punch in bad terrible utterly unwatchable dramabr br the scarecrow lets talk about him the whistling you hear every time hes around is stupid and obviously dubbed in now his costume i cannot get over that  its a guy wearing burlap sacks and a stupid mask i simply am dumbfounded maybe if your 3 years old with brain damage youd be scared of himitbr br one of the characters the token black guy actually used the line this might be a chance to earn my red wings when referring to trying to score with one of the girls on her period wow um yea that is the kind of dialogue you can look forward tobr br oh in the beginning when the scantily clad girl is running through the corn why is it roped off im pretty sure its not supposed to be evident just one of the many obvious mistakes made throughout this film another is the bad dubbing for the musical number yup thats right there all at the beach and the one dorkaziod gets up the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone and its so obviously dubbed its funny thankfully the scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear right through the guys chest when hes done singing overall the gore like that is pretty good this is one of those films when you rooting for these people to be killed by the killerbr br ok theres a scene where the 2 guys bury one of their friends in the sand then stand up whip out their peni and urinate all over the guy in the sand who does this really imagine it hey lets bury joe in the sand then stand up and take out our genitals like its no big deal and pee on him in fact this brings up the homoeroticism in this film what the hell a good part of the beginning of this movie is the jocks standing around in there underwear in the locker room and corn field while there doing the hazing what the hell is with that traditionally in film and real life jocks get the girls and nerds dont that really doesnt make sense as all nerds think of is girls and sex and apparently all jocks think of is sports and being around each other in their underwear i dont get itbr br lets get to the sex as someone who watched this movie with me put it ive never been so disgusted by heterosexual sex in my life and its true if you like hot a cup action or ugly old woman boobs then this film is for you i swear they found a girl with the smallest breasts ever and this is who they get to do the nude scene then the ugly old woman nurse shows her bouncy ones a couple of times and man i just didnt want to see thatbr br now i have to talk about the timeline continuity to this film thats what really is just bizarre it starts in the daytime then they all head to the cornfield and within like 2 minutes its instantly dark middle of the night when they drive off from there saying their going to the beach  its instantly day again and apparently they stay at the beach until night again and until day the next day so basically these events in the film cover 4 days without any of the characters needing sleep or anything its really weirdbr br after the main killings have taken place it flash forwards to 3 weeks later and apparently none of these people actually care that they saw their friends brutally murdered the surviving people literally pop some champaign and thats when i realized the budget didnt go to the script directing or acting it all went to that freakin bottle of champaignbr br the ending stop reading now if you dont want the ending spoiled for you it truly is enjoyablebr br ok so the end takes place in a church and the scarecrow put his soul inside the diabetes kid body then he fights with the steve guttenberg lookalike guy and he fights him with a bmovie version of the power the emperor had in star wars im not kidding its so stupid so somehow in the middle of the fight the scarecrows soul jumps bodies into the guttenberg jr guy and then with the last amount of will he has of his own he impales himself on a cross in the church its awesome some blood but whats even better is that the cross is obviously cardboard you can see the bottom move off the ground wow yea have fun watching
