another sequel why on earth do they keep making these this has got to be the weakest franchise ever yet it is still being funded and spawning sequels scarecrow gone wild  which i only watched so i could officially trash the whole series  brings back the evil strawman who again butchers up some college kids thats basically it the acting sucks as usual the death scenes are beyond pathetic and dont be fooled by the title this thing doesnt have as much nudity as you may think a couple nice topless girls but nothing too pants tightening let me just conclude my continuous insult or review on this movie by saying if i come across a scarecrow in space or a freddy vs scarecrow on the video store shelves im going to be in absolute awe
