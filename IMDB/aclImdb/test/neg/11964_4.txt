this third installment in the scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot i know i knowbut how good is it well lets not be silly its still pretty bad but by comparison to the first two its a fine film again shot on digital with decent lighting and good camera work br br spoilerbr br when a college baseball team hazes new members one is left in a diabetic coma of course they abandon him in a cornfield tied to a scarecrow in keeping with the legend the boys soul is transferred into the body of the scarecrow which comes to life and wreaks terrible vengeance on well pretty much everyone the coeds drive to the beach which is somehow very close to the cornfield on the sunny beach they are killed one by one by the whistling scarecrow br br writerdirector brian katkin does a credible job of bringing some muchneeded drama to the film unfortunately the drama leaps over good and lands in common cheese much of the acting was fair but there were some really terrible bits including an awful piece of poorly done lipsynching some plot points were left mostly unresolved and most were used to get someone alone so they could be slaughtered again better than the previous installments but still lacking
