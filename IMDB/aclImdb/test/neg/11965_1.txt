well first and for most id just like to say that im back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible movies only the movie in titled scarecrow gone wild could bring me back so here i ambr br with that being said i like to start off with this comment ouch this movie was really horrible i mean i know it was going to be bad but i had no idea that i would be spending 60 minutes out of a possible 90 minute film laughing at what i thought was a horror moviebr br lets start with the biggest flaw of the film to me that is ken shamrock now if memory serves me correctly shamrock is one of the worlds most dangerous men now if memory serves me again he was also in this stupid movie being a stupid comic relief or thats how it looked to me i mean how else do you explain all of his lines my all time favorite line of his in this so called movie was its been a long time coming ok the funnest thing about that line was that no more then five minutes prior to him say that he was sitting on the beach talking to the soon to be dead kids about how the dam scarecrow could not be killed so if he has knowledge of this why on earth would he start trying to combat it as soon as he sees it the scarecrow that it like i said before he must have been the comic relief except i dont think his ufc buddies where laughingbr br now that ive finished that well deserved paragraph on to the moviebr br ill admit that i cant remember a lot of scenes and thats not good considering that i just watch the movie no more then fifteen minutes ago so what im going to do is list the top five things wrong with this film 1 usually when horror movie monster have their own theme music its not heard by the victims or even by the monster itself so why were just about every person involved in this movie able to here this pathetic whistling i mean i saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the whistling typebr br 2 why on earth were there murders on a beach im sorry but threw out history beaches are associated with party time and vacation type feelings but i guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room i mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach it looked as if they were running in the same spotbr br 3 the girl running in the gray sweat pants that really bother during the duration of this film i mean she looks so ridiculous plus it didnt help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group i mean what was she like twelve or something there no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera i mean doesnt the camera add like ten pounds or something so what was her excusebr br 4 people trying to get record deals on camera just when i thought that this movie could not get any cheesier out comes the wanna be gorth brooks and oh man was he lame i dont remember the whole scene but from what i do remember it was not pretty this one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing and i mean nothing to do with whats going on in the film the funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this i mean the only person who doesnt really know how to response to this is the token black guy and thats sad because if im not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of american idoal but heres where it gets funny while this guy is all into his new song or whatever in the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow and boy does he look pied off at this i mean theres actually a moment where he looks like hes really jealous of this guy so what does he do about this jealousy well im glad you ask he waits for the guy to finish his song and then he finises the guy i dont want to give the death scene away but i can tell you this if that scene doesnt make you laugh then nothing on this earth willbr br 5 this movie was way longer then i expected and it didnt help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bullst at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film i mean ill admit i didnt see the twist coming but that had a lot to do with the fact that i was hoping that the film was over and done with but no they had to do they twist st needless to say that when i say that coming i just turned off the tv and said fk it theres no way that movie could have gotten any worser thanks to my rather fast judgment i can say that ill never know what was to happen next but i promise that i do not care all and all the movie is good for a laugh but please dont buy it just hype it up to one of your friends and watch it on there expanse
