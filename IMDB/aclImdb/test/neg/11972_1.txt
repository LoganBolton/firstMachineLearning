my roommate and i have another friend that works at a local blockbuster video he finds truly awful movies for us and tells us about them one of them was a christmas horror film starring former professional wrestler bill goldberg as a killer satna claus we didnt watch it immediately but we didnt think there could be anything worse apparently we were wrong we were shown this slasher film starring ken shamrock versus a murderous scarecrow at first we thought ken would actually be the killer scarecrow and thats why we wanted to watch but he wasnt and that made the movie even worse what absolutely ruined the movie was the teen drama if you want to save your brain cells from trying to escape from your head never ever watch this movie
