normally i love finding old and some notsoold westerns i havent seen to be the entertainment for the evening its such a great way to sit back relax and escape the politics and world problems for a few hours but this was not to be the case with this version of the magnificent seven the casting and storyline of this series closely follow the hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment good old getyourmindright revisionist history where the bad guys must all be white male confederate in this case and preferably christian if it can somehow be worked into the script its sad really the best movies out there are now and have always been about simply telling a good story up on the big screen  not about forwarding someones political ideology
