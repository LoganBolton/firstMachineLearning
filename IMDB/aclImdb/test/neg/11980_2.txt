i am a huge fan of the farcry game huge fan it still holds a place in my top10 games list of all time the story line was new fresh a truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on or so i thoughtbr br farcry the movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise see doom the movie and many morebr br the video game begins as the player jack carver awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an rpg from an unknown soldier jack then finds a communication device where harlan doyle guides him across islands shipwrecks jungles installations and volcanoes to find his lady friend valerie constantine all the wile battling mutated super soldiers and genetically enhanced animalsbr br the movie plays out very very differently 1 theres a needless 30 mins 13 of the movie of backstory before we even get to the boat blowing up scene 2 jack then walks onto the beach kills some goons then drives off nothing like the game 3 there is no communicator with doyle on the other end 4 the modified soldiers look like albinos with singlets on and there was no mutated monkeylike creatures jumping out of the bushes a part of the farcry game i enjoyed allot 5 there is no sun filled beach scenes no aircraft carrier no communications stations on huge cliffs little reference to any ingame contents charactersitemsvehicles in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all 6 the climactic volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building 7 theres an ending scene where everyone except krieger live happily ever after what thebr br i recommend avoiding this movie at all costs if you are a gamer you will hate this movie will all your soul it is a movie clearly intended for males so girls stay away so if your a male 1229 years of age have never played farcry and are not disgusted by directors attempts at porting booksgames to the cinema then this is for you
