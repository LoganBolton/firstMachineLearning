i really liked the far cry game nice graphics good leveldesign interesting and clever enemies aboveaverage length and even a somewhat decent plot i am not by default against movie spinoffs of games i thought doom the movie was hilarious but what uwe boll has done here is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible well not the length the movie runs only a merciful 90 min the characters are even more stereotypical than in the game which is quite an achievement the entire plot is told without any twists or mystery several blatantly ridiculous scenes tell you every bit of the story and come on genetically modified soldiers they could have come up with some better namebr br however this film should get some award for the most idiotic love scene i have never seen anything of the like i could not believe they were trying to be serious we have to get out of the wet clothes i think ill get hypothermia although everybody is wearing tshirts we need to cuddle together for body warmth is that your gun but but  werent there people who consciously did this there must have been a scriptwriter a director actors a gaffer an electrician some food guy why didnt anyone jump into that scene to stop this evil from happening was this film done by ravaging inhuman genetically modified film people i wont start at ranting about how many logical errors inconsistencies and scriptwriting flaws there were but even to the diehard actionfan this cant be anything but insultingbr br this film did actually ask for being rated 2 out of 10 so ill do it that favor but that leaves me to explain where the second star comes from specialeffects nah acting not really references to the game you wish wait they used the font from the game for the title and the credits that was neatbr br if you are looking for a flick for a bad movie night go for 2012  supernova this one is just  sad
