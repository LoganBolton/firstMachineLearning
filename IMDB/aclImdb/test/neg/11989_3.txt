i am deeply disturbed by some posts i am reading on the message boards for this movie people saying it is actually a good movie just because this movie is uwe bolls best to date does not make it a good movie at all no way in hell far cry is a clichéd mess full of bad acting poor direction and an uninspired story with a shoddy script this is bolls first pure action movie and news flash people action movies arent too hard to make because for a basic action flick all you need is explosions and gun battles scattered around a flimsy plot and hey mr boll succeeds in doing that house of the dead alone in the dark and bloodrayne all horror games adapted into movies by boll are far worse than this they have no redeeming qualities far cry boasts two things which make it his best yet two good leads and a couple of welldone action sequences til schweiger is quite good as jack carver and emmanuelle vaugier is a strong female lead the usually great udo kier is passable as the clichéd villain and the supporting cast are pretty damn bad towards the end of the film there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence which came as a shock considering boll was behind the camerabr br unfortunately the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feel to it with bad cgi lame oneliners and clichés around every corner oh and the worst lead up to a sex scene i think i have ever scene not only have the two only known each other for six hours but all it takes is for him to say he kept warm while in the army by spooning his fellow soldiers he already got her to take his clothes off by merely telling her to then he took his off and climbed into bed because he was afraid of hypothermiabr br anyway to summarise this is a bad movie it is mindless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you are totally bored one could probably do worse than popping this in and watching it but id personally say watch a classic action film like die hard or predator and stay away from this derivative messbr br 1½5
