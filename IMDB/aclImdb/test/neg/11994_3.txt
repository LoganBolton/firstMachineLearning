glenn ford a new york boy who has been saving his cash thumbs and hobos his way to the arizona ranch he has bought where he hopes to find heaven with a barbed wire fencebr br a film with a dalton trumbo script and story directed by villain extraordinaire ricardo cortez and starring the frequently twitchy glenn ford and the restless richard conte just shouldnt be so bloody nice though the system  mostly seen as mean cops and railroad bulls and real estate con men  is as awful as one might expect from the leftish mr trumbo every single proletarian is just so sweet and nice and salt of the earth that one feels nausea it doesnt help that the heroine  a sweet blonde thing who is an illegal alien refugee fleeing francos spain  is annoying for reasons of both scripting and actingbr br so why watch richard conte in his first role already has his persona and a pretty good part and there are some moments of 30s leftist camp that are pretty astonishing did dalton absolutely have to set a major portion of the movie in the russian workers mission all that was missing was a portrait of a beaming joe stalin also this is glenn fords first substantive role though his performance isnt goodbr br why not watch essentially the movie offers an unconvincing vision is wedded to a political viewpoint that is risible and the two leads have made much better movies also the strengths of dalton trumbo as a screenwriter are nowhere in evidence instead we get a film that the coen brothers barton fink could have written in a flash and avoided that hellish bout with writers block
