wow i suspected this one to be bad but now i find myself just at a loss for words honestly no words of mine can do this movie any justicebr br ill try to say something anywaybr br this truly is one unique gem one of the worst kindbr br lash la rue  given his background as an actor  doing a whipfight with a toltec sorcererzombie during the movies climax a true stroke of genius without a doubtbr br it rarely happens that i laugh out loud when watching a movie alone it happened numerous times with this onebr br the accents of the actors man the accents and the dialogues i heard them speak and the acting itself i just couldnt believe what i was hearingbr br that fat uncle farting so loudly when walking up to the house together with his little nephew for no apparent reason whatsoeverbr br tits yes theres titties and female ass theres even a naked chick in a bathtub sipping a beerbr br that one stretch his mouth over his facekill was the bomb a true highlightbr br the comedyaspects were just totally bonkers i just couldnt believe what i was seeing and hearing for a while i even thought that they were unintentional shaking my head in disbelief but about halfway in the movie i started to get the bigger picture guess it took me half a movie to dumbdown half of my brain to finally get itbr br i had a really hard time believing this movie but its good really i think it had one black chick walking up to a very tiny cupboard opening it and then saying wooow look at all the storage space and she said it like she meant it i mean thats good dialogue and good acting rightbr br oh and perhaps needless to say lash la rues whipskills suck major ass in the dark power its really sad and pathetic to behold thats all part of the comedy of course or wait i might be wrong no yes im wrong lash la rue was amazing with the whip it was the editors fault he messed it up cutting his lashes together and all or wait it might have been the camera operator he filmed from the wrong angles then why didnt phil smoot say anything thats it its the directors faultbr br but its a good moviebr br im just gonna quit talking about it i have nothing meaningful to say anyway except for the fact that i hope my brain will recover from this experience some time soon
