ladies and gentlemen allow us to introduce to you  the toltecs this ancient latin american tribe even preceding the aztecs supposedly had the most malevolent and bloodthirsty sorcerers yet they get their asses whooped by a couple of college floozies and a onehundredandsevenyear old lawman with a whip but before you get to see this however you have to struggle through more than 40 minutes of sheer boredom infantile pranks and sleazy sequences that dont contain any actual sleaze in case i havent made myself entirely clear yet the dark power is an indescribably cheesy and inept piece of 80s horror crap that still manages to be amusing because of its sheer and somewhat charming stupidity factor writerdirector phil smoots intentions were obviously admirable but he  as well as the rest of the cast  crew  lacked the talent and financial means to deliver something even halfdecent smoot carefully watched the evil dead and other similar demonicthemed movies and somehow must have thought he could pull this off as well the movie opens with an old indian guy dying in his isolated countryside house barely speaking out his last word above a whisper  toltecs his grandson promptly rents out house to a bunch of college chicks including a typically 80s aerobics babe a cute black girl and a racist redneck gal soon they will discover why exactly the old indian lived like a hermit as he was actually the guardian of an ancient toltec burial ground toltec sorcerers buried themselves alive only to emerge again thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living and honestly is there any better tasting flesh than that of bimbos as hinted at before already the first half of the dark power is terribly lame and sleepinducing the clichéd pranks the retarded dialogs and the ridiculously overlong footage of lash larue swinging around his whip seem to go on forever then the movie loses its last smidgen of credibility when the toltec sorcerers emerge from the ground instead of menacing they look like drugged out hard rock stars with imbecile masks and drunken gestures exactly one gory moment is worth mentioning when a guys lips are stretched out over his entire skull but overall even the carnage aspect of this movie is disappointing the only remotely worthwhile moments are utterly senseless like when a 9yearold kid named cletus goes joyriding with his uncles truck or when the vulgar naked chick sips beer in the bathtub after working out seriously unless you get turned on by the sight of a 1940s western veteran swinging around his whip at nothing id advise to skip this film
