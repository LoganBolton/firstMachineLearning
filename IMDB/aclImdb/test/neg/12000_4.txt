wow what a cheesy movie this is it starts off looking like its gonna be a backwoods slasher with the camera following dogs running through the woods it then gets a bit boring and follows the story of some girls moving into some house haunted by indian spirits we then get plenty of shots of one partially clad girl and another naked girl in the bath it suddenly gets really cheesy when the zombie indians arise from the earth and start terrorising the girls we even get a samurai indian br br this movie starts off pretty boring although i did find the story of the four indians who buried themselves alive quite interesting once the indian zombies or whatever you want to call them for they arent technically zombies start terrorising the girls is when all the fun begins this is not a special flick and cant be taken seriously its just something fun to watch when youre bored or when youre drinking with friends i cant help thinking though that it would have worked better as a short story because the first half is tediously boring
