problem child 2 was a complete waste of my time the original film wasnt very good but its a classic compared to this film the first film went over the top with its scenes of a devilish child wrecking major havoc in the lives of everyone hes around here it goes even further over the top and one scene in this movie proves that theory that carnival ride sequence was too much for me to stomach its awful this movie shouldnt have been madebr br 12 out of four
