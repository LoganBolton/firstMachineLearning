seriously youve just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it it came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy the little rascals mr nanny etc yet it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm every single character in the movie is driven by rage with the exception of trixies mother who shows only aggravation and weariness possibly at the tired clich√©s this movie enjoys br br to put it simply the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting nor the filming but most notably the writing the lines we receive are reminiscent of disney classics although this film lacks the wholeheartedness il walt managed to pull off juniors dad john ritter makes you mad without even doing anything simply because he allows junior to run around unsupervised and only gives him a stern warning when he tapes a 200pound behemoth to a chalk board br br also juniors grandfather is particularly excruciating for those of you who saw the first one found it nauseating and thus did not see the second one big ben healy as he is referred to in this movie is still a total douche he basically barges into john ritters house uninvited settles himself in juniors room even though he says that he hates junior and basically does nothing to accelerate the films speed or to support the film in any way rather he ticks off the audience by being a lazy free loaderbr br finally we are introduced to a wide variety of new characters such as the smug obnoxious trixie who carries dynamite in her backpack which she first lights then hands to junior who simply stares wide eyed at also gilbert gottfried returns in this film this time playing the obnoxious principal at juniors new elementary school if gilbert gottfried aint enough to get the point across i will put it simply this film reeksbr br 210 stars because the actors convictions shine through the film even though the script sucks
