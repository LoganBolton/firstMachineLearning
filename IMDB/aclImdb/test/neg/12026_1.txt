you know i really hate imdbs censor system since my entire review is almost gone if you take out the cursing but here we go editing timebr br holy moley is this bad i thought it might be a cool little movie judging by the plot summary since yknow ive blindly rented such gems as frailty and american nightmare before but this is just abominal its about a killer who uses edgar allen poes works as reference for his murderous exploits and the story of a detective who has to stop him cant these blithering hacks make a good movie without defiling the grave of a great horror writer i mean the kills in here are completely devoid of thought or originality and the references to poe are hokey and fake without enough thought put into them theyre shallow and they put poes work to shame full of holes with awful sequencing the acting is bad too reminding me of the abortion that was known in some third world countries as fear x what with all the pausing and unemotional linesbr br i realize this is an indie movie but thats no excuse ive seen high school kids act better then these morons and i myself couldve come up with better kill scenes and a better plot given ample timebr br this has no reason to exist avoid at all costs
