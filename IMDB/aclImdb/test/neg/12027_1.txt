i bought this movie sight unseen at a scifi convention and i got what i deserved for doing something so silly simply put this movie is implausible boring and unwatchablebr br i was so bored and disgusted with the lack of plot development that i turned it off to watch a repeat of mythbusters i understand that this was a very low budget move or least it looked like a very low budget move but that does not excuse the horrible acting terrible plot and even worse camera work it looks like something a group of college students did in between classes and getting drunkbr br maybe if the villain wasnt so laughable and the plot was something that actually could happen in real life with respect to law enforcement it might become so bad its funny this movie isnt funny its just bad
