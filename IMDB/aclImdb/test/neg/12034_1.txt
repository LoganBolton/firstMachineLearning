im so glad he wasnt alive to see this this movie is a debauchery of his work i agree with the other commenter this movie was a terrible disappointment id give it a zero but am forced to give it a 1br br the story was weak and it reminded me of the days when i was a young teenager trying to write a movie then looking back on it and realizing how horrible it was bad actors family and friends and someone stupid enough to fund it was how it was made its really amazing how strings can be pulled to get anything done if this movie was able to make it out to the general public it puts high hopes on other indie film makers who have talent worth a damn whore struggling this movie made me laugh but for all the wrong reasons by all accounts this was seriously not meant to be a comedy scary movie is a better play on a horror genre this movie just sucks
