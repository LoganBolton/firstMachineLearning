some movies you watch and you say well that made no sense and you dont really mean it youre just saying things were overly complicated or slightly nonsensicalbr br bread and circus makes no sense at all and i mean it and thats not because its surreal from the start its pretty clear its a feeble excuse to do splatter special effects theres no script theres no plot theres no story of any kind one event does not lead to the next  thats how fundamental the bad writing is herebr br so what i mean there are tons of movies out there that fall into that category they want to show you gore they give you gore why even talk about itbr br because in this case bread and circus gave me hope okay there are some surreal elements vaginas in the ground  people crawling out of them the earth in space two legs on either side these sorts of images are wonderful fun odd crazy but the movie doesnt do anything with thembr br stuff happens the movie ends and its all very unsatisfying i suspect the script was made up on the fly too bad if there had been a story of any kind at all it would have made for a much more entertaining filmbr br the film is very much like the beautiful car you would love to own then you lift up the hood and theres no engine just a small man peddling a bicyclebr br grr
