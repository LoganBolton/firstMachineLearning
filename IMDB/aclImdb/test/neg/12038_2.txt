a chicago couple dillon and dougherty are falsely accused of killing their daughter people begin to wonder if they did it the police investigate and find suspicious evidence the couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press the cops speculate that they are satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter they are charged and brought to trial they are represented by publicityseeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for 100000 the evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police fabricated intimations of sexual abuse are presented their other child is taken away from them and put in a foster home dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed verdict she didnt do it but he did he goes to the slams with a sentence of 45 yearsbr br in the last third of the movie with dillon in jail and dougherty wondering what to do next we see people who have been antagonistic now slowly coming to the couples defense witnesses admit to having lied other facts are brought to light that finally result in dillons release the killer is never found though the movie gives us a thorough whacko as a plausible perpbr br this is a weeper from beginning to end nothing seems to go right for the couple oh there are a few happy moment maybe a party where everyone is glad to be together and tearing up with joy or some point of evidence in their favor is discovered and people hug one another but its never long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all the faces are frozen in tragic disbelief usually a fade to block follows there isnt necessarily anything wrong with moving tragedies although i cant imagine what pleasure we get out of seeing people suffer theres plenty of tragedy in shakespeare too i suppose whatever we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way theyre told oh but i am fortunes fool romeo cries after killing juliets brother here we have dougherty running in her robe through a hospital corridor screaming wheres my baby there isnt any ambiguity or irony in the story  as im sure there must have been in the real life events on which its based people are either good or bad here or else theyre bad then they turn goodbr br the film isnt aimed at exploring human quirkiness or the way things work out its aimed at wrenching tears from the audience the actors provide firstrate role models i cant remember the last movie in which i saw so many tears there are rivulets of tears showers of them cascades of them a veritable niagara of them a lake lacrymose of thembr br well ill give one example of the efficiency with which the movie is crafted dillon and dougherty hire a chicago cop who works on the side as a private investigator ed asner asner is sympathetic to them but he doesnt really accomplish much he seems to be in the movie not because of his importance to the case but because he can provide the victimized couple with a kind of philosophy  learn to live with it which is okay  and because he suffers from colorectal cancer so we can watch him take his medicine double over with pain and finally pass awaybr br whats frustrating about the movie is that in focusing so intensely on the suffering of the couple it sidesteps one of the more important issues that it raises  the function of gossip in regulating private livesbr br gossip is a strange thing really if we call it gossip its bad but if we call it public opinion it sounds acceptable at the very least of course we all have convictions about issues that may or may not be justified as i write michael jackson is once again being brought to court accused of molesting a young boy and i wonder how many of us thrilled at the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile but gossip isnt all bad either its like water when its properly controlled its a community asset we need gossip to keep each other in line it helps us to maintain public order but like water in a flood or a tsunami it is ruinous to a village when it rages out of controlbr br this is a movie thats okay if youre not looking for too much in the way of insight into human nature its done so cleverly that given its goal its hard to argue with it
