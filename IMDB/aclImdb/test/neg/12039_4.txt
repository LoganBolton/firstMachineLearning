they prove that the cops when they cant find the real perpetrators always blame the parents and accuse them of sexual abuse of their kids these movies always depict the press as a bunch of animals and have the parents coming out of court to feed the press hunger to humiliate the griefstricken hasnt anybody ever heard of a courthouse back door in these movies here you have a psychic who tells them exactly what happened and where the body can be found but the police are not told and nobody heeds his findingsbr br the police are portrayed as blockheads who dont know what they are doing and theres always an outside detective like ed asner who comes in late on the case believes in the parents and solves the mysterybr br also after the parents are cleared they dont spit in the faces of the dumb cops who put them in jail took their kid away and accused them of killing their own childbr br it looked as if ive see this film many times before
