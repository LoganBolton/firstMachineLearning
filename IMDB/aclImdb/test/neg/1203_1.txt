i remember watching this for the first time in the 80s as a teen man ive read the reviews on this trash and i find myself astonished by the voting this movie does not deserve four stars this movie is not better than topgun topgun has its own problems dont get me wrong this movie should be banned just for its own stupidity so many stereotypes so many loop holes so much poor dialog i cannot think of one redeeming quality of this vomit this is not actionadventure this is a bad joke on film kinda like watching plan 9 with stock f16 footage this movie not only defies logic and common sense within the context of a military setting it sends a disturbing message the military is not going to save your dad from the imminent evil of the middle east bds so go out there and hijack a multimillion dollar weapon and blast him out of the sinister clutches of the backwards antiamerican arabs cuz you cant reason with those animals this is a bruckheimer flick without a budget bland direction weak acting lame music idiotic plot equalsiron eagle
