i thought that this movie might be a good spoof or at least a good independent comedy like friday instead it was more like something someone in high school would make with their parents camcorder it wasnt just the low budget that makes this film bad many great films have been made on a low budget it is simply a bad movie and it wasnt even bad enough to be good camp case in point for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking dope put on their makeup and then answer a phone call you keep waiting for something to get story moving but it never comes the sound was so bad i had to turn the tv up all the way just to almost make out what they were saying which wasnt interesting anyways if i pay to rent a movie i will usually suffer through it even when its bad but it was all i could do to sit through 20 minutes it looks like the person before me felt the same way because they didnt rewind the tape and left off about the same place i did the only reason i gave this a score of 1 is because the rating system doesnt have negative numbers
