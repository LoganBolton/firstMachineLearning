this movie really shows its age the print i saw was terrible due to age but it is possible that there are better prints out there however this was not the major problem with the movie the problem was that although the film was made in 1933 it was essentially a silent film with only the barest of dialog scattered only a few sentences in the film in the most amateur fashion sometimes the characters backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their facesall in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and cleaverly  hide the fact that the film was dubbed well its true that this czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious it just looked cheapbr br overall the film looked low budget and silly its really a shame though because there was a grain of a good storya young woman who marries an older man who is either gay andor has no interest in women but in the 21st century few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess even with a few glimpses of the naked and somewhat chunky hedy lamarr it isnt worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted even by 1933 standards this film was a poorly made dud about the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different lamarr looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image hollywood created when she came to americashe looks like 2 completely different peoplebr br its such an incomplete looking and technically inferior film i dont see how it has gotten such rave reviews for technical problems alone the movie cant rate a 10 or anything near it
