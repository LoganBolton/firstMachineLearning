tediously long dreary cinematic waffle i couldnt believe how bad this film was i watched it merely because of the numerous people who gushed about it on this site was i watching the same film the entire episode is onedimensional nothing that happened in garps past affected his or anyone elses future and noone was affected by their past i think it was socrates who said about plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect then it shouldnt be there obviously the director didnt know this rule and so stuffed his work with one dire scene after another even the plane crashing into the house was unexpected it wasnt a surprise but it was unexpectedbr br it is worth mentioning that at the time of writing this 1st dec 2002 even though many people say it is one of their favourite films no one has bothered to add a memorable quote the reason being that there simply arent anybr br dont waste your time watching this watch a plank warp instead
