who the heck is responsible for this terrible mangling of one of my favorite books this is just terrible terrible acting terrible script the story isnt even close to its old self  and what were they thinking robin williams for goshs sake this really defies description dont see this seriously dont not even for laughs especially not if youre a fan of the book this might just be the worst movie adaptation ever  everything is disjointed and scrambled  the characters which are important in order to understand the sequence of events are seriously marginalized and every potentially interesting location from the book has been changed example vienna  new york into something profoundly uninterestingbr br for those who havent read the book  its basically a fictional biography about a writer growing up exploring his writing and so on his mother writes an autobiography which is hailed despite her protests as a sort of feminist manifesto the book is wellwritten engaging and long its prose is simply beautifulbr br this movie on the other hand is about robin williams once again telling us to seize the day
