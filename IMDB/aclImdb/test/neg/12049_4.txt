empty shortening of john irvings novel strives for profundity courageously but ends up being absurd its a quirky goofy and bittersweet string of sketches attempting to explain a mans growth from birth to adulthood and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround him garp is born to a formidable unmarried mother jenny fields played by glenn closethe various stages of garps childhood are played by three young actors before robin williams takes over as garp reaches adulthood the story follows him through childhood at a boys prep school where jenny is the school nurse through his high school passionswrestlingwritingand sexto marriage with his high school sweetheart children marital problems and a writing career jenny meanwhile has become a famous feminist  espousing an unorthodox cause the plot details an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and outlandish adventures williams gives a cherubfaced performance this script was not fitting for his wildness and anarchy and thus his talent was wasted hes like an injured bird sputtering out of control john lithgows role as a father like transsexual imparting wisdom also doesnt make sense this movie was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982 due to the popularity of robin williams and his new entry into movies williams had recently shed his mork and mindy pursuits and focused more on standup comedy and movies audiences were confused by this film especially by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending
