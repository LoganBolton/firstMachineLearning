yeah i bought camp blood and it wasted about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money on this crap i mean i didnt expect an amazing movie judging by the front cover i wasnt really expecting anything great but at least not boobies in the first 3 seconds im not complaining about the boobies im complaining about what the hell that has to do with anything this film should have been kept on there hand cam at home as a jokethey suckwhy was the blood more brown and turd like that real bloodcheap i tells ya i mean everyone wasnt in colour they were just tinted yellow and another thing that made me die laughing at this sad excuse for a film was the fact that they tried to pretend the clown was a woman all the time although its clearly a flat chested black short haired mandid anyone else notice that the only special effect in this film was a slowed down jumpthat was also poor oh and the dissolve effect that you can find on many basic pc programs such aspowerpointthis film blows
