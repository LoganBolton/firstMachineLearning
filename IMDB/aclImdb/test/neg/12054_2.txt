well what can i say what the fk there really isnt much to say about this really the only way you would like this is if u like me like bad bad horror to laugh atbr br acting very unconvincing just watch the last scene with the main actresses running ripoff of texas chainsaw massacre but in a bad way just awfulbr br gore really not believable in one scene they use one of those knives which have a chunk cut out of them which fit over a body part etc by using thiswith the addition of red ketchup its supposed 2 look real although it really doesntbr br plot predictable kids get lost in woods on camping weekend movie ripped off from friday the 13thbr br killer quality scary mask if youre scared of clowns kinda unbelievable that someone would chose this as their costume however the director obviously realised all the good costumes had been used in all the other horrorcamp movies out therebr br total 310  ps stay away from camp blood ii that one made this look like lord of the rings
