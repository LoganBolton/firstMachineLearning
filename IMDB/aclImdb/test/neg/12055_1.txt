but i cant say how i really feel about this pile of steaming dung where to begin the film quality there isnt any ive seen clearer pictures on americas funniest home videos the acting is substandard the gore effects is okay the clown mask is the best part of this movie the story is repetitive the same thing over and over again at least in a friday the 13th or halloween we stick with one main character for the most part there is no main characters just victims man now we come to the worst part of all the final survivor kills the clown and finds out it was one of her friends then when the police finally arrive they dont believe her and she is locked up in a rubber room what kind of ending do you call that crap thats what in my opinion there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie that was just sloppy writing the excuse it has to ending badly its a horror movie or we need to end it badly to leave it open to a sequel are just lame excuses and that is all i must give the camp blood the thanksgiving turkey
