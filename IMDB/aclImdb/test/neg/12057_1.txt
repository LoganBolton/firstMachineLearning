how to round up every possible cliché and stereotype existing in the genre of horror and then subsequently stuff them into one massively lousy movie the answer camp blood this is amateurish slasher nonsense made on a microbudget and a little bit too obvious inspired by friday the 13th four of the most intolerable teenage characters youll ever see  theyre like a combination of ugly stupid and annoying  go camping and quickly find themselves pursued by a homicidal maniac in a clown suit dont even ask me what the killers motivations were or even who heshe was because if it did feature in the film i totally missed it this is one of the worst movies ever made with no inspiration or craftsmanship whatsoever the production values were so pitiable that there are actors playing multiple roles without even bothering to make them unrecognizable the only halfdecent and worthwhile sequence throughout the whole of camp blood is the opening in which the impressively voluptuous meredith obrien has sex in the woods with her geeky boy scout yes im fully aware that this is a totally shallow remark to make but then again this is a juvenile and retarded film so who cares
