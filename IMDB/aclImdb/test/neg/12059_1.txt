camp blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film were mixing friday the 13th with the blair witch project and addinga killer in a clown maskbr br the budget for this film must have been very low some of the actors played multiple parts and the camera used produced a picture equal to the colourised version of the original night of the living dead which if anybody has watched that version will back me up that it is poorbr br this film was just so bad there is nothing in the film even worth watching the very fact i watched this all the way through stunned me just take my advice and dont buy or rent this film it is appalling
