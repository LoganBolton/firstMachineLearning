i liked this move when i was a kid but now that im older i can see how absurd the plot really is in case you didnt read the earlier reviews its about a teenager and an air force colonel who steal two fully loaded f16s to rescue said teenagers dadbr br it does have some nice aerial stunts even if the dialog accompanying then is basically teckno babelbr br some unintentional humor in the edited for tv version when the heros dad is being held by iran err i mean an unnamed country and his captors ask him for a confession relating to why hes being held dont worry about exactly why or what they want him to confuse to he says tell him he can take my confession and shove it down his throat however his lips and more importunely his gesture make it clear what motion and part of the anatomy he was really thinking of
