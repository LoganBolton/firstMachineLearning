1st watched 7192003  1 out of 10dirbrad sykes ridiculously lame 3d movie which pretty much follows the plots of many 80s teen slasher flicks stupid kids go to a known murderous camp site become hunted by an unknown masked man and then we try to figure out who if anyone is going to live we really dont care whos behind the mask but even thats not hard to figure out if youve seen any of these kinds of movies what a waste of a 3d viewer despite somewhat decent 3d effects
