i must first mention that as a group of mates we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are known to be terrible for comedy value hence our rental of camp bloodbr br camp blood was the first film which wed rented that had been shot on what looks to be a camcorder and was so rubbish it wanst even funnybr br the dvd was returned and a refund was demanded with the added suggestion some sort of quality control is implemented to prevent such utter rubbish being stockedbr br dont do what i did and let the curiosity get the better of you its so bad its not even funny
