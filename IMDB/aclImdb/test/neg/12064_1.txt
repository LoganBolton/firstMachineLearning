i am a fan of slasher movies especially of scream 13 but this one is just one killing after another to my astonishment part ii is far better and you get the whole story of part one summarized so dont waste time on this one and move right on to part ii you wont regret it cause part 2 actually has a plot and is quite selfironical first part 1 out of 10 second part 4 out of 10
