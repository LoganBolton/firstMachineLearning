dont bother to check for logic there is none but on the other hand there are many really great movies that totally lack logic so why botherbr br i both like and dislike this film i like it because the action sequences in the air are really great you get to see a lot of dogfighting i also like the f16 which is a very cool planebr br but there are just too many goofs to make me really enjoy it i guess its not fair to wish for some sort of continuity as it is hard to make a really good fighter film  but i also think there should be some sense of reasonbr br and i have a question do they fly from california to the middle east in f16s without air refueling id like to see that happening
