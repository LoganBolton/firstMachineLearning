woody allen who i have to confess at the outset i have never been a big fan of directed this quasidocumentary about the life of emmett ray sean penn a 1930s jazz guitarist whose star apparently shone for a while then quickly faded penn does a credible job in the role portraying a complicated and somewhat neurotic man not unlike allen himself which perhaps explains why woody would be attracted to this project who cant maintain relationships and whose twin passions aside from guitar playing were shooting rats at the dump and watching trainsbr br there isnt a great deal of consistency to the story its narrated in a sense by a series of modernday jazz experts one of whom is allen himself who relate their various theories and interpretations of different events in rays life the end result is a wildly inconsistent account of the life of a fictional man who seems to have been given a fairly interesting life story by his creators who probably should have done a better job with it br br jazz fans and fans of woody allen will probably enjoy this as for me the best i can give it is a 310
