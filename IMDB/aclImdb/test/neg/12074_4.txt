this film follows the life of a great guitar player who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly almost to the point of self destructionbr br i was expecting the usual woody allen witty dialogs sarcasm and humour but sweet and lowdown failed to provide any the main character emmet ray is an egocentric rude irresponsible and hurtful man he is so unlikeable that i do not want to now about him or care about him i wonder why a film about him has to be made the pacing of the story is slow making the film a terrible bore even sean penns great acting fails to revive the film to a watchable levelbr br i like woody allens films a lot but sweet and lowdown is a major disappointment
