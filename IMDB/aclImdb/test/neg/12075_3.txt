wow did this episode start on a stooooopid premise the enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden abraham lincoln is floating around in space and welcomes the enterprise is it just me or is this a really lamebrained idea lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet where they meet other famous dead folksboth good and evil it seems that a really cheesylooking rock monster has assembled a team of good and evil people to battle it out for supremacy the whole thing seems really daffy and inherently unfair as the good side is saddled with suraka vulcan who makes gandhi seem like rambo despite a totally awful premise the action is pretty good and its great to see overhead shots of obvious doubles fighting it out in this grudge match but dont mistake this for high art or deep scifi the bottom line is that the series was on its last legs as a firstrun series and this really looked like they dusted off this turkey and filmed it regardless of the absurdity of the premise
