this movie had potential if it had been handled differently what it needed was a different director thats certain and perhaps a different leading lady i just cant understand the minnie driver character  or at least how she played it she was completely unbelievable i cannot believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either she was probably abandoned by the director or incapable of delivering what the director was trying to get her to do i am writing this as i am still watching it im thinking i would have hated to be in her shoes trying to act something i didnt understand well weve just proceeded to the affair she begins with the son im still watching im now beginning to be profoundly embarrassed for everyone involved in this enterprise if you enjoy watching movies that miss their mark in a big way then watch this one
