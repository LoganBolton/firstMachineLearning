despite strong performances by minnie driver and tom wilkinson this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewerbr br by the way what has become of ms driver she had such a potential in the film industrybr br this to me was almost like an 1850s version of yentl without the musical fanfare with the death of her father driver takes a position as a governess to a christian family hiding her jewish identitybr br while i realize that this is a period peace it was awfully dull even for 1850 england and scotlandbr br the lady of the house is most irritating with that singsong voice of hers i expected her to refer to driver as dear at any moment what kind of name is mary blackchurch i know that driver is trying to pass herself off as a christian but does this name signify all the waybr br in the interim mary finds love with the young charges father wilkinson and his emotionally unbalanced sonbr br in the end the only thing that we see accomplished is that mary has found a profession to provide for her familyphotography did we really have to be subjected to what was happening throughout the filmbr br the early scenes of judaism practiced in 19th century england and the cholera epidemic at the end could have been played up more there is a definite underlying feeling of antisemitism by the wilkinson family but thats never allowed to come out
