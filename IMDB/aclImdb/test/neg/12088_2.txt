the governess was by far a very pitiful film i do not use this word loosely as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie i finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind  why honestly you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit there were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development both in the story and in the characters which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation scenes would occur with no foreshadowing understanding or drive to a complete ending it was as if i was watching several different ideas thrown together without really any resolution actors were setting events in motion that did not seem to fit their character or really were resolved this was my biggest issue with this film the complete and utter lack of structure to this film brought all specks of foundation crumbling down with a genuine rippleeffect being felt throughout the rest of the film as a resultbr br let me explain myself further on this lack of consistency throughout the film i would liken this film to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that had a zebra in it it made no sense nor was there any logic behind it all minnie driver was the worst culprit of this deed her characters lines were drawn very fuzzy and nearly transparent she would do things like talk about sex all the time with her sister but yet she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time she has her first moment of passion in this film and there is no pain or excitement it nonchalantly happens and this just didnt seem to fit the original conversation that we had at the beginning of the film with rosina and her sister she is a very intelligent woman that accidentally finds a solution to wilkinsons problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention that was confusing and completely random is it not obvious to anyone else that her teaching methods were nonexistent anyone in their right mind could see that she wasnt teaching cavendishs daughter anything the sudden and awkward relationship that randomly forms between driver and jonathan rhysmeyers nearly had me laughing out loud i thought maybe i had discovered some magic in this film as rhysmeyers literally poofed into the scene and suddenly caused some unneeded drama it felt that the director or writer was thinking that the original story was going nowhere fast so by adding this random character we may be able to advance the plot a bit or confuse the lesser film enthusiasts well it didnt fool me i saw that he was nearly a cutandpaste character used to strengthen an already weakened story dont get me started on the ending which had no consistency to the rest of the story again using the cutandpaste method the writer of this film needed a way to just end the story and this was the only solution they could arrive to it is sad when actors are forced to do things out of character  but i guess that is the name of the game in hollywood fix until completely broken or at least salvageablebr br the remainder of the story was unexciting dribble there were maybe a handful of neat cinematography moments where you could see that there was one sliver of creativity trying to peak through coupled with some bars of decent period piece music but nothing to write to grandma about more family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this film a bit more but as i stated before by leaving openended scenes just lying around the entire film you will experience a crack in your foundation what may seem like a sturdy story will eventually wear down over time and by the end of this film i felt that the house was crumbling down on top of me wilkinson plays his normal self in this film while driver apparently did not want to get naked but everyone else had too i will have to see a doctor after those images were burned into my eyes  eeewwww also she wore the same dress everyday that was disgusting and i could smell her through the television sex and dirty laundry now there is a great film for you there just seemed to be some potential floating around here but instead it was just rubbish nothing was answered questions seemed to fall like snow in alaska and mediocrity seemed to reign supremebr br overall this could have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love together but instead it was just pitiful i cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that characters were going through motions without any sort of preexplanation i dont need cinematic moments handed to me like a child but something should have been done to build a foundation just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that i used if you were as confused about that as i was then you will completely understand the film the governess while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal  then maybe this film is for youbr br grade  out of
