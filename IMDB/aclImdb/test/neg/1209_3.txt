its hard to believe that a movie this bad wasnt produced once but four times most movies require a certain suspension of reality to enjoy but this one takes it just too far the basic scenario is an air force pilot who is shot down over a middle eastern country the us government drags its feet in recovering him leading the pilots son doug masters to attempt a rescue missionbr br the problem i have with the movie is that it depicts the us air force as one colossal joke in the movie youll find that doug and his friends on the air base manage to secure two f16s all the munitions the fuel the intel for the mission and so on security on this base seems to be a joke nobody seems to have a problem that a sixteenyearold kid is fully qualified to pilot an f16br br if that wasnt enough you would think the producers would at least attempt to get the munitions right since people like to see things blow up not so several times in the movie doug fires off aim9 missiles on ground targets aim stands for air intercept missile meaning a weapon used to strike targets in the air he also fires off 1520 missiles where the maximum an f16 can hold is 6 aim9s the movie also lacks continuity youll see the aircraft configured with one set of munitions and in the next scene it has a totally different munitions package also 20mm doesnt just completely destroy anything it touches an f16 will hold 500 rounds of 20mm and its mostly used for selfdefensebr br i could go on forever with plot holes flaws and outright wrong information from the movie but i wont bore you if youre in the mood to see a good air force movie your choices are rather slim most military movies deal either with the army navy or marines until hollywood can come up with an air force movie on the lines of saving private ryan or a few good men well be forced to watch movies like the iron eagle seriesbr br
