what a waste of energy and money what a waste of what talent there wasbr br emilio estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused throughout jon lovitz was very mildly amusing but pointless harry dean stanton  why bother and was it just me or can kari wuhrer barely act in this onebr br the story was pretty nonexistent and really disjointed one of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that transpired like the surf dudes giving up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half how about that you never saw them surf once the setup to some scenes took way to long with not enough payoff to make us give a damn nothing in this movie felt really true or genuinebr br the only good things i can say is some very little of the scenery was filmed nicely and a few scenes were mildly interesting dont see this when there is so many better pointless movies out there
