one can only sit in utter amazement at this mess of a film and be amused at some of the raves people have bestowed upon it the biggest problem seems to be the directors inability to make up his mind as to whether its black comedy farce or a combination of both it meanders all over the place in search of direction and has some utterly embarrassing performances that might be better suited to bad sitcom what a shame to see the talented dianne wiests comic talents squandered and the ever annoying jane birkin is so over the top shes more bothersome than usualbr br perhaps a lot of the positive criticism is due to the quirky french nature of the film  therefore its labeled smart or genius its neither instead its bad tripe that leaves a rather rancid aftertaste merchantivory should stick to the serious stuff as they certainly have no comprehension of comedy
