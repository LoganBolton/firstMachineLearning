ill preface my review by stating that i am not a fan of the independent straight to video genre that owes a great debt to the grindhouse films of the 60s i dont own any ive never rented any so i might lack the appreciation for these tongueincheek lowbudget stinkers that many other people havebr br i caught this movie on cinemax late one saturday evening with a lady friend please dont ask me why i was watching cinemax late one saturday evening with a lady friend we were bored with world championship poker some atrociously bad acting courtesy of misty mundae and i wish she wouldnt own up to being from illinois as we actually turn out some very bright thespians here caught our attention now normally the aim of some good softcore porn would be to get you and your partner in the mood some good sex tongue in cheek humor and who know what could happen after about 15 minutes and a scene where the title character seduces a mugging victim my lady friend said if you want to watch the rest of this fine i am going to bed so i dont have to please turn the volume off here is what i gather from the plot mistys character is a sexless nerd who gets bitten by a spider and turns into a supersex kitten with super web slinging powers that dont come from her wrists there is some sort of evil villainess involved who didnt look particularly evil or sexy spiderbabe saves the day has sex mj who is male in this film constantly gets propositioned by stereotypically bad gay bikers and somehow the evil villainess gets pushed off a building to her deathbr br what was good about this film it endedbr br what was bad about it acting to make a third grade pageant look like oscar winners a script turned out by people who i picture to be drunken collegeaged sex perverts who wouldnt know what sex is if they took a class taught by dr ruth special effects that were about as special as someone jumping off a trampoline humor about as funny as well i have yet to encounter anything that is lamer the sex scenes if we were watching a video the only thing those scenes would have turned on is the fast forward button and the action scenes some of my old atari vcs games had better choreographybr br now i know this type of film is supposed to be enjoyed for its inherent badness companies like ei dont set out to make good movies they have a niche and they target it my experience as a marketer tells me they are right on the money in servicing their audience but after my brief exposure to spiderbabe i for one can say i am not delving into that world again any time soon maybe the problem with the filmmakers in this type of genre is this they spend so much attention to making the films bad that if they made an effort to try and focus on those things they do very well they would turn out some very enjoyable le bad cinema a la troma films in the 80s sorry folks the spirit is there but the effort isntbr br though i have to admit that alice in acidland intrigues me
