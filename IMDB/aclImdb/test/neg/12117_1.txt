any evening with jonathan ross now means to me his wit in first hassling and upsetting with carefully chosen words a 78 year old man by phone and then suggesting he and russell brand should housebreak and masturbate him while he slept as a way to say sorry for making obscene phone calls to him kinky and illegal for a really big laugh maybe next time he should try it on someone he knows well like his boss or a follower of abu hamza would he be amused if someone did it to one of his daughtersbr br over all the years ive perhaps seen less than 30 minutes of bbc star man rosss chat show because i find him so loathsome some of the guests i saw were ok though  probably most of them who ever appeared were ok for all i know as a chat show it seems pretty poor though  whats so chatty about asking tory leader david cameron on this tv programme whether he ever masturbated to photographs of margaret thatcher he chatted up gwyneth paltrow by simply asking her if she wanted to f him however rosss yob mentality was finally totally exposed with the above revelations and i thought id take the opportunity to warn the few decent folk around the world who might not know just how vile this man is and to steer clear of him and his  unless you think all comedy should be edgy ie obscenevacuous were not yet all the same here although bbc and channel 4 are jettisoning all standardsbr br in october 2008 ross with fellow tosser russell brand made a series of premeditated sexual obscene phone calls to andrew sachs answerphone manuel from fawlty towers had it broadcast as intended on bbc national radio against sachs request and then tried to get sachs granddaughter to burn the evidence in case they got prosecuted a significant number of people over here probably most of them non bbc license fee payers found it hilarious andor that the national scandal had been overblown but many people apparently still knew right from wrong and 42851 eventually complained to bbc about the incident many unrighteous media fools and others snickered about these 42851 never having heard the radio programme and never wanting to  using their argument they presumably also consider an event such as the holocaust justified because at the time relatively few people complained to the media and none of us here now should be horrified by it because we werent there the 2 bbc producers initially involved in passing it for broadcast thought it was very funny and brilliant comedy and only 2 people complained about brands radio programme at the time  which im afraid only indicated the moral level his 400000 weekly listeners had sunk to with the help of bbc expertise highly moral bbc tried and failed to use it in mitigation in the later ofcom investigation roll over aristotle tell lord reith the news sachs agent complained to bbc but was ignored by them until a tory national newspaper got hold of the story the penalty for any ordinary pervert doing this would normally be sacking and prosecution maybe even prison but while brand and the head of bbc radio 2 were both eventually ordered to resign the multimillionaire ross was given a 12 week holiday by bbcs boss i suppose that he asked rosss permission first though if he could dock rosss pay by £1500000 to prevent him from suing to come back to this programme afresh in 2009 before his contract runs out all that time to think of more smut andor more insulting witlessness for his 4000000 viewers to admire  but at least he could still chortle his way to the bank as usual to keep his spirits up some people think that his position will be untenable and he wont be able to carry on i think his skin is so thick because the stakes are so high that he will come back unbowed and reenergised with pent up vitriol update 230109 ive just watched the first 5 minutes of his new series  the most enormous cockup  to use his referential phrase  is continuing to allow this sniggering unrepentant lawbreaker to take the publics money like this but who knows maybe in the future after the slimy british film  tv industries have comforted him for the moral stance taken by the 42851 and showered him with awards he will become a sir for his services to perversion by the perverts in government at the least i hope this pair of edgy deviants sign up with other perverted commercial tv and radio stations and stay there so i wont be paying for their flouting the law and spouting illegal obscenities in the future in 2009 ofcom fined british tv licensefee payers £150000 for this sorry affair  thanks ross for offering to pay notbr br to the apologists get a lifesense of humoursense of proportion its not the end of the world having a pair of talentless perverts as your heroes and theres far more important things to worry about in this world like the price of real cheese to sum up family man dross a comedy genius to apparently millions of people especially himself merely a nasty obscene phone caller receiving an obscene wage packet from an obscene multimedia company to others so much for our society of political correctness and respect as you shouldve guessed it doesnt apply to the rich and famous and never will but only to the poor to sum up bbc stumbling blindly on from huttongate campbellgate dykegate springergate crowngate phonegate now rossgate i hope its next crisis will be abolitiongate i also hope anyone who thinks comedy should be always challenging and pushing back boundaries ie offensive arent challenged or offended by my opinion of this particular lawbreaking pervert his perverted programmes and his current perverted employers
