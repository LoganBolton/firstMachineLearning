i loved so much last bellocchios movie the masterpiece lora di religione it had a great screenplay great actors well have to say castellitto is so much greater than others a brillant use of lights for a great cinematographybr br well buongiorno notte is a different story ridiculous screenplay erupting tons of morals and we could speak weeks about politics you know we are italians poor cinematography its too simple representing 70s dark years with dark colors and dark lights do some efforts more peoples bad use of music whats the point of using psychedelia to represent the tragic rationality of brigate rossebr br and to all the people who claimed the main prize in venice i answerare you nuts maybe the russian film was bad but not as bad as thisbr br im down with the pe dont believe the hype
