i wrote spoiler alert but theres not really much that can be spoiled its like spoiling rotten meat this movie is probably the worst ive ever seen not because of the actors or the special effects but because of the sheer number of mistakes both factual and physical first of all the migs arent actually migs at all theyre mirages and theyre french and how the heck can dougs dad withstand the maneuvers his son makes to fight off the migs without a gsuit and why would chappy try to board his plane without a gsuit and how could doug defeat the enemy pilot ace with such ease anyway i did not like this movie and the worst part is that it has 3 sequels the latest one from as late as 1995 now thats scary
