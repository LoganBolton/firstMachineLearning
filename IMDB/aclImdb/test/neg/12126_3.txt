the plot of open graves is very simpleits about a board game called mambawhere the players die in real life the same way they die in the gamelaughable death scenes include killings via computer generated crabs and snakesthe characters are cardboard and deliberately annoying and there isnt even a tiny bit of suspensei liked eliza dushku in wrong turnbut she is completely wasted and unmemorable herethe climax with cgiwitch coming from the sea is utterly laughable and stupidthe only reason to see open graves are some interesting camera angles plus sexy eliza dushkuif such movies are the future of horror then i seriously give upgive me any 70s or 80s lowbudget horror flick over this modern piece of crapa generous 3 out of 10
