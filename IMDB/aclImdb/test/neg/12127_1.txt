this movie was terrible the acting was lame but its hard to tell if someone was acting well since the writing was so bad this is one of johnny depps worst movies i highly discourage anyone from watching itbr br if you must see crybaby though i recommend muting it and simply ogling at mr depp for and hour and a half
