waterss contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a telescope and then whenif something is found by sheer chance and lots of luck it has to be analyzed with a microscopebr br and after it has been analyzed it would get discarded into the labs rubbish bin for totally useless things one single atom of that microscope is worth all of his movies combinedbr br cb is etremely campy and intentionally so the usual jw stuff comicstrip dialogue simplistic plot moronically cheerful characters chewinggum pop overacting etc waters knows that he is incabaple of making a movie of quality so he hides behind the mask of the intentionally cheesy filmmaker  which supposedly makes him a special kind of antiartist but in the world of cinema being an antitalent often gets mistaken for talent which is exactly what waters had hoped for  and eventually got its a con act charlatans infest the world of cinema and modern pop art its a plaguebr br perhaps we have john waters to blame for inspiring baz luhrman to make all those horrible dumb turkeys its like a virus one waters creates five new bad directors and then these five each create more and so on where will it end with dancer in the dark can that bomb actually be topped
