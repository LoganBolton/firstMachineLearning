hehim surprised this movie still exists in any form let alone it being available for rent br br this flick is one of the many bad slasher flicks that exist only for the ta and the cheap laughs the story line crosses a bit of texas chainsaw massacre with a screwy mammacentred back story reminiscent of psycho and a bit of the good old womeninchains toughasnailexcon broads tossed in for good measure  in other words complete unoriginality wrapped up in half naked women spiced with a dash of utter idiocy looking on as the director attempts to make the marsh land of quebec pass off as southern us bayou land is sad i tell ya br br funny thing for me is i was actually at the premier of this flick as at the time i was pals with ratchford the films star it was painful to watch on as jeremy sank into his seat whilst the flick unfolded its mangled wingsbr br im happy to see that ratchford after this sham of a first flick has grown into one hell of an actor he can be seen regularly on the canadian cop drama blue murder has appeared on csi not to mention his role in the classic clint eastwood film unforgiven  we forgive ya jeremy it was a rocky start but you done good man br br tpaul
