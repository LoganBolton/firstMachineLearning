this is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film billy dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands its fairly gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters but still its not that interesting either and billy dees character though maltreated by white authority figures doesnt really come off as sympathetic its also hurt by its extremely low budget still its interesting to look at as its a good depicttion of 1970s social issues
