gold raiders 1951br br a dull westerncomedy feature with the three stooges including shemp howard at this point who ive always enjoyed as the third stooge doing their usual schtick and directed by the normally dependable edward bernds who also did some of their funniest classic shorts  so one has to wonder just what went wrong this time the most probable answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15minute tworeeler comes up as too much for a 55minute feature film unlike so many of their classic short subjects gold raiders is not worth revisitingbr br 12 of
