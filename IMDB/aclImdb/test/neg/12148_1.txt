the horrific production doesnt qualify as a film it was obviously shot on video tape and very poorly at that there is a constant screaching sound for the audiosounds like a bad microphone which is so annoying that you sometimes cannot understand what the characters are saying badly dubbedin music will suddenly appear in a scene and the entire editing of this thing rates about a zerobr br the plot is contrived and ridiculous a late 20s gay man trying to hide his livein lover from parents visiting please and the reaction the mother has when she finds a picture of her son kissing his boyfrioend is beyond melodramatic and rolls right into stupid talk about a stereotypical view of gay life the acting is worse than a porno movie and the direction is very poorbr br as far as production goes there isnt anybr br this title is simply a lame videotaped attempt to call itself a film there is no heart and soul to give it even the smallest bit of praisebr br its just a stupid waste of time so avoid it at all costs bad acting bad writing bad directing  and the title of producer is vanity as this trash probably costed them the price of the videotape they shot it onbr br this ametuer garbage has no business getting released onto a dvd as its deceptive to the cunsomer i cannot stress how horrible this sugarplum crap isbr br
