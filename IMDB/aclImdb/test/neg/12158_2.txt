i watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful br br awfully long  even though they managed to skip through the majority of his lifebr br awfully boring  the parts they included were longwinded and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained br br awfully inaccurate  the wholemystical side to this film was a joke and last time i checked ghengis khan wasnt exactly a nice guy br br awfully acted  i found several of the characters hard to believe they were very twodimensional and lacked and kind of depth br br a saving grace of the film was the cinematography that is why i gave this film a 2 starrating rather than the bare minimum however if you want to look at something pretty i would recommend buying a picture instead br br all in all this film was an awful waste of my time and money please do yourself a favour and give this mongolian turkey a miss
