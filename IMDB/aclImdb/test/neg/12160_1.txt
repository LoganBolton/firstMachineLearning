have seen this movie today very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist the most sad things arebr br 1 its very slow br br 2 how ghengiskhan cruel and mighty emperor of asia can be played by a kind good actor with warm and lovely eyes  during all the movie except one scene br br 3 lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age we see an exslave without money power friends or home click  the very next second hes leading the huge army without any reasons to be a leader br br 4 the magic of ghengiskhan arise is kindly explained only by the help of one wolfgodwhoever it was br br 5 can a man make love to his wife that way after not seeing her for years br br 6 is it enough to win the sword fight if you just riding your horse through the enemy lines sitting there with two swords and everybody around you dies does ridley scott know that way br br 7 why after 2030 years khans mother doesnt look older br br 8 what is the motivation for the main character none literallybr br dont waste your time really cinematographerss work is good the nature is outstanding  but the movie cannot be made without director and script the real ghengiskhan would execute director in a secondbr br kind regards
