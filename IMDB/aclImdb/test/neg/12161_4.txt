i went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to gobr br we were both trying to look at our watches well before the film ended in order to see how much more we had to endure two hours and six minutes long it is its divided roughly equally between battle scenes about a dozen of them all more or less interchangeable and plot developmentbr br one would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world plotting would have been relatively easy theres a fair bit of raw material there from which to make a pretty good story however the writers fluffed it completely we get no real history we get instead a hollywood version of historybr br what sustains young temudjin through his long  almost endless actually or so they seem to the viewer  tribulations why the love of a good woman of coursebr br how does he get out of prison well an old monk who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness sets out across the continent to take to this good woman a talisman that symbolises temudjins love for her dropping dead just close enough to her for her to find him as he lies there talisman in his hand and of course she then goes and having inexplicably become rich and powerful rescues himbr br how does he escape from the shackles well he goes off to the shrine of the great wolfgod tengri or some such name and tengri sets him free by magic yeah rightbr br why does he want to become ruler of the mongols the wolfgod again apparently off goes temudjin to ask for guidance and  surprise surprise  he gets it laws he says to himself what the mongols need are laws good simple ones golly it was impressivebr br and then finally how does he win the decisive battle against his rivals more powerful forces better tactics certainly but also through the aid of the good old wolfgod again who sends a storm at the height of the battle all the troops cower as the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes mongols are scared of thunder you see  but not our temudjin the troops completely wowed by his bravery acclaim him king br br i dont know what induces people to keep producing this kind of garbage the funny thing is its interspersed with all sorts of gritty realism lots of slurping of milk dirt and violence its as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial things right so that viewers wouldnt notice how infantile some of the big stuff isbr br theres heaps of violence in graphic closeup slashings impalings spouts of blood sprays of blood clouds of blood  the blood guys had a great time actually despite the realism its impossible to take seriouslybr br i must mention the ludicrous cgi final battle scene how anyone can think these things look realistic is beyond me they dont oh and its all shot in the standard hollywood style  breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery and the supercloseup stedicam stuff for the battle scenes and the standard dolby supersoundeffects of whumps and thumps and the constant lowfrequency hum to sustain tensionbr br tediousbr br avoid
