i really hated this movie and its the first movie written by stephen king that i didnt finish i was truly disappointed it was the worst crap ive ever seen what were you thinking making three hours out of it it may have a quite good story but actors no suspense no romance no horror no it didnt have anythingbr br its got this strange crazy science man with einsteinhair the classic thing not real at all and a man keep getting younger all the time it seems like they just used the name of stephen king to make a crappy too long movie with nothing exciting at allbr br i give this movie 1 awful if they had like 5 i would probably take that instead it was a total waste of time
