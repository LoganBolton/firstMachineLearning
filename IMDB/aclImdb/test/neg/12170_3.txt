firstly this is not an adaptation of a stephen king book short story novella or anything else from ews web site and their review on the show when it first aired he never writes down to his audience and he never betrays contempt for his subjects his first original work for television stephen kings golden years cbs july 16 911 pm is no exceptionbr br the series was apparently going to be as others have mentioned an ongoing series which is why we never saw the ending after the cliffhanger they left us on but this was never quite made clear to the viewers who were left wondering how it all endsbr br when the series came out on videotape it touted itself as having the neverbeforeseen ending it should have said the shouldneverbeseen ending br br  spoiler br br the very ending was the only significant part changed for the video though parts of the whole were left out and that changed ending was what destroyed the story for example rather than our two intrepid fbi agents realizing that they were now labeled as bad guys and on the run from the evil jude anderson of the shop as originally broadcast jude simply walks up to them and they shoot him bang dead and no real emotion to speak of in the scene ditto on the bit with harlan and his wife going poof whereas the original ending left us with a spectacular cliffhanger on the video they simply get out of the cockadoodie carbr br  end spoiler br br it was a sad ending to a rather well made miniseries and makes the video completely not worth buying or even renting sincerely save your money and your time
