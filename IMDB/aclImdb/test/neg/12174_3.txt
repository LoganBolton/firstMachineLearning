i am utterly astonished at how overrated cemetery man is among horror fans now i usually welcome movies that blend two or more kinds of genrestyles into one and i love just about every zombiecomedy i have ever seen to my dismay this italian cultclassic really didnt show me a lot to get too pumped up about it follows the unusual duties of a fulltime cemetery caretaker and his retarded manchild curly joe looking assistant as they seem to primarily dispose of the recently deceased who pop out of the ground seven days after their initial death he meets a widow whom he wows with some grisly graveyard atmosphere and develops a quick romance soon having sex with her on her dead husbands grave the husbands corpse springs alive and bites her triggering a series of events that seem to consume the rest of the movie cemetery man attempts to incorporate every element it can like horror romance comedy action and fails entirely in the longrun it plods along never able to focus on any aspect long enough to make it interesting for the viewer such as the paunchy sidekicks relationship with a living severed head a motorcycle riding zombie launching out of the ground the main character deciding to gun down random people on the sidewalk etc this thing is so convoluted and dull that its nearly impossible to take it seriously sure its stylish and often elegant but even the most artsy kind of films need the right kind of lineage to allow it to make sense cemetery man plods along appearing unable to focus on anything for more than a few minutes which becomes very tiring after a while people argue that its a more sophisticated zombie movie frankly when it comes to zombies i dont want anything more sophisticated than romero theres a little bit of gore and nudity  mainly in the scenes where it wants to play horror movie but not nearly enough to make up for its uncompromising lack of structure terrible film
