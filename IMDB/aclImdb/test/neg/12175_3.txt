the appeal of this film has to be the artsy euro style because theres absolutely no substance a bunch of stuff happens that seems to be going somewhere but it never gets therebr br its difficult to come up with a full 10 lines of commentary because this film is such a totally empty experience theres lots of nice photography of a cemetery some really lame zombie effects some flashes of what might pass for surrealist humor and a feeble existentialist ending these elements undermine each other just when you might be enjoying the creepy mood theres some silliness with bouncing heads or zombie sex to keep from screaming with boredom you clutch at the minimal story line  and it disintegrates into ridiculous illogic its like someone took several halfbaked b movies and tossed them in a blenderbr br what comes out is mostly a film about meaninglessness  and not a good one clearly it will impress that category of arthouse fan who sees emptiness as indistinguishable from depth everyone else should stay well clear of this dreary mess
