zzzzzzzzzzzz this one came directly from the jaws cookiecutter mold with some other bizarre cliches thrown in for good measure i was interested in seeing this after finding a still from it in a book about italian horror films and wowi guess i got what i deservedbr br very slowmoving and talky much of this killer shark movie takes place on land which isnt really that surprising it seems like the only method they had of showing a shark is through shots of a shark in an aquarium the shark is never in the same frame as any of the actors and thats too badmost of the characters are so annoying that you actually wish they would get eatenbr br the plot concerns a group of four kids who meet up with a mysterious indian on the beach one day while roasting weenies the indian for some reason gives them an ancient artifact that will allow them to track an ancient evil that assumed the form of a monster shark to attack their tribesupposedly because they were too good at fishing the ocean and the ocean god was worried they would take all the fish or something like thatbr br its a good thing too because wouldnt ya know ityears later a monster shark appears and starts gobbling up people in the sleepy seaside community when one of the four guys are eaten by the shark the remaining three are determined to kill the thingespecially since big shocker here the authorities have killed a shark and they think the threat is over yawnbr br the obligatory death scenes are unbelievably tedious and you can see them coming a mile away my favorite was the girl who has a fight with her boyfriend while theyre sitting in a van then jumps out and says im going for a swim immediately to be gobbled up by the waiting shark they had a lot of nerve calling this film deep blood since you hardly see any just cloudy water the actors handle their cliched roles like theyre all thumbs and there is even a hilarious subplot involving a greasy rockertype bad boy who threatens our goodygoody heroes then turns good in the end to help kill the sharkbr br it took me a really long time to find this film it is rather obscure so i dont think theres any danger of too many people wasting their time on this however if you should be lured into itdont say you werent warned
