charles bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen but this movie lacks everything that a thrilleractionmovie should have there are a few action scenes in the movie but theyre really crappy and when the action scenes fail does the story save the film not at all is my answer to that the story is even worse than the action scenes its very straightforward and boring and even though im a big movie fan i almost fell asleep several times i dont know how they came up with a failure like this a low budget maybe regardless of that it looked like all the actors had no interest in being in the movie at all when that happens the result is really bad
