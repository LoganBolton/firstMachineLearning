i watched this movie last night im a huge fan of the book and i was pretty happy with the version in which winona ryder and susan sarandon starred but this one its just awful oh my god i dont understand how they dared to ripped apart this classic story and made the characters totally different starting with the switching of beth being the younger sister and making amy the 3rd one and jo interpretation terrible jo was a feminist intelligent and kinda angry young lady and the actress portraying jo in this movie acts like a foolish and very annoying little girl and whats with the laurie going to war im ok with the fact that when a book is made into a movie there has to be some changes made but not rewrite the whole story very very bad done
