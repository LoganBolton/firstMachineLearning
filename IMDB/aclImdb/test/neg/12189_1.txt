its a long time ago i saw this movie and still its one of the worst ive ever seen i like lots of kind of movies scifi action drama thrillers and sometimes even horror not a combination of two this could have been a wonderful movie but they all blew it up i didnt want to see this movie but friends of mine insisted to watch it i didnt know it was such a crap i loved the first part in which clooney and tarantino drove through texas killing everybody on their way especially the scene with the liquor shooting was excellent but at its turning point in the titty twister bar everything changed stupid vampires took over the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like nightmare on elmsteet if you like horror watch a real horror movie and when you love bloodstolling thrillers dont watch it at all you will be very disappointed at the end
