i love dissing this movie my peers always try their best to defend it probably out of love for quentin tarantino or harvey keitel but theyll never convince me that this one should be treasured heres some huge reasons why a the plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampireinhabited strip bar slasher flick with no setup whatsoever suddenly something very real turns into something very fake which is like sitting the audience down to a thanksgiving feast then exploding it with dynamite b that untalented juliette lewis is in it c preposterous ideas abound such as actual torsoandleg guitars brothers with the last name gecko bad vampire makeup jobs cheech marin playing three characters  and a crotchbased gun that only fires when erect and belongs to a guy who goes by sex machine if robert rodriguez didnt pathetically try to be so innovative with his violence i mightve had fun with this obvious popcorn flick the whole projects like he got the ideas by playing with action figures the only thing even close to being considered my favorite scene is george clooneys laughoutloud cheesy monologue after he kills his bloodsucking hornyforchildren terribleacting brother i swear i think they thought it up right then and there this movies out to offend and ends up offending those who want the offensive horrible movie
