just what is the point of this film it starts off as one film then changes track cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale pale imitation of so many other schlockhorror flicks youve ever seen the overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris screenplay by tarantino direction by rodriguez two guys who have previously shown talent but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because they did it but it doesnt quite work that way youre only good while you continue doing good things there are so many questions to ask just what are george clooney and harvey keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy 혰 utterly ruthless and efficient 혰 and it would have been interesting to see where that was going but of course we never do and the clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character thats not clever or witty thats just bad bad work keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout and no wonder did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the goahead tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant and why did he as writer assume we would find the rape gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny on every level 혰 except the technical 혰 this film stinks avoid
