i saw hurlyburly on broadway and liked it a great deal i dont know what happened with the film version because it was dreadful perhaps some dialogue that works on stage just sounds incoherent on screen anyway i couldnt wait for this film to be over the acting is universally over the top only kevin spacey has it together and he seems like he knows hes in a bad movie and cant wait to get out
