a complete and utter waster of my precious two hours the entire movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people getting coked up a car crashing people getting more coked up people having sex people crying and people getting more coked up the tagline for this movie should have read come see how fcked up our characters are theyre stoned theyre coke addicts theyre a mess who are these people do you really care does it matter just give us your money please because we sure dont care about anything else an absolutely terrible movie it never went anywhere you never got to know the characters they never even said what these people did to earn such a big house and so much money and cars and coke and it was just downright boring you might like the movie a little more if youre a stoner yourself but for the vast majority of us that arent this movie is a waste of film and of time
