thats what i felt like yelling as well as stomping out of the theater but i restrained myself yes the acting was great no this wasnt the typical hollywood film but the dialogue just wouldnt end or get interesting and despite all the gabbing you never get to really know or care about any of the characters definitely the most boring film ive seen since sphere but i was expecting that one to be boring i had to sit through it but please spare yourself
