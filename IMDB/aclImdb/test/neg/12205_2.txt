this film brought a whole new meaning to that wellworn phrase like watching paint dry because this was like watching paint dry in the middle of a monsoonbr br i was attracted to the film by its location on the west coast of portugal which i have visited it is a ruggedly beautiful place and the blackandwhite introduced a whole new dimension to the beauty that was the only good thing the story was appallingly banal and frankly you have to have some storybr br a film crew runs out of film and the entire crew then have to wait well a wait is a wait i can wait for a number 15 bus on princes street in edinburgh i can spend hours on a remote railway station in the middle of nowhere on cold winters sunday afternoon however a wait is boring and yes this wait was boring toobr br so the leader goes off to america to remonstrate with the film supplier who castigates him for not making the whole thing in colour after a number of arguments two blessed bullets ring out from wherever and the eagerlyawaited end finally arrives and not before timebr br yes i would see this film again if someone arms me with a couple of cans of colour film so that i can hurl them at the screen
