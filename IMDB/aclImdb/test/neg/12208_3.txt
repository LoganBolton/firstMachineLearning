one only has to read the cast list and credits to salivate in anticipation of this david copperfield but alas alas how so much major acting and directorial talent could have turned one of literatures richest tales into such a monumental bore is totally beyond me its pretty to look at with lovely photography particularly the yarmouth sequences but just plain dull no need to go on skip it and check out the selznick or the marvelous bbc miniseries from the 1980s
