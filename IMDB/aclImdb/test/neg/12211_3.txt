this movie was so frustrating everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time i at least thought id be able to stand it but i was wrong first the weird looping it was like watching americas funniest home videos the damn parents i hated them so much the stereotypical latino family i need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have a talk that little girl who was always hanging on someone i just hated her and had to mention it now the final scene transcends i must say its so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own what crappy dancing horrible and beautiful at once
