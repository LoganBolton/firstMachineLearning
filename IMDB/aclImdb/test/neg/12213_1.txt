i am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of christian fundamentalismbr br that said this movie is reprehensible vile and transparent it only works on the level of the currently fashionable and tired hatred motif of white american christian fundamentalism had this movie been made about a fundamentalist jewish or muslim family or even a black christian family the outrage would have been palpable and the movie would have been roundly panned in all circles as it stands though its ok and artful because white christian fundamentalists remain one of the last acceptable targets for garbage such as thisbr br and garbage it truly is if you want to see a quality film of a similar bent find and watch or review badlands nothing good was done in the king that wasnt done better decades ago in that masterful filmbr br as other reviewers note the characters are almost completely undeveloped in the king the lines are a snooze the cinematography is lackluster weve seen the tale of the sociopath done better 100 times this movie doesnt cut it for thoughtful viewers
