the real problem with this story is that theres not much story to the story theres hardly any plot to speak of widower buys an electric grandma for his kids one kid resists electric grandma then finally accepts her then the kids grow up and grandma leaves really very little happens its much more of a premise than a storybr br moreover strip it of its schmaltz and you have a story that had already done before and better the lonely same basic idea person initially cant accept the love of a robot because its justamachine then eventually yields and comes to love the robot the biggest difference is that the lonely is much more powerful as both the protagonist and we the audience are shocked abruptly back to reality and forced to remember that in the end the robot really is just a mechanismbr br i also find the story highly flawed in that the electric grandmother is just too perfect shes not only human shes superhuman shes wiser than a real person she has no traces of mechanicalness to her at all and she makes marbles appear out of thin air it frankly really chafes at credulity to think that shes a machine
