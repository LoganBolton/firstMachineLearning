parrots parrots i have been around this old earth longer than most and have seen nearly all the westerns that have have produced old west history is my passion comanche moon is one of the most poorly produced directed and acted stories i have ever seen there was very little historical accuracy but then it is obvious you were operating on a shoestring budget whichbr br played a distinct roll in this insult to intelligence i am happy that i tivod this show it was bad enough having to sit and watch the movie plus put up with the inane commercials once again there was not one actor that came anywhere near convincing i kept hoping it would improve as the three days progressed wrong im ashamed to say i wasted 4 12 hours of what precious little time i have left
