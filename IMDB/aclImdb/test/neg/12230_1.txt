do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of any sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour is there even just a single genuinely funny parody film anymore all i see are zeroquality films that look like a couple stoned high school students got bored one day with a video camera these movies are not funny theyre not clever theyre not entertaining theyre just useless in every conceivable waybr br the comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its hideous level of trash by not calling itself sports movie its the same thing though there are a few different writers for these films the wayans did some freidberg and seltzer did some others and im sure theres another pair i cant even tell the difference in direction or humour to be honest it all seems like the same people wrote and directed them i cant tell if the comebacks was done by the people who did scary movie or the guys who did epic movie or someone else its just the same jokes from all the othersbr br if you have any shred of taste or value for humour dont see this movie if you have selfworth dont bother seeing it if you have any respect for film making dont even consider watching it dont see it in any broke down derelict theatre that may still carry it dont rent it dont order it on netflix or payperview dont redbox it and dont even watch it for free on od avoid it like the plaguebr br the only conceivable reasons i can see to watch this film are as followsbr br a masochism if you like torturing yourself theres very few better ways b seeing a prime example of why to avoid anything that says fox atomic c youre being paid considerably high amounts of cashbr br i really would not watch the entire thing if someone offered me 100 to do it its just mindless mental collapsing tormentbr br you might as well watch zohan
