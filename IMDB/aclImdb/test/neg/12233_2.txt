one would think that since this film has a bad rep that i would be exaggerating when i say i hated this filmbut im am serious this movie was just so stupid and so unfunny and such a waste of timei mean after the first 30 i had a major headache and the smile i had on my facethat was mostly getting ready to laugh was wearing offwhen this film was over i was so glad and because i had good expectations that it would be funny i was extremely disappointedthe acting is not great the comedy moments are lame and unfunnyhardly anything is good about this because i laughed at like maybe 2 partsoverall this is so boring and i cant tell you how awful this is i think this could be used as a suicide techniquei mean i dont think for some its even watchableso my final words on this are avoid at all costs
