1st movie comment ever ill start with saying come on wasnt that bad was it no it wast that bad actually i laughed and giggled enough times through the movie so i cannot say with hand on my heart that it was rubbishbr br its completely different this and epic movie epic movie sucked bad doh how so people would ask ill tell you how this movie is not as nearly as pointless not to mention that the stupid and i say stupid because it is but being stupid makes it funny stuff that happens around and with the characters is actually enjoyable in this movie not the best around but hey what would you expect  look at the poster some people said it was stupid i find that when writing a comment one should be more objective my own opinion but yeah of course it was stupid its a movie about stupid look im not telling you to go and watch the movie now or else you missed the event of the century what i am telling is that if you happen to see the movie somewhere please dont carve your eyes on the opening credits see what its all about  who knows you might like it a bitbr br i give it 410 for not being so bad and making me laugh and some unexpectedly good sexrelated jokes
