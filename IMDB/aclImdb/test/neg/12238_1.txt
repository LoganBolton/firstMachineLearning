if it would of had jack black listed as the leading actor i would of stayed away from this movie right away it actually makes some of his movies look good compared to this moviethis movie should of been filmed as a cartoon for ages 38 and it would of been a lot better it is nothing but a bunch of the stupidest skits from other movies put together to make one big messthe movie looks like it was shot in about one day with no thought at all behind it theres a few times where it looks like maybe theres gonna be a turning point and the movie well actually have plot to the movie or at least a storyline would develop but the stupid skits inserted just ruin the whole movie
