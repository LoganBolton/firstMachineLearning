i watched all three segments and am so disappointed in the story line zahn spends so much time mimicking duvall he does nothing else in the show and tommy lee jones would never be so weak as a young man unlikeable yes but weak never we never see how or why they go to back to lonesome dovewhich is a dirt hole in the originalwhy would they ever leave austin where they are herosfor doing nothing during the whole moviei was rooting for blue duck by the end of the movie and he was totally miscast there is no warning about how many segments there areit just ends this miniseries could have been somebodytragic it looked like it was directed by the parrot and the jag
