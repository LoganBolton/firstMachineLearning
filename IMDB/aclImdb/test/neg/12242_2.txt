the spoof genre which has lacked creativity and humor for some time already gets spat upon yet again by hacks with no talent no point no fun no originality just a few cheap bucks for the film makers br br it takes more than just referencing some recent movies and giving characters doublemeaning names to be satire to make people laugh any clod can pick up a camcorder and have some badacting buddies in cheap costumes imitate somebody since the genre being targeted this time is inspirational sports movies there are a few lame references thrown out to movies of that type the jokes are so weak the characters actually have to emphasize the references in various ways to get you to laugh hysterically it doesnt workbr br thats not comedy however the same old worn out sophomoric jokes ripped off from a middle school washroom done even more blandly than usual are all here if thats not enough theres a running gag of a bus running somebody over so funny right also one pathetically poor scene does more product placement than michael bay again with the same unfunny results a musical bit flops miserably pity carl weathers once apollo creed in the rocky series now stuck with roles in swill like thisbr br lousy beyond words watching a snail run the marathon would be less tedious than watching this film is probably a lot funnier too
