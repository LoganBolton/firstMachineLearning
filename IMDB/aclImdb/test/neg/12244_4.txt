with so many horrible spoof movies this is sadly a breath of fresh air to the genre compared to classics like airplane or the naked gun this is awful but compared to recent spoof movies like meet the spartans and disaster movie this is very clever and original dont get me wrong though this was not a good movie in any way i laughed a few times and there are a few inspired gags but any pop culture reference falls flat on its face as does most jokes in the moviebr br lambeau fields david koechner was a bad coach in the past but now hes brought back to teach college football and this time hell do a good job his wife melora hardin is feeling distant from him and his daughter is dating a football big shot to spite her father spoofs of various recent movies come into play as do a lot of sight gags and nonstop stupiditybr br the best parts of the movie are the gags not relying on reference to recent movies spoofs of radio rocky dodgeball friday night lights invincible and many other sports movies are not funny in the least its mainly the smaller gags that get a few laughs like a bizarre crotch scratching scene or a chewing tobacco spitting joke these little throwaway giggles cannot carry the movie and by the end its hard to watch the last 20 minutes are grueling to sit throughbr br the characters are surprisingly developed for a sports spoof movie however im sure the characters were built on clich√©s from the genre nonetheless theyre not too bad david koechner can pull lead actor in a movie off too bad they gave him so much crummy material to work with matthew lawerence has fine comedic timing in a not always so comedic role as a ballet dancing football player with a cross dressing father carl weathers rounds off the cast once again playing in a subpar sports movie not the rocky movieshappy gilmore overall this is a goofy comedy at times its funny but more often than not its just very annoying and predictablebr br my rating  12 out of  90 mins pg13 for language sexual humor and drug humor
