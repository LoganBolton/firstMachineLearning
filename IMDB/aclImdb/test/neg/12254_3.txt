although this has to be the nadir of season six this schmaltzy episode isnt badly written or acted its just that most of us looked to the xfiles for taut gripping horrorthrillers ending without easy answers and moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracies season 6 gave us a stream of tongueincheek comedies that undermined the shows continuity and frankly made simpsons halloween specials look like great thriller tvbr br in this episode victoria jackson of snl fame plays the longsuffering girlfriend of a man who sets himself up as a rainmaker however her weatherman boss is the one who truly loves her and mulder winds up having to provide him dating advice in order to get out of townbr br theres some playful fun with the chemistry between the agents and some amusing but nonetoosophisticated characterization of midwestern hicks its nothing youd want to see more than oncebr br its hard to figure out season 6 xfiles creator chris carter seems bored by the whole syndicate conspiracy story arc and abandons responsibility to the black comedy writers
