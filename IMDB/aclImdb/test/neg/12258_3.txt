this appears to be two movies spliced into one in the first zasu pitts is a renegade in a small town she wants to help the romantic life of marjorie woodworth ok id never heard of her before either but she and pitts are in both parts of this concoctionbr br before we know it pitts is no longer miss polly she is emmie i had to rewind to see if id fallen asleep somewhere i hadnt she no longer in a small town but on her way to the title honeymoon destinationbr br the movie has some cute moments the first part is better with roles for what seems to be every thirdrate character actress working in hollywood at the timebr br and what of ms woolworth she sounds a little like betty hutton she sounds a little like marie wilson shes pretty certainly but shes no comediennebr br pitts often was used in very small roles here she has the largest role shes always fun though this movie made me wonder if a little of her doesnt go quite a long way as a comic when she was a tragic actress in von stroheim silents  the wedding march and greed are the two i have seen  she was brilliant
