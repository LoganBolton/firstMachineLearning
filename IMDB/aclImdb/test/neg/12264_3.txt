this film follows a very similar storyboard to the warriors only with less intensity and rather poor acting which is nothing to write home aboutbr br the story in general is not that bad based around a small aussie gang who are trying to get out of the city when one of their members is framed for the rape of another gangs girl they then have to fight their way through the streets whilst they are been hunted down by a number of rival gangs on could assume that the writers have taken a page out of the warriors book and rewritten it but as mentioned above  with not nearly as much intensitybr br the acting as a whole is not very good in my opinion and its clearly obvious on many occasions that they are indeed acting the fight scenes make up for this however but then the poor sound effects that go with them bring it back downbr br this film has nothing on once were warriorsbr br low budget alright story poor acting nothing to write home about
