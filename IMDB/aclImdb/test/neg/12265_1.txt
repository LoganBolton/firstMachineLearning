this film proves a theory i have had for quite some time  in australia as long as a film deals with the right topic it will be a success regardless of how terrible it is aussie park boyz could not possibly be any worse  the acting is beyond terrible the plot is basically a poor warriors knockoff and the filmmakers clearly have no idea about ethnic gangs in australia an irish gang in twentyfirst century sydney the last time any irish gangs were in australia was about a hundred years ago in the time of the tinkers but because its about ethnic rivalry one of four topics guaranteed to be a success in australian cinema along with struggling families minority groups and the biography of a famous australian it won multiple academy awards ive always suspected that australian critics will lap up any rubbish that deals with these issues but part of me thought or at least hoped that they had their limits this film proves otherwise so to all you australian aspiring filmmakers out there dont bother putting thought into your film or choosing people who can actually act or even getting your facts right  just write a script about some poor family trying to make ends meet or someone of a foreign race coming to australia and having to deal with racial prejudice and stereotypes or if you want to take a leaf out of these peoples book some ethnic gang fighting some other ethnic gang that isnt actually plausible in the period the film is set and your film will win five academy awards regardless of how pathetic it is
