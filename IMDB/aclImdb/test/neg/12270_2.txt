although i watched this film by myselfthankfully i still felt embarrassed while watching it i was tricked into renting it by the reviews on the front cover and the bloodygritty camera stills on the backwhich led me to believe it was some sort of documentary these actors are laughable throughout the entire film not convincing at all the story involves an italian australian gang just fighting other gangs and then runningfightingrepeat supposedly they train extremely hard which makes them way better than other gangs for some reason i dont believe that they could actually beat up some of these other guys that are twice their size i could be wrong no im not wrong this movie is not enjoyable on any levelthe jail montage looked like it was a summer camp just instead of kids it was a sausage fest of horrible actors just hanging out and laughing and trying to look hard this movie is not worth your time save your money or throw it in the garbage just dont waste it on this movie
