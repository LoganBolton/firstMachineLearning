lets face it a truly awful movie noi mean a truly awful movie is a rare strange and beautiful thing to behold i admite that there is a special place in my heart for films like plan 9 from outer space half caste species etc and although im giving this film a 1 i highly urge anyone who enjoys a bad film for what it truly is a bad film to find a friend snacks something to drink and make the special occasion it deserves out of aussie park boyz br br from the very first moments of the lead actors side to side eyerolling performance as he attempts to inject intensity directly into the film without ever looking at a camera a slice of ham straight out of silent pictureseat your heart out rudolph valentino to the sudden heywereoutoffilm conclusion youwillnotstoplaughing br br to sum the film up its a poor mans warriors down under completeand that description alone should be enough but then comes the wonders of the spaghetti eating scene the weve got their tickets they wont be leaving town now scene its the asians run and more the only truly objectionable part is a gratuitously filmed rape outside of this i dare you to watch this film and i dare you to find evidence of acting or lines or direction or any of those other boring and superfluous elements that socalled critics say a film needs to be judged as good br br if this movie doesnt cause fits of uncontrollable laughter before it ends all i can do is roll my eyes menacingly from side to side at you and shout you dog you dog you dog
