i am seldom motivated to write a review unless inspired by the quality of the movie in the case of comanche moon i was so uninspired i felt the need to warn others how bad this tv mini series is here are a few thoughtsbr br the indians they came across like they were in a saturday night live skit making fun of how indians talk when mcmurtry writes dialogue in his novels it reads so interesting i am not sure how they ended up with what they gotbr br gus mccrae looks like festus from the old gunsmoke series acting is ok and the mannerisms from robert duvalls mccrae are right on but the look is pure comedy cowboybr br clara maybe you could use a little dirt or sweat on her next time ever been in austin in the summer before air conditioning i promise you women did not look like that do you think they never saw any episodes of dearwoodbr br gov elisha pease again whenever they are in the governors office it feels like a saturday night live skit and the skit is bombingbr br woodrow call call is the most reasonable character of course he talks so little how can you screw up that but hey what about that hatbr br blue duck see above and include the fact that he isnt even a tiny bit scary they should have gotten javier bardem to play the partbr br the rangers right out of o brother where art thou i expected george cloony to come riding up and them to break into a songbr br perhaps i am premature because the miniseries isnt completed but i doubt i will watch any more of it any waybr br i would not expect anyone to be able to duplicate the enthralling feel of lonesome dove but i watch this and it seems like they have no feel for the old west at all
