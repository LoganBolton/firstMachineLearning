one of the worst movies ive seen this year everything about the film screams amateur for a movie set in the 1800s everybody speaks like its the 1990s the acting particularly the people playing the white slave masters is horrible after about an hour into this movie i walked out what a waste of time and effort for a much better film on this subject see steven spielbergs far superior amistad
