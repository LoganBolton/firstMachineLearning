1st watched 872004  3 out of 10dirbrett thompson silly juvenilefocused movie about three kids being zapped into their favorite cartoon with their parents experiment the script left much to be desired in this hannabarbara like ripoff of some saturday morning liveaction with people in dinosaur costumes kids show with some goofy cavemen hanging around nothing really to admire about this and nothing much to be said either im just amazed i found this at a blockbuster video store as bad as it was and the way the stores are ridding themselves of old vhs movies i guess they couldnt even sell it so back on the rental rack it went
