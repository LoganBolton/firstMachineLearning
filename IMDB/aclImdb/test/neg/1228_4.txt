i like many folks believe the 1989 epic lonesome dove was one of the best westerns ever produced maybe the best and realizing that most sequels in this case a prequel are certain to disappoint my expectations were low comanche moon met that expectation with its marginal directing and acting poor casting and frankly a lousy script br br lonesome dove created western heroes of captains mccrae and call due to incredibly strong performances by robert duvall and tommy lee jones prior to living in lonesome dove we believed they bravely fought to rid texas of bandits and savage indians during their rangering years br br if i had only seen comanche moon i would think these two boneheads were a couple of incompetent cowardly idiots in lonesome dove call and mccrae supposedly chased blue duck all over texas and never managed to capture or kill him in comanche moon a shot to calls boot heel convinced him to settle down and raise cattle there wasnt a decent fistfight or gun fight in the entire miniseries the best punch was mccrea sucker punching inez scull a funny scene but out of character for mccraebr br where was mccraes wit and charm claras love for mccrae a drunken unshaven slob and philanderer was completely implausible and maggies love for call a dispassionate and sullen loner defies logic br br the cinematography was excellent superior to the original credit goes not only to hd technology but the cinematographer the comanche moon miniseries was better than anything else on tv for three nights but sadly thats not saying much
