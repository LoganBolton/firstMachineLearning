this is a poor caricature of lonesome dove  and larry mcmurtrybr br i love your books with lonesome dove among the top three i have admired the way you view yourself through your characters with such unflinching honesty balanced by never taking it all too seriously i am therefore spoiledbr br why have you come to thisbr br comanche moon is not up to your standards i see that you are credited with the screenwriting but this is so unlike you i prefer to think it is written by someone elsebr br the dialogue makes me claustrophobic wishing someone would break out with a naturally stated sentence the part about genius was agonizing mccrae was unrecognizable  chiefly because of the inane words coming out of his mouthbr br well i miss call toobr br the most important missing factors are gus and call and the men they are their matteroffact courage the underlying vein comprised of ethics and honesty their lack of self delusion hard men leading hard lives with a certain undeniable gracebr br some blame has to attach to the labored direction here and throughout all of the cast needed dialect and dialogue coachingbr br while i try to imagine robert duvall as mccrae speaking this same dialogue it comes off better  but not much it tries to sound cowboyoffewwords shy slygrin witty but doesnt half succeedbr br how can it be so different from lonesome dove can the writer have forgotten his characters you have fooled some of the people mr mcmurtry  but not this one
