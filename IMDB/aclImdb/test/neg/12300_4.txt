the 4th floor is a decidedly mediocre film starring juliette lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a problem neighbor jane lewis has recently inherited a terrific 5th floor apartment from her grandmother and per agreement with the landlord gets a ridiculously low renting rate her boyfriend william hurt as a creepy weather man wants her to move in with him but she wants her own space so she moves in and weird stuff starts happening and because this is a bgrade horror flick theres a dumb nottobefoundinreality reason why as the nonetoointriguing jane keeps trying to tell others her boyfriend the police coworkers whats going on everybody thinks shes losing it so of course she has to face the problem the lunatic living right below her alone neither scary nor interesting the movies single saving grace is lewis shes a very fine actress but poorly used here which is not to say she isnt the best thing about this flick because she is she has feral charisma and holds the screen better than a dozen of the silicone bimbos that routinely populate this type of movie this type of movie though is not worthy of her which is ironic given that shes probably the only reason anyone would see it
