a fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot  though not original  promised me a nice evening in front of the tv i was disappointed the actors delivered up to standard juliette lewis cuddly as ever william hurt solid but in the background shelley duvall convincing as ever but the story was too thin to keep me engaged to the story and the twist to the finale was too obvious and too late there was only one character who was nice to he girl so guess what then the final aftertwistÂ… i do not know what to think of that the boyfriend and the neighbor contract with the devil or just to get her to move in what the film had a nice idea behind it but the idea was not worked out in detail it could have been good but it was not too many loose ends to tie up columbo would say
