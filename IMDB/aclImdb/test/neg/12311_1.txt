holy cow what a piece of sht this movie is i didnt how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie i guess they didnt know either i dont remember any farting or belching in the book do youbr br they took this all times childrens classic added some farting belching and sexual inuindo and prostituted it into a kaka joke this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like i have to say visually it was interesting but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor if you even think that kind of thing is funny i dont want the kids that i know to think it isbr br dont take your kids to see dont rent the dvd i hope the ghost of doctor suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie
