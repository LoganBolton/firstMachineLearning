if you liked the grinch movie go watch that again because this was no where near as good a seussian movie translation mike myers cat is probably the most annoying character to grace the screen in recent times his voiceaccent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound which is about the only laughing i heard at the theater not even the kids liked this one folks and kids laugh at anything now save your money and go see looney tunes back in action if youre really looking for a fun holiday family movie
