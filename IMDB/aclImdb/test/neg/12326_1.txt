the only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that i didnt have to pay for it i saw it for free at college and if a college student cant find humor in something that was free its hopelessbr br stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent yet bewildering set design that goes out of its way to market volkswagon beetles i dont know what michaels myers was doing in this movie but i have never seen anything more depressing this was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the grinch which has its opponents but i enjoyed it very much its difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund itbr br you want a funny seuss adaptation go with the grinch
