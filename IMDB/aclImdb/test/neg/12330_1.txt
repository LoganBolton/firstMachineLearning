there is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the grinch who stole christmas so lets get that part out of the way first of all let me start by saying that i think grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film cat was well just awfulbr br jim carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian and fearlessly commits to over the top outrageous characters mike myers fell back on his old bag of tricksbr br why why why mike myers the kids could care less and the austin powers demographic isnt going to spy this film so what was the studio thinkingbr br the cat was also apparently related to linda richmond can we talk why a new york accent not entirely consistent with anything dr seuss has ever written myers was even allowed to sneak in his scottish shtick i wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said as long as you dont say fahklempt you can keep the accents meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort either with the costume makeup or dialoguebr br the jokes what few there were were crude and age inappropriate when myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera dirty ho everything but the rim shot was missing and even that wouldnt have helpedbr br the same folks who created whoville clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in cat the sets and props were very appealing giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing direction and myersbr br there was some fun to be had with alec baldwin and kelly preston dakota fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a dr seuss classic and stayed true to the genrebr br call the spca this cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again please please no sequel
