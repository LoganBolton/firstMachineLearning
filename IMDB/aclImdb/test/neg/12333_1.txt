the worst movie i have ever seen the sound quality was bad the cutting of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logic and it had no speedbr br i first tought oh no i dont want the trail that proves that poor patrick was an innocent killer but this turned out to be even worse typically in this american film you get a superhint or no hints at all i want very tiny small hints that direct you to the killer the audience isnt involved and now when i dont get any hints at all you can expect a several sheisthekiller sweeps in the end and that is not all ah this is hopeless lets make an end to itbr br in one word disgustingbr br
