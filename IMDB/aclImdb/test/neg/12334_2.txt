it might be that the film i saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw however as the actors are the same i can only think that the cut i saw in europe differed from the one circulating in the usbr br anyway this was the worst movie that i saw the past five years closely followed by the waterboybr br why because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every thriller preceding this one mixed them put the in the wrong order with the wrong music and published itbr br examples nothing happends the music gets scary and still nothing happends the grumpy officer us grumpy in a way that would let the actor flunk any acting class there´s a buddymoment which comes out of nowhere at the end there´s an inescapable scene and in the next scene all the problems are gonebr br if you want to see a smart movie see memento if you want to see a better thriller see any thriller that comes to mind if you want to see patrick swayze see dirty dancing
