downhill racer is essentially a movie to see only for the terrific skiing sequences although there is a story here robert redfords character a skier trying to make the us olympic team is so bland and unsympathetic that you wonder why to care about him at all gene hackman in an early performance adds nicely but this is a film that could be watched with the sound off and it wouldnt make much of a difference
