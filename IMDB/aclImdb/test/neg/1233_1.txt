i just watched lonesome dove return to lonesome dove streets of laredo and dead mans walk all excellent this sorry hunk of junk is cheaply done and poorly actedbr br in the previous series captain call and gus mccrae come off as tough respectable cowboys despite the fact that caption call is played by a different actor every time each one quickly won me over in dead mans walk the boys are believable as the younger versions of the experienced texas rangers in comanche moon they are just a couple of chubby rednecks i had to stop watchingbr br i suspect many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by the people who made this stinking pile its a sorry end to an otherwise great franchise
