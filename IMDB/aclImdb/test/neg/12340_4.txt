rather like paul newman and steve mcqueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a jollies project for robert redford as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the alpine sunshinebr br the story is as light as powdered snow with redfords smalltown boy david chappellet what kind of lead name is that who with his eyes on the prize of olympic glory gets up the nose of in no particular order his coach father and teammates women are a mere sideshow in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pickup scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of heavens above a freethinking independent woman played by camilla sparv the skiing sequences are fine with some good stuntwork involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top tv coverage of skiing events down to the present day plus im not convinced that the winter olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel i couldnt really be that excited for him one way or anotherbr br of the actors redford best profile forward doesnt need to do much and indeed doesnt while gene hackman does better with equally meagre material ms sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats redford the way hes doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic waybr br in truth though theres a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences dont fully compensate and you dont care a fig for any of the leading characters one of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it
