director michael ritchie and actor robert redfords second documentarystyle drama the candidate is a political satire that still seems fresh and pertinent today so its a pity that downhill racer made a short time before seems so dated by contrast the music is ugly and the perhaps innovative skiing sequences are now standard in televisual coverage of the sport the world of skiing seems strangely amateurish probably accurately given the time the movie was made but its hard to relate to todays professional world and the theme of americans in europe likewise seems hundrum in an age of ever easier travel perhaps the biggest problem is the flat plot centred on the arrogant but enigmatic hero unfortunately its a dreary performance from redford offering us little insight into his cares or motivations and a characterdriven film without much of a character is never a good bet i expected much but sadly this is a boring movie
