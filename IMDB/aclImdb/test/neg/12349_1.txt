all the pro comments about this movie claim that the movie is balanced that is their main justification to give a high rate to the movie but a movie is not balanced when the main perpetrator analyzed is given the last world in every single subject the director herself admitted to this at the first san francisco film festival showing she justified it by saying that she couldnt waste the chance of having access to fujimori that might be true but by showing so much of fujimoris take on the issues makes the movie clearly profujimori and unbalanced i dare any of the other commentators to prove this wrong tips 1 claiming harvard professors intellectuals and latin american diplomats agree with you does not help your argument use logic tip 2 disagreeing with the director doesnt help your argument either the director says she thinks fujimori is charismatic and patriotic and therefore she portrayed him that way
