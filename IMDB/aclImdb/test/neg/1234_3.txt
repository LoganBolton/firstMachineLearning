the photography is good the costumes are good but the editing is bad the various scenes are cut or stopped at the wrong times and the conversations are slow and tedious this slowness continues the entire show it is a very tedious show to watch    i believe that more scenes should have been added but that would make it a longer show it is very slowmoving the writers should have made it just a 1night show and not prolong our agony night after night there is nothing else on otherwise id change the channel the first night i feel bad for the indians of the time and am angry at the whitemen for what they did to the indians but thats our history
