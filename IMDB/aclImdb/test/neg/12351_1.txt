i saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of tripe i have ever seenbr br completely unfunny low budget boring rubbish script terrible acting  the entire audience young and old sat through the film comatose without laughing for most of it there were literally only about 2 places you will laugh in the entire moviebr br many people left halfway  cant blame them i stayed thinking that the film would pick up however it never did and i wish id left br br the humour was really lame and i am surprised that this ever made it on to the big screen i am not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie at all  it just wasnt funny the people who made this movie really dont deserve your money so please dont pay to see this filmbr br this isnt even funny enough to be shown on tv let alone cinemabr br i wanted to give it 0 out of 10 but the system wont allow it
