rabbit fever is one of those film oddities its an enjoyable 90 minutes demands little of the viewer and delivers as much and on any terrestrial television channel even in a prime time slot i think that rabbit fever would be rather well received which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemasbr br the movie is filmed in the style of a television documentary and introduces us to 6 women who have am addictive relationship with the rabbit vibrator the film is primarily focused on investigating a supposed addictive quality to the famous sex aid product the narrative is 100 tongue in cheek throughoutbr br the storyline is strong an introduction to some well rounded and likable characters some enjoyable backstory peripheral characters and situations develops into an engaging story and pleasing conclusions sadly theres nothing that feels clever or new br br rabbit fever has some sharp moments a few switches that hint at what the writers are capable of and all credit to them its not just 90 minutes of knob gags and innuendo i could probably watch it with my mother but theres a laziness about some of the scenes that holds it back those moments went you are up for it when you want it to be outrageous and all you get is a dollop of sitcombr br i chuckled i left the theatre feeling empathy for the characters but i also left with the bitter thought that someone had taken a 90 minute reel of made for tv light entertainment and tried to put it into national cinema br br i think rabbit fever achieves some of what it set out to do its a quirky subject a rounded storyline a well presented cast and a good diversion for 90 minutes but theres nothing in this that can justify the extravagance of a movie theatre environment quite the opposite  a few commercial breaks would have given the viewer chance to grab a breath of life that rabbit fever seems to lack
