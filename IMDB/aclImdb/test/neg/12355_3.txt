gotta add a comment to this onebr br first ironically one needs to add the spolier alert to conform to imdbs parameters but there is absolutely nothing here to be spoiledbr br there are six characters the goodlooking gal whose the alist mountain guide in the area of the climb and apparently among all guides including mt everest sherpas on the planet her lost love who disappeared from the titled pass two years prior whom the party is purportedly seeking but never find her storeowner friend also a guide who may be better than a sherpa but no match for her the weird lead actor who engages her services and says theyll find her longmissing love in the bargain his one associate a computer hacker with purportedly limitless expertise of a level sufficient that gates might seek advice from him and his other colleague a bodyguard who apparently has an iq not even near three digitsbr br there are of course nefarious goingson and the secret quest of the lead actor is to gain recovery of a satellite which has fallen in the pass and has worldaltering and unique data to bring them untold riches exactly what is never revealedbr br overacting abounds the script looks like something which might get a c in a freshman writing class but an f if submitted at a higher level and the thespians gnaw every piece of scenery like a horde of beaversbr br the most interesting aspects of this movie for me was juxtaposing portions with three other flicks or roles ive seenbr br first the mysterious undisclosed secret data makes one recall the spanish prisoner an alistmamet film surrounding a valuable corporate process never specifically clarified but better for it definitely not so herebr br second the lead biscuit proved perhaps even more resourceful then rambo in dealing quickly when menaced later in the presentationbr br third i remember a steven seagal flick dont recall the title where he was semiconscious and abed for about 13 of the time and fullycomatose for another 13 although ive not sought viewing a lot of his work ive seen enough to have noted that while comatose he provided the best work he ever has and most inline with his laconic persona in this opus while awake the young hacker may have been the most engaging personality onscreen but while indisposed and incapacitated during the latter portion and unable to emote he provided the best acting during this seemingly unending two hoursbr br take the thin silly basis for a plot here imagine it being compressed into say a lbit on snl with gilda radner bill murray dan aykroyd and martin short in the four roles they could get record laughs with few changes to the dialog herebr br the most interesting aspect in the last analysis is contemplating what information could have been in the spy satellite to be worth even billions to any of many nations and yet rendered worthless according to the guru hacker if simply placed upon the internet with no apparent consequences thereafter even a turkey like this one should have at least a small trace of logic somewhere this one is totally devoid
