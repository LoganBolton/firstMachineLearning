i saw this on a boring sunday morning just this morning well i was drawn to the fact that its an outdoor movie i was hoping to find some nice sceneries but it the views where just limited they just go back and forth in the same spot all over again i hate it when theyre using this so called hitech stuffs like the this motorola bluetooth headset theyre using to eliminate the use of a walkie talkie it was just so funny they look like amateurs and they where like advertising those badly designed alienware laptops that could link up to a satellite to find people i couldnt say more about this tvmovie the ending was bad that it looks like they cut it short eliminating the use of rescue helicopters and etc
