so i caught this one afternoon as what lies above and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising the heroine diana pennington is a mountain climbing expertbut that doesnt help her when her fiancé brian gets hurt on a climb when she goes off to get help and returns he disappears from the mountain never to be seen againbr br two years later diana is still a climberbut she wont go near snowmans pass that is until curt seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program she agrees and they take off up the mountain with curts two assistants his bodyguard hugo and the computer whiz tyler from the start you know that theres some ulterior motive going on but unfortunately the twists arent good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the moviebr br the major disappointments are the red herrings most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition the object from the sky that fell into the mountains which turns out to be not so supernatural the story of how snowmans pass came to be and the most memorable one of them all dianas dream sequence halfway through the movie but what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball the majority of the movie revolves around the search for brian thats why i cant for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie this was the major plot this was how the movie started how do you not wrap that upbr br i wouldnt tell too many people to bother with this one
