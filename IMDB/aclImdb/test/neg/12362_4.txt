eight legged freaks is a modern monster movie like a remake of any of the old attack of the giant insert animal heremovies of the 50s 60s and 70s or rather it should have been more like a remake of the instead of what is was so how is a monster movie done in the year 2002 well from the typical opening with some chemical making the spiders grow to huge proportions they mix movies like gremlins jurassic park starship troopers and flavor it with some parody like scary movie gremlins is probably the best comparison but eight legged freaks was so full of parodies and stupid jokes that it was sometimes more like scary movie it was way too much at least if youre looking for a monster movie and not just another parody movie filled with jokesbr br for a movie like this you dont expect much of the acting and that is just the way it was the story though was extremely thin with just a bunch of loosely connected events to show off some action mixed with all of the jokes leading up to an easily spotted and corny endingbr br i rate eight legged freaks a 410 and that includes the fact that the special effects where pretty good and that the noises the spiders made where hilarious
