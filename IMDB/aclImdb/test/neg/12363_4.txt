im not going to say the story of the movie as some people do im pretty sure people who read this will know what the storyline is im also not going to go on and on about everything thats wrong with this movie because ill be here for ages if i do the storyline is typical and the special effects are below todays standards this is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie buff as most of us here are little things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience if your a casual movie watcher who likes to have a good time when they are watching a flick then this movie is perfect for you lots of fun it would also be a good movie to take a partner to just not for us movie buffsbr br  5 out of 10
