my expectations were high after seeing the trailer they were even higher when i saw the movie had the same director as independance day and godzilla the special effects in independence day were much better then in this movie the whole movie i was waiting for the spiders to show up the rest of the storyline was really boring and when the spiders came they had a very amateuristic look like the special effects were from a movie made in the 60s i didnt watch the whole movie when it was played for about one hour i switched off my dvdplayer i watch 3 movies almost every night and i have never walked away from a movie even if it was that boring the only thing good in this movie was the pretty sheriff  thats why i voted 2 instead of 1  so dont go see this one instead you should go out and rent starship troopers its like the same only 10000 times better
