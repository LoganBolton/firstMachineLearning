i hope this isnt a portent of things to come highdefinition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time although i wouldnt swear thats what was used here so its open season for all the wannabe scorseses and tarantinosbr br there is no hiding the cheapness of this stinker and calling it a film would be doing the industry a big disservice the photography is of a standard you would expect on a family outing to the zoo i could build me a new house with all the wooden acting whats remarkable about that is that nobody stands out as the worst they are all equally terrible like a whole bunch of ben afflecks or steven seagalsbr br what hooked me was the title im a sucker for this sort of thing like frankenhooker or monsturd frankenhooker was pretty bad too but at least i got some laughs out of it and the acting was merely bad not awful i cant comment on monsturd as ive yet to get hold of a copy of itbr br anyway i hope the people who made this didnt make any money from it else they might be encouraged to try it on again please guys pawn the camcorder and go back to your regular job
