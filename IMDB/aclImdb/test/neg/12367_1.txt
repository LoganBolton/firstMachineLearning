go get your camcorder your little brother and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on raccoons and you got yourself a film well thats what these guys thought anyway it was so bad i cant even remember the majority of it except for flashbacks comparable to someone who toured in nam despite the really corny title the horrible quality the terrible actors and the clich√© writing i think this movie isnt the worst ive ever seen im saving that slot for everything with steven seagal chuck norris and jeanclaude van dam anyhow if you are out of options when it comes to finding new horror films that you havent seen 1000 times already as i was and you are debating this one i would still skip this it had absolutely no redeeming qualities this mock serial killer thriller was a weak puny attempt at an even b film if theyre really lucky it might make the walmart 450 bin but i highly doubt it
