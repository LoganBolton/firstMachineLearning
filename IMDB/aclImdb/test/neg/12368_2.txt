the movie was pretty bad its not so much a script problem its just that the movie is really boring in terms of pacing the movie just seems to plod along at a slow agonizing rate the story in san franpsycho is that theres a serial killer on the loose who is killing morally corrupt individuals maybe i read too much into it but hey its my nature apparently after the san franpsycho kills a pair of people under the golden gate bridge were introduced to one of the main characters of the film joe estevez brother of martin sheen as a curmudgeony cop named bill culp bill is currently trying to hunt down the killer seriously he doesnt have a name hes just the killer and he is trying to coerce a local news reporter named rita to help him with his investigation bill is the stereotypical hardedged cop and he threatens rita to throw her in jail for obstruction of justice anyway a few scenes pass by and suddenly rita finds a letter left by the psychopath hes a cold blooded psychopath and she has a change of heart and tells bill and his partner joe about it and help them with the investigationbr br the movie tries to be a taut murderthriller but sort of just fails at that its much like the movie the black dahlia it tries to be tense but it just is unbelievable in terms of that the movie tries to be serious throughout but it has scenes like where the killer masturbates obviously a fan of gore porn what with lines like ooh blood on her or something to that effect and joe estevez hitting the table going hes a cold blooded murderer i admit to chuckling more than once at the movie even though im sure it was intended to be a deadly serious moviebr br one of the only positive points the movie has going for it is the fact that i didnt pay money to see it huzzah netflix and its sad because i could see some good in their movies after watching the damned sure the movie had its fair share of flaws but it was enjoyable sadly though san franpsycho has nothing going for it granted it has an okay script its nothing too grand but it couldve been interesting instead what you get is a murder thriller that fails to thrill or have even vaguely enjoyable deaths also the other reviews claim that the movie has a great twist ending thats shocking apparently i was watching a different movie because by about the one hour mark i sort of figured out what was going to happen the ending didnt shock me in the least bit i would go on insulting this wreck of a movie but i dont think i will long story short this movie is a boring uninspired thriller i use that term loosely that fails to have the hitchcockian thrills that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending bland deaths acting with all of the emotion of a plank of wood and a decent soundtrackbr br im sure others will try to defend this with the usual it was a low budget movie they did the best they could with such a low budget and all that other nonsense but when you get right down to it there was very little that they couldve really spent that budget on there was very little special effects work the soundtrack sounds like it mightve been recycled from hood of the living dead or the damned and its the same damn crew from those two films this movie really reminds me a lot of another low budget flick that was no good and it was called mr jingles the two are about the same quality they fail to deliver anything close to enjoyment and should fade quickly into obscurity
