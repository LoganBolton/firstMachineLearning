without a shadow of a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst film i have ever had the missfortune to see my whole life take 5 wooden actors who got thrown out of acting school because they were so wooden someone sat on them thinking they were a benchbr br then add a cheap camcorder you know the old vhs types that cost Â£20 on ebay add a terrible story line with no effects and yes you have this film what a shocker it was they couldnt even save it by having a fit girl in it she was fat and ugly and was the worst of all i actually watched it all as i could not believe this crap ever got fundedbr br miss at all costs
