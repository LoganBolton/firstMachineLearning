this is one of the most laughably bad films ive ever seen i cannot believe whoever wrote the review above was serious perhaps he was connected with making it it doesnt have anything going for it there is no suspense the acting is dire the direction hopeless the music score  is three trite notes played ad nauseam the plot  must have taken all of five minutes to write the dialogue is what a 10yearold would come up with if asked to do a homework project the only slightly redeeming feature is the actor playing the psycho himself who grimaces trembles and gurns magnificently and thus is amusing at times the only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you were suffering from a weak bladder dont waste your time
