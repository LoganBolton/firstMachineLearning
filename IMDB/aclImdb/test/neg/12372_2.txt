this terrible moovie is fun on many levels  the moost obvious is the lame fakelooking bird puppet which floats around the cheap sets without ever flapping it wings like it was on a string perhaps attacking model trains and toy cars the science is asinine  a masonic atom gun and whats up with the enormous amounts of brylcream in everyones hair i guess the 50s were the slimeball decade well this bird puppet apparently comes from some godforsaken antimatter universe and its here to build a nest  lay eggs in new york seriously that they manage to kill the puppet is almost a shame i give it 1 hoof out of 4  its silly and stupid but moore fun than armageddon 8
