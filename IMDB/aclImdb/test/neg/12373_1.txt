this is a truly terrible scifihorror film from 1957 in fact despite ed wood jrand his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of wood now the acting is a bit better than youd find in the wood epics such as plan 9 and bride of the monster but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than woods however bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that its so bad that its still excellent viewing like a wood film its great to watch this crapfest and laugh along with your friendsbr br the film begins with a scientist flying about doing some testing in his jet however out of nowhere a ufo streaks by and his report of this over the radio triggers a panic by the air force however later they realized that the ufo didnt appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut but when soon after this planes start disappearing all over they realize there must be something to his sightingbr br so far the film isnt great but its watchable however by the time the horrible flying monster appears you know youre watching a turkey first through horrid use of stock film and crappy models airplanes keep changing midflight some may not be bothered by this but with airplane lovers like me seeing an f80 turning into an f86 to an f102 fighter plane made me crazyespecially since the planes look nothing like each other second through clever cinematography all you really see of the monster is a ball of fuzz for half the film this is frustrating and you hope that when you finally do see it clearly it will be worth the wait well no such luck the monster looks less realistic or scary than the duck from grouchos you bet your life tv show in fact its significantly less realistic than any of the japanese giant monsters in fact big bird from sesame street is even a bit scarier and realistic its just godawful in every way and might just be the dumbest movie monster in historyabout as bad or worse as the monsters in robot monster or teenagers from outer space the bottom line is that this is an absolutely dreadful film that sane people wont like bad film fans like me who are a crazy bunch will probably love it all othersbe afraidbe very afraidbr br fyiyou might notice that some clips in this film are from other scifi movies i am positive the crashing washington monument scene was stolen from earth vs the flying saucers but i also saw a couple other scenes that i swear are from other films what a hack job
