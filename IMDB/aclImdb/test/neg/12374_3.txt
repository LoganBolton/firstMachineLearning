before we start may i say i hope youve already eaten when youre reading this why because after id seen this film for the first time the birds look and sound made me want to eat chicken after the words the end had appeared on the screen so dont say you werent warnedbr br fred sears might have directed earth vs the flying saucers an okay film and one of the bigger examples for tim burtons mars attacks but the giant claw is not that giant a film yes its a prehistoric monster that flies in the air attacks planes and cities and occasionally treats itself to a man on a parachute the beast is giant except in the scenes where its considerably smaller but who needs consistent proportions in a movie scary it could have been but not if the plot is hopelessly silly and the monster looks like like a puppet that ran away from sesame street
