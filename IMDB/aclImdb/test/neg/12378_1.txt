this is one awful movie some people told me that it was not that bad actually but i sure disagree the monster is amazingly cheap and funny looking but this is something we all knew i guess in addition to that the dialogs are awful and the writing is just plain terriblebr br as bad as it is this movie as the quality of being entertaining not always for the good reasons but its a good so bad that its fun flickbr br by the way theres no such thing as la castagne according to a secondary character in the film named pierre described in the movie as a french canadian theres a legend among french canadians about a giant bird know as la castagne as a french canadian myself i can assure you that i never heard of such a legend it sure made me laugh though
