largely forgettable monster film from the 50s features truly awful special effects  the claw in question is a giant puppet that would make jim henson want to kill himself i just saw the movie last thursday and i cant even tell you who was in it thats a bad sign im told that when the movie premiered audiences laughed it off the screen and that was in the 50s when standards in special effects were much lower basically i should have walked out of the theater as soon as the words produced by sam katzman came on the screen if i knew what was good for me but then i sat through harum scarum also so i guess i deserve it
