this ones as cheesy as they come  the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already too loopy for words but wait till you get a load of the goofy creature as it appears on screen i tell you i laughed so hard through this thing that i missed out on some of the expository dialogue  then again the latter is often so heavy on scientific jargon and laws of physics and such at which ive never been any good in spite of my love of scifi movies that it didnt really matter anyway the bird  first depicted as a mere blurred form whizzing through the skies but subsequently shown in all its dopey glory  is so sublimely silly that it wouldnt be amiss in a looney tunes cartoon witness the series of intermittentlytaken photographs that start with the creature in the distance and end on a sidesplitting extreme closeup of its face br br director sears had fared much better with his other film about ufos the fine earth vs the flying saucers 1956  with special effects provided by a master ray harryhausen speaking of which ive just given away my copy of the latter in anticipation of acquiring columbias recentlyreleased se dvd also it seems to me that some of the footage illustrating the birds rampage in new york here were lifted from the destruction of washington seen in that earlier scifi classic again the leads are played by genre regulars  namely jeff morrow from this island earth 1955 and mara corday from tarantula 1955 as with the aforementioned flying saucers these titles are highlyregarded and beloved by fans  consequently they are vastly superior to this lamentable addition to the alienmonster animal cycle prevalent during the scifi heyday and beyond incidentally other flying menaces were featured in the flying serpent 1946 which i havent watched and larry cohens tongueincheek updating of same in q the winged serpent 1982br br unfortunately the giant claw cant even rise to a decent climax  which is so rushed as to be a washout to quote a jet pilot from the film itself whose assault with rockets on the bird proves completely ineffective that is before morrow realizes that its shielded by an invisible barrier and then has to figure out a way how to be able to penetrate it ultimately apart from the intractable and frankly tedious technical asides one gets a feeling of so bad its good watching this after all it only lasts for 74 minutes  and in any case the bird is such an unforgettably daft creation as to put a huge smile on your face every time it turns up
