i love old monster movies for the pure camp value this one does not disappoint if you find that sort of thing amusingbr br the acting is pure 1950s stilted crap you do get used to it when youve seen enough of these the dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable youre just there for the giant birdbr br the science in this movie is hilarious a monstrous otherworldly avian that can manipulate antimatter intent on wreaking havoc and eating people an alien who has come to earth to nest some of the best scenes in the movie that dont have the bird in them include the scientists explaining what is going onbr br a lot has been said about the ridiculous bird marionette it looks like a new baby bird bald and ugly with ruffled feathers it even caws like a hungry angry fledgling however the bird scared the crap out of my three year old who had big scary bird nightmares for the evening its a bit creepybr br i was very sad about the scene where they shoot the egg somehow the egg is not protected by an antimatter shield but im a bird lover what can i say
