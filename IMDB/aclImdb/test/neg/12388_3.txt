oh yawn not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even for the abuse they suffered the only difference is that in this film everybodys a pig or has mush for brains i hated this film for the moral issue of why its right to send a man to prison for life for a murder he didnt commit is that a more immoral act than his abuse and deviousness this movie shows all the situational ethics of bad writing i saw it on the cbcs best of britain series if this is britains best no wonder the british film industry is in troublebr br the only bright spot in this film was david tennant he plays his character as so despicable that im likely to spit on the next person who speaks with a scottish accent kate ashfield tries to play the victim but comes off in the end as immorally devious as david tennants character they deserve each otherbr br in the mush for brains category are the parents who see nothing wrong with the obviously psychotic brendan english policemen are made out to be so incompetent that theyre unfit to give out traffic tickets the british policemans union should sue the makers of this film for defamationbr br this film isnt worth the electricity it takes to run your dvd to watch it
