the title doesnt make much sense to me im not sure what door in the movie shouldnt have been openedbr br the movie starts uneventfully with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train car complete with the sound of the train traveling in fact the mans house is a train car and he has a cassette of train sounds the woman leaves and calls a young woman the young woman tells her boyfriend a doctor that shes been told her grandmother is ill and she needs to return to her home town she hasnt been there in thirteen yearsbr br flash back to thirteen years ago a shadowy figure enters a house he caresses a sleeping young girl then goes into another room and stabs the girls mother the girl wakes up and enters her mothers room and finds her dead with a knife in her she screams and an arm comes out of nowhere and claps a hand over her mouth she looks up in fear that early scene in the movie of the killer muffling her scream and the girls look is one of the few effective shots in the moviebr br it doesnt have much going for it in the visuals department occasionally theres some strange use of sound and theres some weird lighting in an attic scene where many of the panes of glass are red and bluebr br back to the present day the young woman arrives in her grandmothers house an old doctor is there who she doesnt trust along with the man from the opening scene judge and kearn the towns museum operator she doesnt trust any of them and its true they dont inspire any trust shes rather crabby throughout the whole movie she wants to check her grandmother into a hospital the men in the town want her house and the museum operator wants the things in it his museum is already filled with many of the grandmothers things inexplicably the woman wants to keep the housebr br the young woman starts getting phone calls from a man speaking in a sinister whisper he makes various threats and wants her to do things to arouse him such scenes recur often unfortunately there are so few characters in the movie that the possibilities of who it could be are limited worse still we see right from the beginning who is making the phone calls so while the young woman doesnt know even though the caller occasionally drops into his normal voice the audience always knows no suspense each call rattles her more and morebr br the ending was unexpected for me so maybe gets points for not going with the obvious but im not sure i cared for it
