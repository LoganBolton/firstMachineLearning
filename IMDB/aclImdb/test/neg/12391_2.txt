it seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for the sopranos as its main character martin blank john cusack is a hit man who has so many issues from his past and his profession that hes in therapy trying to deal with it all everything finally comes to a head at his 10year high school reunion the problem was that by the time blank got to the reunion i had stopped caring frankly i found this movie a drag from start to finishbr br it had potential there was a reasonably good cast headed by cusack and dan aykroyd playing grocer his archrival in the hitman business along with minnie driver as debi blanks high school sweetheart who he stood up on prom night and a limited role for alan arkin as dr oatman blanks psychologist that fairly talented cast never really seemed to come together though the drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humour what i thought had the most potential to be a comedic storyline was grocers proposal for a hit mans union but aside from becoming a bit of a running joke the idea never really got developed as for the romance one wondered why debi would even think of letting this guy back into her lifebr br there were a handful of chuckles but nothing really caught me and held me and i spent most of the movie wondering whether this thing was ever going to start to click it never did  not for me at least 210
