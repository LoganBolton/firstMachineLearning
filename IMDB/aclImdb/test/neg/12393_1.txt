i was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews this has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch itbr br the concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on american idol you watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings but we knew this movie didnt have bad actors so how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldnt get anywhere near an american idol tryout it would be pointless as this movie wasbr br the use of improv is overrated weve all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes i feel that is improv improv cant be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film proves if you like that drew carey hosted show of improv youll probably like this filmbr br overall the jokes were poor the improv was sophomoric and the overacting by guest and company was campyand those are my compliments of this drivel if a guy playing a trumpet and the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you fine for me i prefer more heady stuff like i love lucy or heehawbr br but remember i think snl lost its humor in the 1980s so maybe youll like this grated humor i kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us there was no zoo in town thats the humor you can expectbr br my only wish was that i could give this a minus rating
