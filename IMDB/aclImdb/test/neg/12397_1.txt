after a meteorite lands in boston really somewhere in the isle of man a hideous fanged alien monster is released and is on the loose in a local girls school causing mayhem and turning the students into zombielike creatures this film is apparently a loose and i stress loose remake of the 1986 film with the same name as it features the same monster but a different plot both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable this isnt lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad this film is supposed to take place in boston we know this because the film makers had the ingenious idea of putting boston police or boston gas company on everything yet everyone seems to have rather muddled british accents at least they didnt try using boston accents thank god the script is a big flawed mess the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite is that what our brave heroes do no they run around shooting the zombiestudents instead nice director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films the movie is terribly boring in places the lighting is awful the film looks cheap and bland one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 99 of the death scenes involve the creature popping out of a dark corner and dragging someone away while we hear theyre horrified screams off in the distance this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here the visual effects were awful the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teethbr br to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus not recommendedbr br 1510
