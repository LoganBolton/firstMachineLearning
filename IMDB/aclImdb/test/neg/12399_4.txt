its strange what fate does to some people while looking in the discount bin at a dvd retailer i came across a copy of deadly instincts being a collector of any film that is either scifi horror or featuring alien monsters i decided to buy it not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars  a bargain believe me after viewing it i came to the opinion that it was nothing special but after doing some research on the internet i discovered that the film was actually called breeders  was a remake of the tim kincaid horror flick that menaced video stores in the mid1980s which ive already seen my appreciation of deadly instincts grew following that discoverybr br a meteorite crashes on the lawn next to a private girls college the sole teacher there ashley played by todd jensen  thats right the guy who gets turned into a cyborg in the cult flick cyborg cop four years earlier notices that some of the students are beginning to disappear while encountering a blackhaired woman with a scarred face  wearing a kinky leather outfit his investigation reveals that an alien creature had hitched a ride on the meteorite  had come to earth to breed using the local womenfolk along with a local detective who believes him to be responsible for the disappearances ashley tries to stop the monsterbr br the original breeders directed by tim kincaid who would leave the genre to make gay porn was a scifi  horror film which was actually a thinlyveiled softcore porn film designed to take skin flicks to genre fans it is in my belief one of the worst films made in the 1980s why anyone would want to remake it is quite a mysterybr br this remake is actually a better effort than its lowbudget source the film which takes the basic concept of an alien monster trying to interbreed with human women eliminates any pornographic elements in fact the film is actually very tame there are no sex scenes no nudity even during the shower scene swearing  violence are kept to a minimal level  there is no gore which may cheat gorehounds this makes the remake a film safe for the whole family that is if the kids arent scared by alien monsters which brings me to the films m 15 rating which seems a bit muchbr br tameness of subject matter aside the film does have some faults the script while featuring some good characterizations has a number of holes so big you can crash a meteor throughbr br what youre mad at me for that come on this review needed a bad pun so it will remain interestingbr br anyway the films setting is one problem the script failed to fix  the film is set in boston but the buildings dont look like they belong in boston something about the architecture aint right another thing is the college itself with a rather large building housing about twenty students all female of course  only having one class  art the only teacher there has a relationship with a student  so does the janitor which somehow escapes the attention of the principal not to mention the cops who are so onedimensional  stupid that the real boston pd would have a good case if they ever decided to sue oh  the meteor well the chance that a meteor which is sent from saturn check the opening credits reaches earth with no onboard propulsion is astronomical that doesnt include the chances that any passengers in the meteor will survive the landingbr br as far as the acting goes todd jensen gives a dependable performance as the heroic teacher while the late kadamba simmons who was murdered by her boyfriend shortly before the film came out cuts a striking figure in that leather outfit as well as proving she can act the visual effects are runofthemill with credits due to the filmmakers for bringing us a coollooking monster
