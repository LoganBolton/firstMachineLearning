of all the movies in the history of movies i cant imagine someone sitting down and saying i want to spend x amount of dollars or pounds sterling to remake that flawed classic film called breeders lots of stories have been turned into films about meteors coming to earth with something sinister lurking inside why not put your money into making a spectacular 3d remake of it came from outer space instead why look for a dingy nudie flick that existed only for the purpose of showing off a rubbery set of monsters and some naked coeds was the script for the 1986 version of breeders so inspiring that these producers felt it had to be done again and this time done correctly when you come down to it the only reason this film exists is to show off britcom cutie pie samantha janus but if youre gonna make a skin flick and exploit sam janus in it youd better have her more naked than this and naked more often than this if you want to succeedbr br meteor lands  monster escapes  coeds duff their clothes  monster eats people  and another what if ending ensuesbr br honestly i never thought i would ever recommend the original breeders over any other film but this would be the one to come in 2nd place to it
