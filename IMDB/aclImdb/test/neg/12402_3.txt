ive read other hacks reviews of this movie and while it certainly isnt the best movie ever made in the scifi  horror genre it isnt that bad if you accept it for what it is  lowbudget bmovie fare that shall we say borrows heavily from the likes of alien nasty extraterrestrial monster that cocoons its victims species gorgeous and confused space girl and incubus the beastiebreedingwithcaptivegirls angle this is one seriously cheesy movie and the whole thing was obviously done on a shoestring budget although the alien isnt too bad ive seen far less convincing meninrubbersuits at any rate none of the acting is oscar material and the isle of man doesnt really double for boston massachussetts very convincingly the plot is fairly predictable too and the premise that an alien craft would travel squillions of miles and crash land smack bang in the middle of an allgirls college campus  thus conveniently providing a rich source of perfect breeding victims  is utterly laughable however the movie does have its suspenseful moments theres a few helpings of nudity and seminudity and the film does feature one of the few movie appearances by the beautiful and tragic model  actress kadamba simmons as the space girl who at the age of only 24 was murdered in london by her jealous boyfriend shortly after making this film
