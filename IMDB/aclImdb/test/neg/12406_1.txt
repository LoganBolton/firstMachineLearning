the direction by wong is perhaps the all time worst in film history ive ever seen this film makes my all time worst film of 2000 dungeons and dragons by courtney soloman looked like an oscar winner the flaws in this movie is beyond explanation the biggest one is the lack of depth every scene does not develop fully as if the editing room doesnt know how to do their job correctly its a shame that with such an allstar cast of talents and a famous popular traditional story can be destroyed by this lack of visionbr br i am so disgusted and hope that some great director like john woo or ang lee decide to remake this film and do some justice im not even sure if i can rate 010
