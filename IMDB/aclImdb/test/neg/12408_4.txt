as i sit back after watching wong karwais 1994 movie ashes of time  more specifically the 2008 reedit and rerelease with the word redux slapped on the end of the title  i wonder what went wrong i wonder why the film just didnt work out at all i wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book in particular what was it about the film which dragged it down and made it the directors worst film of his careerbr br well its not too hard to figure out really let me just say that it truly is a shame that karwai so abruptly went down this hellhole of mediocrity and poorness in moviedom especially considering the fact that in the same year he released chungking express one of his enduring legacies and an absolutely sublime film so  what went wrong it would be suitable to consider ashes of time as somewhat of an experimental film our director essentially places his own inimitable style of filmmaking and places it in an entirely different setting mood and atmosphere what results is a catastrophic film which is all over the place and simply does not work out hence it would be even wiser to call ashes of time a failed experiment bold audacious and innovative but a failure nonethelessbr br let me elaborate those who have seen the films of mr karwai a hong kongborn film auteur whos made his mark on the arthouse world since his debut in the late80s will know that there is an overriding aesthetic which binds all of his movies together essentially and frankly speaking theyre all colourful thoughtprovoking amiable subtly humorous and meaningful evocations of life love and loss the same formula is transposed into ashes of time however the regular setting of hong kong is ridden of and in its stead were placed into the setting of ancient china and the land of the legendary martial arts warriors and clansmenbr br intertwined into this quasiadventurehistorical caper is the typical karwai love story this time involving an elegiac hitman who has moved to the middle of the desert and is carrying out contract killings however i must stop myself there description of characters is a useless thing to do why because not a single character in ashes of time is worth mentioning or nothing what a bland cast and what a waste of talent the case of ashes of time contains nearly all regular karwai collaboratorsbr br not only that but the film is essentially endless incessant rambling in a horrendous almost nonexistent narrative structure one of the main reasons why detractors of ashes of time berate it is because it seems to possess no plot whatsoever let alone a semblance or an indication of one you can definitely see what theyre getting at even from the first two three minutes maybe less of the film perhaps its just the atypical setting of ancient china which is unaccustomed and inappropriate for karwais typical filmmaking style i like to think however unfortunate it may be that mr karwai just stuffed up big time herebr br one thing that a reviewer can actually compliment in ashes of time albeit said compliment being starkly isolated is another director trademark  wonderful colourful and blissful aesthetics what joyous colour is composed onscreen what glorious textures are painted for us and what breathtaking landscapes and imagery are captured for us throughout the entire movie we can at least take this as a sign that wong karwai is still there at heart and its just the film which is so atypical and buries his usually commendable nuance although the visuals arent enough for us to fully absolve karwai for this disastrous venture theyre enough to make the film worthwhile  and at least we dont walk out of the movie in a completely and totally cantankerous mood now that theres something we can think of nicelybr br the film is essentially a wuxia art film following in the style of say legendary japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa however one thing differentiates karwais film from kurosawas best and thats that in the japanese directors films everything gels together and simply works in ashes of time nothing seems to work karwais attempt to make a genuinely profound wuxia film let alone an intellectual and provocative movie in general terms is a futile endeavourbr br karwai claims that making ashes of time exhausted him and that he needed time to clear his head it mustve certainly been a fatiguing effort on his behalf as his exertions are embodied in the film and transferred to us directly  i mean just watching the film is an exhausting effort and now i need time to clear my head of this unpleasant moviegoing experience
