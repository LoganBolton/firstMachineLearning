did the writers pay people to come up here and write positive reviews i mean really its a bit hackneyed and spike isnt that funny he seems more like the serious guy trying too hard to be funny there are so many mediocre gigs in this show like once the opening sketch was talk show apply directly to the forehead over and over and another that featured spike and another dude getting high and it wasnt even funny they didnt even do anything but sit around and laugh over and over ha ha and another that featured spike talking to a korean guy who ate duck and told him that he had a pet duck ha ha i mean really spike just gets funny guests on his show thats why people like this show
