wild rebels was probably a fun second film at a drive in movie triple feature 40 years ago it hasnt aged very well but it was never meant to age well it was obviously intended to be disposable forgettable fun from its inception taken on that level its a good example of the biker flick genrebr br several elements help distinguish it from the dozens of similar films being churned out at the same time the hero rod tillman steve alaimo comes off as somewhat of an unimpressive everyman  hes not especially brave tough talented or handsome although he does win a fight with a tough biker gang member halfway into the film and the girl gang member chooses to help him over her fellow gang member at the end of the film the soundtrack is quite well done featuring a nice ventures style bassdrum riff that keeps things moving and saxophones and brass charts that pep things up quite a bit and although the script is pretty shallow all the actors inhabit their cardboard characters convincingly and with a fair amount of energybr br there are plenty of careless technical gaffes terrible dayfornight scenes that occur in broad daylight squealing tires in a swamp fire sirens mistakenly stuck on the soundtrack instead of police sirens a bank sign made of duct tape on a ceiling tile a luger that sounds like a winchester 3006 shotgun blasts that cut down people 100 yards away a detective killing a biker on a 3rd floor landing from the ground with a revolver with a 2 inch barrelbr br there are a whole bunch of goofy story elements  linda the girl gang member disables a bank guard with a drugfilled syringe the final shootout takes place inside a lighthouse  police roadblocks dont actually block roads the police apparently never heard of ducking and the police detectives apparently never heard of planting bugs or having their undercover guy wearing a wirebr br but the plot chugs along the cameraman knows what he is doing the pacing in most scenes is pretty good and there are some nice zippy one liners and dialog exchanges here and there that keep the energy level up my favorite man youre messing with private stock ie linda so no dont seek this one out or anything but if a copy of the mst version should fall in your hands you should have some good shallow fun watching it vastly superior to five the hard way or the hellcats or even girl in gold boots three other mst covered counter culture movies
