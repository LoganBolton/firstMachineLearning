i just caught wild rebels on one of the mystery science theatre 3000 archive compilations and this movie was so bad even the mst3k crew couldnt make it entertaining there are some mst3k targets that were films whose concepts were so dippy they couldnt possibly have been good movies like the green slime and others whose basic premises could have been made into genuinely entertaining films if their filmmakers hadnt bobbled them in the execution wild rebels is a film whose basic premise did make a good movie three years earlier when don siegel directed his remake of the killers at universal both films are about a failed racing driver whos seduced by a femme fatale into driving the getaway car in a robbery masterminded by the womans boyfriend  only in the killers the driver was john cassavetes the woman was angie dickinson and the criminal mastermind cast wildly but successfully against type in what turned out to be his final film was ronald reagan steve alaimo bobbie byers and willie pastrano are quite a comedown but what really makes wild rebels an awful movie is the direction by william gref√© note the accent over the final e present in his onscreen credit which has absolutely no sense of pace whatsoever and seems to let every shot run at least half again as long as it needs to to make its dramatic point its only a pity that someone didnt do a mocking commentary on this movie now in 2009 the comparison between steve alaimos hairdo and rod blagojevichs would have been irresistible
