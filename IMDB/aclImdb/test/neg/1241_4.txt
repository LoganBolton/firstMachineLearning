this show is like watching someone who is in training to someday host a show there are some good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre ones it doesnt look like the writers know the difference between whats funny and whats just weird or grossbr br it has its moments when spike hosed down a neighbor who had been letting her dog soil his lawn repeatedly it hit its peak but the hilarious moments are too few and theres too many experimental comedy bits that miss the markbr br the shows better than say watching a test pattern or the qvc network but it needs some better writersbr br reading the glowingly positive imdb comments on this show i am convinced that most of them were written by show staffers and by relatives and personal friends of spikebr br it just isnt very good most of the time
