this is basically your run of the mill violent biker flick complete with nifty slangs crashes and music ok so just slangs and crashes its a slight notch above much of the other fare featured on mst3k but its still the equivalent of driving a nail into your kneecap slow and painful to give away plot would exhaust my energy so ill just say youre better off skipping this one
