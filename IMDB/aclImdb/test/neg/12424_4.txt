i completely forgot that id seen this within a couple of days which is pretty revealing in itself the umpteenth version of gaston phantom of the opera lerouxs lockeddoor countryhouse mystery i had heard that it was an engaging and witty update so it appeared from the likable title sequence and a few neat touches in the opening scene but the film very quickly ground to a halt and became vaguely tedious and wholly unsatisfyingbr br as a mystery the major problem is that it is fundamentally unsolvable by the audience like the worst agatha christies it depends on a character appearing in the final act with a wealth of background information that we have not been privy to as a film be it comedy or thriller the crucial problem is that characterisation is almost nonexistent with the exception of the killer everyone is a facevalue version of the typical suspects in the typical countryhouse murder story  reporter endangered heiress suspicious fianc√© scatterbrained scientist father a surprisingly poor michel lonsdale etc theres no depth and little of interest and the frequently overripe or misjudged performances dont help you frankly dont care about anyone in it so theres no jeopardy or suspense only claude rich and in the last reel pierre arditi get anything to work with and only in the last reel does the film get close to a sense of resonance that is too fleeting to be really effectivebr br for the rest we get endless exposition and a couple of ineffective wouldbe comic set pieces a promising one with a photographer trapped inside a grandfather clock is just too poorly thought through to pay off with dennis podalydes reduced to irving the explainer for the last third of the picture im not fond of countryhouse movies or agatha christie style whodunits so those who are might cit it a lot more slack but i found it a poor show as rich says when the mystery is revealed its all rather something of a disappointment
