maybe im alone here but this is a crap show im sorry but i was lured in when i found out about lil bill oreilly which i had no idea came from this show until months later and has honestly since lost its appeal but i gave the show a fair shot spike tries to hard to make himself into something hes not which is to say he tries to be human fox didnt even bother to hide the strings when they took him out of the box he came in his sketches try to hard he himself isnt funny and the writers are struggling to write material for a notalent host there is too much good tv out there to waste your time with this show and foxfox we had some good times but you need to get your fing act together and come up with something original instead of trying to be just another metoo network
