it starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other clark movies like kids bully etc but then just as quickly it unravels into a directionless mess who is the main character is this a serious film or some gregg arakiesquire over the top goofy film is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted i have no clue i found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end i kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came i cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes yes it illustrates the changing landscape between the haves have nots i got it way back in the beginning kids and bully was done in such a way that i actually felt like i was observing the realities of that group of friends wassup felt very staged poorly constructed and ever worse acting teenage caveman which larry didnt write but did direct was terrible but at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didnt take itself seriously wassup rockers was just plain bad
