larry clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director but he has made some undeniably important films kids bully and to a lesser extent ken park all achieve their intended purpose shock revulsion and even disgust these films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth kids exposed us to the proliferation of aids and sexual promiscuity among the young bully touched upon similar issues ken park dealt somewhat hamhandedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui irrefutably all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouthbr br wassup rockers is about a group of poor hispanic skateboarders from southcentral las angeles who go to arbitrarily go to beverly hills to skate thats itbr br wassup rockers is nothingbr br it has no substance it has an essentially nonexistent narrative and like kids it features a cast of firsttime actors who were drawn out of the films setting however unlike kids none of them have any semblance of talent there is better acting in porn this film features without a doubt the most terrible performances ive ever seen in a feature film one can respect larry clark to exposing these young men to the filmmaking process but these kids are absolutely cringeworthy folks might i add that apparently these gents also produced the soundtrack which features some of the most dismally inept garage punk youll ever hear my advice is to pop a couple of migraine pills before you enter the theater or youll regret it afterwardbr br but then again its not like they had much of a script to work with every line that is uttered is a contrived patheticallydelivered and irritating beyond all measure the story itself is ludicrous it starts out reasonably enough but soon slips quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity this begins of course with a capricious sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls followed by a series of clich√©d national lampoonish encounters characters being killed off for no reason and finally resulting in a ridiculous anticlimax shots go on much longer than they need to be prepared to watch people fall of skateboards for about fifteen minutes straight overlong lingering shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding down streets but then again with the script at a scant 32 pages they need as much useless filler as possible perhaps wassup rockers would have worked better as a short filmbr br anyways i could go on like this this is the worst film larry clark has made yet for those of you who are interested in seeing a clark movie if only for his shocking pederast antics look elsewhere this is by far the tamest film hes made yet and its also the worst its flat out horrible like uwe boll horrible definitely the worst one i saw at the festivalbr br 110
