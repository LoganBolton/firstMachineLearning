ever once in a while i run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad i wonder why movies exist this is one of them this is a terrible attempt to parody the godfather with annoying cartoon sounds and bad dialogue eddie deezen is just plain annoying as tony an annoying twit who upon his father don william hickeys request takes over the family business tony as i said is an annoying little twit this makes the whole movie a complete mess the movie is terribly daffy its too cartoonish the main point im trying to make is that you cant make a parody of an acclaimed drama like the godfather with so much cartoonishness it doesnt work that way believe it or not you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously if you dont take it seriously it will feel too much like a parody the thing about doing a parody is that you cant seem too much like youre doing a parody you have to make it seem like youre taking the movie at least a little bit seriously it also feels like theyre just mocking woody allen and thats what makes this movie absolutely terrible
