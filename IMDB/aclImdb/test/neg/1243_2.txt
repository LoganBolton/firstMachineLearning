first of allive seen better acting and more realistic makeup in porno flicks how bad was chris moltisante as stewie ungar on the sopranos chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered comic relief and then throw in bobby baccala as one of his vegas cronies its just too much to take in a dramatic movie neither actor can handle a serious role and is better suited as a second banana for tonypaulie or uncle junior and i want to know who did the makeup for this disaster i want that person to be my makeup person over the next 25 years so ill never age a day either so thats all ill write on this movie since its not worth wasting too much more of my time br br yes i do know that michael imperioli and steve schirippa are their real names
