if you liked william hickey in prizzis honor he resurrects his character as don anthony in mob boss this is a very weak godfather satire with few laughs stuart whitman looks perplexed as to what hes doing in this schlockfest morgan fairchilds performance is one of the better efforts in the movie and that alone is not a good sign for sure eddie deezen vacillates between three stooges slapstick and a bad woody allen imitation fatally flawed mob boss is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom and numerous other nonsense  merk
