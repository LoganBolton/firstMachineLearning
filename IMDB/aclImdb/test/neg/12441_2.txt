this has to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life i cant believe people actually a write scripts like this b have a budget to make a film c actually expect it to be successful words cant even describe how horrible this film is i enjoy my fair share of teen movies but this didnt even come close to being funny in fact it was funny for the sole reason that it was so horrible i can probably count one maybe two parts in the film where i even managed to squeeze out a chuckle other than the laughs regarding how bad it wasbr br renting this was one of the biggest mistakes ive ever made its been a day since ive seen the film and im still in shock regarding how horrible it was avoid at all costsbr br 210
