my mom brought me this movie on a dvd a guy in a rental recommended it but in fact this might be the worst movie ive ever seen you know i didnt expect much from this film but it didnt have a good story it wasnt even funny and it was senseless i was looking forward to see christine lakin in this movie because i loved step by step even she was a huge disappointment the story was completely unreal one of the party guys is dead he wasnt dead in fact he woke up later the house looks like there exploded a bomb and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to handle everything but then there comes a homosexual policeman there is a total mess till the end and the guys managed to tide up and everything in like 15 minutes come on just be realistic at least waste of money really
