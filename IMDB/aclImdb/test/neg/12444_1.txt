everyones already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a stake in the film or had friendsfamily who had a stake in the film and thats okay  if id made a movie all of my family and friends would be in there complimenting it too in all honesty there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie unfortunately the bad things far outweigh the good good the overall plot was mildly interesting the music was overall pretty good several of the songs when you could hear them were actually pretty cool the only musical issues i had were 1 the first suspense scene with some sort of quiet instrumental it really seemed to take away from the suspense 2 the song being played when the lead characters went to an outdoor party at a friends house and 3 the songs that were good were too quiet especially when a heavy metal song was playing in the background while danny trejo hung a man sounded like a pretty cool song but it should have ripped out across the scene when danny trejo got froggy now for the completely bad stuff the script was atrocious i mean horrible ive seen smoother dialogue in a star wars movie advice to the writer from a parttime writer and fulltime movie buff when you write dialogue ask yourself is this something that people would actually say honestly the script was laughable i want to slam the acting but with that kind of writing its hard to know if they have talent or not the mildly interesting plot was seriously hampered by the crappy dialogue i know it was lowbudget but words dont cost money  if you have a good script even semicompetent actors can pull it off this movie didnt seem to have either but hopefully the director will get a second shot at making a better film
