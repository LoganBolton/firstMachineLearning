wow this movie really sucked down below the normal scale of dull boring and unimaginative films ive seen recently the acting was poor and robotic the story was so bland you could have summed it up with a simple 5minute short audio was so poor and dirty it was hard to even listen to perhaps it was unedited from the camera it was shot off of im not sure which movie the 3 glowing reviewers were commenting on but it wasnt this one perhaps the director had his hand in seeing that his film received a good review at least before the real reviews started to show upbr br save your time or youll just be wasting your time and money on this film absolute suckage
