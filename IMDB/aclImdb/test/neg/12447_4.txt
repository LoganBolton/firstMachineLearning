dont get fooled by the awards and the comment below this is just 1 poor movie the way george katt played his character the soft gangster makes it very annoying to watch the conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic display of this de in the rest of the film the characters head seems to be somewhere else his emotions dont match with the things that happen in the filmthe things he says as a voiceover doesnt add anything to the film it just makes zeus an even more spineless character with is head in the cloudsbr br the story and the film was put together with a total lack of fantasy all parts of the film were poorly stolen from other modern directors lets hope jon rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films
