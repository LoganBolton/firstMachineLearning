this was pretty bad  from bad acting bad technical details bad camera shots and bad audio even though i was watching a dvd sometimes i couldnt hear what they were saying sometimes it was blowing my speakers even within the same conversation the plot was predictable and the characters consisted of mostly unbelievable neurotics bipolars and caricatures character development was awful the bratty little sister why was she even written into the script the nagging mom again  what purpose the whiny girlfriend why didnt he dump her long ago the dark suits gang how original  couldnt think of a better name i guess the drug dealers hot girlfriend gotta have a hot latina if your going to have la gangs i guess but really etc etc cant believe i watched the whole thing
