this film has recently been televised by turner classic movies it may have been considered racy in its time and may have made money but even the most diehard jane russell fan will find it hard to sit through this dreckbr br there are many movie musicals from the 1950s which can withstand the test of time even though dated by current standards but which can still be enjoyed because of good music or dancing or an amusing plot the french line however fails at all of these aspectsbr br it doesnt matter that russell was a fine singer when she is given lousy vocal material the entire cast is dragged down by a boring trite plot and dialoguebr br its not even worth recording and skipping through to only the musical numberstheyre crummy
