it was so disjointed  it seemed to jump from place to place  and the thief was obvious it was a poor mans not to mention high school less than zero i would pass on this movie as it has very little to add so many issues are left unresolved and thats okay  but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder whats exactly going on is terrible the voiceover is needed because the movie doesnt work on its own avoid this movie and watch something else about rich teen angst im sure there are plenty of others to watch dont waste your time on this
