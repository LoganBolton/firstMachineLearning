what couldve been a great film about the late poker pro prepoker craze stu the kid unger turned into a disappointmentbr br you can tell the filmmakers were working on a shortstring budget everything look filmed on the cheap timelines seemed a bit off to mebr br casting michael imperoli from the sopranos was also a bad casting choice he looked too old to play the babyfaced stu he looked way too healthy for a coke addict if you look at footage from the 1997 wsop main event the real stu was so skinny and he practically had no nose from too much cocaine so he wore those sunglasses to hide them and i kept expecting adriana to pop up and yell christuphur br br also they skipped over the fact that he had a son from angies previous relationship that committed suicide in the late 80sbr br every time i saw vincent van patten appear i kept thinking he was going to announce show tunes going off in stus head like he does on the wptbr br if youre looking for real stuey footage check espn classic because they rerun the 1997 wsop main event every so often or try youtube avoid this move like a bad beat
