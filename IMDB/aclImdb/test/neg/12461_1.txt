for the first time in reviewing films i found myself immediately uninterested in this story i dont know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters but it felt bland overused and completely unoriginal within the first thirty minutes i found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story i felt as if i had seen this structure before and tart was providing nothing new to surprise me after thinking that it may just be my mood i stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning but the same feeling persisted i just didnt care that is not a good sign the characters were bland when i say bland i literally mean that by watching them develop you will never have any flavor hit your palate the story seemed recycled nearly to the point of plagiarism now i am not saying that christina wayne stole this story but she added nothing fresh to the perspective the casting was horrid the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them nor the characters and the stories were vague and sloppy you knew nothing about anyone or anything and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters we instead found ourselves with drugs minor sex and money pushed into our faces these are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time yet somehow could not be creatively captured by waynebr br what immediately pulled me away from this story it was mainly the characters i have seen most of brad renfros work and honestly he needs to redefine himself director larry clark has defined him and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character within the first twenty minutes of renfros screen time i was bored i knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why it was spectacular nor impressive just repetitive he needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role instead of just blandly playing this random socialite without a strong character the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown renfro did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film while i am on the subject Â… nobody showcased the best of their abilities what is going on with dominique swain outside of lolita i dont believe she has really emerged as an actress and followingup with roles such as cat storm doesnt help bijou phillips was the only actress that i witnessed actually try to bring something remarkable to the screen sadly due to everyone elses horrid acting she was lost rambling here and there and honestly nearly forgotten about during the second act melanie griffith was a pointless cast and most of this films budget probably went to her two scenes that she was in maybe the rest of it went to the random guy from the kids in the hall who desperately needs to place himself far away from this projectbr br my biggest problem outside of the acting was the pacing of this film nothing and this is hard for me to say but nothing gelled together there were so many substories happening throughout the course of the film that no actual substance was formed the robberies the teenage angst and woe the wealthy socialites learning how horrible real life is the random kids in the hall guy and even the ending just felt rushed and horribly edited together with this shoddy craftsmanship the whole story never really formed any true shape family structures were never defined characters were never given any emotion and all we are left with are bits and pieces of honest leftovers wayne did not complete the task at handbr br while i hate to put the entire burden on the director with this film i am left with little choice with a horrid title that just screamed the complete opposite of what this film was about with amateurish directional ability the cast pretty much was able to give every emotion in every scenes leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments and with vague storytelling it is hard to place any good behind tart this was a film i had heard nothing about and after viewing it i can see why all wayne has done with this film is random take excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cut all together to make the film tart it is hard for me to say this but wayne ruined this film while i dont believe there was much to fully take from the story any remaining elements of excitement were drained as wayne took the helm while most of the time you can credit some of the story perhaps strong acting or even the music in tart you can credit nothing from the opening sequence until the end i felt like i was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal no consistency no strengthbr br overall this film is a waste of your time if you are searching for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some banter on our society you will not find it in this film while i know that was what wayne was attempting to show the final product seems like it was edited on an etchasketch it was an embarrassing film to sit through and encourage nobody to pick it up wayne threw to the wind all the teachings of her columbia university education and destroyed two hours of my life avoid at all costs br br grade  out
