tart is the worst movie ive seen this year and that includes both the affleckjlo bomb gigli and the rob zombie borefest house of 1000 corpses i dont know if thats a fair comparison seeing that tart was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the lowbudget 1000 corpses regardless all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings horrible script horrible acting horrible directionbr br  spoilers  although i honestly dont think theres anything to spoilbr br tart is about a group of superspoiled private school kids most of them reside in supersized apartments along new yorks hyperexpensive park avenue thanks to the finances of their neglectful parents the film showcases the aimless life of one of the students cat as she discards her only true friend as frivolous a person as she was in the pursuit of the good life with the incrowd that of course leads to sex drugs and music that is substantially worse than rock  roll everything is overly dramaticized in the way that truly bad movies usually are cats first sexual experience leads to her being branded a tramp and ostracized by her newly acquired circle of friends her first encounter with drugs leads to her nearly being dumped down a garbage chute after her cohorts believe her to be dead from an overdose no heavyhanded messages there he said sarcasticallybr br thats mainly what the seen it before 100 times plot entails other minor and even less interesting plot details include one friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from all the others a wild child who lives life on the edge and finally falls off of it one night in the east hamptons an antisemitic british chick who ends her close friendship with cat the moment she finds out cat has a jewish father and cats strained relationship with her single mother who tries unsuccessfully to get cat to appreciate the privileged life she has the thief turns out to be an irredeemable lowlife the wild child is played as a toned down version of one of the hilton sisters the british girl disappears from the film after the breakup the motherdaughter relationship is seen as totally inconsequential until the films final schmaltzy scene where she and her beleaguered mother have a reconciliation of sorts yawnbr br  end spoilers br br about the cast and crew dominique swain came on the scene strong with her role as the underaged seductress in 1997s highly watchable lolita and faceoff her performances were strong enough to land her on quite a few onestowatch lists at the time she was 17 at the time and i hope that they will not be the best roles of her career if she takes a few more roles like the one she takes in tart it very well may bebr br ive only seen bijou phillips in one other film bully and i swear her performance in that one was nearly identical to the one she gave here im not sure if shes incapable of giving varied performances or if it was just a coincidence her roles in the two were so very similar my guess is that the former is true i sense this woman possesses very little talent as far as acting is concerned here she is the actress tapped to portray the watereddown hilton sister that she gives such a weak performance is amazing considering that she grew up with and remains friends with the reallife hilton sisters shes essentially playing a version of herself in this film and doing a damn poor job of itbr br as for writerdirector christina wayne i know nothing of her other than tart was her first and only film project to date with a first effort like this it is no wonder her career in show business was shortlived
