eghads what a bad movie tart is perhaps the very worst movie ive seen all year and ive run across some doozies there is nothing redeeming about this trash from the characterization to the direction to the plot even the usually brilliant dominique swain couldnt save this movie none of the characters are in the least bit sympathetic with the possible exception of eloise wonderfully portrayed by lacey chabert the only bright spot in this dismal failurebr br possible spoilersbr br the main problem with tart is that it rambles on without saying anything it staggers about drunkenly instead of leading us along the path of the story it also introduces numerous potentially tantalizing details the hypochondriac brother the mothers possessions constantly being repossessed the antisemitic classmate the other classmates murderous father without successfully exploring a single one of them and just when i finally thought that there might be some sort of resolution for the characters the movie crashes to an unexpectedly violent endbr br i left the movie feeling that it was trying to tell me something but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated this is an obvious first film from a writerdirector who really needs to spend much more time working under more established film makers before foisting any more of her work on an unsuspecting publicbr br i gave this film 1 out of 10 and im usually very generous even with bad films
