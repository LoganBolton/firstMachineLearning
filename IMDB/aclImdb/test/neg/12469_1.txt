basic structure of a story beginning middle endbr br sometimes this structure is played with and we get memento or irreversible and the story plays backwards sometimes its just not linear a la pulp fiction regardless they all have a beginning middle and endbr br this is the first film i have ever seen that doesnt have an endbr br beginning girls best friend is expelledbr br middle girl needs to cope without best friendbr br end non existentbr br not that having an end wouldve saved this film but at least it would have been completebr br its an exercise in apathy we get a partymix of characters and they all turn out to be duds boring vain vapid and pallid imitations of peoplebr br and heres the action within this film nothing happens nothing at all happens mischa barton tries to talk with a plummy english accent dominique swain whines a lot and brad renfro receives a blow job from some old guy end of moviebr br by the time the credits rolled i had a horrible feeling that many prisoners must feel periods of time those precious minutes of our life have just been wastedbr br the only passable point and that is a very emphatic only is brad renfro he acts well lacey chabert i tend to like but no luck here due to good work in other films i will forgive mischa barton this travesty but i hope all cast members were slapped in the face for their involvementbr br please i implore you avoid dont fool yourself into thinking ill make up my own mind my sister told me to never see this and i ignored her wanting to make up my own mind that was a bad decisionbr br i have never hated a film there are many i dont like but i have never hated a film until i saw this
