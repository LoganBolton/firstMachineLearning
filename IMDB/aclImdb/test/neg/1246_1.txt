this is probably the worst movie ive seen in a long time independent or not solid writing is a must ditto for directing and acting i know these actors can act ive seen them in sporanos and more but this movie is very bad very bad maybe its the script maybe its the director probably a little of bothprobably a lot of both technically ok just bad bad bad i have a theory that the backers for this movie also own the poker magazines because i saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines  hey we made it so its gotta be good right not so fast bucky i know it takes a lot of hard work and money to even get a movie made much less sold and distributed and for that i commend these folks but the final product leave a bad taste in my mouthbr br ps i won a free rental and chose this movie from blockbuster tomorrow im going to get my money back
