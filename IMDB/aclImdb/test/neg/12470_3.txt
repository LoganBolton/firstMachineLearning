the beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable it was just one of those movies that i came across in my netflix instant queue and i thought it would be interesting to see brad renfro and bijou phillips team up together again since bully unfortunately interesting never happened in this movie swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants at any time phillips but swain likes one of the boys renfro from the in crowd and eventually starts hanging with them and of course like all other movies things are good or so you assume since the movie never hints on that things are good and then things become not so good by hanging with the rich kidsbr br the problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys it is just a dead lifeless movie that after youve watched it you feel you could have done anything better some scenes the ones with renfros parents dont even make sense as to being in the movie because the director and writer didnt follow up on it at allbr br all the interesting things that could have played out was just completely ignore and this is almost like watching a before they were stars episode mischa barton and rachel bison from the oc br br the only shining light in this movie and the reason it doesnt get a one rating from me is phillips they needed more scenes with her in it renfro just look like he brought over a bit of his character from bully and for petes sake the title is bs change the name
