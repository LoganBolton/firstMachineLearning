a film by almodovar sends a tingle down my spine every time the capitalized print which opens the spanish auteurs latest feature instantly induces memories of salacious nuns gentle necrophiliacs wisecracking transsexualsÂ…and i havent even got as far as the infantterribles critically reviled early work and after a beautiful opening montage with the camera roving across a windswept graveyard animated by a hoard of widows feverishly scrubbing tombstones i thought pedro had me again under his wicked spellbr br yet once my nostalgia had subsided there was very little to fill its place for a director who revels in bringing humanity to assassins and rapists he does a very poor job at finding any emotional depth or endearing quality in his women penelope cruz is raimunda a headstrong housewife whose life is complicated by her daughters accidental killing of her abusive husband thankfully she lives in almodovars spain where your friends will quite happily help to dispose of a corpse for the offer of a round of cocktails add to the meltingpot the ghost of raimundas mother and a host of other eccentrically warmhearted matriarchs volver means literally to return and pedro does appear to be recycling old material the subplot of incest feels as though it were tackedon as the obligatory taboo instead of commenting on or subverting the issue as with his treatment of paedophilia in bad education it feels forced and unconvincing amid the films chickflick sentimentality i suggest almodovar call his next film salir to move on
