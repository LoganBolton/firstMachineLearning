there are certain horror directors for whom ive built up so much respect  admiration over the years that they cant possibly disappoint me know matter what garbage to decide to put on film lucio fulci is surely one of them but damned hes trying to disappoint me with his later efforts you can easily afford yourself to skip most of the films fulci directed or produced during the late 80s and simply watch cat in the brain instead because that one title gathers and repeats the best and absolute goriest footage of no less than seven other fulciflicks including the sickest murders sequences featuring in when alice broke the mirror as a whole this movie definitely ranks among our directors weakest and most pointless achievements the script is incoherent as hell the basic premise is totally implausible and somewhat stupid and theres absolutely no suspense to enjoy i love the title but its actually quite meaningless there is a character named alice in the story but its only a supportive role and she certainly doesnt break any mirrors i suppose she could break stuff simply using her voice as shes an opera singer but she doesnt the plot revolves on a middleaged and gamblingaddicted playboy who spends his days seducing wealthy widows and killing them for their money lester parson butchers the ladies as well as unwelcome witnesses in gruesome ways makes steaks out of their juiciest body parts and feeds the remainders to his cat theres also a silly psychological sub plot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him the difference between when alice broke the mirror and some of fulcis greatest horror films the beyond city of the living dead Â… lies in the fact that he totally doesnt bother to create a horrific atmosphere the characters lester included are colorless and boring and the murders are ordinarily depicted like its the most common thing in the world to put a womans head in a microwave or repeatedly run back and forth over a human body with a car the lighting is poor the cinematography superugly the editing clumsy and amateurish and the acting performances are downright miserable if i didnt know any better i would think lucio deliberately made a lousy film in order to protest against all the harsh critics that dislike his repertoire no matter how much spirit and effort he put into it the obvious element to enjoy here is simply the outrageous gore  bloodshed because even the attempt to blend in black comedy doesnt work properly as long as lester swings around his chainsaw and cuts off womens feet when alice broke the mirror is an undemanding piece of horror entertainment but other than that theres isnt a whole lot to recommend
