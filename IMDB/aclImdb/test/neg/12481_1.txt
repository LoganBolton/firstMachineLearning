this latterday fulci schlocker is a totally abysmal concoction dealing with an incurable gambler brett halsey who decides bluebeardstyle to pay off his everrising debts by seducing some of the ugliest bitches you will ever lay your eyes on and who just happen to be wealthy widows the fulcipenned script also contrives to incorporate a few blackly comedic elements  which only result in some unfunny business involving a corpse which wont stay put an opera singer victim who wont stop singing etc  not to mention a doppelganger theme straight out of the student of prague  although in this case the two personas communicate via prerecorded radio messages in the end i cant say im surprised that this film shows no sign of the sophistication of mario bavas hatchet for the honeymoon 1970 which it resembles in several ways and that it is content to merely pile up the disgustingly gory but nonetooconvincing effects of dismembered limbs and squashed or melting faces with which alas fulci had by then become completely associated
