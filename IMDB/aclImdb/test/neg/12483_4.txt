hailing from 1988 touch of death is probably the most frustrating fulci film ive seen to date prompting me to join the chorus of horror fans who generalise that his films get worse as you get later into his career considering the plot synopsis i was expecting some bloody badnatured fun with this one but for all its bizarre flourishes it feels tedious even at a running time of just 80 minutes and suffers from nauseatingly shabby production values and filmmaking craft or lack thereofbr br el story a gambling addict widower wines and dines rich and strange women he finds via lonely hearts columns before offing them in gruesome fashion  sometimes eating them or feeding them to animals  and stealing their money to keep his debtors at bay sure its unlikely that just one man would be the host for so much screwedup pathology all at once addict psychosociopath cannibal but this is fulcibr br touch is actually the cheapest and sparsest looking fulci film ive seen theres almost nobody in it even in the background of shots out on the street for instance a newsreader who keeps appearing on the films televisions to warn the nonexistent cast about the maniacs latest doings operates out of the most pathetic tv studio on the planet he never even gets to look at the camera because has to read all the headlines off misaligned sheets of paperbr br some scenes just go on and on with the protagonist muttering to himself about what hes done or what hes about to do but the acting is nowhere near good enough to sustain this kind of thing so the main outcome is viewer boredom the film also looks bland and ugly in general ive read that it was intended to be an italian telemovie did it ever screen in that venue with the amount of gore involved it seems unlikely and it does reek of crappy old telemovie production valuesbr br this is also fulcis first foray into outright black humour but hes just too graceless a director to make it work sometimes conspicuously cheerful or wacky music is used to play against a gruesome scene for instance while the herovillain is carving up a dead body in his basement the effect isnt really chilling or funny or ironic anything that youd like it to be  its mostly just hamfisted and crappybr br there are of course some redeeming moments of gore that youll be waiting for while trying to stay awake including the eventual murder by oven of a woman who just wont quit life even after her face has been totally bashed apart with a bloody great club and a homeless guy who gets a car run back and forth over him about five times the most outrageous element of touch however is all the physical deformation on the widows courted by the crazy guy beards hairy moles messy harelips  its not like he sought out women with these features its just the way all lonely hearts widows are apparently there are plenty of shots of mr crazy secretly grimacing while hes smooching up these women the black humour of such garish misogyny might have some staying power or resonance if the film wasnt so poorly executed in general in the end touch of death just seems like a really lazy inarticulate mess
