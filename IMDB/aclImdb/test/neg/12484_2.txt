yeah what did i expect i thought this would be a film about young adults at their turningpoint in life something like sonnenallee or american pie which i liked a lot i wanted to see a funny film perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic wuerzburg and what did i getbr br attention spoilers aheadbr br this film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow more lengthy dialogues sometimes i thought moritz bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before but as i think of bleibtreu as one of the better german actors i believe that this effect really was intended i think the author wanted to show how boring talking to close friends can be  especially when they are stoned but really i dont need cinema to be bored by stoned friends talk boring dialogues make up most of this filmbr br but okay thats one thing i can cope with that i have seen nice films with abominable dialogues just think of schwarzeneggers lifes work but the next thing is that characters are cheap and flat and that the storyline is as foreseeable as anything just one example spoiler why do you think does someone take a garden hose to his hempplants deep in the forest to water them of course not usually you dont find waterpipes deep in forests do you the only reason this waterhose is there is that a hunter who happens to come by while the two protagonists are harvesting their dope can be drugged maltreated and finally filled up with three bottles of jaegermeister i truly hated this scene because its really violent usually i dont mind violence in films  slapstickcomedies are full of it but in that sort of comedy there is a silent agreement between the film and you that people dont get hurt if they fall on their faces or get beaten with chairs or things like that but if that happens in a film which is otherwise realistic enough slapstickscenes also seem real in this particular scene in lammbock i really thought that this hunter must be badly injured if not dead  the final scene really invoked in me the impression that he is left to die there totally filled up with more booze anyone could handle and the protagonists just walk away it would have been otherwise if the author had consistently followed one style the scene could have been quite funnybr br talking about being consistently  thats what i missed most about this film the whole film seems to be a listing of small episodes that came to the authors mind things just happen without a apparent reason  yeah i know thats life but thats not cinema because cinema is meant to tell a story not to show boring episodes without any significance i found myself asking wheres the point all the time characters besides the two main ones are not elaborated you never get to know why the protagonists sister wants to sleep with his best friend kai in fact she tells you but i could not buy it not at all i think she just was there to give kai an opportunity to act this childish aidstest sketch which you sure have seen a thousand times before and mostly better the protagonists girlfriend you meet once then she leaves germany what you dont even see and the guy doesnt seem to care and finally it is mentioned in one sentence that she has met someone else in america and splits up with the protagonist it seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up a few loose ends he actually didnt you never really get to know whats so bad about studying law being daddys son daddy fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night which to my mind made him one of the nicer characters in the whole film and living in beautiful wuerzburg even the dinner with daddys layerfriend which maybe was intended to show how horrible it is to have to live up to dads expectations seemed flat just another nice dinner with the familys friends except for the trip the guy is on later but i think showing that eating dope before you dine with parents isnt healthy was not the point of this scene if there was any i have experienced far worse dinners in my life than this one and still finished my exams i couldnt understand one single character in the whole film they just seemed flat and implausiblebr br all this made it a notsogood film but not one i wouldnt watch again on television it really had a few good scenes most of them were not new though like the one with the nice and understanding policemen some were really funny some dialogues were nice and i like bleibtreus play although he repeated his wellknown stereotypes again this time not good not abominable thats what i thought after the film was half overbr br but then came this incest scene and this i really found repulsive incest simply isnt funny i dont even know if this was intended to be funny some people in the audience laughed so it could have been meant this way this scene spoiled the whole film for me i couldnt feel sympathy for the protagonist any more  i cant feel sympathy for anyone who f a helpless person to me this is rape and rape isnt funny so it might have been a hint of drama or so but the incest is never again mentioned although we thought this could have been one reason for the protagonist to leave germany in the end but as it is never mentioned again we dont know it is even totally unnecessary i almost expected the sister to become pregnant in the end which would just have added the finishing touch to this tasteless story but not even this final cliche is fulfilled just as nothing is really solved or thought through to the end in this film it isnt really funny it isnt really a drama it isnt at all a road movie a la tarantino despite desperate tries on violence it is definitely not enjoyablebr br skip this film watch final fantasy thats also bad but at least with beautiful pictures and not that tasteless
