20 people rated this a 10 that ballot box was stuffed better than a christmas turkey speaking of turkeys heres a traditional story hoping to piggyback on the current poker craze  without success told entirely in linear flashback and when i say told i mean talked to death this film never lets a picture suffice when words can be used to expositbr br stu ungers childhood fascination with cards and his associations with hoodlums might sound like interesting movie material but the director manages to suck the life out of them at no point did i feel the least bit of sympathy for unger a genius at cards who threw it all away on other forms of gambling at which he was not so proficient of course this leads as we wade through three musical montages to the inevitable downward spiral of drugs loss of family and finally his redemption sort of big yawn
