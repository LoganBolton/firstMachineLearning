yet another version of mother of all gangster flicksthe classic godfather and yet another case of overhype due to media circus sarkar the 13th hindi film of ram gopal varma as director is also the weakest in his underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellentsatya and company the charisma the magnetic persona of the two bachchans playing fatherson duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which varma should be applauded however the same equation of the duo is missing with the other characters in the film reasonthe other characters look more like cardboard caricatures esp the villains represent the typical bollywood baddies a character who attracts attention is elder son played by kaykay but again not able to hold due to halfbaked characterization  the drama and conflict is brought alive by the excessive use of closeshots which brought a claustrophobic effect rightly needed to construct an ambiance the haunting score amar mohile and the sound design kunal mehta parikshit lalwani  anup dev together with dark murky background overlapped by shinning powerful images camerawork by amit roy contributes to visuals so typical of ramus style but there is an overuse of music though fortunately no songs are there in the film but can interest of todays intelligently growing audience be sustained just on shoulders of two performers and strong visuals  i dont think so surely audience maangey more and here film fails to deliver in any adaptation in order to add a new dimension the biggest prerequisite is the screenplay which is sluggish here not being crisp at places and therefore the pace slackens quite often what finally audience is subjected to is a highly predictable very commonplace drama with very little surprise elements top stunt director allan amin ghani is also not in his best form some scenes which require a different treatment includes a minister is talking foul about sarkar and the son is overhearing a very amateurish shoot out in the jail on sarkar sarkar jr escapes from the clutches of his enemies a son easily motivated to kill his own father a son is secretly entering his fathers room to kill him a police commissioner slapping sarkar jrall this requires a more realistic hardhitting approach which is the backbone to create the required conflict the dialogues are weak for eg look at an amateurish line where a cm says to sarkar jr Â–wo jo police commissioner tha na usay maine hata diya the women folk take on sarkars working is completely ignored the uninterrupted negotiations about criminal activities while sarkar is with his family also look slightly out of place in fact the film follows a graph quite similar to ramus own productionab tak chhappan in depicting the battle between good and evil the other side of lifethe law police administration politics is completely ignored certainly more is expected in content here the film definitely falls short and could not rise above an average fare dear ramu agreed that now you are laughing your way to the bank you definitely need to take some drastic overhauling measures in your film production factory before it is too late
