cybertracker is set in los angeles sometime in the near future where bodyguard eric phillips coproducer don the dragon wilson saves senator robert dilly john aprea from an assassination attempt by a group known as the uhr the union of human rights who are angry at dilly for spearheading the computerised judicial system in which robots called cybertrackers are sent out to determine  dispense justice on the guilty anyway eric saves dilly who is very impressed  decides to see if he can trust eric in his shady activities like the cold blooded murder of a traitor being the fine upstanding guy that he is eric isnt impressed when dilly kills a woman  he is asked to keep it quiet eric escapes  sets out to bring dilly down however dilly has lots of powerful friends  he uses his influence to frame eric  have his cybertrackers sent out in pursuit of himbr br coproduced  directed by richard pepin i think films like cybertracker give films a bad name i didnt like it that much at all the script by jacobsen hart is pretty predictable it doesnt excite it steals most of its ideas  theme from other better scifi films  the heady mix of martial arts action  scifi dont gel that well there a few fights some car chases  a couple of shoot outs but its all rather bland  forgettable the film lacks imagination considering the film is set in the future  it deals with robots technology  the way society is run  its judicial system in particular speaking of which the fantastic robocop 1987 mixed its violent action  clever social commentary brilliantly but cybertracker doesnt even try to make any relevant social statement or try to portray any meaningful moral message about law enforcement the script basically uses the concept to have robots  shoot outs which robocop did as well but also managed to include a good story there is very little in cybertracker that i can say was entertaining  thats what films are about rightbr br director pepin does ok but nothing stands out its all rather forgettable  its not particularly exciting the scifi elements are nothing more than the robot side of things  as a whole the film doesnt look that futuristic the action scenes are alright theres some exploding cars  some shoot outs but nothing spectacularbr br technically cybertracker is average for a film supposedly set in the future it already looks dated  the special effects are poor the acting was bad i wonder if don the dragon wilson signs cheques with that namebr br cybertracker was a waste of my time there is nothing here original or exciting  the action is instantly forgettable poor  thats all that needs to be said not recommended
