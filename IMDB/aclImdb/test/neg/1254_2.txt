having just finished reading the book one of a kind a week ago i was thinking this would make a great movie especially now when people know a little about poker and poker players i was totally shocked to find it while browsing at the video store last night i had no idea someone had actually turned this into a film i grabbed it immediately and watched with much anticipation what a major letdownbr br all of the intriguing things about stu ungar were skimmed over quickly and instead i was left with a biopic that could have been about anybody ungar may have been a burntout jerk but he was also a brilliant thinker that could read people instinctively that is what made him so fascinating why not focus on thatbr br and talk about watering down the real truth this guy was excessive about absolutely everything drugs women gambling starvation sleepdeprivation he gambled on sporting events from dusk to dawn he would go missing for days while hanging out in crack dens his body was perpetually emaciated and yet if he ever needed money he could always beat just about anyone at will playing cards now thats a storybr br too much time spent on his childhood and personal relationships although his ties with vincent and his daughter were hardly touched on and hardly anything about his drugs use which was exorbitant his insane gambling and his incredible cardplaying abilitiesbr br probably too late now but i hope someone remakes this film properly i had no problem with imperioli he is excellent the script just left him with nothing interesting to say
