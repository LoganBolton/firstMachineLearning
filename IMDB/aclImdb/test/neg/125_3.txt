its a totally average film with a few semialright action sequences that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films parts of the plot dont make sense and seem to be added in to use up time the end plot is that of a very basic type that doesnt leave the viewer guessing and any twists are obvious from the beginning the end scene with the flask backs dont make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van dams character not really worth watching again bit disappointed in the end production even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the film are of poor directed quality
