this was more of a love story than one about an angel who comes down here to earth although both angles of that story are given a good share of the moviebr br if i took this movie to heart as someone who knows and believes the bible i would have canned it pretty quick but i dont think the general atmosphere was either meanspirited or blasphemous it was just ludicrous or just plain stupidbr br i mean john travolta as a grubby angel smoking scratching his groin quoting the beatles a warring angel who knows nothing about heaven an angel who flirts with all the women yes its all absurd and certainly biblically incorrect br br i could tolerate all that but i dont know how many people whatever beliefs they hold who could stand a boring film which this turned out to be during the second half of it it begins to drag when the romance begins between william hurt and andie macdowell some of the dialog during that romance is so stupid its insulting to any discriminating viewerbr br this is another nora ephrondirected film man i cant believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has either written or directed at least shes consistent
