i wanted to like this movie but there is very little to like about it it starts out with jean stapleton and a randy newman song in iowa northwest iowa i guess reminiscent of norman lears cold turkey which was one of the best movies ever made according to people on imdb so far so good and the idea of the archangel michael living at pansy milbanks motel on earth well give it a chance its supposed to be a comedy okay so far so good but michael does things that an angel not fallen would never do and that completely blows any credibility the movie might have had the other characters in the movie dont have much appeal either michael brings a dog back to life and were supposed to be in awe of that the people make up corny country songs in the end stapleton dances with travolta big deal if she was smart she wouldnt even be in this movie when it was over i thought gee what a stupid tasteless boring corny sacrilegious movie its not fit to be seen by children or anyone else
