i was excited at the concept of my favorite comic book hero being on television and sorely disappointed at the end resultbr br the only amazing thing was the wall crawling despite the visibility of the cable i didnt think nick hammond was peter parker and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit you could tell they were two different actorsbr br granted i can also spot in the modern spiderman movies when i am looking at tobey macguire and when i am looking at cgi but that is from a trained eye and experience working with cgi still the 70s version could have been better despite lack of special fxbr br the webs were hokey and looked like ropes that seemed to wrap around things rather than stick to them and what was up with giving him a spider mobile to ride around in hello hes the web slinger peoplebr br sorry didnt mean to get so worked up but our beloved wall crawler deserved better
