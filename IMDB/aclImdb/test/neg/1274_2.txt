i will give it this it tried it did try to make it good and even got luke wilson involved luke wilson is good but he can only do so much he cant make up for the fact that the story was very flawed and the characters were underdevelopedbr br the running gag with the bully was asinine he was never funny and i got tired of the gag really fast and the barefooted kid bit was kind of weak too he hitchhiked to florida yeah okbr br the movie felt like an average kiddie film at times with this underlining mantra adults stupid kids smart and that bit gets tiresomebr br but the only moments that were funny was the police cart wilson drove around when he lost his squad car i loved that little cart especially when wilson turned on the sirens but other than that nothing else was worth my time d
