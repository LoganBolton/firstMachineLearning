i stopped this movie at 48 minutes and change i dont knowmaybe its because im not swedishor frenchthe cannes commenteror any of those other sleepy places from which the previous reviewers held forth born and raised in ny lived near san francisco for a quarter of a century and now holland i love a good independent film as much as the next movie enthusiast but this in a word isnt funny see now thats funnythat youre thinking that i made a mistake i said in a word but then said isnt funny nope no mistake if this is your type of humor id say you havent really had much of a life consider your appreciation of this film a symptom and please dont ever write another reviewi have a tendency to believe them when theyre unanimous even if there only were about 3 reviews before minei figured i might actually be able to save someone else the boredomthe anticipation of laughter that never materializes i did smile once or twice though when i started the movieand when i stopped it that should be 10 lines
