i love scifi and am willing to put up with a lot scifi moviestv are usually underfunded underappreciated and misunderstood i tried to like this i really did but it is to good tv scifi as babylon 5 is to star trek the original silly prosthetics cheap cardboard sets stilted dialogues cg that doesnt match the background and painfully onedimensional characters cannot be overcome with a scifi setting im sure there are those of you out there who think babylon 5 is good scifi tv its not its clich√©d and uninspiring while us viewers might like emotion and character development scifi is a genre that does not take itself seriously cf star trek it may treat important issues yet not as a serious philosophy its really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish just missing a spark of life their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable often painful to watch the makers of earth know its rubbish as they have to always say gene roddenberrys earth otherwise people would not continue watching roddenberrys ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull cheap poorly edited watching it without advert breaks really brings this home trudging trabant of a show lumbers into space spoiler so kill off a main character and then bring him back as another actor jeeez dallas all over again
