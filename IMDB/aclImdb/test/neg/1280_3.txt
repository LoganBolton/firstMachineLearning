all grown up is basically a spin off and not much else of the original nickalodeon rugrats cartoon that featured the babies tommy pickles chucky finster lil and phil deville angelica susie and later kimi chuckies sister and dill tommys brother i grew up with rugrats and thought it was a great cartoon it had excellent humor nice stories and the shows creators klasky  csupo were obviously very original and creative with the concept of the adventures of babies the new show all grown up tries to recapture the magic of the original cartoon i was disappointed when i saw it i found the allgrownup chuckie just annoying and the whole preteenactingmaturetryingtobepopular that applied to unfortunately all of the characters dull and washed out there still are some funny scenes and jokes in the new series and it was interesting how the artists would make the whole baby gang of rugrats look ten years from their age in the original show overall this show is fair and only watchable if a youre a diehard fan of the rugrats b have never seen the original show c youre a preteen that has nothing to do or d your so bored that your somehow forced to see this show this show is not that good it doesnt compare to the older rugrats episodes in quality humor and everything else
