all grown up had a lot to live up to and there was much hype when this show was anounced now its easy to explain why it didnt live up to expectations firstly this show failed to create a realistic world of preteens in the way that rugrats captured the world and the imagination of toddlers secondly the shows characters are stereotypes angelica white spoilt blond as opposed to suzie colored girl from modest family or boring tommy chuckie and annoying dil finally there is not one ounce of innovation or an original plotline to sum up all grown up is a waste of time and a bad idea for a sequel series to a show such as rugrats its boring lacks imagination and it seems that the producers dont even know how 10 to 13 year olds behave to be accurate shouldnt angelica and suzie be comparing bra sizes rather than fight over whos better at doing chores
