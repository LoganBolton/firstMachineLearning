i had to watch this movie with my 5yearold he didnt laugh once during the entire movieand he loves dogs and will laugh at nearly anything this movie was horrible from all aspects poor script even accounting for a childrens grated movie poor production the jittery camera shots made me feel nauseous for the first ten minutes poor acting perhaps they were directed to act cartoonish and even poor sound quality there are parts where the audio level seems fine then you cant hear what the next actor is saying im willing to put up with quite a lot when it comes to watching a childs movie but this was worse than having a stick in my eye i also didnt like being battered over the head with the godheavenbelief thing in all it was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my lifeand ive done some serious timewasting in my day
