what a waste of precious time my 5yearold daughter brought this home from my mothers house and we watched it as a family none of us liked it this wretched little film rife with glaring inconsistencies overt christian themes and horrible film quality is not worth watching even on a dare it felt a bit like a bad highschool drama class attempt at film making how sad to see talented actors chris atkins gary busey and company flounder their way through this trite and insipid storyline the only good thing i can say about this movie is that the dog is cute the film can should have gone straight to the pound avoid this film  your time is better spent watching paint dry
