this movie comes down like a square peg in a square hole a poorly made peg a peg so cheap it couldnt even be produced in a sweatshop assembly line in chinatown mexico in fact when you try to press the peg into the hole for which it is obviously designed it crumbles into sticky disgusting pieces that smell like rotting fruit and wont wash off quigly is such a pegbr br this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created a movie like this must have been the result of some accident of nature some freakish entity that congealed in the corner of a dank office somewhere and festered and grew until it was too big and terrifying to look at only science would be interested in such a thing anyone not bent on studying it would exhume it from this worldbr br what it comes down to is this if youre the kind to enjoy first year violin recitals racism or coke zero it might just be your birthday
