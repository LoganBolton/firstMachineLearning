i really tried to give this film a chance but when i realized that most of the film was being told by a bunch of boring officials walking around and talking on phones i knew it was over a lot of this film also looked like stock footage thats just lamebr br the camera person kept like doing these quick short zooms for no reason it bothered me so much but i was just wondering why in the heck did they think it was a good idea it doesnt add anything to a static scene of two people talking this isnt nypd blue or some cop show or somethingbr br how could they have not realized that telling this type a story from conversations of people in conference rooms and what not is boring did they not watch this mess anyway this was just a really boring movie and it does make it seem like whoever made it doesnt understand good storytelling in filmbr br darn stock footage thats just wrong
