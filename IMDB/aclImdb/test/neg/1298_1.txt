this is possibly the worst film i have ever seen i gave it one star simply because it is the lowest score possible whoever thought flood would ever be a good film the director and cast should be ashamed and then it dawned on me this could all be part of a shambolic scare tactic only propaganda could be this badbr br the redeeming feature of flood is that its ghastliness and shameless formulaic storyline make it funny if only the characters had the same depth as created by the flood itself yet they galumph from sound bite to sound bite without any emotional response whatsoeverbr br the sad thing about this film is that it could have been so much better informative imaginative and tense flood has the amateur streak to found in many recent british films where a more focused use of funds would have made for a better entertainmentbr br where was smithee
