in addition to all the negative reviews i was amazed to see that at the drop of a hat somewhere somehow a cctvcamera was summoned at a most unlikely location to show the crisisteam look maaaaaaaam what was going on notably near the thamesbarrier where the professor is hit at full windforce against the head by a heavy object and subsequently lives to tell the story otherwise i was unable to shake off the image of some actors as portrayed in other filmsprograms i said to my wife hey thats neil from the young ones nigel planer and did they summon hercule poirot for help david suchet to add to the disgrace of this film shown in two parts on itv uk recently itv showed the telephone number of the environment agency after each episode for worried viewers living in areas at risk of flooding how low can you as a broadcaster go to treat your audience like that what must the environment agency have thought oh no its mrs jones from hull again she says she was right all along she saw it on itv
