ill put it straight to you this movie is dead boring its about a flood thats it blah blah a little about family blah blah blah politics blah blah blah boring br br blame it all on the weatherman poor sod the deputy prime minister campbell is a hardass that expects everyone to be clairvoyant a most irritating character br br if you are from the united kingdom or anywhere that it may flood then you might like this film its sort of like earthquake movies are most appreciated where earthquakes happen br br this is not really an action film where the weather is the enemy and you must conquer or outrun it literally it is more like a timebomb that must be disabled br br looking at this movie it is understandable why the uk thinks the world is overpopulated it isnt but for them it is br br really the movie is about as exciting as picking scabs and i cant recommend it its over 100 minutes far far too longbr br the problems with the film i wont get into them beyond this because the film doesnt deserve such dissection hint to you londoners  buy more boats if you bring children to this movie theyll either fall asleep or become uncontrolled bored screaming demons
