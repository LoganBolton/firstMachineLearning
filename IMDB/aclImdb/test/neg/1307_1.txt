i usually like these dumbno brain activity movies but this was just too stupid there were way too many clichés and the plot didnt really make much sense there were a lot of loose ends and the ending was extremely poor and abrupt we didnt even get too see if the big master plan worked we only got too see the main character sob over his dead farther the professor that died because of stupidity see belowbr br one scene annoyed me particularly why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he went to manually override the dam and if they only had oxygen containers containing 5 minutes worth of oxygen why didnt he bring two or three of them then he would have survived that was bloody stupid the movie is pretty full of such stupid things i can not recommend it at all
