i really do not joke when i can honestly submit that this film is not suitable for sunday night viewing on itv4br br the underground scenes are just awful when london is supposedly under 30ft of water robert carlyles character is drab the police commissioners outfit reminds me of something kate moss threw up and nigel planer looks very very old in fact i am worried that he may have had suffered a stroke whilst filmingbr br the father of robert carlyle who was right all along has obviously been necking too many ketamin and whilst he has a major part in this awkward journey he deserved to be killed off way way before he was caught pretending to be kate winslett titanic whilst dangling over the thames barrierbr br im sorry film lovers but avoid at all costs
