flood is a prime example of how throwing good actors and cgi at a film will do little to compensate for a rubbish script the basic premise is fine what if a freak storm threatened to send the sea straight over the thames flood barriers and engulf london so fast that most of the inhabitants would probably never get out in time its basically the new york segment of the day after tomorrow but that shouldnt make it any less of a film however the script just isnt there its merely functional flat and lacking in depth great british talents like robert carlysle and david suchet to name but two do their level best with what theyve got but their characters are twodimensional cyphers like something out of an old marvel comic and itd be frankly easier to turn back the tide not that every actor gets let off the hook  tom courtenay seemed capable of only one emotion throughout the film but then he wasnt given much of a challengebr br i applaud any opportunity to see some nonhollywood disaster flicks for a change and i dont expect zillions of dollars spent on rendering ultra realistic graphics however theres no excuse for shonky writing  especially from a country that has produced some of the best science fiction ever made on next to no budget at all this is the kind of half hearted bgrade fluff the scifi channel produces and thats hardly a target to aim for if like me you are such a fan of disaster films youre still tempted do yourself a favour and watch it with some friends better still dont bother
