theres something intriguing about disaster movies the simple primal premise can lead to several great stories granted most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but i can usually live with thatbr br unfortunately flood probably marks the low point in the history of this subgenre robert carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie even though screen time is split between different locations and characters he gives a barely decent performance as well joanne whalley is very uneven veteran actor tom courtenay he played in doctor zhivago for heavens sake is particularly bad i mean his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor what an embarrassing performance for that man the rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad with one exception jessalyn gilsig whom i thought might be there as a plot deviceeye candy gives by far the most convincing performance doesnt mean much considering how bad everybody else is but still nice to see that she caredbr br the script is really bad confusing and clich√© some of the worse lines i have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actors one after the otheryouve seen this story a thousand times it employs every dramatic hook and tearjerkers youve seen in outbreak armageddon the poseidon movies original and remake and many othersbr br the direction is awful no sense of timing nothing inspired the shots are bland dialog and action both fail to flow editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess without a doubt this movie tried to rely way too much on rather poor cgi the human factor the drama and struggles of the characters are glossed over scenes where the characters must actually face the flood are rare and poorly done the madefortv feel gives nausea some guy is supposed to go down a rope from an helicopter no problem lets show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor cutediting job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground in the most obvious way possiblebr br the movie score is rather poor all over the place no timingbr br the ending is probably the worse i have seen in quite some time very much like they ran out of ideas scrap that you cant run out of something if you never had it in the first place must have ran out of budgetbr br this is a really amateur job i give it a 2 for using london as a location which is a nice change for gilsig being actually decent in a key support role and for the few cgi shots that were decent those of the water closing in on london and the gatesbr br do yourself a favor and check out day after tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one this includes older classics like the towering inferno
