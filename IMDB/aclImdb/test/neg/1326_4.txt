do people rate this movie highly because its a foreign war moviebr br to me its nothing more than a bad hollywood war movie in germanbr br this movie is so bad on so many levels to even mention it along with platoon or full metal jacket is absurd the battle sequences are pathetic the dialog and acting atrociousbr br this so called group of storm troopers are regulars in the wermacht not ss troops there is so much wrong with this movie its sad bad editing bad acting its got it allbr br the movie goes on and on and on as though the audience should be made to suffer as much as the soldiers didbr br i read in a review that the this film had a 20 million budgetbr br for real where was it spent in the fake train car sequences in the pathetic special effects ughbr br as a wwii history buff and wwii movie fan i found this movie to be a serious disappointmentbr br for an excellent alternative war movie check out the beast not a wwii movie but still outstandingbr br dont bother with this one
