with all of its technical flash the 1993 stalingrad movie is very disappointing before watching it i had read nonfiction accounts of the stalingrad campaign and had seen a lot of documentary footage and photographs of the actual battle and its participants i dont think that any movie can really succeed in depicting the titanic struggle and suffering that actually occurred but i still wanted to see what a relatively recent german movie production would be like while there are a few good elements of this movie overall it is a failure to me the worst aspect is that it includes substantial anachronisms and also some very contrived and clich√©d elements most glaringly in some encounters between a german officer and a soviet womanbr br also there are some ideological elements in the movie which result in very distorted perceptions including what amounts to a caricature of a german chaplain some overblown classwarfare messages and problematic depictions of good vs bad germans certainly the german armed forces of world war ii included men who were able to maintain some decency throughout the war and others who did very bad things but the attempts in the movie to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish i give stalingrad credit in the sense that it doesnt completely portray german troops in the simple demonic quality which is the stereotype that many people now have yet the movie includes stereotypes of its own such as an almost toogoodtobetrue infantryman who has attitudes more akin to the 1990s than the 1940s and two completely evil infantrymen and a rearechelon officerbr br some recent movies such as stalingrad and saving private ryan are frequently praised for their authenticity in depicting graphic scenes of combat yet these same movies are deeply flawed and distorted in their depictions of the attitudes values and behaviors of 1940s soldiers and civilians stalingrad and spr have major and minor characters who lack the unselfconscious stoicism that was common among regular people during the world war ii period certainly soldiers throughout history have been notorious for their frequent grumbling and occasional cynicism yet the selfabsorbed talky and touchyfeely characters in both of these movies are something else and are much more prevalent in our world of today than they were in the 1940s while many people these days like to denigrate war movies from the 40s and 50s which present more patriotic messages and arent as graphic about combat many of those earlier movies such as battleground are much more accurate in their depictions of typical soldiers attitudes and they are often successful in showing the horrible effects of war in more indirect waysbr br one welldone part of stalingrad is a battle between german infantry and soviet tanks which does a reasonable job of capturing some of the horror and confusion in such combatbr br stalingrad does a poor job though of showing the common look of the frontline soldier part of this might be due to the difficulty in finding thin haggardlooking extras in our pampered and wellfed america and western europe of today also too many of the german troops in the movie dont wear their uniforms and equipment properly and dont display the professional bearing that was common in the german wehrmacht even during the years of german defeat if you want to get a good idea of how the actual german troops looked i recommend the following documentaries which contain footage of the stalingrad campaign the world at war war of the century and russias war also the books operation barbarossa in photographs by paul carell stalingrad by geoffrey jukes and stalingrad by paul carell contain a great many helpful photos books written about the battle by antony beevor and william craig are recommended also and the latter one is especially good about the common soldiers and civilians on both sidesbr br relatively recent movies which in my opinion are much better than stalingrad and saving private ryan in depicting attitudes and characters of persons during world war ii and the general feel look horror and grittiness of that war are der untergang the downfall and talvisota the winter war while a bridge too far and the longest day cover events on the western front rather than in the east they are also excellent war movies and stick very close to factual accounts the latter two movies lack some of the grit that is more prevalent in more recent films but they compensate for that lack with their other strengths including truthfulness
