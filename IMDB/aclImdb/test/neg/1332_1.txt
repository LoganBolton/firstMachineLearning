woa talk about awful do not waste your time i wish i had seen the other use comments first br br i have to admit i didnt watch the whole thing it was just too horrible the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on but what really made it unwatchable was the direction the poor actors you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance br br this would not even be good as a made for tv flick br br ouch
