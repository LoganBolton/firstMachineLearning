i hired the dvd yesterday and first of all it started bad its 43 aspect ratio film and it just keeps getting worse the acting is so bad and the movie itself is way to predictable i was like watching the movie and said to myself this going to happen next and guess what happened rightbr br if you want to see a good action boxing movie dont watch this one youll end disappointed on this lowbudget movie like i did go and see ali its way better
