well i fell for it i saw the box for this at the video store and mistook it for girlfight which id heard was great in my own defense the titles are similar and they redid the cover art for the box so it looked almost identical anyway to sum it up they obviously redid the whole cover packagingpromo to capitalize on the buzzsuccess of girlfight i popped it in and got a bad feeling when they started showing trailers for low budget straighttovideo flicks and even worse when a music video of the main song for the movie which sounded like elevator music and featured corny slomo clips from the movie preceded the main feature when i saw the first few minutes and maria conchita alonso showed up i knew id fallen for it dont get me wrong shes a talented actress but i knew she wasnt in girlfight the movie id been under the false impression i was rentingbr br so apart from me feeling sort of cheated and mad at myself for not looking closer the movie was ok the plot involves belle a young latino woman who is the daughter of an exchampion boxer one of her close friends is a female boxer whoand i could see all this coming sooo far ahead of time it was really a draggets seriously injured during a match with a mean champ named the terminator who resembles a female version of a bigger more pumped up ike turner of course belle decides that the only thing to do is to become a boxer herself and avenge her friend she lives with her caring supportive yet protective dad her mother died of cancer when she was younger who just happens to be a cop her love interest also caring and supportive yet protective is also a cop who works with her dad hmmm they both have jobs that put their lives in danger in the line of dutywonder whats gonna happen she starts training and meets a sleazy manager who of course pretends to care about her but just wants to exploit her the actor they hired looks like a very lowrent cary eweles and is so young he barely manages to have a mustache his acting was also really really bad im not even going to go into the plot any further because anyone who has seen rocky or almost anyone knows exactly where this movie is going and how it will endbr br this was not a completely terrible movie most of the acting was ok and the lead actress was very good there were good strong female latino role models the final fight scene did get me sort of interested even though i knew everything that was going to happen long before it did the actress that played the terminator did a great job of being unlikeable enough that i really did want belle to kick her a and rooted for belleagain although there were absolutely no surprises my favorite moment maybe the only moment where i wasnt mad at myself for renting the movie by mistake was when belle slaps her sleazy manager after hes shown his true colors yells at him and then turns away only to suddenly fake a punch and watch him cringe back in fear showing that she is really the one in chargebr br the dialogue was really really bad my main complaint one of their attempts to be witty was someone discussing boxing saying size doesnt matter and the female replying wryly now where have i heard that before other lines that are supposed to have dramatic impact are the doctors told me i may never walk again come on you know you can trust me and your mother would have been so proud of you i could go on and on nothing you havent heard a million times before in bad soap operas or moviesoftheweek br br maybe im being too meanthe filmmakers did make an effort and i did sit through the whole thing voluntarilybut only because there was nothing else to watch while i worked out you could do worse especially if you are looking for a movie with strong female characters but you could also do much much better
