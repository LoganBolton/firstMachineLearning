saw this movie last night i dont usually comment good or bad as i think movies are like books in that there is something for everyone and everyone is different tastes vary yadda yadda this movie was bad by the end i thought oh my this is testing my patience how many women really look and live like this when they hit rock bottom and if i could just borrow some cash from mum and carry out to live my fashion designing dreams  gosh life would be great i was out for a nice chickdate flick with my girl my darling hubby likes watching movies together and i knew this wouldnt be his thing something light and easy on the senses but this was one bad movie we are intelligent and interesting movie watchers and this movie wasnt that annette benning is a great actress she held her own bad bad
