this movie is not a comedy it is not even funny in the this movie is so bad its funny department rather it is just plain bad other reviewers mention the bad lighting but beyond that is the abundance of bad plastic surgerybr br meanwhile a lot of great acting talent was wasted on a poor screenplay and uninspired direction the main characters are onedimensional and boring it is hard to feel sympathy for any of them it is also hard to see the four characters as close friends it seems like just a bunch of women thrown together pretending to be closebr br i wont list all of the problems with this movie as it doesnt merit that much of anyones attention nor is it worth the time it takes to watch it
