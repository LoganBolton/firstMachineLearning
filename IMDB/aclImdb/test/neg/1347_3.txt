this film could have been a decent remake and gosh knows it tried or ms english tried assembling talented actors together with a successful  experienced writerdirector should be a formula for a decent film but ms englishs experience  according to her imdb bio  is exclusively limited to television work and it is glaringly obvious throughout this filmbr br i am surprised that none of the reviews i have read mention what i found most unlikeable about this film and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential it looked and felt like it was made for television to give some credit to ms english many of the jokes that simply did not work on a movie screen would have been terrific on tv and maybe a laugh track would have helped so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on tv but looked awkward or odd on a big screen if the whole film had been chopped up into a miniseries or a sitcom i think it could have worked but this is cinema and sadly ms englishs talents didnt translate i cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors  the writers that i felt like i came out of the theater half shriveled meg ryan is her usual perky cute self except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face but where did she have a chance to use her talent she has made films where she doesnt recreate her stereotyped role and done them well but not here annette bening seemed to simply go through the motions  such a great talent and yet such a poor performance i enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance and it was sad to see what worked in this film in the 1930s doesnt translate to the 2000s and no one helped ms english get the changes  updates or subtleties right if only she as writer director and producer had reached out for some assistance i think it could have been good but it was notbr br its so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyones time  money this new yorker cartoon i saw yesterday is appropriate a few movie execs are having a meeting  the caption reads lets remake a classic with worse everything
