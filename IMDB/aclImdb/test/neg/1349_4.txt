ive never seen the original movie others have commented on so my perspective is just about this movie without comparisonbr br i found the message of the movie to be if you only worry about yourself all will be right with the world everything will fall into place your lovers will love you more your friends will respect and like you more your employers will want you more pay you more and even your own children and parents will love you morebr br i find this message to be reprehensible and totally falsebr br kudos for the very funny birthing scene at the end there isnt a mother out there who wont laugh during that scenebr br overall a very disappointing movie plot i didnt find myself rooting for anyone in this movie i thought they were all pathetic self absorbed individuals that i just didnt care what happened to them and thats not a movie people want to see
