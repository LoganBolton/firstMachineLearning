i really wish i had read everyones review before going to see the movie it was one of the most excruciating films that ive ever seen i was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes into the movie i should have followed my instinct the movie offered nothing new or clever it was boring and very cliché i was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman the characters did not represent any women that i know they were boring bitter and melodramatic the movie was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money and the actors looked tired poor makeup and hair styling it was recently compared to the sex and in the city movie it was not even half as good my suggestion do not see this movie
