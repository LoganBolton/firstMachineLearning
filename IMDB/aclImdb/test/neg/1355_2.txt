as a spanish tourist in los angeles and a fanatic movie lover i committed a terrible mistake i went to see the women the remake of one of my all time favorites ive seen the original many many times in fact i own it my rushing to see the remake was based on diane english the woman responsible for murphy brown my though was how bad can it be she must know what shes doing well i dont know what to say i dont understand what happened the botoxed women is a rather depressing affair meg ryan or whoever played mary  she looked a bit like a grotesque version of meg ryananother actress perhaps wearing a meg ryan mask  she doesnt bring to the character nothing of what norma shearer did in 1939 the new one is a tired unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce within a farce the friends annette bening debra messing jada pinket smith are as disconnected as anything ive ever seen and if this wasnt enough eva mendes as crystal the character created by joan crawford in one of her best and funniest performances eva mendess casting is really the poster sign for how wrong how ill conceived this commercial attempt turned up i didnt give it a 1 out respect for candice bergen and cloris leachman
