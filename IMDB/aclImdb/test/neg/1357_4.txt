im sorry but i cannot even partly agree with some comments on this awful piece of shbr br english is not my native language because im a german citizen so please do not blame me for inappropriate grammar structures or something gg i cannot understand why this movie got such a high rating 63 are you kidding me this movie has completely no sense not even a seem of good actingbr br when i looked at the comments on the da vinci code which has  i think  nearly the same rating i had to bang my head on the table  because i watched 00 schneider directly after sakrileg and oh my god  there are worlds between thembr br the majority of the posters in this board tears every hyped movie to pieces while rating this crime of movie making with a 63 and denominates helge as a genius of course  he knows how to make money but i think the main aspect of your opinions is the fact that german isnt your native language and you just ignore  or rather dont notice the bunch of crap which is said in the sentences ok  i must confess that some scenes are funny but all in all  a 63 is just too much for my compatriot
