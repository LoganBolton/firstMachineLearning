every once in a while an indie comes along that has an awesome cast and a story that sounds really interesting and cantmiss but the movie sucks some recent films belonging to this unfortunate category are levity and the safety of objects and now heres the united states of lelandbr br said awesome cast includes ryan gosling kevin spacey don cheadle jena malone lena olin michelle williams chris klein and kerry washington gosling plays leland p fitzgerald the teenage son of a famous author spacey who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime murdering a retarded child but doesnt remember it and doesnt seem to have any sort of motive br br don cheadle plays a teacher in juvenile hall who is trying to understand leland and also exploit him by writing a book about him and jena malone is his exgirlfriend we see their deteriorating relationship due to her heroin addiction in flashback sounds like an awesome little drama huh i thought so too br br the fact is that this movie is just badly badly written the dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and laden with irritating platitudes about life the characters are all twodimensional indie cliches and while it does manage to make leland sympathetic in some ways it glosses over his crime br br for the most part theres no problem with the acting gosling who was oscarworthy in the believer is a tremendously talented young actor but the way theyre written none of these characters least of all leland even feel like real people so theres not much he can do but mumble his ridiculous lines and look sad br br jena malone is the most memorable she has one of the most expressive faces ive ever seen even playing an underwritten character in a bad movie like this she can break your heart with one look when shes got good material to work with as in donnie darko or the dangerous lives of altar boys shes really amazing br br but this is not good material maybe after a massive rewrite it could have been something worthwhile but as it is the united states of leland is ponderous inert and for a movie that seems in love with how deep it is its really shallow
