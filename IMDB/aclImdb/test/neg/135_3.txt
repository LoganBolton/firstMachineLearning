the first 13 of this movie i loved and thought it was going to be one of truffauts best films i loved the plot where a pen pal marries a man from half way around the worldsight unseen especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the real pen pal so she could take her place she then cleaned out the husbands huge bank account and disappeared i was really hooked and wanted to see morebr br and then the movie fell apart and became just plain dumb despite her coming from new caladonia an island in the pacific and he from reunion an island in the indian ocean when he goes on a trip to the south of france he stumbles upon her almost immediately hmmodds are 187000000 to 1 but he finds her then instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police he forgives hereven when she acknowledges what she has done okaythis is tough to believe but okaybut then he helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him no one is that stupid yes the character catherine deneuve plays is quite beautiful but come on folksthis is just silly plus if he only wanted her as a sex object then why would he do this for a woman who is often frigid and completely selfish and evilbr br this movie due to its very ridiculous plot does not deserve such high ratings unless you are a diehard truffaut fan try another filmeven one of truffautsjust not this one
