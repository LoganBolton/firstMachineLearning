i have to admit im not a big fan of satanic horror movies and in fact i seem to like them less and less every time i see a new one and that isnt really surprising when i end up watching films like brotherhood of satan despite its low rating on imdb i was surprised to hear some good things about this film and my expectations went up this turned out to be a big mistake as this is exactly the film that its rating suggests it is namely a very bad one the plot is your basic bunch of satanists causing trouble and we focus on a small town where people have been murdered and kidnapped and its not really clear why naturally satanists are behind it and this is bad news for a mother father and daughter on a road trip who become trapped in the mysterious town i had a feeling that this film might be along the same lines as the crappy satanist flick the devils rain and while its not quite as silly as robert fuests later film its not much better either the plot seems to be fairly down to earth but its also rather boring and i cant say that i enjoyed myself at all during this movie brotherhood of satan obviously has its fans but im not one of them this is a film that i see no reason to recommend
