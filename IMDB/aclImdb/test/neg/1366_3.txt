this is one of those religious horror films which never explain why the forces of evil are 10000 times stronger than those of good weve got here a satanic cult which can 1 beam away people like in star trek 2 kill through little childrens dolls 3 transfer a soul from one body into another 4 hypnotize telepathically from a bigger distance and 5 cause drastic carcrashes in which selected persons turn into spaghetti while others kids in this case survive unscathedbr br on the other hand the forces of good can 1 sit around helplessly 2 stand around cluelessly 3 panic 4 laugh hysterically 5 waste time by doing nothing 6 read comics while people get slaughtered by the dozens and 7 arrive too late to satanic ritualsbr br in every religious horror movie i have to assume that that movies world is inhabited by god and by satan i also have to assume that satan cant be 1000000 times more powerful unless the movie has a world order resembling that of hell in other words where were the priests in this film who knew something the best that this movies priest could do is guess that there are some witches about  nothing else  from reading all those books in his study at the first sight of violence this priest becomes catatonic then laughs hysterically only to finish in a major panic attack so this is supposed to be gods contribution to fighting satan ridiculous every good religious horror film has the powers of good equipped with some form of moreorless supernatural power or at least some concrete knowledge of how to fight evil in that sense this movie is quite idiotic as is the casting of the droll martin to play the high priest of the cult there is very little menace or awe in watching the quirky martin lead a satanic ritual i mean it didnt have to be christopher lee or langhella but couldnt they have found someone less funnylooking also why does the couple go back to the town after their car is put out of the running after their friendly encounter with the towns folk no sane person would have gone back they shouldve just walked on the mans explanation to his girlfriend and the viewer is that who knows whats in that direction
