i saw this movie when it was first released in pittsburgh pa i had traveled from youngstown ohio a distance of approx 85 miles i knew nothing of the plot nor the players i had read no reviews nor had i talked to anyone who had seen it believe me i will never make that mistake again it was being touted i believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3d process that was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round tripbr br there was a waiting line two abreast that stretched i kid you not 2 or 2½ blocks long and moving very slowly i could hardy wait to be seated if i had only known at that moment what i soon would know i could have been ¾ of the way back to youngstown by the time the feature startedbr br by the time the first 3d scene was shown i was already nodding off the novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agonybr br without going into excruciating detail i can only offer the following advice if you have ever seen the famous film plan nine from outer space supposedly the worst movie ever filmed it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbagebr br i dont know if this has ever been shown on tv if it has i dont know why if you ever get a chance to see it do something else take a walk cut the grass wash the dog have someone flog you with a rubber hose anything your time will have been better spentbr br this has been my first movie review it might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and i wouldnt make book that will happenbr br billbr br
