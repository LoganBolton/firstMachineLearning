i was a teenager when this first appeared in theaters and i saw it in japan the films plot wasnt my cup of tea as a high school sophomore but i went to see it for the 3d process it had been ballyhooed in the press so that even service personnel overseas had heard of it though it never screened at the post theaterbr br the film started the trend of throwing objects at the audience which was taken to absurd levels with later 3d filmsbr br i dont know whether this qualifies as a spoiler but youve been warned if it is in many films of the time actors would often work in front of a rear projection screen where backgrounds could be projected to make it appear that they were in a different environment such as a jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage this works well on regular films but when seen in 3d they look like a flat scene behind the actors there were several scenes in the film where rear projection was used and it didnt work well in the theaters if seen in 3d it will constitute another disappointmentbr br the films only importance is historical since it was the first of its kind
