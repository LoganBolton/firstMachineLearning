this show reminds me of an episode of the simpsons where smithers had just been fired by mr burns and was forced to live a miserable life being unemployed all he did to while the way the hours was to drink and watch comedy central the implication was that comedy central was a pathetic tv channel for miserable people with nothing else to occupy their time mind of mencia is slightly better than most of comedy centrals programming but it still serves as an example of why this channel is lowquality filler for people with absolutely no lives br br truth be told mencia is a fairly competent comedian who throws out trite softball ethnic jokes and cashes in on bland stereotypes of people based on their race gender or economic status or a combination of two out of three of these characteristics if youve heard one of these jokes by one of your friends at a bar or at work believe me youve heard what passes as comedy on mind of mencia carlos also tries to make fun of current events but lacks creativity or originality this is not to say that carlos is a washout all the time i found some of his skits amusing such as his rap video portrayal as an oil sheik if you find bland runofthemill comedy up your alley youll probably enjoy mind of mencia for those people who are tired of repetitive pedestrian comedians trotting out the same old timeworn jokes stay away
