ive only seen most of the series since i leave the tv on as background noise in my dormbr br ive been a fan of mencia but this show really doesnt do much for me occasionally hell say or do something to pull a chuckle out but he has this aura of smugness that completely ruins itbr br ive always thought he was funny because of his raging angryman routine thats not terribly prevalent in this tv series instead hes just smug i guess that just reflects how funny his comedy is stale and uninteresting when he isnt in the proper mode of delivery ive seen him get into it sometimes on his show but for the most part he just sits there smiling and looking smug and it doesnt suit him wellbr br just my opinion though
