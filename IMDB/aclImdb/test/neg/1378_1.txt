occasionally i accidentally leave the television on after south park and i end up catching some of the train wreck of middle school humor that is mind of mencia its the only time i wish my room was cleaner because id be able to find the remote that much faster the truth is comedy central was in need of a replacement chappelles show and what they got was a show that appeals to idiots that either miss dave so much theyll cling to any minority variety show or are satisfied with the plain mexicans love tacos jokes that carlos mencia shovels in every week i am to understand though that there are some people out there that actually find mencia shudder funny i firmly stand by my words when i say i believe these people to exist only in myth however if you are indeed out there i ask only that you never enter into my housing district and read these major differences between carlos and chappelles show br br 1 dave was funny you may want to highlight this one br br 2 chappelles show was five times as edgy as mencia could ever hope to be yet every time a promo for his little show airs its all about him tooting his own horn about how hes nothing weve ever seen before youve got that right carlos and not in a good way chappelle didnt need to tell people he was edgy and funny we all just kind of stuck around to watch the show to find out for ourselvesbr br 3 chappelle actually had race jokes that dove into some depth of the different cultures things that some people didnt know about like his i know black people game segment the grand prize was some hair cream that black people use thats deeper than mencia would ever dare to dive so how dare he call himself edgy if mencia were writing that sketch the grand prize would have been fried chicken and koolaid and my accusations have some merit i saw a promo for his show which i have affectionately come to call my tv monitor taking a st for thirty minutes a few days ago and it was some stereotype olympics sketch which i admitted to myself was a pretty funny concept then i saw that the mexican that won received a green card as a grand prize thats it thats as close to the fire as you wanna get who couldnt think of that back in 7th grade for you fans of the show if youre ever watching and you miss one of his punchlines perhaps because you and your friends were discussing how duhdedurr never gets old and is in no way the part of the joke where someone funny would have something clever to say just remember that there are only five possible choices for punchlines anyway green card tacos border jumpers lawn mowers and of course duhdedur just rememberwhichever it was it was screamed enjoybr br 4 kind of relating to number two every time he says something that gets a laugh hell pause to tell people while laughing at his own joke that he thinks he went too far with that last one then dont say it for gods sake or let the people decide by themselves he and comedy central keep shoving this tripe down my throat that hes this tellitlikeitis show that is more controversial than the da vinci code youre not you never will be br br ive never been offended by the shows content i would never give it that much credit im offended that carlos mencia is given thirty minutes to scream unnecessarily yeah im literally offended by that fact
