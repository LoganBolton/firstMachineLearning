this is one of the more poorly made movies ive ever seen one has to take anything by truffaut seriously its not just some bmovie cranked out by hacksbr br evidently truffaut couldnt decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick and neither could deneuve whose dozen  character flipflops are simply unbelievable  not even badly acted just not acted at all among other things how a woman as beautiful as deneuve could be a person such as juliemarion is simply beyond anyones ability to suspend disbelief the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful belmondos acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as deneuves the clich√© ending which i wont describe is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete mistake
