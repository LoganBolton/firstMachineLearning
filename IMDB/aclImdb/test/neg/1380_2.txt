im a huge comedy show fan racial humor is always a little risky but the greats like george lopez dave chapelle lisa lampanelli etc pull it off perfectlybr br they dont go overboard make the audience uncomfortable or cough cough steal jokes but i wont harp upon thatbr br carlos makes racial humor totally unenjoyable his jokes continually scream racial humor to the point were its not funny or clever but its insulting im not one to turn cold towards racial humor but his execution of these jokes is sloppy that cause people to recoil at his comedybr br his humor is only surpassed by his stage presence in annoyance i feel as though hes screaming at me constantly and he runs around the stage like a maniac it only comes off as annoying
