the tagline for this show is hes speaking his mind were hiring extra lawyers if you look back in time any classic raunchy comedian never prided himself in being controversial richard pryors tagline wasnt im crude racist and daring thats basically how comedy central is marketing this show  in your face nonpc and honest  but how can a television show pride itself in being this way wheres the humility and humbleness and what suddenly has made carlos mencia this huge figure for comedy central lets start at the beginning  dave chappelle cancels his show which became unexpectedly popular and controversial and comedy central is looking around for someone new to push they hire this guy named ned who claims to be a mexican even though he isnt they splatter his face on a few tv ads and make it look like theyre being daring by unleashing him upon the publicbr br ive seen a lot of hateful topics on the forums for this show and i dont agree with mencias detractors this is not an awful show it had me crying in laughter a few times when its funny its very very funny yes its juvenile  but so was chappellesbr br the problem with carlos is that he uses a lot of the same material over and over and hes too obvious the overt marketing put aside carlos has now said beaner so many times i have lost count hes trying to make it the next famous line like im rick james b but its way too obviousbr br in terms of repeating himself carlos uses many of the same jokes over and over for example on one episode he said hed love it if all mexicans disappeared from america overnight hed wake up and an american guy would be saying room servuce in a southern accentbr br he used this exact same joke  verbatim  when he appeared as a guest on adam carollas talk show it was a great deal less funny the second time around because he seemed more desperatebr br is carlos funny i think so there are some outrageous moments on his show but he focuses too much on trying to be controversial rather than just going with the flow and letting his comedy naturally progress repeating silly little catchphrases over and over again coupled with goofy faces and loud vocal screams does indeed get old quite fasti just hope carlos  or his writers  can give a new edge to this show because right now its starting to dwindle in repeat hell
