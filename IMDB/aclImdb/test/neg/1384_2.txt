theres been a whole lot made about carlos mencias mr holness excuse me theft of other comics material heck even before joe rogan had a blowup with him on stage i knew that carlos mensteala was swiping material from cosby and kinison and a host of othersbr br to compound the crime of his theft he retold these comic geniuses jokes badlybr br and that is a crime he continues to perpetuate on this show im sure the series writers have to share some of the blame  its got to be hard to write jokes day in and day out but thats why people get paid so darned much to do it these series writers need to go back to their day jobs of flipping burgers or whatever it was they were doing before they decided to embark upon a career of intellectual theftbr br not to say that he steals all of his material you can tell when he has devised a joke on his own when what you are watching transcends the merely awful and goes straight into the territory of horrifyingly badbr br because he likes to call people bh on his show ten year olds call him a genius theyre gonna grow up one of these days carlos and when they do youre gonna dry up and blow away
