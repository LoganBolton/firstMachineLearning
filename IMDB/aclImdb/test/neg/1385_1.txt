thats right i cant watch comedy central anymore just because i cant bear to watch the repeated commercials for this show ill tell you the truth this is a terrible show not because im offended by it but because carlos mencia is one of the worst comedians i have ever seen i rather watch carrot top do a george bush impression than watch this noskill hack and to believe he calls himself the greatest even if he didnt steal the jokes he is still bad at telling them hes way offtiming and unoriginal i remember in one joke he said why do white people go camping to pretend there poor for a week now what is that suppose to mean that all white people are rich another one i didnt understand was when he did a skit of the price is right and he told some fat guy you should know how much a fridge cost youre fat and the fat guy had the saddest look on his face but what does that mean that fat people are always looking for refrigerators those are just the two i seen in his commercials god knows what his show is likebr br this show falls in the likes of epic movie and date movie
