if youve been laughing too much for a long time and need to take a breakbr br after reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this show i decided to turn it on and check it out for myself everything that each of those people have said about this show is absolutely true mind of mencia is like a half hour version of mad tv but with somehow worse jokesbr br one skit i had the displeasure of watching was the second annual stereotype olympics whats funny about black guy who has trouble swimming or gay guy named sparkles that wins a banana eating contest neither of these concepts is particularly novel insightful or amusing do we really need a joke about star wars every episode that movie came out like 30 years ago mencias solution to funny things up is toss in some stereotypes about hispanics and throw a few beaners in there and call it a day to go home to roll around in his pile of money pure comedic geniusbr br then he blatantly ripped off jeff foxworthy on a second show i watched with a your gay if bit you could just imagine the roaring laughter he got when he snook in a ryanseacrestisgay joke its not like either of those has already been done to deathbr br unless youre a big fan of jason friedberg and adam seltzer movies please stay away from this show especially when there are authentic comedians like dave chappelle out there who can joke about races and racism and still be insightful
