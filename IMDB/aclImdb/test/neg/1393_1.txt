i absolutely love standup comedy i love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so ing stupid that they had to share it with someone br br there used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to rodney dangerfield comes to mind or were just so damn crazy that you couldnt help but laugh with them as they laughed at others richard pryor and then there were the thoughtprovoking comics like george carlin who despite pretending to be a loon was the smartest guy in the room who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around and realize just how screwed up things were and how easily they could change thingsbr br now this might seem to not have anything to do with mind of mencia which as i agree with most commentators here is comedy centrals horrid solution to the loss of chappelles show but it does carlos mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience sometimes on popular topics most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes he tries to be all three of the above types of standups he makes a stage character an everyday mexican named carlos who despite stereotypes is just your runofthemill normal guy he then proceeds to try to laugh at others people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion and then finally he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer telling them that it will help them see his point of viewbr br carlos mencia always says hes showing a point of view that people dont see yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them aroundlaughbr br promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest yet easiest way to get laughs in standup the best comedians which i fear carlos mencia feels he is in good company with dont have to resort to them they talk universally and ask you to laugh at absurdity rather than with it like mencia encourages as he creates more skits or reallife situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it he tells us rather than asks us to laugh and actually presents these absurdities as truth rather than just extremes of it br br his show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it mencia doesnt give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want something that as much as i hate to compare the two was chappelles shows finest quality he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to itwhich according to him is to make a stupid face and say dee dee dee this show is appropriately named it is indeed a show about the mind of mencia its mencias mind through and through and as such is nothing more than dumb entertainment the show is tailormade to give life lessons to its core audience 1424 year olds about how stereotypes are bad but that racial bashing is alright to carlos mencia and therefore should be alright to you
