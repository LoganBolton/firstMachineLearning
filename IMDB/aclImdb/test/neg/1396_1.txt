i havent watched this show in months but for a while i was forced to watch it every day because i had a roommate that liked it so maybe its undergone some vast improvement in all that time although the commercials and the 42 rating on imdb arent a good signbr br it was clearly just a quick replacement for chappelles show even mencia says so and while i wasnt even that big a fan of chappelles show his jokes were at least original and clever and far edgier than mencia has ever been mencias jokes are completely unoriginal and stale if you cant see that i guess theres just no hope for you but to be fair here are some examples br br mencia blatantly rips off chapelles lil jon skit just takes itbr br south park makes an episode about scientology one week later mencia has a joke on his show about how offensive he is to scientologists bear in mind the joke isnt about scientologists but about how much hes offended them on his show when up to this point he has never made a single scientology joke everbr br after hurricane katrina two ap photos go around the internet showing a black man looting groceries and a white woman finding them weeks later after millions of people have already seen this mencia presents it on his show as if he discovered it and its being shown for the first time the daily show would have been on something like that in a day patheticbr br even more annoying than the jokestealing is the way carlos has promoted himself and his show claiming hes breaking down some sort of pc barrier whatever and that if you arent laughing you must be a weak prude who cant handle any jokes about race yes carlos its not because youre not funny its because were all too offended to laugh if that was really true then why was chappelles show so popular he constantly berates his audience for not getting it if he doesnt get enough laughs and often repeats and explains his jokes a technique most comedians stop using by age 14br br the worst part is that mencia does not seem to be very intelligent its sort of tragic that there are dozens of funnier more insightful comedians out there trying to make it while this guy is rolling in money his show is supposedly the third highest rated on comedy central which is baffling again it has a 42 rating on this site where the hell are they getting these numbers comedy central tries to bill itself as an edgy station but as long as it tries to appeal to the dumbest audience possible that will never be the case
