i thought puppets making crank phone calls was pretty low but i dont believe that carlos mencias show even qualifies as comedy his main objective is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable while using the word beaner as many times as he possible can i have never felt compelled to write a review declaring the awfulness of anything on imdb before but i really do hope this show is never renewed or rerunbr br mencia is trying to be the next dave chapelle and perhaps he was only hired by the network because they hoped he would fill those shoes it is obvious right down to the rip of chapelles intro blues guys vs mariachi band however mencia has absolutely no attitude and does not delve into popular views of the hispanic culture enough to come up with a creative poke at it each time instead he sticks to a small number of hardlyshocking nicknames for his fellow latinos and makes jokes about immigration every once in a while hell take advantage of the slight darkness of his skin to make fun of someone else like middle eastern cultures these jokes mainly consist of reiterating every joke or stereotype made against the culture and perhaps some incredibly old topics such as 911 in a watered down standup style while he laughs at himself to cover up the audiences style i think hes too afraid of really offending anyone so it just makes the viewer feel awkward he also beats jokes to death if youve ever seen why the f is this news youll know what im talking about its funny at first but he just rambles on and on and becomes captain obvious at some point br br its a trainwreck that is purely painful to watch
