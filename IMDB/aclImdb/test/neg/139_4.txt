when i was young id get up early every saturday morning not to watch cartoons but to turn on the local channel for what was called kung fu theatre it wasnt as if these films were works of art it wasnt as if these films all came from china japan korea or any country in particular if the story had to do with fighting  be it swordplay or fisticuffs  and if the fighting didnt resemble much of anything going on in any american gym class then that was good enough it wasnt as if they were really even very good they were just great action flicks with incredibly overdramatic music where the hero reaped his vengeance over a whole host of bad guys and then the credits would rollbr br sword in the moon is much like these films of my youth arguably a bit of a thematic throwback given a welcome twist by muddying the characters up enough that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the bad guys from the goodbr br yun cho jae hyun is known throughout the kingdom as the human butcher he kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the chun dynasty the chief bodyguard of an emperor who spared his life and the life of his men in exchange for his service however an equally merciless rebel and his lovely sidekick appear in the countryside and start murdering imperial ministers and yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them his task becomes one of personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are choi a friend from his past and his former love shi yeongbr br sadly sword doesnt have much to distinguish itself from other action films some stunning cinematography is nearly entirely wasted on shoddy editing with portions of the film put together so loosely its hard to believe that what inevitably made it to the film was what anyone intended while the atmosphere and story tend to gravitate toward a dark mood the tone is almost sacrificed to the neverending parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters is given a healthy story arc what shouldve been a quick and easy action film gets weighed down by far too much personal baggage and the film suffers as a resultbr br ive read that this film marks koreas first real foray into the world of arthouse action pieces along the likes of crouching tiger hidden dragon next time id strongly suggest that the producers stick with a little more martial and a little less art
