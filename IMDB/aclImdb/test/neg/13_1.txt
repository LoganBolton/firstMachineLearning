an obvious vanity press for julie in her first movie with blake lets see where do we begin she is a traitor during a world war she redeems that by falling in love her friends who are presumably patriots because they are german citizens are expendable and must die and she winds up as a heroine ok the scenes with the drunken pilot and the buffoons who work for french intelligence cant even be described and we wont even mention rocks romantic scenes with a female by the way when they visit a museum look at his gaze  i reran it on video and its priceless is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie i dont know and you wont either
