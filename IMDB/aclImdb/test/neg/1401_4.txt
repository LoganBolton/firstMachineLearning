kinda funny how comments for this film went consistently downhill now add mine i think the script could have been saved by better acting and the acting by a better script together it was difficult to watch and i dont flinch from such subject matterbr br sigourney was the best part i thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was pretty much the only new thing this film offered to its genre but even she lagged cant blame her who knows what takes were left on the cutting room floor by the director andor editor the whole movie had an okay thats good enough lets move on feel to it when i know there was more to be mined from the actors and the script which did have some good lines and some interesting themesbr br i dont think this counts as a spoiler but a perfect example is the scene where sigourney marches up to her sons supposed tormentors house and has this look on her face and i thought thats the face of someone who is overacting what its like to see someone living in a mobile home and sure enough next shot meant to shock us im sure bully lives in a trailer as opposed to a nice house like hersbr br as many other posters have pointed out there are so many better movies with similarly airy scripts about similarly messed up families that hit the notes better  celebration probably being the ultimate example that ive seen
