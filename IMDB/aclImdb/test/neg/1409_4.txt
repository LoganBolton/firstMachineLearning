i was aware of man of the years critical pans and unremarkable gross but was prepared to give the film the benefit of the doubt because i know good pictures can fall under the radar during the crowded release schedule of the fall monthsbr br what i found out was that the movie is surprisingly uninspired surprising is an understatement considering barry levinsons gift for political satire demonstrated in good morning vietnam and wag the dog and robin williams obvious comic gifts robin williams in fact is mysteriously underused on the making of featurette that comes with the dvd barry levinson talked about how sometimes he let robin williams improvise off the script like it was some naughty secret of his umÂ…are you really that much of a moron barry levinson whenever you have robin williams in your film and want to use him for his comic abilities basically every movie hes been in other than insomnia or one hour photo dont cage him within a script let him adlib whatever he wants because he is the funnier than anything anyone else can write for him and his uncontained comic rants can instantly raise the bar on any mediocre movie like rv or patch adams what i found even more baffling in his failure to make use of robin williams was that back in 1987 levinson used this exact formula to perfection in good morning vietnam injecting robin williams bursts of comic zaniness into a war picture to make a resounding political piecebr br so the film isnt as much of a laughfest as it could be and feels awkwardly lost in its tone if the film had potential to work as anything it might have made one of those thrillers from the mid90s in the style of the pelican brief the fugitive or one of those jack ryan films its plot centered around an employee at a silicon valley company uncovering a glitch in a system that reveals that the country elected the wrong president and the efforts of the ceos to eliminate her before the secret gets out so if you replaced robin williams with some harrisonfordtype actor or perhaps even harrison ford himself added a couple more explosions and maybe thats where the movie was trying to go ill never really know and its not worth it to try to find out
