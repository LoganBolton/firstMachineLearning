i found this robin williams vehicle mildly amusing at besti guess you would call it a political satire of sortsits about a political talk show hostcomedian who decides to run for president and unexpectedly winsi found most of the humour dry myselfand robin williams is much more restrained and sedate than usuali would say the movie is more of a drama than a comedywith a bit of mystery and suspensei think the dramatic parts worked better than the comedy partsand the mystery and suspense aspectthough thats a small part of the movieworked the beststilli wouldnt rate this movie very highfor meit was an ok waste of 2 hoursbut nothing specialmy best advice would be to catch it on tvcable or rent it cheap firstbefore making a decision on whether to purchasemy vote for man of the year is a 410
