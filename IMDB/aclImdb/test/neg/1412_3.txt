i went to see this movie mostly because it looked so good in the trailers robin williams and barry levinson should equal greatness instead it just continues williams bad streak of movies lately whats wrong with the movie more like whats right the ensemble crew does a pretty good job around robin and like usual christopher walken is fantastic that being said this movie just plain wasnt good i really only recommend seeing it if you want to see what it would be like if jon stewart ran for president and won saying he won isnt a spoiler since it was in the trailer the concept and idea is really amusing but thats all most of robins jokes are just recycled from old comedy bits of his and there are very few laugh out loud moments and most are just dumb like most comedies that turn out to suck all of the funny bits are put into the trailer really no surprises there but come on some of the movie reads like a tom clancy or vince flynn novel people were expecting this to be robins return to greatness instead its more a flubber
