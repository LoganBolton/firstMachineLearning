i liked the understated character that laura linney played in love actually and she is very good in man of the yearbr br but wow robin williams doesnt give that much of a performance with a couple of minor exceptions this was weak laura linney may not have been miscast but either the editing raped her character or this was just a sad performance by director barry levinsonbr br and i think it was barry levinson that got old so many weak performances such uneven results have to be the fault of managementbr br christopher walken and jeff goldblum are great in supporting roles goldblum plays a sinister side with relish and walkens combination of entertainers manager and commentator for the film is wonderfulbr br but the story is clich√© the presentation looks like it could have should have been a very good picture and too many actions are halfhearted the pacing story and direction all come up weak compared to say head office spoof of secret of my success
