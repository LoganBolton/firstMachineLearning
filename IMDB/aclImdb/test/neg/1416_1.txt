how is it possible to make such a bad movie with such actors were they forced into it the plot has nothing to do with an idea of how things would turn out if a comedian ran for president they dont even try to give an impression of that just when you thought you were watching a comment from famous liberals on dc politics the first five minutes the movie runs off the road and into bfilm drama about 1 a computer voting error 2 the regular evil corporate suits who wants to cover it up with the most unoriginal lines in history and 3 a neurotic but extremely pretty female programmer who tries to tell the coming president about this shes soon the victim of the evil xfiles masterlords of the computer company who  instead of killing her  drug her to make her seem untrustworthy but when she gets to dc she doesnt tell him in fact the movie then changes from bfilm drama to idiotic bfilmlovedrama up to now we are so far off the original starting point of the movie that most people turn it off i almost did if it just couldve been intelligent love drama but no its not its the kind of oops im so nervous im being stupid all the time so please love me for itkind of love drama all with a slow slow pace that has nothing to do with either the political plot of the movie the xfiles plot of the movie or the comedy plot of the movie all plots fail on all levels which every annoying bit of meaningless dialog reminds you of the love part has to be the result of deciding during a drinking binge hey there has to be a dynamic of love between the president candidate and the extremely pretty female programmer yeah thatll work stick it in therebr br meanwhile lewis black is castrated and put into a role where he doesnt come up with one single lewis black line the lewis black anger is replaced by a hope for it to surface sometime in the film which it never does and christopher walken is thrown into a hospital with heart trouble to duplicate the dramatic effect of the heart attack of the presidents closest aid in westwing watching christopher walken being castrated like lewis black in roles that constantly struggles uphill to sound casual and westwingish but fail like titanic every time is like watching a great blue whale dying on a beach heartbreakingbr br and then enter the low point of the whole movie it raises the mindbogglingly enormously difficult ethical question should robin williams go on to be president knowing that he got elected because of a computer glitch the american dream and all good prevails as he turns down the presidency on live tv like lassie the dog would with the usual patriotic glamor of the presidency and the weresosmartthatweremakinghistoryatmosphere that westwing cultivated in sickening abundance for the next million yearsbr br the director and screen writer barry levinson is now on my personal list of writers and directors im staying away from forever this film must be seen as a symptom of a faulty production process where people inlcuding barry levinson got to spend production money due to their personal relationships and not their skills this is a project made to satisfy poorly skilled peoples wish for career success and the formerly mentioned great actors were tricked into participating in it thats the only explanation there can be br br ps the voting error in the computers was due to the double letters in dobbs kellogs and mills of course it was what else could it be when you write a script and cant tell a computer from a dishwashing machine
