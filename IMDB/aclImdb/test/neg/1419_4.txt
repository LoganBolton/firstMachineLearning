saw this movie at a saturday matin√©e with a friend theater was about 70 fullbr br although there are quite a few funny lines it is more of a dramasuspense with humor sprinkled on top robin williams gives a decent performance as does laura linney being a daily show fan lewis black is pretty good in this christopher walken gives a good performance also br br the movie starts out slow and remains that way for about the first thirty minutes then the suspense part kicks in and starts keeping you a little on edge throughout the rest of the movie suspense in a supposed comedy movie i know that i as well as everybody else in the place was struggling a bit with this a character would crack a joke during suspense sequence and you would hear just one or two laughs in the theater br br in all fairness after the movie was over there was smattering of applause so definitely some people enjoyed this moviebr br i gave this movie a four out of ten because i believe the comedy aspect doesnt work very well in a suspensedrama movie and the actors performances while not bad were just decent br br again this movie isnt what was advertised
