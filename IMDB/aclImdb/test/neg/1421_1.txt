this has to one of the most pathetic predictable and badly acted films i have ever seen clint eastwood has never been worse never have i seen somebody less convincing on screen i was laughing at him the whole way through then theres this romance kinda thing between him and the gorgeous rene russo which was even more pathetic than the one between mrconnery and mszetajones in entrapmentbr br one imdb user posed the question whats not to like about this film im asking what is to like about it and the answer is john malkovich he is an absolute genius and probably the best movie villain ever he even saved con air you know but thats it br br this movie is called in the line of fire but bodyguard 2 the ripoff seems to be a more appropriate title watch only if you are a die hard john malkovich fan otherwise avoid at all cost 12out of five
