just seen which way to the front on tcm uk it is a truly awful film if id paid at the pictures id have walked outbr br a terrible mess of a film byers lewis and his mates prance around in cast off uniforms from an italian scifi movie of 1960s were the cndpeace symbol badges on the uniforms meant to be ironic the sets were pure 1970 im sure a hollywood tv backlot could have provided a more realistic setbr br the film is riddled with racism the film takes the mickey out of veterans br br not funny how lewis every got to make another film is beyond me
