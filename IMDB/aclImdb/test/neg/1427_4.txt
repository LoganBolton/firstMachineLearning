i had watched this as a kid but not being much of a jerry lewis fan i had completely forgotten it not that its in any way memorable the film revolves around impersonation which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star  in this case a german officer  and while not as bad as leonard maltin claims awarding it a bomb rating its not exactly classic stuff either  certainly leagues behind chaplins the great dictator 1940 even if comparably narcissistic ironically the scenes prior to the appearance of the wouldbe wacky general offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at nazi expense br br the film was really lewis last gasp during his heyday in fact this proved to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years its painfully apparent here that his particular brand of foolishness wouldnt pass muster in the age of mel brooks and woody allen
