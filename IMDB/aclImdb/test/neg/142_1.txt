this movie is over hyped i am sad to say that i manage to watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and anything beyond that i will have to force myself real hard to sit down and watch the rest of the movie its totally stupid and very fake the robot in the movie looks like a man wearing those steel suit and the acting is really bad especially the one playing the character alienhe is totally annoying dont waste your money watching this sequel to the popular genx cops id rather sleep or spend my money on some other things rather than watching this movie 1 out of 10 if possibleid give 0
