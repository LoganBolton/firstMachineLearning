what starts off fairly well and quite disturbing quickly sinks into an annoying messbr br dee snider of twisted sister infamy apparently penned the screenplay from his own idea and while the idea of a cyberstalking pierce freak has potential they really blow it here on uneven pacing bad dialogue and one of the greatest nonendings youll ever see despite some lifeless performances the director manages a genuinely creepy first reel this really looks like its going to be a good lowbudget effortbr br no such luck the plot goes all over the map and sniders character relentlessly spits out tiresome psychotic fortune cookie lines that are supposed to pass for meaningful dialogue worse the supporting cast barely registers and the only halfway believable dialogue comes from a young girl who helps a detective navigate the internetbr br what a waste of a great idea oh and there is a new twisted sister song if you care
