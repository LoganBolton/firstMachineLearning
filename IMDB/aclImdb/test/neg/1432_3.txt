i watched this movie on video the other night and found myself dozing off throughout this uninspired snoozefest first of all one of my biggest pet peeves is when movies like this are characterized as horror movies it is a thriller get it rightit has no monsters or anything supernatural it is simply a movie about a twisted serial killer actually there is a very small body count so it is more of a serial torturer movie and it did a good job of torturing me the basic premise of a man luring teenagers to his house of horrors through online chat rooms could have made for a great movie but we only see him lure one pair of teen girls through the internet at the very beginning of the film one of these girls turns out to be a local detectives daughter and he gets emotionally involved in the case the film quickly changes from a potentially intelligent sadomasochistic thriller to a boring old cat and mouse game between the incredibly dull detective and the psychopathic captain howdycarleton hendricks played adequately by writerproducertwisted sister frontman dee snider the occasional attempts at meaningful poetic oneliners about the positive effects of pain and the like from snider are laughable if he is attempting to get people to subscribe to these opinions through this film he fails miserably and unintentionally makes light of them the directing by john pieplow whose only previous directing effort was jurassic women which i will let the title speak for itself was uninspired and there was something wrong with the editing which resulted in the film being disjointed with a few scenes completely unrelated to the plot unless the screenplay is at fault which is quite possible this film a completely unsuccessful attempt at a thriller trying to pass of as a horror movie thats only achievement was making me squirm at the sight of a few graphic bodily piercings if you see it at your video store dont waste your money but if you need something to laugh at one night and strangeland is on cable you might as well watch 3 out of 10
