oh where the hell should i begin give a brief summary of the story no either youve already heard it or dont want to either way it sucks much like the movie i happen to be a semilarge horror movie aficionado and i must say this is one of the dumbest and most clumsilyexecuted movies ive ever had the displeasure of viewing br br the script is horrendously stupid the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest all of those torture scenes would have been a lot more effective if we gave even the tiniest bit of crap for the characters since the first scene in the film is when the teenage girls meet capt howdy how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them first off they seem stupid for going to a party with a guy they dont even know and second we dont even know their damn names why the hell should i care if they live or die not to mention the fact that they actually have the guts to try and make us feel sympathetic towards capt howdy after hes been reformed please i was cheering when he got his just deserts he deserved them hell he deserved worse also were forced to sit through a pointless misdirect sequence lifted directly from the silence of the lambs and here its done horribly of course hes gonna give them a false address and even if he had given them the real one dont you think hed be waiting and not piercing some guys johnson upstairs retardedbr br then theres the dialogue everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid the dead are so dreadfully dead when theyre dead what the hell kind of crap is that dee snider at one point says knowledge is power well if thats true this film has absolutely no power whatsoever br br then theres the plot holes yes i know this is a horror film well wannabe horror film but damn you could drive a semi truck into these holes first off these have got to be the dumbest cops i have ever seen ever i mean dear god these guys are morons call for backup idiots second how the hell did that humungous septum ring fall out of captain howdys nose evidentially this piercing expert guy says thats the biggest one ive ever seen but if its so damn big how the hell could it have fallen out so easily did capt howdy just leave it at the crime scene because he wanted to get caught they sure didnt make it seem like he did also they would never release capt howdy and i know that for a damn fact he would be in jail for the rest of his life and theres no getting around this much less let him return to his old house where he killedtortured everybody impossible and implausible br br and now the acting dear god did these people suck linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film shes poised and amazing too bad she hardly gets a good chance to act in this piece of crap amy smart shows up for about 10 minutes and then drops out of existence even the usually entertaining robert englund is underused and ineffective here dee snider plays the crazy guy with no talent whatsoever i never felt threatened scared or intimidated id rather have seen dee snider in alexis arquettes role in bride of chucky it would have been so much more fun to see this talentless hack get it by that lovable psycho doll br br dee snider just plain sucks he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep and hes obviously dumber than freaking jessica simpson this film is just a way for dee snider to show off all the weird crap he knows about selfmutilation and modern primitives and blahblahblah either its been done before or it just didnt need to be done i was bored throughout the whole damn thing br br the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably it doesnt manage to scare shock or disturb in any shape way or form this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid br br strangeland gets a 0 out of 10 avoid at any and all costs not enjoyable in the slightest
