i saw this movie on vhs some time ago 27 jan 2003 just because of the name of paul rudd on the cover i liked his performance in the object of my affection very much and i really expected a good work however i found this film a complete mess the story has a very confused screenplay and the characters are not well developed further the lowbudget special effects do not help much i do not know the previous generation of geny cops but this next generation is not good i do not recall exactly why i gave this grade and i do not intent to see this movie again but my vote is fourbr br title brazil  geny cops a nova geração geny cops the next generation
