i first rented this movie on the infamous day of september 11 2001 since then ive seen it a number of times my only complaint is that its too short strangeland wouldve be a complete piece of horror art at two hours as it stands the running time is only an hour and a halfbr br extwisted sister member dee snider wrote produced and stars in this 1998 shockfest set in a small colorado town he plays carleton hendricks a crazed sadist who has psychotic ideologies on human evolution and a love for neardeath experiences hendricks is no pushover hes a pumped up sixfoot modern primitive someone who has tattooed and pierced their body to the very extreme when he makes his first full appearance in the film it is a truly terrifying sightbr br hendricks main hobby in life is to share his spiritual awakenings with his kidnapped victims he visits internet chatrooms under the name capt howdy and then invites people over to his house they believe theyre going to a party instead they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering hendricks sows their eyes and mouths shut and tortures them by sticking blades and hooks in numerous parts of their body if it sounds sick its because it isbr br one of hendricks victims is genevieve the teenaged daughter of detective michael gage gage not only manages to save her but arrests hendricks as well four years later hendricks is released from a mental institution completely rehabilitated to the disapproval of the community a group of rednecks led by freddy krueger himself actor robert englund decide to kill him they fail and hendricks reverts back to his old selfbr br the rest of the film ill leave to you only to say the conclusion is satisfying and will leave you in shivers with the exception of snider the acting isnt too good but its serviceable the direction is okay too there are some humorous parts in strangeland and they are very funny i also loved the soundtrack its awesome and worth buying if you love rock overall this is a movie worth watching if you love lowbudget horror films with a sense of humor check it out youll probably like it
