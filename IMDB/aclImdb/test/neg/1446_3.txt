it seems that dee snyder ran out of ideas halfway through the script the second half of the movie is basically just a rehash of the first which makes the film very boring to sum up cops daughter is suckered into party via chatroom where she is sexually molestedtortured by psychopath played by snider cop rescues her psychopath is put in therapyjail psychopath is released four years later and the whole thing is played out again within all this are many unexplained plot elements why was captain howdy psycho in the first place whats with the onetime personality detour to biblethumper how does he kidnap all the adults and manage to sew their mouths shut without a struggle and perhaps the biggest unsolved mystery of all how does a 62 man with pink hair hide himself completely behind a 56 average build woman these are just some of the questions i had watching this filmbr br it seems that snyder was trying to make some kind of commentary on a the dangers of online chatrooms b the hypocrisy of christian sexual mores and c the effect our twisted puritanical society has on us as individuals if that is so he failed the movie is just too poorly done to entertain never mind convey social messages the torture scenes are stupid and boring bordering on silly especially when snyder goes into one of his pain and death monologues and everything else is just plain dumb the call tracing scene is really lame when are the cops gonna get caller id and 69 the young partner of the main cop character is particularly awful he shouldnt be working as an actor basically and the audio in the final showdown scene is really poor i guess they couldnt afford two boom mikesbr br the rest of the acting is not awful but its not good either the cop is pretty one note and his detached quality is not quite believable dee snyder is actually not too bad but he snarls and sneers way too much robert englund who deserves way better puts in a somewhat amusing performance of a hypocritical redneck if youre a big robert englund fan the movie is probably worth seeing just for him everyone else is forgettablebr br in conclusion weve seen all these plot elements done before and done better in films like silence of the lambs hellraiser and texas chainsaw massacre i suggest you rent one of those instead of watching this turkey 310br br
