i somehow managed to make it all the way through this movie but was dumbfounded by the complete lack of entertainment delivered my friends and i are fans of hk film but wow this movie has it all and by all i mean everything a movie shouldnt have underdeveloped and stereotyped characters way overthetop overacting cheesy special effects talking robots no less than 20 doublefoot jumpkicks impossible situations unfunny gags and jokes elementary school premise mindless killings and toolong running time for the material throw in the fact that genx cops was a decent film and this movie becomes even harder to bear quite simply if youre entertaining the idea of watching this filmdont
