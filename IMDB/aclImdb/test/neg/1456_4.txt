have you ever tried a kind of food that your friend made and then said to yourself wow that was not a good mix well that is how i felt after watching this filmbr br many viewers will be left highly uncomfortable with this weird mix of crime and very very corny comedy its almost like watching mr rogers play a ruthless gangster very weird some things just dont mix and this film clearly proves thatbr br there are some very good performances here as dean stockwell mercedes ruhle and alec baldwin are all excellent but that doesnt make up for the lack of balance and symmetry in the filmbr br jonathan demme has done some excellent work in films such as silence of the lambs and philadelphia but seems to be out of his element with this one
