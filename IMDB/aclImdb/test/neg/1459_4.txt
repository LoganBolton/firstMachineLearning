its hard to decide what to say about this one it isnt totally one hundred percent bad although the movieinamovie is unspeakably bad meant to be campy but missing by a mile im pretty sure that this is intentional however danny aiello is perfectly adequate here and more or less nails his pathetic character dyan cannon was good in a small role clotilde courau was impressive as the latest twentysomething girlfriend and linda carlson had a brave topless scene that she pulled off very wellbr br so its not totally bad but i dont believe that this one accomplishes its goals all in all its probably worth passing on
