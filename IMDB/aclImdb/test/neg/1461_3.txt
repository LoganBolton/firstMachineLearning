when i first saw race against fear dont you just love lmn movie titles i had to keep scratching my head was this meant to be serious why couldnt the main character even run like a normal person running much less like a star runner how did i know that the coach was evil only 1 minute into the film all of these questions and no answers then i just let the inane script and the awful directing just carry me awayit was easier not to resistthen the film became funnier by the minute and i now rank it among my top ten junk movies from lmn some have said here that ariana richards is really talented but that the material was flawed  i heartily disagree not only can she not convince me that shes an athlete shes walks wideeyed through the rest of the story like shes just landed on earth maybe the coach broke out of prison and finished her offat least i hope so
