this movie was shot using a digital camera and it shows there were enough annoying digital tricks used to alienate the viewer also with the help of a terrible score as if that werent enough the acting was also terrible now in hartleys movies the acting is always peculiar but here it was just bad especially by satan thomas jay ryanand harvey who thank god doesnt get to say much after all these external problems it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not that good either the jokes are predictable and unbelievably straightforward and the events just rumble on from one incident to the next the socalled book of life with armageddon inside isnt much more than an excuse to see actors struggle to say their lines all in all this movie is a waste of time and money and effort thumbs down
