hey remember when hal hartley was brilliant what a time that was id say the book of life was when things really started going downhill but i will say that at least he went uphill from this one a movie that looks like it was filmed on someones cell phone wouldnt have to be a bad thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog but alas those are missing along with hartleys spare quirky dialog in their place is tedious exposition on themes of christian end of times and a trite story of a modern jesus in a quandary packaged in a tryingtobehip modern world where everyone looks like someone out of a hal hartley movie while it picks up a little in its second half its never enjoyable or especially sensible what the hell happened to you hartley
