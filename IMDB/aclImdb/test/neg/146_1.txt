exceptionally silly actioner with braindead leads in a story which would have suited a fillin issue of spiderman the action sequences never really flow as they should leaving some cool bits orphaned in a sea of sound and fury signifying nothing i really wonder how theyll release this one in the west sam lee overacts like crazy newcomer edison chan doesnt display any acting talent yet the robot is clunky and not very impressive and the cgi effects though done by us sfxpeople are ridiculous totally destroying any remaining suspension of disbelief i am not looking forward to genz cops
