i usually enjoy underground movies and antiheroes but this is a bad joke i wonder how this can be called a movie all these people are loosers and the filmmaker doesnt succeed in making them interesting at all they are not funny not tragic just plain stupid and boringbr br may be i missed something but i wont watch it again to find out what anybody with a camcorder can do better than thatbr br i give it a 1 for the originality all the rest is crap
