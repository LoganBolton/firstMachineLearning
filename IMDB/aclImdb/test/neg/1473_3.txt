i love documentaries they are among my favorite genres of film before seeing this film i hadnt seen one that i hadnt likedbr br the premise for this film is a great one the execution is well done there were some times early on when i laughed and smiled yet as the film went on the more tedious and irritating it became this could have been something special had the subject not been such an inarticulate childish inept putz i appreciate his passion for film but quit your whining if youre short on funds maybe you shouldnt have so many kids or spend so much money on alcohol maybe you should have gone to film school or at least graduated from high school maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision br br there are so many people out there with stories that are interesting funny and poignant to see this guy chosen over any of them is nothing less than crass if you want to do a documentary on a film maker why not do one on someone from china or iran a film maker with real problems br br two final questionsbr br who takes a little kid to see apocalypse nowbr br how many times did this guy say man
