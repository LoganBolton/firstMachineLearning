 and its a not very good documentary either american movie seems to have confused some people into thinking this is a spoof documentary   mockumentary  and even some newspaper tv listings described it as such  ill not laugh out loud at that because its easy to mistake this documentary as one big wind up ala this is spinal tap br br what seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary centres around budding film maker mark borchardt who is  how can i put it  rather self deluded  yes but thats not necessarily a bad thing since if we had no dreams wed all still be living in caves and the fact that mark is obsessed with horror movies is not to be taken as a criticism since both sam raimi  yes that one  and peter jackson  yes that one  both started out doing low budget horror comedies so again its not a criticism  no its just that mark borchardt  yes that one  is a parody of american trailer trash br br remember in theres something about mary ben stiller gives a lift to a dodgy hitch hiker   come into my office because youre fin fired    well thats who mark resembles along with most of jerry springers guests so its very easy to see why some people thought this wasnt a real documentary  its also not a very good documentary since mark and co give me the creeps  did you know that someone thought mark would grow up to be a serial killer  does anyone else think theres plenty of time left for this to happen
