a trash classic basically what we have here is a story about a couple of american teenagers one male one female both beautiful people of course who seem to be psychically linked in that every time both of them fall asleep they can inhabit each others dreams and express each others innermost desires think mills  boon meets xfiles and youll be somewhere near the mark actually its more like an unhappy hybrid between one of ed woods famously bad b movies and a particularly silly episode of melrose place so tacky are the specialeffects and so amateurish is the acting the actors who inhabit i wouldnt say act in this flick say their lines like theyre reading from cue cards and pout when theyre supposed to be showing an emotion and it comes as no great shock or loss to the industry that they have since faded into obscurity the whole thing is just a laughably misguided mixture of styles that dont go together at all and the end result is a intriguing curiosity that no doubt will be lapped up by purveyors of sobadtheyregood films in years to come ill probably be the only person who ever comments on this film but if you are reading and have seen it please get back it gets kinda lonely round here
