found an old vhs version of this film in my parents house so i thought id give it a go right from the start i wasnt expecting much from this film and im glad for that because overall the film was no goodbr br the acting overall was very poor even for a nicolas cage movie one scene with a radio controller stands out as being so pitiful that i found it hilarious that this scene wasnt cut the first 30 minutes of the film had almost no developed plot and i didnt know what was going onbr br the story itself had the possibility of being decent but either the director was just bad or was trying too hard to put his own unique touch on the style of the film i managed to watch the whole thing but i wont likely ever see this film again
