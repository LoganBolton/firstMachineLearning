i was very disappointed with this series it had lots of cool graphics and thats about it the level of detail it went into was minimal and i always got the feeling the audience was being patronized  there was a lot of what seemed to me as this is extremely cool but were not going to explain it in further detail because you wont get it anyway lets just show you some pretty pictures to entertain you the host would drop interestingsounding words such as sparticles and supersymmetry without any attempt at explaining what it was we had to look it up on wikipediabr br furthermore i know quite a bit about superstrings for a layman and i found their explanations were convoluted and could have been so much better they could have chosen much better examples to explain concepts but instead the examples they used were confusing and further obscured the subjectbr br additionally i got so sick of the repetitiveness they could easily have condensed the series into one episode if they had cut out all the repetition they must have shown the clips of the quantum caf√© about 8 times the host kept saying the same things over and over and over again i cant remember how many times he said the universe is made out of tiny little vibrating strings its like they were trying to brainwash us into just accepting superstrings are the best thing since sliced breadbr br finally the show ended off with an unpleasant sense of a competition between fermilab and cern clearly biased towards fermilab this is supposed to be an educational program about quantum physics not about whether the us is better than europe or vice versa i also felt that was part of the patronizing  audiences need to see some conflict to remain interested please give me a little more credit than thatbr br overall 2 thumbs down
