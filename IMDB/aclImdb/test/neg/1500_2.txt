this one features an interesting way of handling a camerabr br espercially for a dtv movie  the version i saw was fullscreenbr br  but it falls short on the scenario department first you getbr br around 20mn of talk talk talk in a wouldbehip posttrainspotting way then its slasher city and then comesbr br the most dishonest cheat ending ive seen much worse thanbr br april fools day  where at least it made sense so all inbr br all its the old song and dance  interesting director triesbr br hard but deserves better movie funny  usually it is the actors which are in desperate need ofbr br something betterÂ… skip it anyway for your time
