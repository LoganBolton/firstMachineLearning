ok end of the story is  all the kills were a joke on the main character and no one is actually dead yes i know cry wolf did it and did it well but this isnt cry wolf its scream crap even though the characters dont apparently die we see them get stabbed to death and other ways they are killed even though these kills do not take place as anyone can see them mr director if youre gonna show people getting killed someone needs to see it if theyre off camera and the character getting faked killed is alone it doesnt work  and until the end i liked a couple of scenes but your end ruined the whole thingbr br the acting is horrid especially the kid at the beginning who really thinks he tricked his friends into believing they were playing with his dead grandmothers brains the script is lessthan half baked though if youre half baked you might like the movie the only reason i gave this movie a 3 is because a they actually made something b they got it released and c they shot on film yes you read right they wasted at least 5000 on film stock for this crap sad if theyd shot dv theyd had some cash for a better cast and another writer to go through the script and make it goodbr br i admire the fact that the director made something as most dont but hatwe the fact that he comes on imdfb talking about how original the movie isbr br avoid the movie if it means buying it to see if a friend has it it might be a funny movie to borrow
