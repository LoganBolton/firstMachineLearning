truly awful nonsensical garbage this movie does everything wrong except make the running time under an hour the gore fx defy gravity  logic there are no scares the acting is abysmal with everyone appearing to be reading their lines theres a surprise ending thats just silly where we find out that things we saw happen didnt even happen boy do i hate cop out endings they pad this thing out with long drawnout shots of people doing nothing interestinglike putting on makeup or talking for what seems like forever they have to pad out a movie thats under an hour long ridiculous the story itself is pretty freakin thin i mean its just a variation of the movie april fools day if i remember that movie correctly and that film wasnt all that great either the only good thing i can say is it seems to have been shot well too bad nothing happens thats very exciting
