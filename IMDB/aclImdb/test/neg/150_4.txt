not near as well made as the guinea pig flicks it was inspired by flowers of flesh and blood or devils experiment and not conveying any real philosophy this video feature which is barely feature length adds hardcore sex with mosaic censoring to its inspiration the special makeup effects which include stomach slitting and disembowelment are pretty good if overlit the amateur feel of the production is a distraction it all looks cheap and lazy the lighting is harsh and the sound and editing are sloppy the simple story involves a porno actress who ends up starring in a real snuff movie just when she gets tired of being abused the real abuse begins in the films hero scene an actor cuts the womans stomach open in graphic closeup stuffs his member inside it and proceeds to do his thing i didnt find psycho  the snuff reels shocking on the contrary i found it to be a desperate attempt by amateurs to oneup guinea pig and its bloody ilk interestingly this was distributed by aroma a leading fetish producer
