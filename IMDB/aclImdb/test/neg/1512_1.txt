as a christian i found this movie to be completely embarrassing the actors sucked the writing sucked the cinematography sucked and the story was so typical i couldnt say this is a great witnessing tool because id be too embarrassed to show any of my unsaved friends hollywood has much better stuff and thats because they invest the best into it christians put out shtty work and think its ok because its for the lord in the old testament people spent huge amounts of money to bring offerings to god david or saul i dont remember spent what would be equal to about 50 billion in todays money on building a temple for god but these days spending what would appear to be about 30000 tops on making a movie to witness to people with is just pathetic its the person not the product that affects someone dont waste your time trying to convert your friends with this waste of an hour and a half if you want to make a positive impact with people show them movies like the matrix american beauty braveheart etc movies that have something to say and actually get it into you
