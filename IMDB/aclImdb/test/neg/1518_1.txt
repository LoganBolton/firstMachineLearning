i have always been a fan of bottom grabbing as many videos as i could find of the series here in the states the chemistry between rik and ade is always genius and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail i thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness and was utterly disappointed by the endbr br the first 34 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed sorry ade but with some utterly brilliant moments unfortunately these laughoutloud moments make you realize how lessthanbrilliant the rest of the movie is the slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorousbr br the end of the movie the green scenes for those of you whove seen it was perhaps the worst ending ive seen in the past decade honestly it was one joke repeated about thirty times followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense which didnt bother me and wasnt funny which didbr br to sum up i was sorely disappointed by this movie i shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it to retain the fondest memories that i can but i have to warn you if youre about to overpay for your ntsc conversion tape from the local importer dont there are far better things to spend your money on
