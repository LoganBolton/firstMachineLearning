being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this filmi was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute rollercoaster ridealasbr br where to start on this messi think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funnyi was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewingmany aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cutbr br the overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the terrible guest house the 2 buffoons attempt to runbut to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been createdbr br the actingat timesis patheticfenella fielding is wasted as the loony mrs foxfur and ive seen simon pegg have much better outingsbr br id recommend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much morebut to any bottom fan who hasnt seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned
