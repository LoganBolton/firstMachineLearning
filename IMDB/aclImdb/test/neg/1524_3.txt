i loved all the other don knotts movies but i never heard much about how to frame a fig and now i know why i cant think of anyone who would find it enjoyable this movie seems to appeal to 9 or 10 year olds but even most of them would give this a thumbs down at best there are brief moments of mild amusement mostly from don knotts playing the same nervous underdog persona that made him famousbr br after the movie finally finished i was curious if my teenager could pick up on this movies fatal flaw we were in complete agreement the prentiss gates sidekick character was even dumber than the don knotts characterbr br be happy that mr limpet reluctant astronaut shakiest gun and mr chicken movies are around to enjoy
