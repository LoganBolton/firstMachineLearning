a modern scare film yep it isbr br the hippies peaceniks and environmentalists got together to deliver us a fear film i didnt recognize it when watching it only 2 years ago that it was a fear film but thats exactly what it isbr br theres no difference between this film and films the nazi made about us in ww2 and the same films we made about them this is pure propaganda and speaks only to those that believe in aliens 911 conspiracy plots faked moon landings peak oil and major environmentalism what i can say is this film does push buttons make you ask questions and ultimately just forget about it its a scare film so if your scarred get in your houses lock your doors and stock up for that nuclear winter we all know is coming when bush provokes the chinese into nuclear war
