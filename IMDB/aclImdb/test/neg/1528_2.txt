where do i begin with the killing mind before i mention the good bit this movie is about a young psychological profiling fbi woman or something that for some reason goes to work for the lapd for a wee while there are some recognisable faces like the i love you man bloke from waynes world playing a cop nice beardage too and two guys who always seem to play cops playing you guessed it cops one of them was one of the cops in gross point blank following john cusack about the place and the other is the fbi guy with specs in final destination who is also in the fugitive as another cop i know the fbi us marshalls cia etc arent cops but theyre all the same they enforce the law to a certain degree that makes them cops in my book feel free to disagree with the definition of a cop all you want theyre still seen as the ones who are trying to bring the bad guys down any i digress the woman is working alongside these cops who just seem to sit around in a library in the basement or something and for some unknown reason decides to reopen a case that hasnt been looked at for yonks she saw the dead body as a kid so naturally decided that she can reopen the case cos she was personally attached to it i also like how the person profiling other peoples psychological state witnessed a murder scene as a child surely thats the kind of thing that can screw with someones head she starts asking questions off some journalist who covered the story when it was open even though he appears to be the same age as the woman so he presumably was either writing for a newspaper when he was 10 or he wrote a few school reports on it and she decided hed be the best person to ask about itbr br we then see that as well as reopening homicide cases from 25 years earlier she tries her hand at petty theft as some really inconspicuous bloke sprints through a busy street wearing a balaclava way to blend moron anyway she and the cops shes with eating ice creams in the park give chase after him and whilst crossing a bridge with a woman and child standing on it the thief grabs the baby from the mothers arms and throws the baby in the river this if you havent already guessed is the best bit of the movie im not sadistic and dont have a hatred for babies or anything but the scene just looks so stupid i promise you will wet your pants laughing at it if you should watch this movie it gets better when the cop from final destination  the fugitive jumps in to rescue the baby then declares to his friend its a baby how did he not know that before he jumped in is beyond mebr br anyway she chases after the thief but loses him later on she remembers that a random dog didnt bark at the thief so assumed it must be his and decided to track down the thief through the dog the dog had no markings or anything on it so how she knew where to find the dog and thus find the thief is another question i wont go into it was shortly after this that i stopped watching the story was moving really slowly and after i had stopped laughing at the baby throwing bit i had kind of lost interest and missed what was being saidbr br saying that ill go ahead and assume that the killer was the journalist bloke because he seemed a bit shifty and she was spending a lot of time with him and anyone who watches columbo knows that the person outside the police force who spends most time with the investigating officer is your bad guy plus other peoples reviews say the killer was pretty obvious so im sure it was himbr br so all in all a pants film but worth watching just for that one glorious scene
