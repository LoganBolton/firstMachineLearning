not for the first time im out of kilter with the majority view oz is a dreadful pretentious voyeuristic series the makers have their cake and eat it oz em city etc are used as ultra crude signals that the apparent grittiness is complete fantasy this allows viewers the feeblest of intellectual excuses to watch soap operatic nonsense spiced with everything that is bad about human beingsbr br when you watch an episode please remember that while the foulmouthed violent absurdly convoluted unconvincing sick imaginary drama unfolds before your approving eyes several hundred infants in poorer parts of the world have died from bad food or waterbr br oz is exploitative drama at its worst it appeals to the basest instincts but pretends to be serious and meaningful it blows hot and cold and changes from fortissimo to pianissimo more often than a mahler symphonybr br dialogue is unrelentingly ugly and utilitarian the liberties taken with realities are stupid heres a nightclub owning dandy arriving at oz in his foppish finery complete with a ridiculously cloudy contact lens in one eye brandishing a stash of drugs that nobody detected heres a murderous wimp bleating about the heat death of the universe begging to be killed but of course being refused by the brute he approaches and doing a bit of improbable throat cutting himselfbr br the action races on at a pace fast enough for the voyeuristic dimwitted viewer to be thinking always about what happens next rather than the rubbish that has just been shown dont worry a betrayal a murder a sex scene will be along within a minute or two br br finally oz is obviously pretentious you dont have to feel embarrassed about being carried along by its flow you can watch it and tell yourself that the producers writers and actors are doing everything with a huge wink or same word but for a change of vowel to the audience br br yes you can be a nastyminded viewer and excuse yourself on the grounds of the cleverness postmodernistic etc skills of the oz production team they appeal to the lowest common denominator while pretending to operate on a higher planebr br truly a despicable series and every hour it shows rewarding its makers and actors and generating advertising revenue for the channels that show it to people who have nothing better to do than watch something so ugly and unnecessary another few hundred children die whose lives could have been saved by the dollars spent by this horrible successful widelypraised series
