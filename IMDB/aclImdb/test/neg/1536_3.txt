murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is madefortv but isnt considering the only actor of any note is bullock although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things it isnt a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things like remembering to lock your front door when you go out or putting clothes back on when you come out of the showerbr br bullock plays cassie mayweather a cop with personal issues dont they all together with her new partner a wetlooking ben chaplin she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think theyve planned and executed the perfect murder as the investigation continues a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood ryan goslingbr br the crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless bullock though she is very nice to look at is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield actually hed be better chaplin for his sins is a complete nonentity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood at least gosling and pitt as the conniving sneering suspects acquit themselves adequately as if dodgy leads werent bad enough a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable but illogical ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to runbr br murder by numbers has absolutely nothing going for it even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldnt redeem it well just a little but still not enough to save it forgettable predictable and redundant  this is one film that isnt going to move the cop genre forward as cassie probably says on her next case theres nothing to see here people move along keep moving
