i suppose i can see why critics give this film two out five stars it isnt fantastic but i think it is worth a look from director shawn levy cheaper by the dozen night at the museum basically 14yearold jason shepherd malcolm in the middles frankie muniz is often lying to his parents and teachers and his teacher warns him that if he doesnt do his creative writing he will fail his whole semester and have to repeat the grade during summer so he completes his work but getting a lift from hollywood producer marty wolf paul giamatti who hit him on the way to school he manages to leave his paper with the story big fat liar in the car he finds out from a movie trailer that marty stole his paper and is turning it into a major movie so he and his best friend kaylee shes the mans amanda bynes are on a mission to prove jason is for once telling the truth marty of course is too nasty and smug to give jasons father harry michael bryan french a phone call and he evens burns the big fat liar paper so now jason and kaylee are determined to make martys life as hellish as possible until he agrees to call jasons dad they put blue dye in his swimming pool and orange hair dye in his shampoo and much more naughty pranks creating chaos for martys career there is the obvious point when jason looks like he wants to give up but dont worry all characters that despise marty help out in the final operation and with jasons parents coming he wants to finally prove his truthfulness and boy does he deliver big style also starring amanda detmer as monty kirkham lee majors as vince donald adeosun faison as frank jackson sandra oh as mrs phyllis caldwell russell hornsby as marcus duncan christine tucci as carol shepherd and american pies john cho as dustin dusty wong muniz is likable byrnes proves a very surprisingly talented support and even though he is wasting his time and talent a little giamatti is great at being nasty it is a kids film so if it seems corny cheesy or predictable just keep that in mind and try to enjoy the performances and slapstick okay
