theres something frustrating about watching a movie like murder by numers because somewhere inside that hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out however by the time the credits roll theres no saving it the whole thing is pretty much blown by the cop side of the story where sandra bullock and ben chaplins homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on although bullock is strong in her role its not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing ben chaplins talents are wasted in a forgettable role he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated birthday girl as well as chris penn who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him anyway the plot really isnt even a factor in this movie at all the two teen killers played by ryan gosling and michael pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well its too bad they werent in a much better allaround film barbet schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker bottom line its worth a rent if youre a genre fan but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it except maybe on network tv with convenient commercial breaks
