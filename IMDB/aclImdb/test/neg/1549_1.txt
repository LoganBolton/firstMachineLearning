for a while it seemed like this show was on 247 then apparently there was a second season or some other kind of continuation of this horrible show about the two most vapid and conceited people who have ever been filmed all the other comments have captured the essence of these two selfish haggish airheads perfectly not much less can be said about them besides what everyone else has saidbr br i doubt these two ladies have souls and more than likely they made some kind of faustian bargain in order to get their lizardly snouts on a television series may the fates protect the human race from any more exposure to the ghastly girls
