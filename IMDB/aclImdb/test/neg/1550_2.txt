well the episode i just watched had the older gastineau girl whining about why people keep mentioning her husband mr gastineau a famous american football player apparently she seems unwilling to accept that hes the only reason she isnt flipping burgers she married someone famous and thats why she has cameras pointed at herbr br when challenged by an interviewer to explain what she actually does she gave a wonderfully circular reason for why people should pay attention to her i work really hard on my reality tv show then she said im not a celebrity im a personalitybr br im not quite sure who this series is meant to appeal to except people whove had all their intelligence removed its certainly no role model to anyone except golddiggers as the two stars do nothing but spend money and all it tells you about rich people is that they have no money problems
