i only rented this stinker because of its relatively high ratings it totally sucked i cannot imagine how anyone would think this a good movie  even an ok movie none of the characters had any redeeming qualities of any kind to varying degrees they were each selfish and meanspirited  or abused and damaged personalities who hadnt a clue about the spirit of christmas when this takes place i know canadians and like them  but i cannot think that even they would think this a good movie id rather a sharp stick in the eye than watch this offensive movie again a colossal waste of time and money do not believe the person who wrote the opinion that it was worth watching this person probably would enjoy having a dentist drill their teeth without anesthesia too dont mean to be unkind but for the life of me i cannot imagine what this person was thinking unless they had ulterior motives maybe she was the director or the producer if so id like to ask them to give me back my money if your money is important to you  save it instead of renting this piece of drek  or rent something anything else im running out of good reasons not to rent this film if i were canadian id be ashamed that its supposed to be a favorite canadian flick if so i would say that those who think so are definitely in need of great quantities of powerful drugs yeck
