first let me make it clear that im a big fan of bad scifi especially when it involves gigantic citystomping monsters but this one is so fantastically lame that i cant even like it for being bad they apparently didnt shave enough money off the budget by skimping on the props the only prop we have to indicate the size of the alien girl is an oversized novelty pencil available at spencers gifts for about fifteen bucks they also decided not to outlay for concept or plot the monster does look okay in my opinion but it doesnt have enough interaction with the backgrounds ie not enough destruction to suit most fans of the genre the general rule of giant monster movies is if you dont have a lot of fakelooking buildings to smash then youd better have another fakelooking monster to wrestle with this movie has neither i cant make my final complaint about the movie without giving away the ending but suffice to say the origin of the monster and the method found to get rid of it just dont hold water not even as well as most of these movies skip it
