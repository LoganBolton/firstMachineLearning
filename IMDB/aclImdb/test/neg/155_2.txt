i keep waiting for peter fonda to start acting for someone who comes from such a talented family its a mystery to me why peter fonda can only play peter fonda trying to play someone else and thats the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of the tempest a string of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the bards great play is what were served the setting is the civil war and prosperos here guideons evil brother looks like an 1890s melodrama villain complete with snidely whiplash moustache i kept waiting for him to go uh ha hah which would have been a high point in this dreary presentation none of the supporting cast was memoriable and peter fondas lack of expression and wooden body movements made the lackadaisical story drag on and on br br the tempest is the bards statement about the rage of mans unjust treatment of man the only believable character was the gator man the caliban counterpart the transferrence to the swamp had possibilities but the civil war setting just didnt make it all in all a very disappointing production i saw it on video and would advise if you want a willy shakespeare fix save your money on this one rent something else like branaghs much ado about nothing or kevin kline in midsummers night dream
