by strange coincidence ive started to watch this move straight after brice de nice and the good thing was that not many movies could be worst than brice de nice so i was really looking forward for something better which would make me forget this horrible flopbr br unfortunately oss117 again left me disappointed  i dont know maybe its just problem with translations but since diner de cons i havent seen any french comedy that i would call really good even when i look at the reviews on imdb only people from france are giving the oss117 high notesbr br for me this movie didnt really work  in some parts is as funny as real bond movies in others jokes were a little bit too predictable or too corny
