george and mildred is a truly unfunny film this attempt to translate the successful tv series to the big screen was a dismal failure as is so often the casebr br the wit and clever oneliners from the tv shows have gone missing the plot is a typical english farce of confused characters and mistaken identities which is neither funny enough nor weird enough to provoke many decent laughsbr br diehard george and mildred fans might want to see this final episode of the pairs output mildred died of hepatitis before the film was released but others should invest their time more wisely
