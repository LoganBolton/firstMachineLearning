such a highlyanticipated remake of a cherished musical classic and such a bitter pill it was to have to take very very hard to swallowall of it it didnt have an ounce of believability anywhere and when you dont have a rose you dont have a showbr br bette midler seemed born to play this part yet all she was able to produce was a cute funny glitzy trademark bette midlerweighed down with all the familiar midlerisms roz russell has nothing to worry about she can rest in her grave knowing she is still the definitive mama rose of film anywaybr br i thought midler was really going to put it across this timeto throw herself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all timelike she did in the rose but no she played it safe she played herself she made rose a total dinnertheatre cartoon even her songs were uninspired it was maddening to watch knowing midler has the talent to rise above her moneymaking schtick she showed promise only once in this gypsy and that was with roses turn but by then it was too little too latebr br a sincere cynthia gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when the role of gypsy outshines that of rose you know theres trouble in river citybr br a huge huge letdown
