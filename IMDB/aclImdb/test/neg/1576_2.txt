i saw this movie while surfing through infomercials and latenight 80s sitcoms on tv one night at 2 in the morning i must say i didnt expect much and i didnt get much although rose mcgowan is hot her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast was not oscarworthy to say the least this movie has its ups and downs and does have a nice couple of twists at the end but in all honesty it was awful not even a typical slasher movie no gore no sex no nudity no real violence just bad acting id give it a 3 out of 10
