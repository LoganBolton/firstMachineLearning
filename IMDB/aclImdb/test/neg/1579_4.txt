i am a big fan of the abc movies of the week genre i am only 27 meaning i wasnt even born until after the series ended but i am trying to collect as many of them on dvd as possible i have about a dozen or so i had read such wonderful things about this film both on here and elsewhere that i was really excited to see it i just received my dvd in the mail today and watched it anxiously ill admit that the first one or two phone calls did give me the creeps  that boys voice would give anyone the creeps but it began to ware off fast and the entire divorce subplot was stupid i also figured out that michael douglas was the antagonist about a half an hour before the movie ended as soon as that story was told about how elizabeth ashleys character had locked up his mother i knew something was fishy plus didnt anyone ever think to ask him why he happened to suddenly appear that night when the fire occurred in the barn ill admit that i thought he was coaching a boy at the school to make the phone calls i didnt guess the mute boy part or the prerecorded tapes did they ever say whose voice that actually was i doubt douglas could ever get his voice that highbr br i am only giving this movie a four out of ten because i actually liked most of the acting in it ashley especially is greatbr br its a shame because this movie has such a great premise but oh well thats what happens sometimes when one gets his or her hopes up for a movie too much
