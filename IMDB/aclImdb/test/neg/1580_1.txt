i watched this film awhile ago and the only thing i can remember about the film is how absolutely horribly outstandingly bad it was its definitely in my top 5 worst films i have ever seenand to think i had to persuade my mates to get this film out at the video shopmy reputation has been shot to bits because of this film will my mates ever trust me againi doubt itthey always say dont judge something by its coverthey were right when i saw the cover to skinsgang boys i thought wow this looks great as it had a load of skin heads on the front cover running riot with metal barsdont watch this filmi cant think of anything else to say the acting is bad the story is bad its just bad
