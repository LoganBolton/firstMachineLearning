wings hauser and son cole hauser team up to make a film about neonazi thugs targeting a gay man and terrorising a city wings plays the hero and his reallife son is the villain fairly lowbudget film that has not many redeeming features and for some reason no one has seen it perhaps because it is quite a laughable and ridiculous film and the studio realised this maybe wings hauser himself prevented the distribution of skins after seeing it himself maybe people just didnt want to comment on such a bad film oh well i generally like wings and cole as actors but this was a film that they both should have skipped wings directed wrote and was the lead actor in skins an extremely bad and stupid film 12 out of
