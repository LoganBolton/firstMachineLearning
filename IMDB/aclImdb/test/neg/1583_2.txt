ok what was this story about again i am afraid that i never read the book and frankly this was one of the most confusing movies that i have ever tried to watch in a long time i get a bit confused on the number of flashbacks between the nurse the patient and the man with no thumbs the film didnt even really explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it or even how in the world they all knew each other to come togetherbr br after recently seeing the pride and prejudice movie with colin firth i have been trying to do a study on his film career by watching other movies of his and bluntly other than what a girl wants i am not finding much where he played in that was any good i am definitely not saying that he wasnt good he is really one of the best actors i have seen in the modern day film but the content and quality of the films he plays in have a lot to be desiredbr br the english patient is another perfect example of where the director writer and crew are just too close to their subject matter to see that the viewer is not getting the picture  literally the entire movie seemed to be to showcase ralph fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emoting that was a bore nothing is really explained and every one of the subjects from the beginning seems to need a psychoanalyst evaluation br br kristin scott thomas character seems to enjoy describing erotic stories standing in front of a totally male audience and titillating other men other than her husband colin firth who plays her husband does not necessarily have all his marbles in place and is supposed to be a secret agent  i guess and ralph fiennes walks around like a roman mr darcy sorry colin who thinks he knows it all the rest of the cast is cast pun intended to the four winds as the plot wanders onbr br the subplot of the mental stability of the nurse juliette binoche and her motives and involvement with naveen andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with an unsavory taste but of course the viewer is still reeling how in the world the first two characters thomas and fiennes ended up having sex the first time anyway what was the attraction there was no chemistry and no buildup just a slap bam thank you br br and isnt it romantic that fiennes ended up a traitor helping the germans by giving them maps to the desert sarcasm br br to describe this movie i would have to simply say how to impress your gynecologist with your mammograms and cheat on your sweet adorable husband who loves you br br the final unbelievable section of this plot is to fathom how anyone would choose ralph fiennes over colin firth firth had very little opportunity to demonstrate any of his acting talents  in fact when watching the movie i thought it must have been one of his first the scene where he had been waiting for his wife all night was perhaps the only two second clip that is worth seeing in the movie at that i have no interest in watching it againbr br the best scene i liked was the plane crash where firth is trying to take them all out too bad he missed it would have saved an extra twenty minutes of even more fruitless film aerial desert scenes were pretty neat though
