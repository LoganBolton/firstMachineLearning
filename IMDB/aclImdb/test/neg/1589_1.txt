thomas vinterbergs de st√∏rste helte is yet another road movie without the most important element of a film a good story the characters are not very original and not particularly interesting especially thomas bo larsen is a pain in the neck playing the same role he has played in the past few years and which he repeated in festen  it seems as if he thinks acting  being angry and screaming at other people the film doesnt make much too sense and isnt very funny either  although it tries hard to be kooky and weird if youre going to make a road movie why not add something original to the genre
