the only reason i havent given this film an awful rating is because i feel that it was such an awful film in every aspect that it deserves at the very least a 210 for not trying br br the plot is the least of your worries as you are slapped in the face with over the top language and scenes like the singing arsehole in a poor attempt to shock and disgust seen as the main aim of this film is to shock and the main body of it didnt achieve this the final scene disgustingly manages to erase the memory of this shockingly pointless film and fulfil its aim to be the most filthy film everbr br a really low budget film awfully acted and the dialogue is shockingly badbr br i give it 010 really
