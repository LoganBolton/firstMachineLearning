if i could rate it a zero i would  coming from someone who likes shockexploitation films of the time and waters overall i must say this is uselessbr br it does nothing  serves nothing  an idiot with a camera and a urge to prove his cleverness by rebeling against social standards is all this comes off asbr br its entirely amateur  both in principle and execution  it doesnt have a point  its digusting for the sake of disgusting obscene with the wit of a neanderthal  its uselessbr br someone said waters was probably chuckling over all the bad press and disgust others gave with this film  but why if i made a short film depicting a man in a bathroom taking a sht for ten minutes straight surely it would receive the same accomidations but why would i be proud or chuckle at that br br would it be because i am so unintelligent that i have to resort to this so i can say ha take that censors and mainstream im so rebellious ill do whatever i want and film it nobr br waters shouldnt be proud of this mess  fans of waters shouldnt watch it  its useless  that is  without any usebr br its doesnt even fit under the criteria of art for arts sakebr br to like or defend this movie is to defend something that was designed purposely as being anticulture to be pushed for the mainstream audience  in modern terms this film is the hot topic of filmsbr br useless and obsolete a poser film that demands it be acknowledged as rebellion
