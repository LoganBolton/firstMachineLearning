alright so not every australian movie is all that good yes maybe there have actually been very few with much merit take away however is an absolute bomb qualifying as one of the worst movies ive ever seen i wanted to like it i figured id give it a fair go ive even met one of the screen writers dave oneil so i feel kind of a traitor giving this movie a bad review but the plot is fairly thin i wont bother relating it read the synopsis which i can forgive there are plenty of movies that can cover that up with a few decent jokes unfortunately take aways jokes cover its plot up like a 2 prostitutes skirt probably the only laughs that came from the 6 other people in the cinema was at the poor acting and dialogue take away goes down like a week old dim sim  you might understand that joke if you see the film but the jokes not worth it
