this is supposed to be the story of the life of a man named wirey spindell from age 8 through to 36 told in narrative by the character at each age point in his life so for example when hes eight its the eight year olds voice that is doing the narration when hes in junior high its that one doing the narration etc thats about the only interesting thing about this movie it looks like each actor playing wirey is a separate character not only do they not look alike their life experiences dont seem to match upbr br avoid this movie like a bad cold
