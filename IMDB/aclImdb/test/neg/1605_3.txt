i hoped for this show to be somewhat realistic it stroke me as just another mainstream show after i watched it i didnt feel the characters at all is this americas glamorized idea of how terrorism operates the main character doesnt act like a fundamentalist at all and how he passes for a terrorist is beyond my comprehension neither of the other terrorists managed to appear genuine one of the members a blonde allamerican white boy would never be accepted by muslim terrorists in real life another member a french exskinhead doesnt quite fit in an islamic terror movement on top of this the terrorists have sexual relations to white american housewives which i find very strange this is just another stupid misguiding american tv show it is about just as realistic as prison break
