ill start by confessing that i tend to really enjoy action movies military or other im a guy but this dreck was awful i saw it for free showtime or hbo and still feel i paid too much it was a prolonged episode of general hospital br br i gave it a 1 only because 0 or 01 was not possible how or why 59 others would give it a rating of between 5 and 6 boggles my mind unless they are all family of the cast or crew br br it might be this movie was so bad many bailed outand as such were too uninvested to botherbr br im sorry for repeating but the 10 line minimum seems silly for what essentially boils down to a warningin hopes of saving others the 2 hr black hole this movie represents trust me stare at a blank wall theyll be more action
