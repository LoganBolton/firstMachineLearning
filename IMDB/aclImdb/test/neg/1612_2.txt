a malfunction in space sends astronaut neil stryker glenn corbett off course and headed to something of a parallel world called terra circling the sun exactly opposite earth as a being from space would pose a threat to this worlds order stryker is held until a determination can be made as to exactly what to do with him stryker however gets suspicious of his surroundings and escapes with the help of a sympathetic nurse and a old scientist who opposes the government stryker will try to board a spaceship and head back to earthbr br stranded in space or the stranger if you prefer is another of those 70s madefortv movies that was to be turned into a regular weekly show in this case its easy to see why it didnt make it first off theres nothing new about the shows setup it was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula used by the fugitive or the incredible hulk or planet of the apes you know a stranger constantly on the move going from one town to the next taking whatever odd job he can all the while being pursued by a government agency or newspaper reporter its a formula thats been done to death the second strike against stranded in space is its lead glenn corbett could this guy come across any less likable i was rooting for him to get caught without sympathy for the main character this kind of show would never work finally this is supposed to be science fiction just because everyone is lefthanded and someone has hung three fake looking moons on the horizon im supposed to jump to the conclusion that this is some distant planet so its a mere coincidence that they all speak english dress just like people on earth and drive plymouth furies yeah rightbr br the lone highlight for me was the inclusion of cameron mitchell in the cast sure its difficult to watch him in something this dreadful but you know the old saying  any cameron is better than no cameron yeah ive never heard it eitherbr br as with a lot of these 70s madefortv movies i watched stranded in space courtesy of mystery science theater 3000 i wouldnt call it a great episode by any stretch of the imagination but there are a few good jokes along the way so in the end while i rate the movie a 210 it gets a 35 on my mst3k rating scale
