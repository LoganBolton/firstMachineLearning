a friend of mine who is even more into 1970s cult films than myself recommended this one to me and in fact gave me the copy of it that i watched however i was not as enthusiastic about the result as he  or for that matter michael elliott  was the film is a hybrid of house of wax 1953 and the texas chain saw massacre 1974 indeed i would venture to say that it served as the basis of the 2005 remake of the former much more than the original did so we have a remote and derelict wax museum of incredibly lifelike dummies guess why that is with its apparently harmless curator a hammy chuck connors being invaded by the obligatory group of stranded teenagers among them tanya roberts he also has a mad brother  shades of psycho 1960 incorporated for good measure down to the selfsame twist  who is supposed to be a mechanical genius showcased in a poltergeist which unaccountably accompanies the first murder the film does benefit from a pino donaggio score but being so derivative and not especially well made to boot essentially ends up merely a redundant and fairly muddled genre effort
