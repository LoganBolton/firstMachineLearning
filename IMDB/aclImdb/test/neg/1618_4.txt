thanks to silly horror movies like troll and the indescribably atrocious cultfavorite troll 2 it has become practically impossible to take movies with kobolds gnomes and various other types of little green hobgoblins seriously these days only just recently i watched the 70s madefortv movie dont be afraid of the dark which is basically a quite terrifying and serioustoned film about domestic little goblin monsters and yet i still couldnt help thinking back about the laughinducing potato headed critters dressed in garbage bags that were running amok in troll 2 same thing happened to me now as much as i tried going into inhabited with a clear mindset unconsciously i kept comparing the supposedly creepy and menacing garden fairies with the badly sculptured goblins of nilbog still even without all the prejudices inhabited is a remotely entertaining albeit unmemorable straighttovideo horror flick its a cheesy soft and politically correct pastiche of family drama and northern europe mythology the annoying and murderous little creatures in this movie arent your plain average goblins they are the huldre wicked little norwegian demons that live underground and attempt to chase happy families out of their houses through influencing the youngest children this overcomes the russell family as they move into their ramshackle dream house in a remote little town the cherubic blond daughter of milfactress megan gallagher starts to behave strangely whenever she hangs out in the cute play house in the back of the garden she claims her friends are fairies and even though the sinister handyman also warns for strange occurrences in the past ginas parents simply think the girl has troubles adjusting to her new neighborhood when she keeps rattling about fairies they arrange an appointment with the acclaimed psychologist dr werner whilst the huldre are slowly coming out of their botanical shelter not much special to mention here the pace is acceptable and the attempts to build up suspense are pretty cute you understand this is a familyfriendly horror movie so no bloody murder sequences are graphically being shown here heck even the cadaver of the familys pet cat is kept offscreen this is the umpteenth nonsensical horror movie in which malcolm mcdowell pops up and he practically always depicts an unreliable greedy and selfcentered authority figure
