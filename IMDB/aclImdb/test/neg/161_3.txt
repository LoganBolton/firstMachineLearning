this film is about the complicated friendship romance and deceit between two men and two women during the world war iibr br a lot of effort has been put to make the edge of lovelook the right period however i find this effort too excessive particularly in terms of the tone of the colours most of the first half of the film is processed so much to have a strong bluish tone its hard to make out whos who in this tonebr br another detrimental point is the fancy use of image splitting lens there are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing such as three keira knightley smiling face or four pairs of arms in embrace that simply makes the film confusing and hard to follow instead of being artisticbr br as for the plot it is plain boring the way the story unfolds is not engaging at all sienna millers unstable character is annoying in fact all the main characters are annoying and unlikeable keira knightleys accent is impossible to understand making it a further impediment to understanding the plotbr br i strongly advise avoiding the edge of love unless you watch a film only to appreciate great costumes nice sets and lighting
