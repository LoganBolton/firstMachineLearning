theres simply no redeeming quality about this film ok some of the costumes are ok but theyre nothing you cant see in say the conan flicks and whats up with ators hair i cant believe this is part of a series i will say one thing about this film it was deemed bad enough for a righteous lampooning by the early cast of mst3k and i suggest to anyone thats curious enough to see how bad this film is to watch that version of the film for moral support if nothing else
