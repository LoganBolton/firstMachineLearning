i saw this one on the late late late late show back when mst3k was just a twinkle in joel hodgsons eye i had the privilege of seeing it without knowing exactly how bad it would be i didnt know that a woman with an arrow in her chest could run to the ends of the earth in about an hour and a half thank god her father gave such specific directions and then take days to make it back to the castle with help i didnt know that a sword wielding barbariantype could run into the forest and create a hanglider and flash powder bombs in under 30 seconds i had no idea how disjointed a movie could bebr br its a bad thing children a very bad thing if you enjoy bad movies go for it
