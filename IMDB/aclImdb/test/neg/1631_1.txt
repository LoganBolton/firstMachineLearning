like almost everyone else i became aware of this turkey on mystery science theater 3000 it easily ranks as one of my favorite mst3k episodes of all time i really couldnt imagine attempting to watch this film on its own thoughits really really really really really really really really really really badbr br miles okeeffe stars as ator a musclebound fabio wannabe who lives during the time of cave men we the viewer are asked to suspend our disbelief in that he knows alchemy and chemistry and can manage to build a complete hangglider in about 5 minutes yeah right theres also a fairly attractive actress cant remember her name who wears a hubcap as a chest shield oh and i cant forget that wacky asian sidekick thong he had the easiest role in the movie since he doesnt utter one word of dialogue throughout the entire movie he had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talkingand he failed miserablybr br the film isnt watchable in any way and should be only viewed in its proper mst3k format if you watch that version youll laugh yourself sillybr br im hugebr br rating1
