why its none other than ator played hilariously bad by miles okeefe surprisingly i had the misfortune of sitting through this turkey before mystery science theater 3000 tore it to pieces i highly recommend checking out the mst3k version since its hilarious and one of their best episodes everbr br the movie on its own is basically the kind of typical bmovie crud that italian filmmakers were churning out in the early to mid 80s this film was apparently made to cash in on the conan craze but it fails miserably on all countsbr br keep an eye out for the scenes where ator fights a giant rubber snake and also manages to make a complete hangglider during a cutawaybr br thong fish is readybr br rating the movie itself1 the mst3k version 10
