another in the long line of conan wannabes that tired to cash in on that movies success this italian monstrosity is about as bad as they came you know its a bad sign when your heroes fight invisible enemies because the movie was made so cheaply there wasnt money for either adequate special effects or to hire real people i wont even bother going into the plot as i defy anyone to follow it and make sense of the storyline maybe its the television cut i watched but i cant imagine any version being that much better it all seems so random to me evil sorcerers cavemen giant snakes medieval castles grenades and hang gliding  none of it fits together its as if director joe damato had an epileptic fit while making cave dwellers or any of the other halfdozen names the movie goes by and threw everything he could think of onto the screen regardless of how unrelated it was or how it fit into the films already puzzling plot the acting is sufficiently bad miles okeeffe could never act his way out of a wet paper bag and he proves that once again in this movie the rest of the cast is equally atrocious then theres the    well you get the idea its late im tired and ive already wasted more than enough time writing about this piece of garbage take my word for it  avoid cave dwellers or whatever you want to call it at all costs
