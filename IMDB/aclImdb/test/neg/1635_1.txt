i actually own this movie which is the mst3k version called cave dwellers which is really the only way anyone could really watch a movie like this if it werent for joel crow and tom servo constantly making wisecracks it wouldnt be possible to sit through this piece of crap you have a hero called ator who looks a lot like jeff spigoli in fast times at ridgemont high and appears only slightly more intelligent just without being stoned he takes on cavemen the cave dwellers invisible guys a giant snake with a bunch of anal retentive snakes that like to line up all the skulls to face the same way invents a hang glider which suspiciously looks like a modern aluminum one with some cheap vines wrapped around it and then does battle with the evil john saxonlooking dude then he rides off on his horse across the tire tracks where someones been fourwheelingbr br yes i got most of that from mst3k which as i said is the only way to watch this turkey of a movie if it werent for that it would get zero stars
