this is about one of the worst movies id ever seen its not the worst though  manos the hands of fate holds that honorbr br this movie has a lot of problems to begin this whole movie is a cheap ripoff of the conan movies theres the babe in a skimpy dress wearing a hubcap the quiet asian warrior the cookie cutter bad guy the almost mindless soliders and so on theres lots of continuity errors in this film some of the dumbest errors ive ever seen are in this filmbr br fortunately when i watched this film i seen the mst3k version joel and the bots make the film watchable otherwise i probably wouldve turned it off five minutes into the film
