spoilers horrifyingly enough i have actually seen the film that this horrid film was a sequel to it was called ator the fighting eagle and i saw it when i was just 8 years old it made such an awful impression on me that i never forgot it ive been an mst3k fan for a long time so when cavedwellers came out on tape i bought it i was horrified to realize that it was a sequel to the wretched ator movie that id seen so long ago ators costume has somehow gotten ever skimpier than the last time i saw him how can he wear that tiny little bikini doesnt he care that it shows off the fact that he has noerrrpackage and poor thonghe gets no lines and no girl and has to follow that frizzy haired girly doofus ator around all the time has anyone else noticed that miles okeefe walks like a woman no wonder hes not interested in the pretty if somewhat lackluster meela the evil but prancy bad guy zor is more to his taste im sure i loved zors cardboard spray painted swan helmet and the way he spent all his time trying to touch some part of ator the fight scenes are so badly choreographed that its a wonder that the swords ever manage to connect the dull old guy spends all of his time standing around looking depressed ator drinks from a cup given to him by a guy who hates him and then looks surprised that they drugged him he must be pretty smart thoughhe invented a hang glider in the space pf five minutes then flew it into a rift in the spacetime continuum so that he travelled briefly into 17th century bulgaria that was after he stabbed the giant snake puppet of course and saved the post coital meela while she sat around doing absolutely nothing the real hero of the movie was thong who saved ator several times from his boundless stupiditiy and killed the evil zor in the bargain kudos to thong the only competent person in the whole film
