it amazes me that anyone would find pauly shore entertaining he is basically one joke that gets stale real fast he has his little california jerk vocabulary and a basic stock of lame jokes mainly he is just obnoxiousbr br that said i watched this movie because i was up sick and there was literally nothing else on but infomercials otherwise i would have turned it off after 30 minutes anyway the film could have been ok if pauly could have just turned off his spiel and just played it as a comic actor instead of well pauly br br anyway im sure pauly fans will like it anyway  but if you are not a pauly fan stay away from this crock of manurebr br i had to leave this comment after seeing that another user actually gave this film a 1010 maybe it was pauly personally i gave it a 310 because they didnt have any mikeinframe shots didnt drop the camera and the supporting cast was pretty good
