this is one of the worst pieces of cinema i have seen in some time this is also my first review so you can tell i must hate this film at lotbr br dont get me wrong i like my serious films i dont like hollywood too much i tend to like french italian offbeat us or anything that tries to communicate something sensiblebr br but this was awful why 1 the plot such as it was was entirely unbelievable even though the director seems to be hinging everything on a feeling of realismbr br 2 the main character has nothing to recommend him does he smoke for coolness or to show us his angst for goodness sake this guy is meant to be an exdodgy mafia lawyer are we meant to care more because that he is also one of the meanest unfriendly people you could ever meet and he smokesso he must have deep personal issues pop psychology at its best in the final moments i almost cheered as he gets buried in the cement best place for him and i thought that was about the only good scene or maybe that was because it was so close the final creditsbr br 3 the entirely tired and unbelievable interest in the main character from the beautiful girl she was there simply because beautiful girls always have odd sexual relationships with old old men with a deep and meaningful personality as demonstrated by smoking happens all the time in really bad films that isbr br 4 the pace was so leaden i like slow i like careful but this was just deathlybr br 550 a bunch of other stuff that i really cant be bothered to writebr br awful
