i rate movies on this site all the time but i dont normally write comments however in this case i felt compelled to warn others this movie is bad its probably one of only a dozen movies i have scored as 1 awful i know people say this all the time but this truly was one of the worst movies i have ever seen its easily on the bottom ten anywaybr br when it comes to horror movies i have very low standards ill overlook all sorts of shoddy filmmaking for a good scare but this movie is embarrassingly bad it looks someone bought a video camera at sears and decided to make a movie with his buddies the fact that every single crew members name appears in the cast list proves this theory i think this movie has lower production standards than your average high school play its actually a little shocking to see a movie that looks this bad released on dvd the special effects are somewhat effective at times but are still amateurish at best the best thing that can be said about the actors is that at least they remember no to look into the camera most of the time i cant say for certain if they struggling to remember their lines or making them up as they went along any and all attempts at humor are lame this movie is such a colossal waste of time
