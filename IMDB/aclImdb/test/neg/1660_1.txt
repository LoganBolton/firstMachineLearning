did you ever think like after watching a horror movie with a group of friends wow this is so cool we have got to make a splatter horror movie ourselves some day soon i bet it isnt as difficult as it seems well this must have been what went through the minds of the young campbell brothers back in 2003 presumably right after watching sam raimis the evil dead or a similar independent horror classic this demon summer however is so bad its embarrassing these young amateurish filmmakers obviously worship the horror genre and know their classics but that nearly doesnt make them talented ive seen quite a lot lousy bmovies in my years as a horror fanatic but this honestly ranks as one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made and its quite sad to be this openhearted because the whole cast and crew clearly had good intentions theres pretty much no script at all a duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a bum and whilst reading some passages of it one of them mutates into a hideous demon that starts killing off members of all the different teenagergroups dorks hot catholic girls stoners and troublemakers thats about it except of course for all the obligatory clich√©s like the hot girl falling for the biggest dork etc etc the performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry they just stand there motionless until the script says its their turn to interact i hate that some of makeup effects are remotely decent but still not spectacular and the soundtrack contains some of the most awful punksongs ever this film should never have been released i can very well imagine that it must have been fun to be a part of the production but its utterly imbecile and doesnt feature the slightest redeeming element not even a bit of amateurnudity damned
