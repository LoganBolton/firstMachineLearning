i understand that the budget was low on this film but come on this is really terrible filmmaking the script is just plain awful and that was the free part the effects arent bad but this film plays out like a conventional rrated movie with lame scares and cutaway violence rather than a no holds barred unrated gorefest that was intentionally made for video who were these guys kidding like this would have been released in theatersbr br the acting is terrible the editing another free aspect of the film is beyond amateur and the plot as i said before leaves little to be desired theres nothing original about the film gore fans avoid this one to the filmmakers try for something original next time or stop making movies all together youre not good at it people hate a trashy rehash especially one of such low caliber avoid it isnt even worth making fun of
