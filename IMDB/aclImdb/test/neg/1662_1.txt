i could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie it has set the standard i will never again give a movie a 1 unless it was as horrible as this one i fully agree with the other comments about this film but since im dutch i watched it with dutch translation apparently they didnt have money for a proper translation so they decided to babelfish it with sometimes hilarious resultsbr br dont smoke dont drink dont do drugs dont watch demon summerbr br i was surprised that the actors wow i cant believe i just said that didnt hold the script was there any in their hands while shooting i think they also did a good job on well uhmm no they didnt do a good job at all
