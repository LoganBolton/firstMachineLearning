this was an 1970stype irreverent comedy poking fun at the psychiatric profession and at beverly hills i didnt mind that but i did object to more that irreverence regarding marriage and religion two topics which secular filmmakers meaning about everyone in hollywood and elsewhere just cant stop trashing br br walter matthau plays a scuzzy character donald becker who walks around with a clerics collar on which offends me but when has hollywood ever been worried about offending christiansbr br anyway despite that nonsense the film has its entertaining moments and even some charm to it dan aykroyd is good at paying a nutcase and donna dixon laura rollins is a knockout i am sorry she didnt have a bigger role
