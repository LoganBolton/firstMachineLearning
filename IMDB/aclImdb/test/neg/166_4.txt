an odd willfully skewed biopic of dyan thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen lines of his poetry instead we have to endure a raw character expos√©e seen through the prism of his protobigamous relationship with wife sienna miller and childhood love keira knightley matthew rhys plays thomas with sufficient charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repellent selfinterest and cillian murphy makes up the persistently tense lovetetbr br the film never seems to decide on where its going theres no arc so much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other maybury seems much more interested in his two female leads who wouldnt than in the man who brings them together and then divides them miller is the choice of the two i found knightley competent at best but then i have never found her sympathetic but they both offer dreadfully inconsistent welsh accents other funny decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of william murphy arty production eg double crossfades that is neither impressionist nor symbolic and the old chestnut act of period footage which doesnt blend 410
