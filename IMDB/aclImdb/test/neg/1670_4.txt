this movie seems a little clunky around the edges like not quite enough zaniness was thrown it when it should have been but i mostly enjoyed itbr br the storyline is more than a little bit preposterous so no expectation of something real should be included in your viewing experience check your brain in at the door it will not be needed and might be an impediment otherwisebr br i quite enjoyed clennons performance as the real dr baird his role was spot on for giving aykroyds character a protagonist what a putz the real dr baird wasbr br and matthau was quite good as the lead characters sidekick annoying at first but ultimately lovable sort of kind of or at least something the use of a bar of soap and a lot of water would have been more than helpfulbr br actually worth watching if youre in the mood for a spoof on the psychiatric profession sure why not
