what a truly moronic movie all i can say is the writer must be very fond of magic mushrooms and lsd because this must be the result of one of his tripsbr br you follow the whole movie thinking alright this is very weird but hey im sure at the end there will be a perfectly good explanation for all of this only to be disappointed to find erm no theres no explanation at all and the twist at the end makes it even more confusing at the end of the movie youll probably have the same facial expression as if you were standing in a que paying for you groceries and the merchant told you thatll be 1195 please and proceeded to elbow you in the balls for no apparent reason there are so many factors in this movie that go unexplained and i think it leaves it to the imagination of the viewer in an entirely bizarre way dont get me wrong i like weird movies the cell could easily be described as weird and twisted but in my eyes its a brilliant movie despite casting jlo who i dislike to the maximum even that didnt manage to sway my opinion this isnt one of those movies and i think you should take in to consideration the characters of those who praise this movie i can tell you they are probably the sort of people that would go to an art exhibition see a splat of pigeon excrement on a white board and say oooooh what a masterpiece the artist has truly found a unique way to portray eternity when in actual fact all it is is bird excrement on a boardbr br keep that last bit in mind when watching this movie br br thanks for reading
