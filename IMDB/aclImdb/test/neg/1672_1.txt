i received this movie in a pack called 50 allstar movies for 18 45 cents each many are good this one was terrible it was a hackneyed retread done 1000 times before and each time better a crippled exjock is dared to coach a team made up of juvenile delinquents they learn from him that they can make it if they play by the rules im sure the kids and the locals were thrilled to be included in a real tv movie but i cant imagine what the folks that launched and produced this project figured they could bring to this already over beaten subject i kept waiting to see that new twist or new angle but honest it doesnt come avoid this movie forget about the 45 cents i want the 96 minutes of my life back
