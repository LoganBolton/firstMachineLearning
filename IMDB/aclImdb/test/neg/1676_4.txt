a childlike puppeteer for a public access childrens show goes over the deep end when he discovers kids he entertains at a hospital were victims of horrible abuse this movie has some of the worst indescribably monstrous parents you could ever come across not an exploitation film as much as an afterschool special on the dangers of child abuse seemingly harmless mr rabby takes matters into his own hands when it seems the police are neutered by lack of evidence to convict loathsome parents of their terrible abuse towards their children the children are emotionless and zombielikedue to the amount of abuse inflicted upon them the parents loud inconceivably harsh contemptible and belligerent the mothers in particular are so obscene youll root for their execution they are essentially miserable people taking out their frustrations on the kids our detectives are a tired lot frustrated with the whole judicial process how police procedure is often unable to prosecute those who beat their kids into submission while the crimes themselves are heinous the film doesnt explicitly elaborate the grisly activity on screen id say the reason to see this is for tom bashams performance as the unbalanced manchild who slips into psychosis theres quite a weird dinner table sequence between bashams mr rabbey and his guardian shortly after he murdered the parents responsible for the death of their child regarding how he lives in a fantasy and how what he had just done has left an indelible marknotice the changes in behavior pretty impressive work going from innocent to creepy peter renaday is lt hayes the detective in charge of the homicides cases expressing on his face the strain that is taking its toll on him theres an early performance by john ashton as detective matthews always raising the ire of hayes because of his inability to follow directions not to mention how opinionated he is regarding the parents abusing their kids awkward laidback bluesy score that seems improper for a film such as this controversial conclusion establishing that even kids can only tolerate so much a bit too slow moving for my tastes but theres an effective use i felt of bashams eyes before he takes care of business waiting patiently as he prepares to strike
