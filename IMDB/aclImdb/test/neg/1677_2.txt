this movie over does it on the cgi i mean scifi really they over did it the original  bats is better it does not use cgi like the sequel in this movie its the simple people running from mutated killer bats and really bats in afghanistan the plot involves us army soldiers finding a terrorist and being attack by bats and dying but the reason i gave this movie 3 stars is because the way the camera zooms in on the soldiers the acting is bad and this doesnt even look like a horror movie in all this movie is a fairly good tv movie for scifi channel but if like scifis movies youll like this movie because you just like channel 43 oh and if you fall asleep during the movie dont be surprised oh sorry i think i give it 2 stars instead
