i have yet to watch the first entry in this series however fortunately i was still able to follow the complex and intricate plot with all its unexpected twists and turns and i applaud them for the utter originality of the concepts herein in case there is any confusion let me leave no doubt as to the fact that everything ive just said is coated in pure carefully nurtured sarcasm the kind that flourishes and grows exponentially when exposed to crap like this flick a clear sign that this is unimpressive is that it was directed by a visual effects creator whose only other credit in that field is a henry rooker film that wasnt well received the acting is average at best and i defy anyone to not find scottish computerwomancome on seriously what is with that last names russian accent laughable andor irritating there is an attempt or two at stylization in this and they are reasonable the action isnt terrible cinematography and editing are fine the music is cool enough language is infrequent if even that violence is fairly bloody i recommend this solely to fans of bmovies and i will say that you can do worse than this 110
