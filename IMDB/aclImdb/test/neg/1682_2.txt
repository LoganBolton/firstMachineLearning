i give the show a six because of the fact that the show was in fact a platform for damon wayans as the cosby show was for bill cosby it dealt with a lot of issues with humor and i felt that it in fact tailored to getting a laugh as opposed to letting the jokes come from the character br br michael kyle an interesting patriarch and a wisecracking person he is phenomenal in movies but in the show he was there for the wisecrack and though i loved it i felt that the laugh was more important than plausibilitybr br jay kyle i have loved her since house party and have enjoyed her in school daze and martin this was a great role for her and she made a great choice in picking this sitcom to costar in i also feel that jay and michael were more like equals in the show but jay was more the woman who fed her crazy husbands the lines and went along with his way of unorthodox discipline because she may have felt that it workedbr br jr just plain stupid his character should have been well developed and even though he does have his moments of greatness we are returned to the stupidity as if he learned nothing which drives me nuts not to mention that most of the situations in episodes ive seen seems to center around himbr br clair the attractive sister who dated a christian i found her boyfriends character to be more interesting than she was shed be better off sticking to movies the writers should have done more to show her intelligence but its not stereotypical enoughbr br kady lovable and the youngest daughter i think the writers established her character most on the show aside from the parents and franklinbr br franklin i love this character and i think they derived it from smart guy tj mowry which only lasted one season they did a great job of casting for this little genius the effort would have been made if jr would have been the smart one but show the down sides alsobr br all in all this sitcom is a wonderful thing and its homage to the cosby show is well done i love the show and wished it would have stayed on longer than that i cant wait to see the series finale
