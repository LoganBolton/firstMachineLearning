i loathe despise and hate this film with a passion that makes the red hot gates of hell look cold by comparison its nothing but a campy frightening and completly shoddy trip down memory lane to that ohsonasty time the 70s a decade im glad i wasnt a part of if this absolute trite is all that was on offerbr br the animation is sickeningly dated not least of all with its tacky missing frames and characters with huge bulbous heads this film is an eyesore from the knowing snide nod to the parents with the freakily gay sea horse and its camp hand motions and kenneth williamsesque voice to the overtly unsubtly druggy anthem high cockalorum this film im sad to say is one that was forced upon me as a child and i have never fully recovered from the terror it caused mebr br this ghastly display of complete terribleness should carry an r rated certificate so disturbing it is in its contents
