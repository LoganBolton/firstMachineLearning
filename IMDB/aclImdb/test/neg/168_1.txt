this is one of the most awful movies ive ever seen probably only surpassed by the dreadful and utterly meaningless blueberry how can harald zwart even have put his name on this crap im feeling every ounce of respect i had for him waning fastbr br so what is it about this film that makes it so poor is it the story yes is it the actors yes it it the whole look and feel of the movie yesbr br to start off with the story my godits about as clich√©ridden and predictable as what you would expect from a drunk 14year old who is late writing hisher paper on what i did this summer the feelgood vibe the makers try to achieve just completely drown as we suffer through yet another embarrassing turn to the storybr br the actors are amateurs i know and thus we cannot expect them to be of the same quality as professional actors but for this to work the characters have to be charming andor funny preferably both so that the viewers dont mind the cheeky acting or perhaps it even adds to the characters in this case not even close baby you start off disliking the characters mildly and by the end of the film i think its about 90 minutes long although it feels like 4 hours you have a strong desire to hurt somebody to get your mind of these annoying stupid guys it should be impossible to find this movies attempt at humor successful unless youre actually yourself like these stupid hickeys their before mentioned lack of talent and credibility as far as acting goes only makes the foolish and overly simple scenes fall harder to the ground even the family of the people involved will have a hard time finding this anything but very very embarrassing id rather have my sister make a fool of herself on american idolbr br finally why cram in a bunch of misplaced norwegian celebrities they look even more out of place than the actors if this is possible these celebrity cameos just add to the cheap feeling of the film and is in itself a pretty seethrough shot in the dark at trying to improve something broken even before inceptionbr br i cannot even begin to stress how much id rather watch paint dry than ever watch this movie again
