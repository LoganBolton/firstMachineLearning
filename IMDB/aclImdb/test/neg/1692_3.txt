i was 12 when this film was released and adored it the songs were inspiring and it made me feel good watching it several times at the cinema i actually had the soundtrack album and played the songs over and overbr br 26 years laterim ashamed just sat and watched it with my 2 daughters who enjoyed it lots but my cynical older grown up eyes hated it its very poorly directed in many places and considering it was lionel jeffries directing i really wanted to enjoy it the character animation was so rough yet the backgrounds were quite good i remember the critics at the time saying that it was a poor film and was horrified but now i agreebr br it is an old film yes compared to what can be achieved now maybe thats why i thought it was good then but that does not excuse it for its poor acting directing and sloppiness the main child actors voice seems dubbed which is very distracting too cant quite see what they were trying achieve when it was being made all that it become was a weak film
