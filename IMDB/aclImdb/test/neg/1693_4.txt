very resistible but ultimately harmless film version of the childrens literary classic which incorporates an animated portion in the style of mary poppins 1964 and bedknobs and broomsticks 1971 the human cast is very distinguished  james mason billie whitelaw david tomlinson joan greenwood bernard cribbins  but their roles range from the miscast a 69 yearold mason as a thieving chimneysweep to the inconsequential greenwood as a befuddled aristocrat to the bizarre whitelaw plays several exotic characters  including a circus performer an old hag a maid and a fairy  for no apparent reasonbr br the animated segment of the film handled by a group of easteuropean animators is hardly inspired but mildly enjoyable in itself and as usual with this type of thing there is an assortment of songs one has to put up with one of which in particular is reprised far too often for its own good the film was directed by noted character actor jeffries who had previously directed far more successfully other childrens films namely the railway children 1970 and the amazing mr blunden 1972 which ive yet to watch myself but which was released some time ago on r2 dvd by anchor bay uk
