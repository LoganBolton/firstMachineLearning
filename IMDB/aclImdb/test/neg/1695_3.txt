maybe this wowed them in the 50s but this is one of those flicks that doesnt age well its got that preachy earnest downtrodden working man vibe of a 2nd rate rod serling live tv playhouse broadcast the plot is by the book the cassevetes characters troubled background seems tackedon and the love interest is unconvincing and halfheartedbr br sidney portier gives an ok performance but man he sure was an annoying haughty snot if i had to work with this guy in a warehouse id probably want to hit him with a grappling hook too jack warden is good because as usual he plays jack wardenbr br like 90 of the films rated on imdb whether they are classics mediocre or crapola somehow this one gets rated with 7pointsomestars it is in no way deserving of that save your time
