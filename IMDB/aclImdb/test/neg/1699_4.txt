if you are a catalan nationalist anarchosocialist with unnuanced reverence for the mythologies of the spanish republic this movie may be for you two brothers reallife ones one of them being marc recha himself reenact a fictional version of a reallife journey they had made through the spectacular catalan countryside and history is evoked pans of bulletholed walls artillery booms on the soundtrack but not shown there is very little dialog and most of it is incidental the story is told in a thirdperson voiceover the voice being that of an actress impersonating the reallife sister of the reallife brothers the images have little to do with what story line there is which isnt much many are stunning brooding pans across stark semiarid mountains and rivers think terrence malick or gus van sant  theres not a little of both gerry and last days here interspersed with some stunning still images and motionless frames these are best enjoyed within the films superb natural sound environment and without the ultimately tedious narration or even the occasional background music some quite good some rather odd but all gratuitous the best of what this movie has to say is said in these sequences with their occasional commentless inclusion of power stations and damsbr br the relationship between the brothers is left sketchy and generic a major character is a manbiting catfish never shown the more the catalanonationalist anarchowhateverist commitments of the director are suggested the more the films richer unspoken message is subverted and the more irritatingly narcissistic the experience becomes though the director said at the nyff screening that the film was conceived from the beginning with its thirdperson narrative id like to see a version of it without the narrative or the music and with only the natural soundtrack and minimalist dialog  the result might be more moving and would in any case not be that much less bafflingbr br meantime this is most likely the only film you will see this year in which a guy strides into the frame with a cloth object the bathing suit he had been wearing dangling from his penis this is one of the few moments in the whole movie in which your interest is sorry pricked by something thats actually happening on screen what is that whys it hanging there but as usual no answers are provided very warholian very sixties and a not a little tiresome
