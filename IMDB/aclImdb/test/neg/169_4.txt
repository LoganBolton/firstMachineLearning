i think i watched a highly edited version because it wasnt nearly as graphic as i expected  based on the other reviews that i have heardbr br other than 1 being written by the same person who wrote the original emmanuelle 1974 emmanuelle arsan 2 the lead character being a sexually free spirit and 3 being set in the exotic locale of asia laure doesnt have the same flair as its predecessorbr br i just found this film way too talky with philosophical topics that im really not that interested in ie the voyeuristic open relationship between laure and nick im just happy with whatever brings her pleasuresomething along those lines i cannot relate to this mentality and the filmcharacters dont really shed any lightbr br the second half about finding the mara tribe just seemed as though it were a completely separate film one that i didnt care for by that time i was just hoping that it would turn into a porn so that at least it would keep my interestbr br maybe i just didnt get itbr br ill leave it at that
