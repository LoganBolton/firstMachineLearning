for years ive been a big fan of parks work and old boy is one of my alltimes favoritebr br with lots of expectation i rented this movie only to find the worst movie ive watched in awhile its not a proper horror movie theres no suspense in it and even the light part is so lame that i didnt know whether to laugh or crybr br i introduced my younger brother to chanwook park and what a disappointment he got from this for me an idol has fallenbr br if you loved movies like old boy the mr  lady vengeance or even his short films on three extremes dont waste your time the films not worth it
