this film had it been done properly has so much potential parody films are always funny and people tend to like them because theyre light hearted stupid and silly but fun this film was funny in some parts but it could have been a lot funnier the acting itself was ok from all the actors buti wasnt satisfied it seemed a tad empty and my summary title says it all about the effects proper green screens werent used for this moviebackgrounds were added in after which just looked terrible no wonder this film went straight to dvd lol it wasnt all a total loss it is funny and will give you a good laugh at it not with it most of the time
