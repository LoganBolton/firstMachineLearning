this is a film that revolves around two mysteries which i have now demystifedbr br first did the film makers understand the concept of parody before using it to carpet bomb the audience throughout the film parody is when a reproduction attempts to mock comment on or pay homage through selfdepreciating humour to the original work in other words there should be reasons to parody such work and they should definitely be clever i didnt see any of those in the film i did see some awful 10 seconds jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds of delivery bryan stoller probably went to eric roberts and said hey i was drunk last night watching survivors and had this brain fart for a straight to dvd release i want you on board without reading the scriptbecause i plan to direct this film without one br br and herein lies the second mystery eric roberts career i use to think eric roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky now i realize its because he is stupid and therefore deserves the career that he had after watching this movie it is apparent that he would have been better off had he gone into mainstream adult films which has higher budgets moreintensescenes and roles better acting and direction more elaborate and compelling plot lines and a much wider audience than this bmovie reject cmovie
