holy sweet murder this is quite possibly the least funny movie ive ever seen you can take my word for this as truth because its playing on television right now its really one of the most pathetic productions ive ever seen there is not a single redeemable aspect of this flick it just lacks any humor whatsoever the only good thing it possibly has going for it is that its so unfunny that its wholly unmemorable in fact i just sat through some ridiculous subplot and i cant really tell you what went on the only reason i can even possibly remember having seen this movie is because its so absolutely humorless it will stick in my mind forever based on that alonebr br an absolutely must miss if your friend wants to show it to you shoot him and save yourself the boredom
