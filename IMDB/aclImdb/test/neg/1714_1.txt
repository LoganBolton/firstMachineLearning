this movie even calling it a movie is an overstatement is ridiculously horrible normally a huge fan of eric roberts in b list movies this tragedy of a flick makes me question his real b list clout and charlie please go back to hoping for a diagnosis murder revival rather than thisyou cant blame the nameless eye candy uhhumbeauty pageant members for participating in this weak movie but you are a former tv star man pull yourself together dont even get me started on stuart pankin for the sake of all that is good stuart you should have seen this was not necessarily a real movie bryan michael stoller exemplifies absolute genius only in the fact that he was able to dupe anyone into investing in this picture money or timebr br really this was no parody or spoof movie although it tries on a 2nd grade level mostly it is poor writing and acting and camera work and editing andwell poor everything i watched it because i read an article in some mag about agent mjs involvement and my interest was peaked due to the lawsuit in which he was involved i now wonder if the only reason they show him from the shoulders up in the movie is because he like at the trial showed up wearing pajama bottoms and barely lucid wait a second is he ever really considered lucidi digress and agent mj is that the best they could come up with for a name for his character sheez what a startling piece of originality or maybe that was supposed to be funny putting marriott into the movie was a nice touch at first but overdone and annoying after all is said and donebr br spare yourself the grief of watchingdont say i didnt warn you
