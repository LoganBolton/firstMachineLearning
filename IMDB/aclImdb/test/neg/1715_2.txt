i actually enjoyed tycus if not for much more than mocking the production values dennis hopper was just fine although i wonder if he would have signed on the project had he seen the special effects they used and furthermore what was with the scene with the ninja that was just completely out of pace perhaps someone came up with the bright idea midshooting oh well this movie is great if youre drunk and need a good laugh cheers
