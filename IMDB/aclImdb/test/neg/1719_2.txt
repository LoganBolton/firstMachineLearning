unimpressive and extremely low budget scifi without any charm and appeal even the scenes related with the fall of the asteroids are stolen from other movies with the same plot its just a bad ripoff of asteroid with annabela sciora and deep impact with morgan freeman mr hopper seems to be anxious to slip away from this pointless and dull scifi entrybr br i give this a 2 two and dont say im not a good guy
