like many others i counted on the appearance of dennis hopper to make this not a complete waste of time i was sadly mistaken everything negative said about this flic is more than true what takes the cake however is the horrible horrible storyline for the main characterbr br heres why the planet might be destroyed the only way to recover from it for the entire human race to be saved trough it is to get as many smart capable nice competent people into an underground hideout and dennis hopper is the lone seerscientist with vision who was prepared for the worst and who has realized this but whats the main motivation of stevens sonny dangelo hes angry because dennis has decided who is to be saved or to be doomed while it clearly explained to stevens that dennis character has done everything to warn people of the danger but that he was laughed at the hoppercharacter was the boy with the finger in the dike and now stevens is blaming him for picking and choosing and if that isnt enough he wants to stop everybody from entering this hideout because it isnt fair and hes responsible for the death of the one guy who is humanitys saviour oh my god how stupid can you getbr br whats also maddening that imdb forces one to write minimal ten lines about this piece of crap i mean two million in budget what could have been done with that think clerks blair witch and lotsa other movies who have been made for under 100000 dollars and were still better aaaaargh i count myself lucky that i didnt pay one penny to see this crap and to sit through the end of this utter Ãºbercrap is one the most heroic things ive done this year its no wonder that the writers of this pile of dung had jobs as camera operator and title designer before
