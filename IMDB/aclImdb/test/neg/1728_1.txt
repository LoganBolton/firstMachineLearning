i found myself getting increasingly angry as this movie progressedbr br basically dr crawford dennis hopper has predicted a meteor will hit the earth the powers that be dont believe him so he sets about building a survival shelter inside a mountain for a small collection of peoplebr br jake lowe peter onorati is a down on his luck reporter for a trashy tabloid who gets a tip from a friend he thought was dead that something is going on in the mountains he sets out to investigatebr br while trying to get into the secret survival shelter jake spends a great deal of time shooting people to death or beating them to within an inch of their lives he spends the rest of his time bitching at dr crawford about who gave the doc the right to decide which people should get to survive the meteorbr br i found myself wishing jake would do the future a big favor and turn a gun on himselfbr br dont waste your time on this turkey
