horrendous im a teenager and i dont mind teen movies but this is horrible aaron carter plays this popstar named jd mcqueen and to keep his grades up or something he works together with the nerd jane whateverherlastnameis but the mean girls are too predictable and such the clothing most of the girls wear in the movie isnt realistic how would any of those girls get away with wearing no bra tube tops and shirts that expose the belly in high school at my school wed be sent home for something like thatbr br and one part of the movie where jd texts jane she says sleep tight he must think im an idiot i didnt know texting was so stressful how is texting stressful and how obsessed jane is with jd and how he falls in love with her is very stupid the dialogue is cheesy and stupid the actings terrible the music is somewhat enjoyable and the plot is little to nonebr br for tweenyboppers who still love aaron carter youll enjoy it if youre a casual watcher like me this is not the movie for you
