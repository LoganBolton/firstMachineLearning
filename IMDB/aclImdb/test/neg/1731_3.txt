my summary refers to the fact that this film has 1479 votesjust 21 short of making it eligible to be on imdbs infamous bottom 100 listthe 100 lowest rated films on the website with a paltry score of only 18 this would place the film at approximately between 38 and 46 on the listtalk about a very dubious achievement my score of 3 isnt that badbut it does bring the film that much closer to the dreaded listbr br as for the film it stars the oncecute aaron carteryet another prepackaged and forgettable pop star of the 1990s when he first broke onto the scene he was a cute kid with some songs that appealed to preteens and tweeners on radio disney his songs look and image were all scrupulously groomed and created by marketing folks and did the trickleading to some huge album sales unfortunately by 2005 sales were in decline and carter had hit his awkward stage of lifesomething all kids his age have to deal with eventually to put it bluntly he isnt cute any more in this film and is at a very tough stage of life i assume now hes a gorgeous young manbut in popstar hes no longer the heartthrob he once was here he is just very normala death sentence for a kid in his position as a pop sensationbr br interestingly the film has some appearances by some other exteen heartthrobs from the last few decadesincluding a roles for david cassidy and leif garretttwo guys who also know what its like to disappear from the limelight cassidy managed to pick up the pieces and make a niche for himself while garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after stardom has been a bit of a joke hopefully carter will take after cassidy in the future and so far thankfully hes managed to avoid the negative publicity and court appearances of many expop idols i was far from thrilled with the film but seriously wish him best in this department its not his fault he was plastered across the radio and television throughout the early to mid1990sbr br in this film carter doesnt exactly need to stretch himselfhe plays a pop star however despite making millions and being adored by girls he doesnt have it all hes quite densemostly because he has little interest in learning the problem is so bad that his mother decides to no longer home school himforcing him to go to public school the problem though is that he is rather phobic about taking testsand making the grade in school is difficult so he gets the idea of finding a smart girl to dateone who would naturally be obliged to help him out in school he picks the cute but bookish jane alana austin and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt to make this scheme workbr br this plot by the way isnt bad and could work even though it seems a lot like an episode of a show like the brady bunch or a nickelodeon sitcom sure its predictable and you know that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn his plot and be hurt and he will eventually realize that he actually does care for her and by the end of the film all will be forgiven and theyll be a real couple but given good acting and competent direction this could be worth seeing for his teen fans as predictable isnt always bad and as it turned out this isnt exactly where the plot wentbut it was awfully closebr br there are a few good things i liked about the film seeing tom bosley and stella stevens playing janes grandparents was very nicetheir role was quite sweet and it was good seeing them again also 1970s made for tv movie star andrew stevens appeared in the filmit was nice to see him againthough part of me hated him as he looks so great after all these years and i look ever bit of my 45 years he did a fine job and it was nice seeing him in the same film as his mother stellabr br as for carter with his many prior experiences on tv he was not surprisingly pretty good while his relationship with jane didnt seem very believable he and ms austin gave it their best the film wasnt great but they did try and i think most of the problems with the film were in the writingwith a better and less formulaic plot it could have worked much better plus the whole testophobia angle seemed pretty contrivedand rather insignificant who cares if a megamillionaire star gets anxious taking tests in school overall not a rotten film as the current rating would imply though there isnt much here to attract a wide audience people who grew up loving carter probably will enjoy the film older folks will probably care less as well as really young people who probably havent heard of him for them there is no nostalgia value in the filmbr br my favorite part of the filmleif garrett giving aaron advice i felt like screaming dont listen but didnt
