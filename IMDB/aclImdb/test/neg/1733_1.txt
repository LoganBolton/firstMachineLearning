honestly the only reason i picked up this movie from blockbuster was because aaron carter was in it okay first things first do you notice how ugly aaron carter has become i mean he used to be so cute but nowwith that lanky body and blotchy skin  ew i think he should stick with singing and the directors of the movie couldve found a much betterlooking guy who could lipsync no offense though i thought this teen movie was majorly lame  and this is coming from me being a teen myself the mean girls in there are ohso predictable the acting is so amateurish it makes you cringe at times especially from aaron and overall i just didnt enjoy it although i give out points for the storyline  that was alright but not at all realistic anyway stay away from this movie by all means you can unless you happen to have wads of cash on hand and have absolutely nothing better to do with 94 minutes of your time its not worth the 650br br ps this review of mine may not be applicable to younger kids under the age of 13
