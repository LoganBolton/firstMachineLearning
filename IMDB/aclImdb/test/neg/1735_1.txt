what really stood out to me about this movie was how little the plot made sense so many characters were randomly introduced it was like how i imagine tommy wiseaus the room would be reenvisioned for the disney channel set we had the wise elderly couple who kept on hanging out where jane worked telling the same story about how soda brought them together or janes momstepmomrandom crying woman who would all show up at random timesbr br aaron carters acting is definitely the highlight of this film i actually looked forward to every scene he appeared in the editing is painfully bad with scene cuts that make no sense the jane character is really irritating mooning about and moping about jd mcqueen the scenes with the music awards are more depressing than anything else and the ending of this movie is surreal
