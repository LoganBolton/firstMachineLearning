this movie started out as a quite decentlooking film but it never really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow it didnt manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its not scary at all its supposed to be a horror movie but there wasnt a single scene that was close to frightening or even excitingbr br to be frank the actors werent all that great either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your daysbr br overall a watchable movie but it doesnt add anything and once youve finished watching it it wont last long until its already forgottenbr br the reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores but i disagree and instead i would grade it 4 out of 10 if you still want some japanese horror i would suggest you watch juon insteadbr br
