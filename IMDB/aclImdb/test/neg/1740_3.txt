this feeble attempt at veering your typically bland japanese horror movie more towards a creepy cult hit did not have the ammunition needed to keep the viewer involved throughout translated to vortex uzumaki is about just that an irrational and overabundant tribute to the strange downward spiral into nothingness that has seemingly captivated a whole small town into dementia obsessed lunatics while this certainly makes for a pleasurable bmovie on the surface the traditionally tiresome acting direction and script will have all but asian horror buffs shaking their heads in dismay what could have roughly translated into japanese equivalent of an early david lynch piece instead wares out its spiraled gimmickry before it even has a chance to explain itself which of course it does not aside from a few clever techniques employed the movie rarely connects the dizzying thematics with the dull script ultimately coming across as a cheap exploitation into the cult genre substituting hollow imagery for genuine substance when the movie had ended there was hardly anything that was gained from any of the interactions save a tiny few scenes or images that rose above the one note film i do applaud the makers for at least trying to take the genre into more supernatural metaphysical realms and understand the rough losses lostintranslation but with zero substance to back any of its freakishness up this will likely be relegated to obscure fanboys bongridden basements
