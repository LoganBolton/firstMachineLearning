uzumaki which translates into spirals arriving within this new wave of asian horror films following such hits like ringu juon and the eye two of them with remakes and much more coming like dark water and tale of two sisters falls short of the spooky supernatural thriller element so characteristic of the other movies the only thing that remains is weirdness and not in a tim burton or david lynch kind of way but in a irrelevant and dull way br br its start with a girl some other kid with a crush on her her best friend and his dad whos obsessed with uzumakis everything that happens concerns uzumakis people die and you see uzumakis so okay itll go along with it im kinda amuse by spirals myself characters dont seem to go anywhere but ill play along we find out the town is cursed by uzumakis people start screaming at uzumakis and the point is uzumakis are everywhere the movie is a disaster it doesnt know where to go except to show you the power of uzumakis there are some cool concepts like when the mother cuts her fingers because she sees uzumakis on her fingerprints but then theres another scene where she hears her husband from beyond the grave tell her that she also has uzumakis in her ear the way they handled that scene was just laughable not even cheesy fun there are also some a little bit of cool visuals like the collection the father has of uzumakis and the girl with the uzumakis hair yep uzumakis hair its out of context though its seems like it was taken out of a fruit snack commercial where if you eat an uzumakis fruits snack its taste is so incredible your hair turns into uzumakis now if this wasnt bad enough suddenly out of nowhere there are snail men or mansnails whatever and you know why right because in their shells they have uuuuzuuuumaaakiiiis that only left time enough for a crappy anticlimatic ending and by that time i was sick of friggin uzumakis uzumaki here uzumaki there sure look around you how many uzumakis can you find if you want to see a movie about spirals go see pi 31416 now there youll find some pretty cool uzumaki concepts in between the meaning of life and dark city has also a little bit of a spiraling thing in therebr br this movie could have worked as a music video it has already garnered a cult following and thats why i was compelled to see it but after doing so im not sure why people think its great i was truly disappointed
