i recently waisted 8 Â€ by going and see this movie in the cinema it was a waste of time and the only feeling you get going out of the theater is a slightly nauseous of all the disgusting social pornography br br it could have been interesting if it had a quite absurd twist but it hadnt so it was just plain awful with maybe one or two scenes which could have been taken out and made to very nice short moviesbr br another thing i thought about is the way the director uses all the finish stereotypes as characters it is quite extraordinary how you as a finish director can make a movie with the worst stereotypes of your own nationality it was sad to sit and and hear the audience sitting and laughing at things that they thought was typical finish but in general just is making fun of people
