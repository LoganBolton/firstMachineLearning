if this is whats best in the finnish cinema at the moment id say those big tax euros spent at supporting culture have gone to waste here in a horrible way paha maa is the worst kind of example of trying to make a finnish european film for big audiences im sure they wanted it to be all stateoftheart smart and touching at the same time the result is crapbr br to make it short  the story is pretentious naïve and not credible the same goes for the characters i can imagine them brainstorming about making a film where everything would like turn to t and people would be hurt and feel you know really bad inside because finnish people are so notoriously depressed too and their selfesteem is so bad which brings us to the fact thatbr br  the film is loaded with clichés mostly about the finnish mentality the way the it deals with peoples problems and their causes could be straight out of a regular womens magazine or a cheap bullpsychologyselfhelp book we feel so bad inside im sure they watched some kaurismäki too to find out what it is about his films that people like misunderstood him completely and came up with a boring depressing story about people going through all kinds of st for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography its a crying shame they threw in tolstoy here its just a sign of trying to be smart and of not beingbr br  i think the worst fault however is the complete lack of vision and depth the film is highly unoriginal it is also frustrating to watch endless sulking and suffering without any real revelation brought to it i can go through this kind of mindck if the film is funny or ends up being an elaborate joke or better yet something sublime like in eg von triers breaking the waves there was none these in paha maa actually though i did start laughing at some point because the turn of events was again just too predictable overthetop and incrediblebr br who does this crap and who likes it i hope theyre pretending
