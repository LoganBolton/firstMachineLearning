although the acting was excellent i spent the whole movie waiting for the nasty boy who caused so much grief to so many of the characters get his final nemesis and instead everyone else suffered except him and he gets the job of the husband whose wifes death he causes by running away from his friends wins the girl he gave an overdose to and tried to rape even his friend gives money to his father but the butterfly effect completely fails to return to its causebr br this is a very dark film as each character that gets affected suffers never ending depression none of the normal avenues for relief seem to be effective and the only thing the authorities seem to do is give out quantities of stress pillsbr br if this is normal behaviour in finland now im never going to go back just in case i am affected by such an amoral butterfly and end up as destroyed as the characters in this film were
