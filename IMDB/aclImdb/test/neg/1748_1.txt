i was so offended by this film that i had to write something about it so please humour mebr br its only redeeming virtue outside of some good acting is that it doesnt go on past 107 minutes even that length is about 30 minutes too longbr br comparisons have been made here to the brilliantly dark the grifters but i cant see it they are two different films altogether the closest swindled comes to an existing film is the sting made in 1973 it borrows sorry steals liberally from this splendid george roy hill entertainment which is exactly what is was i enjoyed it because it didnt pretend to be anything elsebr br there are so many red herrings in swindled that i thought i was in a fish tank its very confusing but thats only one of its many problems the principal one is this if you make a film where everyone lies to everyone else where everyone is conning we have no anchor to ground us the inevitable result is a mishmash of very sloppy seconds from other caper flicksbr br just about everyone in this film is conniving and objectionable surely a basic film 101 class would tell us that the audience has to care for someone we cant care for anyone here theyre all swines it might have worked as a rakish comedy but it plays it straight from beginning to endbr br if you want to see this film read no further big spoiler coming sorry but i have to do itbr br theres so much fake blood and so many fake killings that it doesnt strain credulity  it destroys it the ending is absolutely ridiculous  a murder in a crowded airport that isnt really a murder at all and the murdered guy bloodsoaked simply stands up brushes himself off and walks away fake blood dripping with the booty all while the police and hordes of people are looking on and no one intercedes the director must have a lot of cojones if he thinks were supposed to buy into this noirish bmovies from the 1940s did better br br im a great fan of european flicks but this confirms that schlock doesnt always come from hollywood as far as swindled is concerned my judgment lies with a famous line from the oftmisspoken producer samuel goldwyn who knew all about schlock include me out
