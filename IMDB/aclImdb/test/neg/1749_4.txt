i liked most of this film as other reviews mentioned it has a good cast the plot is interesting enough all in all it is fun to watchbr br but the ending i feel is completely botched it left me bewildered yes you expect people crossing and doublecrossing each other in this sort of movie but quadruplecrossing well if its justified by the plot then why not br br but thats the bad part theres completely no need for it after a certain point its all scheming with completely no meaning here comes the spoiler after the airport scene enrico and his accomplices already have the money i couldnt understand the need for the rest of the scam is it all necessary just to rub federicos nose in the fact that hes been fooled i dont buy itbr br so 6 out of 10 for 34 of the film and 2 out of 10 for the ending
