ive heard people compare this movie to sideways how this comparison was made ill never guess because this movie was in no way comparable to sidewaysbr br these 2 films were as different as star wars and the thornbirds the only thing they had in common at all was they both had wine as a subjectbr br though the interviews in this documentary were semiinteresting they were ruined by the absolute worst camera work everattempted ive never seen worse camera work in my life and im comparing it to home videos accidentally taken by 5 year oldsbr br i give this two stars only for the interesting interviews with french wine types and for showing how pushy and corrupt the american wine companies are arent all companies pushy and corrupt id give it 10 stars yes thats negative 10 for the deplorable terrible horrible awful vertigoinducing 5yearoldcoulddobetter camera mess
