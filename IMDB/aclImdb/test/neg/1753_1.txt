kidman and law lack the chemistry to make this sloppily directed poorly written romancemelodrama work on any level other than grandiosity kidman pouts andbr br pines wistfully for her absent lover law shes just met him when hes whisked off to do battle for the south in the civil war and theyve only exchanged about 5 sentences and one kiss yet theyre totally smitten laws main direction throughout seems to be look vacant and shellshocked but sensitive rene zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script but she plays it way too broad and over the top like she was starring in annie get your gun yeehah boy howdy something about her character felt more like it belonged in a monty python sketch  the one from holy grail where the peasants spend all their time wallowing in muck making mud pies for no reason kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a victorian era novelbr br whenever the action bogs down into total tedium which is frequently all the writers do is shout cue the simon legreetype villain and teague ray winstone comes galloping out of nowhere to do his unspeakably dastardly acts like kill and torture innocent godfearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fastfadingbr br confederacy all other times hes missing in action which is preposterous even in this cornball script there is a plethora of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles these are the characters law meets as he does his johnny appleseed trek from the front lines where he has deserted to the hopefully loving embrace of kidman back in cold mountain ultimately though none of these characters matter law has no time for them or their lives each of these little minimovies has the same tired theme war is goldurn heck and turns otherwise decent christian folk into rabid animalsbr br and the script is far too predictable too heavyhanded moreover the pacing of the story is dreadfully slow you spend the entire movie waiting for romeo and juliets inevitable reunion with kidman wringing her hands and sighing law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets and when it finally comes you just dont care anymore youll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endurebr br i give it one star out of five for the battle scenes there is a potent antiwar message here the incredible lack of concern for the loss of life by the generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff but its only about 15 minutes of this 150minute dog
