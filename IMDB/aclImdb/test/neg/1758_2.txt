her embalmed look was totally inappropriate for the role her face remained too white hair too coifed clothes etc too clean and wellfitting especially her fathers old hat and coat in the scene where inman comes home for any sense of accuracy it would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to remain clean and perfect too but she was the only one who didnt get messy there was never even a smudge on her powdered cheek are we to believe she was the only person in the civil war with a bathtub and a mirror she certainly looked like the only one who used them tweezers too i mean whats with those eyebrows she looked absolutely meanbr br the love story was implausible she only went over to the guy because someone told her that he had said he thought she was cute so she goes over to tease him then flirts with him a couple more times and suddenly this is a love on a par with odysseus and penelope pleasebr br i should have known better than to expect anything better from the man who brought us the english patient my reaction to that one was the same as elaines on seinfeld it sucked
