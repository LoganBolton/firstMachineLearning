i found the first 90 minutes of this film to be very interesting even though a few parts of it were ridiculous ie philip seymour hoffmans character the last 60 minutes were distasteful and i began to lose interest in the film the last hour lasted forever it seemedbr br the movie is nicely acted and i can see why rene zellweger won an academy award since her character was so interesting the movie also is beautifully filmed and the story is an emotional one however i found the message to be a bad one not surprising these days in hollywood in this story inman jude law deserts the confederate army during the civil war his reason his girlfriend misses him and wants him home hes also getting disillusioned with war can you imagine if every soldier who was in a similar boat deserted the army in the two world warsbr br yet in this film of course all of that is perfectly acceptable then again what liberal filmmaker has ever had a nice thing to say about the us military to add to their leftwing slant they portray a vigilantelike posse going after deserters as coldblooded sick killers well in the world of films as we know good is portrayed as bad and bad is goodand only liberals would portray deserters as heroes
