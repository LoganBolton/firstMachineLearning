casper van dien what can i say i enjoy the guy his movies bring a certain flair to them that is actually not brought on by the director or producer but by him recycled plots check ripoffs of better movies check wooden acting check its not that van dien is a bad actor he has been effective in hollywood gloss as starship troopers and sleepy hollow he just really has not been offered a script worthy of his talents and yes he does have acting talent other than being eyecandy this movie offers a slight hint of what van dien can offer but is bogged down by the production of it all the script can be better developed see oliver stones uturn the directing can be better utilized see robert rodriguezs from dusk til dawn the dp couldve made the desert more exotic see russ meyers faster pussycat faster kill this script is weak because this is something we have seen before many other times so the doubletriplecrosses are expected the direction is weak because it is not offering anything new and telegraphs many of the weak script moments the cinematography at times paints a lovely autumn desert flavor to it but at other times it doesnt take advantage of the scorching light and the beginning sequence is horrible in cornflower bluebr br now to the acting van dien shows some grace and charisma to his jake he neither gets too methodical nor too campy in his role a nice balance especially since the rest of the cast seems too distracted as to how they should be acting in this film bad script or bad direction you make your opinion the only other person worth mentioning is bryan browns villain as it provides the only real credit for acting in this film aspiring actors forget trying to learn how to act in green screen try learning how to act in a horrendous script and take notes on bryan brown in this film he adds extra depth to his role and is a nice counter part to van diens character jake always seem to either be one step ahead or control of any situation whether if it is out of his control the femme fatale is weak this is a desert noir after all and is another nail in this films coffin you decide script or direction the rosalita character shouldve been thrusted forward in the movie instead of being pushed into the back ground later on to make room for the real femme fatale so watch the film for van dien and brown and for fun try to skip a rock across the plot holes laced within the film
