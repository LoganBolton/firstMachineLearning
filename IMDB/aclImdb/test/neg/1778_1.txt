at the very beginning the look at a control panel that reads 8 miles of the cost of california and no i didnt misspell that they really did not realize the put of the cost instead of off the coast these people must have been moronsbr br its good if youre into terrible movies but the sheer fact they couldnt catch a simple spelling issue make me believe they really didnt put any effort into creating the movie whatsoever the navy uniforms are not correct at all in any manner whatsoeverbr br wow completely ridiculous but good if you are looking for something insanely stupid to watch how these folks made any money off this is beyond me
