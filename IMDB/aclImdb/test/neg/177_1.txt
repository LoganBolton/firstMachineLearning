the film is annoyingbr br technically there are too many times you see unfocused and very roughly edited scenes one could easily get a cleaner film using a decent amateur camera and 100 video editing software down to earth man on the street doesnt mean sloppy editing unfocused scenes that dont contain important statement should have been deleted the same goes for making sure that the objects headhandothers stay in the frame my 8 years old son knows that by nowbr br the film is way too long the main point anti globalization is understood after 30 minutes why bother with all the rest after the interview with james suckling i pressed the stop button what a waist of timebr br the main theme just doesnt work for me anymore ive seen too many small wineries which produce mediocre commercialized wines and many big wineries that produce great and unique wines the movie identifies the small producers as the ones that are producing wines with more identity or terroir the bigger ones are accused of producing internationalized or commercialized wines the film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones however the movie hasnt proved this claim they look at a couple of sporadic examples tie some of the big producers frescobaldi with fascism and provided interviews with key people well did all the small producers spent wwii in the resistance is it relevant to see that parker has a thing with bulldogs the movie is very manipulative and unconvincing
