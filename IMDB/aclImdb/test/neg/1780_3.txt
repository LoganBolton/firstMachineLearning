some giant scorpions are on a submarine and kill everybody two months later some marines and the scientists in charge of the scorpion project go to the sub to retrieve their cargo after finding 200 dead bodies the marine commander tells the doctor i need to know if theres anything down here that could be a danger to my men uh geeya think she refuses to tell him what is down there citing need to know yup that pretty well sizes it up one of the scientists is apparently some sort of idiot savant  real heavy on the idiot light on the savant hes given the task of fixing the lights he finds the control panel for the lights cuts a wire and shrieks like a banshee then he does it again then he takes a hammer and smashes the control panel to pieces which causes all the lights on the submarine to start workingbr br and so it goes apparently this was made in sweden im not sure if the swedes have a really weird sense of humor or if theyre just really awful movie makers im inclined to think theyre awful movie makers if you guessed that theres a huge explosion at the end of this thing well sorry but thats on a needtoknow basis so i cant tell youbr br if youve absolutely got to see a giant scorpion movie let me suggest tail sting which is a cheesy and fun movie about scorpions on a plane or bugs which is a fairly descent b movie about scorpions in a tunnel look at this movie as an absolute last resort oh its watchable its hard to turn it off just because of the sheer lunacy of it but thats about all its got going for it
