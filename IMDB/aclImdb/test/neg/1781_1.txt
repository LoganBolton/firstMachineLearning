even by the standards of most bmovies this movie is by far the worst ive ever seen the graphics are so poor that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic the ocean water effects are especially laughable including the one scene where they board the minisub and the water looks like its frozen in place the problems with this film are so numerous that ill just stop here with the details needless to say i kid you not when i say that even uwe toilet boll himself could do a better job avoid this movie at all cost there are other b grade movies out there that despite being horrible are at least a good way of passing the time by
