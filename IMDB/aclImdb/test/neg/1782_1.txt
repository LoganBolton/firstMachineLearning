there is so much bad to say about this movie and so little thats goodbr br the plot has enough holes to sink the titanic the characters are completely unbelievable the monsters are so unrealistic and im sick and tired of seeing movies that involve an exhusband and exwife being thrown together in some bizarre emergency  it happens far too often in films and its become another bad clich√©br br i find it hard to believe that anybody would have invested 1 in making this garbage never mind the 100 or so it must have costbr br you could make a better movie with more convincing special effects on your home computer i didnt think movies could get this bad avoid it at all costs  do something thats more fun and enjoyable such as having a tooth pulled or an enema
