if this movie was made two years earlier it could have been a lot better but unfortunately it was made in the decade that had no idea about how a horror movie was supposed to look or act when i first heard about this movie people on imdb were classifying it as the sequel to cheerleader camp oh how wrong they were yes betsy russell was in it but uma thurman sure wasnt id really like to find the person who started that whole sequel rumor im sure a lot of us would though im not gonna give anything away because frankly i dont remember how this movie even ends im just gonna tell you to watch a real camp horror movie the burning starring jason alexander fisher stevens holly hunter  the geek from fast times at ridgemont high a word to the wise  just because a horror movie has the word camp in the title doesnt mean its gonna be worth watching oh and another thing any horror flick made in the early to mid 90s was ever considered even remotely good
