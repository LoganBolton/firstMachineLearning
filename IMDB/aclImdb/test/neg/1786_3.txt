this movie starts out the way every movie should start out with a bunch of hot babes in a dorm walking around in their undies andor topless a couple of them take showers im liking it so far unfortunately we then meet or main characters theyre just not particularly likable usually in these movies the actresses arent really acting they give very natural performances and theyre quite sympathetic fun and likable not here they dont have much of any personality and i didnt care for them muchbr br some of the girls go on a camping trip for school on the way they stop at a backwoods gas station and meet a biker gang the biker gang should really have been left out of the movie  it was cheesy before but now its just plain stupid the head biker looks like a middle aged guy dressed up as john bon jovi for halloween the girls go out to the woods and later the biker gang follows thembr br i dont really know what the heck happens after that theres a bunch of stuff about the world ending because its the end of the millennium then some of the bikers get killed by a mysterious indian dude who keeps disappearing somebody gets eaten by a cheesy lock ness monster thing as hes swimming across a lake some guy in silly makeup is apparently a druid and he needs to sacrifice some of the girls in order to forestall the end of the world or maybe cause the end of the world im afraid i wasnt paying much attention first he dresses the girls up in animal skin lingeriebr br it could have been a really fun cheesy movie but the biker gang kind of ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so scatterbrained that it didnt even live up to my grade z schlock expectations they really should have eliminated half the plot elements and just focused on one or two things instead its all over the place overall if youre looking for late 80 schlock i imagine you could do worse if you tried really hard theres plenty of nudity at the beginning but the characters are kind of crummy and the plot is too nonsensical to be even the least bit satisfying
