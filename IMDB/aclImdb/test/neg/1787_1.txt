this movie is so irredeemably bad nothing about it makes it worth seeing no effects no suspense and poor dialogue poorly delivered oh and neither a camp or any fear does it contain do yourself a favor and go see the original friday the 13th or preferably sleepaway camp but what ever you do do not see this movie br br even michele bauers appearance at the very beginning cant save it usually in these kinds of films you expect violence suspense and a little gore and some ta the violence was poorly executed the suspense was laughable there was no gore and the ta is plentiful in the first 5 minutes then nothing at least one of these things properly done would have at least made it watchable br br to say at least one nice thing about it buck flower is great he seems to be the only one who understands they are making schlock and rightly hams it up if everyone else had fit that tone it would have been campy fun no pun intended
