roegs take on conrads heart of darkness was not quite what i had expected although based on one of historys most studied and interesting texts the film just became sort of dull the story just never manages to grasp the viewer it just comes across as indifferent in a waybr br the traces of the text are easily spotted but still this is not really conrads heart of darkness benedict fitzgeralds who also wrote the passion of the christ script just uses conrad as an inspiration and thus becomes fitzgeralds heart of darkness the film is just not worth it unless you are particularly interested in conrad or perhaps john malkovich
