might end up being the biggest disappointment that i will see in 2009 i seem to be the rare person who disliked parks oldboy but i think that his lady vengeance and sympathy for mr vengeance are among the best films ive seen in the 2000s decade therefore i really was looking forward to see this especially as it got such positive reviews instead i found the film clich√©d and broke little if any new ground to the vampire genre and while i can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this i felt park did this at very inopportune timesbr br others have comparedcontrasted this to let the right one in and i have to say that let the right one in was far superior to this one and was a fresh take on the vampire genre sadly parks take was a tired one
