if youre looking for a movie that puts you to sleep then heart of darkness is the movie for you the book wasnt what i expected to it to be and the movie disappointed me even further the cast list was pitiful and the all around plot was pathetic and was not like the book except for a few scenes i understand that everyone has their own point of view as they read heart of darkness and they create their own movie in their head but they director cuts important scenes and adds pointless ones if there was someone in the movie who was supposed to be of a certain culture they shouldve used an actor that was of that culture there are actors from every where and im sure that they couldve found better ones to fit the roles joseph conrad was a respectable man and created a book that will entertain you if thats what youre looking for but the movie was cheap and pointless and someone who could make the movie as respectable as the book shouldve done it if you want a movie that drags you into darkness then heart of darkness is the movie for you
