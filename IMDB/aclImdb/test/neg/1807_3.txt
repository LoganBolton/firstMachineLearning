heart of darkness movie review could a book that is well known for its eloquent wording and complicated concepts ever be made into a movie good enough to portray the deep meaning in the book so far that goal hasnt been achieved the heart of darkness was attempted to be made into a movie in 1993 but it was a failure in comparison to the bookbr br it is hard enough to make any book into a movie there always is the worry that it wont be as descriptive or have the same meaning so why the novel the heart of darkness is made into a movie i am clueless there is so much description and hidden meaning throughout the entire book when just reading the words plainly i think that a person would think it is pretty boring and wouldnt get the symbolism i think that is what happened in the movie the movie just skimmed the story at the surfacebr br the movie didnt even follow the full storyline of the book major changes were made that i thought made the movie worse for example the manager did not go along on the boat with marlow and the rest of the crew the spy did instead i think that took out some major plots and took out the great deception of the manager in relation to kurtz also kurtz wasnt even on the steamboat when he died which especially made the entire journey even more futile which just got annoying after a while and when marlow was telling kurtzs fiancée about his final moments and words it was no where near as descriptive or important the fiancée didnt even get that upsetbr br as far as the acting went none of the actors did a very good job except for the actor that played mfumu in my opinion kurtz was not very evil and that was kind of an important thing in the book also other characters such as marlow the manager and the fiancé didnt do the characters justice that they deserved from the book their acting wasnt very exciting or memorable at all over all i dont think that this book should have even been attempted to be made into a movie i think it is fine to use some of the themes in a different story line like in apocalypse now but as for following the same exact story line of the book it just does it shame
