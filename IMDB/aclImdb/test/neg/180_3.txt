this film appears to be an expos√© of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry wineries around the world are more and more either joining large conglomerates the american producer mondavi in the case of this film or paying highpriced experts to help them make the perfect wineand as a result wines are becoming very standard and predictable to some this is a good thing especially since few can afford to pay 50 or more for an everyday wine and to others this is horrible as the uniqueness of smaller wineries is disappearing i truly can understand the concerns of both sides and dont think there is a villain or hero in this business sure good and cheaper wine is a nice thing but like whats happened with beers with giants like unibrew and anheiserbusch food mcdonalds shopping european shopping malls are almost indistinguishable from american ones and megastores like walmartasda are taking away much of the uniqueness of the little guys so i definitely was ready and willing to listen to these film makers however with a product that is almost two and a half hours long and a general lack of focus the film simply became too big a chore to watch and i lost interest an 8090 minute focused film would have been much more effectiveespecially since the average viewer is not an oenophile thats the highbrow word for a wine aficionadobr br on the very positive side the film makers are smart not to do much talking at alland simply let those on both sides of the issue do the talking plus the topic is so relevant and timely however despite choosing a good style of documentary making the film simply goes on way way way too long and ended up making a very dull film
