taylor deemer mrs drake english 10 pib b4 31 march 2010 br br a shot in the darkbr br it is difficult to make it through the movie heart of darkness because it is incredibly unexciting the book that this movie is based off of has little action to begin with so the thought of turning it into a movie seems like a totally offhanded idea anyways basically guaranteeing a fail br br most of the book is of the mental travel of a young seaman named marlow on a job through the many darknesses of the congo and people as a wholei feel like the screenwriter failed massively at capturing the essence of marlows travels it totally missed the biggest issue of light versus dark that is the major point in the book and when that doesnt translate to the movie all thats left is 100 minutes of boredom and monotony br br this being the case the question is posed why would anyone make this into a movie an even better question could then be asked who would want to watch it it is utterly a chore to watch had it not contributed to a grade in my english class i would have never even considered watching the movie i would never recommend this movie to anyone heart of darkness is stripped of all its insight and meaning when its taken from the pages of the book the novella is torture to read until the last twenty pages or so but the afterthought is that it is a pretty decent book the movie is like a shot in the dark with no chance in the world of hitting its target br br how can a book thats all about the mental processes and realizations of darkness be portrayed in a physical visual sense i feel like its impossible to accurately show thoughts also i feel like the time difference between the book and the movie creates major points that dont seem to add up at all the novella heart of darkness was published in 1902 while the movie version of heart of darkness is from 1993 the 91 years between the two may be a reason behind the seemingly different terrains the novella seems to have much harsher conditions and the movie does not portray the prehistoric feel of the congo the congo in the movie just seems like another place not the dark inhuman place that the book paints this setting of i feel like this removes another major element that really contributes to the novellabr br with two of the biggest aspects of the storyline missing in the movie the little bit of decency that is in the book heart of darkness is gone when the controversy of light versus dark is the biggest theme not including it in the movie makes it seem like the entire movie will be incredibly pointlessand it is its dull unexciting and a major waste of time theres no reason to watch it the book is stripped of any significance it has if its necessary for some reason read the book avoid the movie at all costs br br cast and credits marlow tim roth kurtz john malkovich the russianmorten faldaas the intended phoebe nichollsbr br directed by nicolas roeg written by benedict fitzgerald based on the novella by joseph conrad running time 100 minutes rated pg 13 some sexuality and language
