this is the first and as far as i can tell the only completed production of heart of darkness ever released prior to starting on citizen kane orson welles shot some test footage for a version of heart of darkness that was to be filmed entirely in what would now be called pov where we would see everything from the point of view of the main character charlie marlow he would be seen only fleetingly in mirrors windows water etc the film was never made the pov technique was used not too successfully in 1947 in the lady in the lake with robert montgomery starring as philip marlowe presumably the coincidence of the two marlowe characters is just that of course francis coppolas apocalypse now was based on heart of darknessbr br the short novel heart of darkness by the polishborn british writer joseph conrad first serialized in a british literary magazine in 1899 features one of his favorite alter egos ship captain charlie marlow who also narrates the short story youth and indirectly tells the story of lord jim marlow temporarily out of work decides to take a job captaining a river boat for a belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of king leopold iis personal fiefdom the cruelly misnamed congo free state marlow travels from london to brussels signs on with the company and is told that his mission is to take a boat up the congo river to a far inland station headed by one of the companys most productive agents in the colony a german named kurtz shipments of ivory latex for the production of rubber and other products from kurtzs station have ceased and no word has come downriver from kurtz for some time there are rumors that he has gone native marlow is to investigate take any necessary action and make a report on his return he takes passage down the west african coast to the mouth of the congo is delayed for weeks while he is forced to repair his boat at the company station on the coast and finally sets out upriver to find kurtzs station the river the heat the vegetation the wildlife the insects the people all take their toll on his endurance his imagination and his mental resources he finds kurtz ill halfmad and close to death the final encounter and the death of kurtz are almost an anticlimax especially since conrad is so obscure about what actually happens that we are left to puzzle it out for ourselves this is a novel where you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the ending but nevertheless treasuring the story for its amazing atmosphericsbr br this heart of darkness was filmed with guyana in central america standing in for west africa it is best where the novel is at its greatest disadvantage actually showing us first world urbanites what a boat trip up a tropical river would look like but the rest of the film was forgettable tim roth does his best as marlow but so much about the plot characterizations and character relationships has been altered beyond recognition that you wonder why they bothered if the aim was to make conrads story for the screen why didnt they leave it alone its unreasonable to expect that no compromises will be made when a book is made into a movie but so many changes were made that to me had no cinematic justification that you wonder whether we are simply dealing with incompetent screenwriters and cinematographers most disappointing of all was john malkovich as kurtz he was completely miscast and simply flubs the role everything about him is wrong his looks his acting style his voice his accent everything a vastly better choice would have been someone like bruno ganz unlike malkovich an actual german like the characterbr br this is a very disappointing production and i would recommend it only after youve read the book if you want to depend on more than your imagination to get a visual picture of a boat trip up the congo river circa 1900
