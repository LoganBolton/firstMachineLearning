i felt last nights episode was slow and kinda of boring at times i honestly dont think it has to do anything with the writing because i know the story was well staged and tried to keep things in place i thought it wasnt that bad but overall i didnt enjoy it the most blame has to do with the director of that episode stephen williams i always hated stephen williamss directing if jack bender continues with this episode from the season premiere he would have kept it in a good pace and keep things float to keep things interesting im glad jack bender is directing next weeks episode and itll be much better and im glad he got first syaid episode to direct and im curious what he will pull off this time since stephen williams had directed too many syaid episodes beforebr br i always keep thinking that stephen williams needs to be thrown off from the show he doesnt even do anything interesting with the showbr br why does the opening have to be done with a target thing while being in the helicopter it was so boring bad perspective of camera work too
