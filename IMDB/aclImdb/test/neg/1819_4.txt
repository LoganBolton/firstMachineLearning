this film would like to be the kind of shocking cerebral and intense movie that many others in its genre have successfully been but its not it is at best confusing and absurd when the twists and turns finally revealed themselves rather than saying ahh i get it i muttered something along the lines of okaywhatever in my opinion when a movie reveals a major plot twist it shouldnt have to employ a flashback sequence to prove that it did give some hints that would enable the viewer to discern the truth himself but this movie does have a flashback and heres the kicker it flashes back on scenes that werent even in the moviebr br the characters were stereotypical unsympathetic and wholly ridiculous i feel that the steamy love scenes between the romantic leads were the most untitillating and unsexy that ive ever scene in a movie that wasnt porn it seems that the director was going for shocking and kinky with the love scenes but they were really just plain sillybr br and dont even get me started on the crappy accents and secondrate sets i guess the movie was set in new orleans but aside from the afore mentioned accents and a couple bland city shots the movie could have been in anytown usabr br my recommendation dont bother
