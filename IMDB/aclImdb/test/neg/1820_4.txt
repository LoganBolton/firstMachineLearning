its not easy to find judas kiss on vhs its not available on dvd but i wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my alan rickman movie collectionbr br i cant understand how the talented mr rickman gets into these mediocre films judas kiss boasts several wonderful actors an interesting plot and intriguing twists but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the characters actions why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses why did he mistrust the detective he replaced there were times when i honestly couldnt tell if the director meant judas kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof why else would he toss in a toplessalienlesbian porno scene in the first two minutes that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby did he purposely instruct his two distinguished english actors alan rickman and emma thompson to use such awful new orleans accents as an alan freak i confess that i still thought mr rickman was sexy in a rumpled weary takehimhomeandtuckhimin sort of waybr br judas kiss isnt a great movie but it does have some intriguing moments but i dont recommend it unless youre trying to immerse yourself in alan rickman
