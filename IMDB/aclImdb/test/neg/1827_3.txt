this is a pretty lousy pictureit offers nothing unique or original or even interestingbr br a medical student discovers that a secret society at her university is engaged in macabre medical experimentsand of course she becomes involved in solving the weird deaths at the schoolthis movie started out promising with a few cool special effects in which a guy is partially dissected while alive and tries to get away after he wakes up but then even that fizzles and the rest of the special effects are pretty routine plastic models of the human body and that unreal looking blood that these second rate horror movies always seem to havebr br and as if the routine plot and the lousy acting wasnt enough this movie had subtitles that many times didnt even match the dubbed english that you hear being spoken and then add that to the mouth movement not matching the dubbing well lets just say trying to coordinate all that in your head isnt worth it for this mediocre moviebr br i was at least counting on some skin in this movie and except for a bit during the opening credits this movie didnt deliver on that eitherbr br this is a boring routine run of the mill horrorgore movieshort on horror and goreskip this movie unless ernest goes to camp is the only rental left
