anatomie isnt very unique in horror genre in fact it isnt even scary at all it reminds me of its american cousins horror slashers its just a copy of any other horror slasher and as a german movie its just too american with nothing to add to itbr br actually anatomie is too predictable and boring its plot is not intact and consistent its got stupid scenes to it which dont even fit into a horror movie genre amusing sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear why do they need to have it all in just one movie they should have made a cheap german adult movie insteadbr br i cant recommend this movie to anyone because its just too boring
