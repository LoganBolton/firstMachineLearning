1st watched 6242007  4 out of 10dirstefan rujowitzky ok thriller but a little too predictable this story is based in germany which is also where the movie is made it is about a young medical student who gets a shot to go to a premiere school in heidelberg and arrives seeing some strange things occurring someone she met on the train there and saved shows up on the schools experimentation table and shes suspecting foul play right away she does some investigation and the disappearance of her friend leads her to a secret society called aaaand no its not alcoholics anonymous that has something to do with the antihippocratic oath and is used to perform experimentations on live people that doctors wouldnt normally be able to do she finds out her grandfatherwho was a dean at the school was a big part of establishing it and its pretty readily filled by members of the school its an interesting story but the problem with this movie is how quickly the audience is told whats going on and then its kind of a horror movie with the heroine fighting off the bad boy of the group thats taking things to the next psychotic level although this movie was made in europe it plays to a young american audience with its focus on gore sex and the horror film premisewhich is really its big downfall and explains why it probably made good money and spawned a sequel but doesnt necessarily make for a good movie
