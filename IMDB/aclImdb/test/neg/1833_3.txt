okay i had reasonably high expectations for this the controversial subject matter was a good concept as a horror fan i admit i was fascinated and very excited about thisbr br it turns out they had a great idea but it was terribly executed lets see this movie seems to run in 3 modes happy sex and dark the problem is that the movie never decides what it wants to be the happy parts i believe were meant to contrast with the dark parts but it doesnt work the soundtrack is one of the reasonsbr br the movie transitions between these 3 modes very badly i cant even begin to say how much the directing and editing suck theres sex in the most unappealing and unerotic way im not complaining but even for horror standards they were unnecessary and fillerbr br the characters are all unlikeable with the exception of paula potente her friend from munich is a slut and possibly one of the most annoying characters in movies ive come across recentlybr br theres a bit of plot which i wont go into detail its not stupid and in more talented hands would make a good movie theres even a nice twist and a cool conspiracy going on dont try to understand everything because there are giant plot holes herebr br its all so shoddily done that you dont care for the victims the perpetrators anyone and to think this could have been great i can say one good thing about it which is the movie shed some light on todays unethical medical procedures with genetics and controversial sciences advancing this could have been a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these questions but you wont find that here just a series of scenes loosely pasted together with people and things that you dont care aboutbr br skip this and go watch flatliners instead youre welcomebr br 310
