i was looking forward to this movie as everyone was talking about it as being a good horror movie and finally an european one so maybe my expectations were to highbr br it begins with a good quiet horrorshock sequence but it lets you down right away in the following scenes where the plot begin being introduced as the acting and the motivationlife of the characters reveals itself no better than any made for tv drama it keeps that way right into the endbr br about the horror part of the movie it is certainly a good idea and a different one but all the scenes are of the seen it before kindbr br overall my idea of this movie was that it had a good concept which was inserted into a mediocre story bad acting and less than tolerable plot holesbr br
