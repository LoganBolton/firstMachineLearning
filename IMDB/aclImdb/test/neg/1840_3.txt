doll master is an example of a lousy horror film fallen somewhere in the space with its two not so well established genres a horror film and an emotional drama film seems like the doll master tries very hard to be a very scary horror film but it fails the noise of the dolls while moving is like taken from the croak of kayako in juon and the crawls are like sadako esquire the killing dolls will remember you a cute version of chucky but compared to childs play this film is more superb but the story seems a nothing the brilliant camera shots and the brilliance of acting was taken away cause of the plotbr br don watch this if you are expecting great shocks
