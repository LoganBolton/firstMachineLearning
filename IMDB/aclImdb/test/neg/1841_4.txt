have to disagree with people saying that this is a lousy horror film with good acting and camerawork  id say its an okay horror flick ruined by shockingly abysmal acting and poor camerawork  watch juon  the grudge instead of wasting your time with this garbage the principal idea behind the film is rather an original one considering the abundance of killerdollbased scarefests which have been foist upon us over the years unfortunately the story is handled with all the subtlety of the latest michael bay actioner with a cast of characters which are uniformly unlikable and played with precisionperfect dreadfulness by actors presumably sifted from daytime korean soap operas it isnt scary and only succeeds in dampening your expectations of the next korean horror movie to comeacalling oh well
