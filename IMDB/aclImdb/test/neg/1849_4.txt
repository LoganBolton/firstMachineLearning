inferno starts off with a fairly impressive for a tvm starscape effect  were also introduced to a scientist whos called heller  dont you get it  heller  heller  inferno  so i guess someone on the production had some intelligence  however it does become more and more obvious as the tvm progresses that intelligence has been discarded throughout the storyline in order to appeal to an american tvm audience br br the story itself is overwhelmed by subplots featuring umpteen stock tvm characters like the tough liberal schoolteacher whos trying to save a home boy from a life of crime  the doctor whos lost his medical licence etc  in fact the story concentrates far more on these characters than the approaching disaster that all the potential tension and drama the scenario might have had soon goes up in a puff of smoke  and being a tvm we just know that there wont be a downbeat ending br br there is an onscreen problem i noticed and that is everytime theres an explosion theres a massive fireball which looks ridiculous not to mention physically impossible  look at the scene where the national guard are in a fight with a gang  a soldier fires a grenade into a tower block and the whole building explodes in a fire ball  what a small greanade containing no more than a few ounces of high explosive can do that  no it cant  theres also another scene of army engineers blowing up a dam with plastic explosive and the same fireball effect is seen  can directors please note that high explosive is not the same as napalm br br having said that i did find inferno highly watchable for a tvm and at no time did i find myself wanting to turn it off  it did have some potential and let me repeat the special effects are fairly good considering the budget and its not as bad a tvm as some people are making out
