this movie is not at all like city of god you might get the same feeling but it isnt theres no intense shooting nor intense drug scenes you get the idea if you ask me i think this film was a waste of time there are a lot of other films which gives 100 times better meaning and teaching than wooden camera yes i might be the only one to give a negative comment for this film but its only in my opinion its one of those films where i can get the feeling that ill be blown away but when the credits start to role my friends and i all gave mutual looks and we all laughed at how ridiculous this movie was so to conclude this matter i advise not to watch itbr br personal note  making africans talk english was a big mistake in city of god they used their native language which gave the film much more power and reality
