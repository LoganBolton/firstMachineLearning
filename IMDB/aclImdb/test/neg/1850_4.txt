mario racocevic from europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the major points to the filmyet again another difficult film to purchase in the uki had to go through midnight video who have a swedish branchi went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title at only skr30 a titlebr br this film goes under many akas depending on when and where it is marketedi had previously purchased the bloodsucker leads the dance which you will find if you search on imdb under people and input krista nellthe actor who plays the count on his private island in the latter film had his words dubbed from italian into english by an actor with an unmistakably mournful and rather tired sounding voicei smiled when i heard this same voice dubbing on the english soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the copse in the subject filmmy choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious krista nellbr br there are quite a few rather inconsequential sub plots in the movie involving blackmailextortion sleazy affairs with girlfriends mothers a motor cycle chase resulting in a gangland hit a gangrape by a clients motorcycle friends sleazy photography cross dressing by transvestites etc which give a flavour to this film summarised in a word  sleaze but artistic sleazethe aforementioned contributor liked this film but the lowly rating suggests other imdb fans did not albeit without explaining their wheres and whyforespersonally i thought there were too many subplots and not enough put into the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen charactersalso a professional film editor was sorely needed as some of the scenes appeared to last far too long having made their point so that the film appeared to drag in places eg the scene of the dancing transvestitekrista nell appears in one fruity scene with a client but this too is but a vignette and i was left wanting more from her the director and the screenplaybr br i love the political incorrectness shown in older films this is 30 years from its making eg smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the officei would suggest 410 as a more realistic rating and i have awarded it as such
