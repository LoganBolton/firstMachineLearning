we saw this in a bargain basket at the local asda £150 for the dvd reading all the hype plastered all over the cover saying how hillarious it is and it also had a really good established cast we thought this must a great filmbr br so we bought took it home shoved it in the dvd player sat back and waited for the funnies to beginand waitedand waitedand waited a bit morebr br some 90 minutes later although it felt more like 3 hours the credits rolled and that was the end of thatbr br what a letdown  even paying £150 seemed a con god knows what caine richardson and gambon were thinking when they said yes to this tosh and as for moran well much as i enjoyed black books shaun of the dead and his comedy tours i felt he was out of his depth in this film he tried too hard playing for laughs probably thinking that if retaining the characteristics from his black books character would work herebr br sadly it backfired the gags fell flat after awhile and then he became just an irritation which is a shame because i believe given the right part he could be a very good filmcharacter actorbr br anyway to sum up the actors in the actors failed to act br br
