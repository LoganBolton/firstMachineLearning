jerry angell owner of zombiehorrors finest mullet returns for more undead action in the sequel to director todd sheets atrocious homemade gorefest zombie bloodbath this time around jerry plays a sleazy lowlife thug who along with his equally despicable partnerincrime some escaped convicts several teenagers and a bunch of screaming girls comes facetoface with a horde of shambling flesheating corpsesbr br obviously having learnt zilch about improving his craft in the two years since zombie bloodbath sheets delivers another shoddy mess of a film that somehow manages to be even worse than the originala feat that i thought was almost impossible to achieve the acting is uniformly lousy the effects amateurish and cheap most of the gore appears to be nothing more than a selection of offcuts offal and blood from the local butchers shop the story incomprehensible as far as i could fathom the zombies rise from the dead because a scarecrow commands them to and the direction frustratingly laden with cheap looking video effects and completely meaningless cuts to blackandwhitebr br and as if that wasnt enough to convince you of this films complete lack of redeeming features the simply mindbogglingly moronic ending should do the trick the few remaining survivors stumble upon an abandoned truck that conveniently happens to have a stash of flesheating bacteria laying on its passenger seatjust the thing for dissolving the undead but strangely enough not at all detrimental to the living
