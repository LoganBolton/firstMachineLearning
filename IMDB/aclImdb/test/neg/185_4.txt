dont get me wrong i really love the arenamartial arts genre and i get more and more surprised over how many films like this there are out there this one is one of those and its not even close to be one of the best with mathias hues in it i thought it would be good he cant save this movie though and to be honest he wasnt very good either just dont pay attention to what other people say the fighting scenes in this movie are not good at all i really know what im talking about since i have seen so many movies like this there are also a bunch of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot whatsoever i guess they added these only to make the movie last a little bit longer in addition to manifest the bad guy asuuuuuuhbad like we didnt know that already
