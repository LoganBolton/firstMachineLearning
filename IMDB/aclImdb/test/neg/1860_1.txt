wow this movie is almost too bad for words obviously the writers wanted to somehow link this to the ghoulies franchise so they got pete liapis from the first one to reprise his role as jonathanonly now hes a cop and has no similar character traits as he did in the first one the ghoulies in this one arent the ghoulies from the last ones the cheap looking puppets have been replaced with even cheaper looking costumed little people instead of being any main antagonist or being evil they are more like the comic relief characters that appeared out of nowhere for no reasonbr br when watching this film for the first time it felt like id seen it before why was this because everything in this was stolen from another movie all the cheesy cop lines and action scenes were from lethal weapon the ghoulies were pretty much like bugs bunny and daffy duck except they werent amusing at all even scenes from the original ghoulies film were sprinkled throughout this flickbr br i think the target audience was supposed to be adults but the mixture of black magic cartoon slapstick cop drama and bad acting doesnt work at all i hope they dont make a ghoulies v because i dont want a movie studio to lose their moneybr br my rating bomb 78 mins r for violence
