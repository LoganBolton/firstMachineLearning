ghoulies iv starts in a museum storage facility where pvc  leather clad blonde alexandra stacie randall is looking for a ancient jewel after offing various guards she summon the demon faust who she worships  wants to have sex with unfortunately she lost the jewel so hes not very happy  orders her to get the last remaining one which belongs to jonathan graves returning from the original ghoulies 1985 peter liapis who is experienced in demonic possession  stuff like that after the events of the original ghoulies alexandra sets about finding the jewel so she can bring faust to earth permanently from the other side to well i dont know actually erm thats about it reallybr br directed by jim wynorski whose very name name sends shivers down my spine when its attached to a film im about to waste 90 minutes of my life on goulies iv is as i expected complete total  utter crap from start to finish  its as simple  straight forward as that the ahem script  cough by mark sevi has virtually nothing in common with the other ghoulies film except in its title  that they managed to convince liapis to reprise his role which also has the added bonus of big able to use footage from the original even though it has no relevance whatsoever the story is almost none existent the whole film is a real chore to watch its incredibly boring  moronic its slow its predictable its squeaky clean as far as blood or gore goes  it has two comic relief goblins whom i assume are supposed to fill the ghoulies quota even though they look nothing like they did in the previous films  are in fact just embarrassing to watch in fact i think they were practising to be ventriloquists during most of the film as when they speak their mouths dont move you know i dont want to talk or think about ghoulies iv anymore so please believe me when i say this is one huge piece of crap of elephant sized proportions dont waste either your time or moneybr br dirctor wynorski turns in a throughly rotten film on just about every level the special effects are terrible as is the whole film apparently ghoulies iv is meant to be some sort of horror comedy but it misses both targets by the proverbial mile  it is neither funny nor scary the best thing about this film is actress randall in her pvc  leather outfit running around trying to find the jewel  thats hardly worth sitting through this rubbish to see theres a half decent runaway car scene with a few crashes but it looks like it was edited in from a completely different film  given wynorskis track record im sure it was forget about any gore as there isnt anybr br technically ghoulies iv sucks its obvious it had  low budget but that simply isnt an excuse for it to be this bad is it liapis is back in the cast although he probably wishes hed stayed away pvc clad babe randall is easily the best thing about this film which says a lotbr br ghoulies iv is crap theres nothing else to say really i honestly cant see anyone who enjoy films getting anything out of this i just cant i cant believe that im going to recommend the original ghoulies over anything but its going to happen now because even though thats crap as well its a hell of a lot better than ghoulies iv one to avoid folks  you can thank me later the things i sit through so you dont have to honestly
