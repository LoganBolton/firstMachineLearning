i dont know why imdb lists all the ghoulies films as theatrical releases they were all straight to video films same with the puppet master series why hasnt anyone noticed this yet right somehow youve stumbled across ghoulies iv probably raiding through an old abandoned video rental store from 1993 you looked in the discount section and found thislook at the back and front covers what do you expect the shawshank redemption there is no need to review this film so critically it is the fourth ghoulies film i bought it on dvd for 650 because it was 650 i knew it wasnt kubrick material and i was right an unremastered dvd with no extras not even a trailer boasts an uncaredfor filmbr br it actually contains the star of the first ghoulies film peter liapis who really didnt get many big roles apart from those two films and i dont see why hes not too bad an actor and is pretty fun but i guess if youre gonna take a lead role in the ghoulies films scorsese and tarantino will lose interest also present is his idiot sidekick bobby di cocco who despite having a very small resemblance to al pacino very small retains none of his acting ability a complete idiot whos just awkward to watch then theres stacie randall  obviously a porn star i dont need to look that up she does look quite sexy though her costume her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility which is no easy task for such a filmbr br then there is the ghoulies themselves who also manage to let us down ghoulies iii made them start talking mistake no 1 but ghoulies iv takes it a step further instead of being puppets this time the ghoulies are in fact kids in costumes the filmmakers decided to run that extra mile to insult the films viewers also theres only two of them and theyre not the main highlight of the film as they dont appear in a lot of it however at times they are mildly amusing and theyre not evil this time eitherbr br this really is hilariously bad stuff its amazing that i was actually able to enjoy it i dunno why some of the black humour is actually funny though the script is mostly effortless imagine satans only threat to you being that he will kill you slowlypainfullybr br but at least full moon had no involvement this time did they yeah a very bad and cheaply made film with 0 production value but not so bad as to be in the ranks of puppet master 12 lawnmower man 2 surviving christmas or even ghoulies iii
