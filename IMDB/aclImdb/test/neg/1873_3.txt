this is not a good film by an standards it is very poorly written and the acting is just a little above par some performances are well below par but swayze and grey do a very good job with little to work withbr br what was goodbr br the dance sequences were choreographed very well and as stated above swayze and grey were high pointsbr br what was badbr br the script the bad guys were simply too evil to be believable the best villains are the ones who arent so obviously evil these guys the owners nephew the waiter who impregnates the girl do and say nothing that would leave me to believe they could be real people perhaps there are guys like them but i sure dont want to see a movie about itbr br another scene the first where grey and swayze meet when the employees at the resort are dancing swayze and grey dance together and seem to enjoy themselves the next time they meet swayze is hostile towards her why what happened in between to make him dislike her so when they danced well togetherbr br and some of those lines i mean come on i cringed at the end when swayze muttered the line nobody puts baby in the corner how did he ever do that with a straight facebr br another thing wrong the setting of the 1960s everyone looked and dressed like the 1980s who was in charge of the costumes and hairstylesbr br the music original music for the film was laughable with the exception of i had the time of my life which was a good songbr br not the worst film ive ever seen but definitely the most overrated
