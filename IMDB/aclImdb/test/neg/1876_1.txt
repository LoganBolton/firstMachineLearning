this might be for those who have been to summer camps but it sure isnt an entertaining camp i went to one before but it didnt make me scream up and down for joy instead it made my head hurtbr br the first thing you notice is that bill murray actually had some hair in the 70s yeah and he also didnt mind running some but to get him to run a lot you would need to give him a woman to chase afterbr br its not that some of the stunts cant be funny for example the running joke with one of the councilors who is always waking up somewhere else due to the movement of his bed instead its that the jokes and stunts were poorly setup and executed it just failed to be funnybr br to somebody who loves comedy this is a pain others are glued to it for life i wish it was more like leonard part 6 but it doesnt come close f
