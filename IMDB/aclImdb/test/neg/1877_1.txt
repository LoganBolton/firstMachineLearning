i live in mexico city so i have to suffer throug the trailers for every piece of trash that comes out from all these stupid mexican filmmakers you want to admire a mexican guy for making great films take a look at something by guillermo del toro specially the devils backbone or maybe alfonso cuar√≥n though i really dont like his films but i respect thembr br mexican filmmakers often produce some of the most terrible utter trash ever por la libre el segundo aire american visa but this is one of the lowest points in mexican films ever if you respect your brain please avoid this piece of  at all costs it would be more intelligent to watch some video of a wedding or to watch britneys reality show thats got more iq than everyone in this film
