i have seen tons of trash in every language about every topic and of every trend of filmmaking from every period every director and any kind of budget available that said i really have to declarebr br this is one of the three worst movies i have ever seenbr br its painfully bad its pompous its grim its incomprehensible its annoying its a really bad mess it is a piece of youknowwhatbr br and whats more important it lacks a point and even if it had one the characters are so unreal and annoying that its impossible to overlook the lack of cohesion of the whole thingbr br its just weird for the sake of being weirdbr br i actually felt sick watching this trash the theater where i saw it lincoln center in new york was full when it started by the end of it half of the audience had walked out there was a qa programmed at the end but nobody stayed with the exception of about two sickos everybody else ran for the door myself included br br save 2 hours of your life its probably one of the worst ever donebr br if there is a movie theater in hell this movie will be playing 247 for eternity
