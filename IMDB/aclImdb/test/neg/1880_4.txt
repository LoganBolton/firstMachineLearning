apart from the da james eckhouse and a brief appearing woman who is convincingly sympathetic to ellen guldens renee zellwegerplight ellen herself is the only convincing characterand likable character in the movie she is the one not her dying mother who should be and isthe one true thing its not only in the role in zellwegers acting but also in the plot itself until the plot turns against itselfand makes the mother the one true thing in the eyes of her weak willed shallow husband who can do nothing right for his wife or daughter the daughter perceives what the viewer perceives but such intelligent perceptions must give way to the shallow sentiment of the husband who is blanked out on both the realities of his wife and daughter br br to boot the one powerful scene in this whole movie when ellen confronts her fathers cruelty is given the lie at the end ellen is just another young strong woman who must be tamed into conformity by a crybaby father a very flawed movieso flawed as to be called a bore and not worth the time
