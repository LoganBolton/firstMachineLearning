what really amazed me about this film was that it ringed so false first of all who in the late 80s when the film takes placelived like this family a college professor wouldnt make enough money to support the lifestyle i saw on the film hence he and his stay home wife would be plagued by financial woes especially when she gets cancer second streep is my age and most women particularly in her class educated white well off experienced the feminist movement yet this woman seems oblivious to her anachronistic behavior i actually felt that she was a very controlling woman who kept her husband an emotional child by taking care of his every needbr br the fact that so many people were moved by the film is amazing i have admired carl franklins films in the past and i actually like meryl streep but gad what a manipulative and lying film this is
