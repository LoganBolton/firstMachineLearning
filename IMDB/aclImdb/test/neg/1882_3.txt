unlike terms of endearment and steel magnolias i left the movie theater feeling very disappointed i started to get into the characters and their complex motherdaughter and fatherdaughter relationships at the beginning i even cried but i had no sympathy for the characters with the ending the final act did not seem in line with the mothers character at all so although the acting was pretty good i thought the movie on a whole was disappointing
