although inevitably linked to the 70s decade the concept of exploitationcinema is actually nearly as old as cinema itself moreover universal studios practically invented the term with their long running monster cycles dracula frankenstein the wolf man and the mummy every original classic spawned a couple of sequels at least and after a while they even thought up the idea of making genuine monster stewing house of frankenstein released one year earlier and also directed by erle c kenton was quite a successful effort with interesting ideas and enthusiast performances but house of dracula is a little too loony for me to recommend it the plot suffers too much from extremely irritating coincidental situations forced twists  dialogs and  most of all  a far too short running time to elaborate the monsters personalities like they deserve onslow stevens doesnt receive top billing but plays the most fundamental role as miracle a doctor whos challenged to cure count dracula carradine from his incontrollable thirst for blood and fix lawrence talbots illness of mutating into a hairy wolf man whenever the moon is full during a nightly walk in some caves they also pick up the remainders of frankensteins monster and the good doctor himself eventually undergoes a jekyllhyde metamorphosis due to a bad blood transfusion the last invitation to the messy party is a female hunchback though not of the notre dame something is very wrong when youre watching a movie that is literally stuffed with horror icons yet the only character in the whole movie that is able to freak you out is an ordinary villager going by the name siegfried the actual monsters are dull and their oncefabulous backgrounds are fully drained count dracula is a whining romanticist talbot is a pitiable and also whining old martyr and the frankenstein creation  well his share in the plot isnt even worth mentioning theres a serious lack of atmospheric settings and nifty photography in this universal film especially compared to all their other efforts and the abrupt climax is a disaster
