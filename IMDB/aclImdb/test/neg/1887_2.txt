i watched this film when i was a kid and i thought it was terrible then now that im older i found it just as terrible universal could have done better than this they merely decided to make the most money they could out of using all their monsters at once to me that was a cheap shot these characters were capable of holding their own in their own movies and the choice of actors was deplorable dracula needed to be bela lugosi frankensteins monster needed to be karloffbr br in my mind it was the disney squalid sequel sequence done decades ago and it was not appreciated umiversal started out with something great and original and then thought they could pander to the masses with the schlock which is extremely evident in this film
