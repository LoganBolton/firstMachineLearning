ive been a classic horror fan my entire life many nights stretched until the early hours of the morning watching the universal films on horror incorporated and creature feature night sadly i viewed this film in the early evening and yet it still almost put me to sleepbr br i dont think ive ever seen a horror picture where everything was so matter of fact dr edelmann doesnt seem to believe in the supernatural yet before long hes medically treating dracula and watching larry talbot change into the wolfman while hardly blinking an eye he and talbot discover the frankenstein monster like its an everyday occurrence edelmann is all fired up to bring the monster back to life but after talbot miliza and nina protest hes like aww youre right no big deal after realizing draculas treachery he opens the counts coffin to sunlight and poof hes gone just like thatbr br the only person who didnt appear to just be phoning in her lines was jane adams as nina her reward is getting bounced off the hump in her back into a pit by the frankenstein monster at the end of the filmand no one even tries to rescue her she dr edelmann and the monster all perish while talbot and miliza casually leave the castlebr br definitely the low point for universal during its classic horror years
