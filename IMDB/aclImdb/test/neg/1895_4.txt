whereas the movie was beautifully shot and reasonably well acted the script was dull plodding and nothing we have not seen before not once in this film did i ever get the feeling that these people were really in danger no noticeable climax and a very standard resolution i believe these type of movies have been overdone and should be given a rest after all didnt everyone on the planet see schindlers list
