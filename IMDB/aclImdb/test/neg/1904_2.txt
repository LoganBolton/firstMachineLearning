if you need a clue as to whether playmaker is decent or not look to its star colin firth who refers to it in an interview as absolute rubbish  i sincerely hope no one ever sees itbr br the script and plot are ludicrous the female lead is unconvincing the only thing worthwhile is colin firth and he seems slightly embarrassed throughoutbr br for diehard firth fans only  the shower scene alone is worth the 399 you might have to shell out should you find it in a video cutout bin like i didbr br im happy for mr firth that his days of taking projects like this one are over
