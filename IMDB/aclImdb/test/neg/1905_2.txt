if it wasnt for colin firth the movie would be ready for the dust bin so foreseable so silly and so badly acted only colin firth as always shines through this mess as single light on the end of the tunnelbr br the worst was jennifer rubins acting for sure maybe it was because of this script did they actually have really written one or was it just made up on the waybr br to cut a tooo long story shortbr br it is a must see only for colin firth fanatics like me since he is incredibly sexy and good acting struggling hard against this mentally challenged script these minutes of colinscreentime make up a lot of this movie br br dont spend too much money on it though try to see or get it as cheap as possible an auction or something like that and then do stick to the colin firth scenes br br the rest of the movie might be dangerous for anyones mental health
