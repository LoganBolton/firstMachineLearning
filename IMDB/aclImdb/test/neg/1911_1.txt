well if you set aside the fact that this movie features abysmal acting and if you set aside the fact that the story is muddled and wanders off in about five different directions without ever deciding which way it really wants to go and if you set aside the fact that i didnt find a single scene in this movie that was remotely interesting well if you set all that aside this is still a really terrible moviebr br i take it that this is supposed to be a love story about rich guypoor girl i never really understood for a moment how this romance between kelley chris klein and samantha leelee sobieski ever got started the inexplicable romance is made worse by a complete lack of chemistry between klein and sobieski the screenplay by michael seitzman is dull to the point of stupefying how seitzman managed to write the thing without falling asleep is a miracle that he would think anyone would want to pay to see this is unbelievablebr br did i mention that this is a really really terrible moviebr br id give it a zero but the imdb doesnt provide for votes of zero so i give it a one while holding my nose
