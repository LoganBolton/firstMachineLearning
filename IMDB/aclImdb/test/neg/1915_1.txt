im not sure why i disliked this film so much maybe im too old or too male or too something just who was the target audience here if youre it and you liked it then im happy for you personally i found it a bit of a pill the characters were uninteresting and unlikeable the script was just plain embarrassing and some though not all of the acting was uninspired mawkish tedious and occasionally nauseating  surely theres something better onbr br on a related issue why is it that whenever i see chris klein in a film i get an urge to slap him silly does anyone else get that
