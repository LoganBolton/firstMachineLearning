this comes close to the worst movie ive ever seen the writer starts you out in a way that youll side with jasper josh hartnett when he did absolutely nothing wrong sam leelee sobiesky leaves him for kelley chris klein in a way that leaves you mad at sam you arent let in on what she feels so her feelings with kelley arent real to you and their relationship is phony it drags you in either direction and it gets rather exhausting and annoying the only good thing about this movie that i saw was the castbr br
