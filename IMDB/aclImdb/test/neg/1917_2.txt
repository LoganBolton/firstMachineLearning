spoilerspoiler this movie stunk just let me say now that i totally agree with what carissaphillips had to say about this what was sam thinking she was with a guy who told her he loved her 3 times in total was extremely hot and stuck with her though her trying times josh hartnett but she decided to break up with him no cheat on him with a snobbyugly spoiled richbrat jerk loser who never said he loved her in the entire movieoh wait he wrote it on the wall does that count and left her in her time of need because he was scared chris loser klein who would you want to be with the only reason i sat through the entire movie was because it had josh hartnett in it and hoping that maybe she would die at the end i wanted jasper to get another girlfriend who was actually worthy of him the whole your mom thing was funny i enjoyed it i hate it when people around here say it but i think that kelley deserved it jasper should have said it to sam as well she needed a good slap how the romance started is a mystery to me they never said anything to each other anyway so i dont understand how they got together i was thinking about the cheese sandwich you gave medid it have mustard or mayonnaise or oh what a come on the supposedly romantic lines were so stupid plus hes sosososososososo ugly i must admit i did cry in this movie for a long time really hard not because she died but because she broke jaspers heart he cried in this movie so many timeshe tried to smile for her but he couldnt stop the tears he cried when 1 he told her he loved her 2 she got sick 3 chris klein came back and he saw how happy she was w him 4 she died i cried when he cried because he loved her her entire life and told her and yet she was dumb enough to not care and love a guy who left her in her time of need and who did not cry at the funeral 1 12 stars only because i love josh hartnett oh by the way chris klein your mom wileys sis
