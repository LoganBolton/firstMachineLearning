rich vs poor big city vs small town white collar vs blue collar these things are not original themes in movies so when one chooses to involve these themes the situational storyline had better be very original or very good this one was neither i never believed in the romance of the two young lovers in this movie neither convincing nor compelling it just fell flat dont bother even with a video rental
