 possible spoiler  br br if you were making a serious movie involving a powerful but aging father with three apparently ungrateful daughters featuring actors of the highest caliber with great cinematography and a beautiful midwestern setting now where would you go with it why youd fashion a modern tragedy after king lear of coursebr br thats what i was expecting that certainly wasnt what i got what i got was 105 minutes of feminist tripeone long harangue about mans inhumanity to woman why there wasnt a decent male in the entire storybr br you see early on where this film might be headed but you cant believe anyone would waste all these fine actors and craftsmen on that trite scenarioyou just want them to get on with the king lear theme but it never happens and theres the real tragedy if you ask mebr br aside from the panorama of glorious rural heartland about the only thing worth watching in this film was that wonderful chameleon british actor colin firth practicing his midwestern accent now there was a treatbr br 310
