the story is derived from king lear the setting is a farm in iowa heres a test for this kind of thing if you find yourself asking why did soandso do suchandsuch and the answer is because thats what happened in king lear you know that the film has failed well that is what happens here the father figure in this story isnt living his own life hes mimicking a fictional one but theres more wrong with the film than thisbr br jocelyn moorhouse is ambitious  far more ambitious than i think she realises shes trying to take the king lear story and completely change the setting this is a task in itself the likeliest result is that the transplanted story will die and nobody will quite be able to work out why although there are enough successful transplants like west side story to make it worth trying but shes also attempting a revisionist retelling in the version of king lear she wishes to create reagan and goneril command our sympathy and cordelia is a villain this is a task in itself toobr br succeeding at either task is hard succeeding at both at once is impossible in fact succeeding at one while so much as attempting the other is impossible if we are to look on the very same events from a different moral perspective then the events must be the very same events  which means there can be no tampering with setting if the story is to be transplanted alive into a different setting its moral heart must keep beating the whole while  which means there can be no tampering with ethical perspective moorhouse was bound to fail in not just one but in both of her endeavours and so she did naturally its possible to attempt both tasks fail at both tasks yet by some fluke hit upon a work of art thats good for independent reasons i mention this because i havent read jane smileys novel which for all i know is good for independent reasons but the film isnt if there was nothing else wrong with it there would still be no getting around the fact that its just so thoroughly excruciatingly dull the very fields of corn are even more boring than they would be in real life  which neednt be the case since off the top of my head i can think of four films the wizard of oz north by northwest the straight story kikujiro in which the cornfields arent boring at all
