this movie has more on its plate than a sumo wrestler and the result for the viewer is indigestion there are some good performances but the subplots are extraneous and largely unresolvedbr br in addition i found all the characters unlikeable and if you cant identify with at least one character there isnt much to get excited about all in all this is a classic example of trying to do too much with too little
