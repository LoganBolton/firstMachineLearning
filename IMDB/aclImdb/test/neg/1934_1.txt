its probably a cultural thingsomehow the natives of this country have been conditioned to find this stuff funny i have experienced this phenomenon firsthand during an openair cinema event where this film was shown before the feature most of the indigenous audience laughed and no this wasnt in a sanitarium or a clinic for retarded children this was in a welltodo area and the audience consisted mostly of educated adultsbr br so it must be possible somehow to find this amusing but honest to goodness i have no idea what it takesmaybe its in the air or the water prolonged exposure to which causes this condition something must cause it obviously the only thing i can say is that i am quite sure what doesnt cause it the movie itselfbr br there are no jokes in it its brain dead stupid nonsensical unfunny lame its in short a waste of time any tom and jerry is funnier heck even funerals are funnierbr br just in case you have been fortunate enough not ever to have seen any of the stooges performances its three guys behaving running even talking like retarded infants causing all kinds of unfunny mayhem with no plot no real purpose and no real conclusion its like ugly teletubbies without the cute costumesbr br sitting in a crowd watching this garbage in this country can be quite exasperating because you feel like you are at a party with a bunch of potheads and you are the only one who hasnt smoked anythingbr br so unless you are prepared to intoxicate yourself to make this bearable or come equipped with whatever it is that makes people think watching three ugly old men behave like morons is funny my advice on this is stay way far away
