i saw this when it came out in theaters back in 1996 i remember i was already familiar with elijah woods work thats right he made stuff before lord of the rings and the merchandising tieins to the film were pretty abundant flipper water guns were even circulatingbr br adults were reminded of the old movies and tv show and for nostalgias sake took their kids to see it who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boybr br unfortunately it wasnt what anyone expected and flopped severely you know a movies in trouble when a boy swims away from a hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean and a pack of dolphins scare the shark away and the kid  instead of getting out of the water into a boat  floats in the water for five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him  apparently he hasnt taken into mind that the shark is still out there perhaps even below himbr br another problem is paul hogan he looks old crusty and tired of recycling his croc dundee shtick by now no one even remembered crocodile dundee much less hogan and i half expected him to suddenly start pretending he didnt know what a hair dryer was for the sake of fishoutofwatersocialsatire laughsbr br all in all this is a really poor family movie that is amateurish and almost hard to watch at times i hated it when i saw it in theaters back in 96 and i hate it more now
