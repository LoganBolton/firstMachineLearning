my take even splendid underwater photography can salvage a familiar script and paperthin characters br br for those who havent already got enough of the free willy pictures flipper might serve up a decent rental others are heavily suggested to stay away although flipper is harmless affair it hardly showcases anything for the adult audience unless its your first time to see a dolphinbr br a remake of a 1960s tv show and film flipper may have sound like a good idea back then a dolphin charms the life of boy and a girl they help ave the environment by first getting rid of toxic wastes thrown in on the sparkling waters of the florida keys and at the same time battle a shark and a salty sea baddie who happens to be the one responsible for the toxic dumping and also happens to hate dolphins but even for the 90s especially if an eerily similar film like free willy was a recent hit flipper is just another harmless yet occasionally empty summer splash movie for the kids although the animals this in case is the main dolphin a clumsy pelican and a realisticlooking hammerhead shark typecast as the villain and the pristine underwater cinematography steal the show theres nothing much in flipper to steal from anywaybr br the story is completely predictable something than nowadays even a 6year old may find evident the human cast led by a prelord of the rings elijah wood and an outofwork paul hogan have rarely anything to do but stand around and look pretty their acting skills whatever they may be to this movie is rarely revealed on screen unless you consider the acting talents of cheerful bottlenose dolphin i guess not trying to recommend flipper as mindless family entertainment wont be fair but anyone over the age of 10 no make that 8 are better off renting or buying something else besides the film is about 95 minutes tops that might just give you enough time to something elsewhere without worrying about your kids that alone might be worth the rentalbr br rating  out of 5
