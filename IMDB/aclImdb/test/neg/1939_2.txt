viva la bam this jackass spin off focuses on the obviously scripted adventures of bam margera and his pals johnny knoxville brandon dicamillo etc this show while it has its fair share of grossout comedy and crazy stunts focuses mainly on bams torturing of his parentsbr br im sorry to say this bam but youre in no way as cool as you think you are this ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny and yes i liked jackass but also narcissistic beyond belief the overly stylized intro ends with bam coolly explaining that hes going to do whatever the f he wants to how about you do something that is actually funny i liked jackass for what it was worth the camerawork was horrible  any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents garage  but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performedbr br not so with viva la bam we follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy the stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smilebr br viva la bam is a poor spinoff of that does little good but feed margeras already too big ego i dont recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone
