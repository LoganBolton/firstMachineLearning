i had noticed this movie had been on cinemax a lot lately so this morning i decided to watch it i had just finished the infiltrator which is a great movie and i thought this looked good as well from the description the cable had atleast this film was awful its slow the pacing is horrible it feels as tho it lasts 4 hours theres no real plot to speak ofagh how can anyone say anything good about this movie rickman is goodbut he always isthe other two characters work well but theres no real story to support any of it after 2 hours and you sitting there wondering what on earth is going on where on earth is the plot it ends with a surprise that frankly just made me sick dont bother with this one
