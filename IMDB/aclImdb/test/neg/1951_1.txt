talk about rubbish i cant think of one good thing in this movie the screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects well there were no effects i cant believe the writer of this movie did identity everything in this movie made me sick to start to finishbr br the front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes i looks like a scary villain but like the old saying never judge a book by its cover the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out one part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs terrible the setting was bad enough like they could of set the whole thing in lapland but no a tropical island insteadbr br i took this movie as a spoof which i think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects you can argue that i havent watched the first one but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldnt attempted itbr br the biggest joke in this movie is the effects the snowballs looked like they were home made and that carrot was a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have 6 minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a islandbr br lastly the acting in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way throughbr br in conclusion i give this film 0 stars out of 5
