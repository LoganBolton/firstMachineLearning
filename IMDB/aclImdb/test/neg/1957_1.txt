this is the worst film i have ever seen bar none from the flimsylooking poorly lit sets to the laughable acting to the infantile plot and shoddy drawnout action sequences this film is so bad its hilarious for about ten minutes after which you will be reaching for the remote or the power socket to end this film nonexperience although it was obviously made with the entire production and acting staffs collective tongue rammed in cheek please god i found jack frost 2 so dreadful as to be unwatchable for more than a quarter of an hour if you have not had enough of it after this time you must be indulging in drug abuse
