in all it took me three attempts to get through this movie although not total trash ive found a number of things to be more useful to dedicate my time to such as taking off my fingernails with sandpaperbr br the actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in herpes medication commercials do people wont really pay to see either the notoriety you earn wont be the best for you personally but at least the commercials get air timebr br the first one was bad but this gave the word bad a whole new definition but it does have one good feature if your kids bug you about letting them watch rrated movies before you want them to tie them down and pop this little gem in watch the whining stop and the tears begin
