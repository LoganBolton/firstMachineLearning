i was giddy with girlishglee when i found out about this movie shortly after seeing spirits withinbr br after years of anticipation they gave november 2005 release date well november came and went followed by december oh look todays january 31 2006 no us release as of yetbr br oh well im so glad i had a friend with a bootlegged subtitled copy dbr br well the cg was great not as good as expected but near perfect i cringed however at the unnatural movements made by the children throughout the movie i had thought that we were passed this by now also i didnt really care for the anime look given to their faces i was under the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look to the film and yet most of the characters have largerthannorm eyes especially the girl characters they had personality though ill give them thatbr br even though im not a big fan of anime i do have to say i was impressed with the wild fight scenes they were animated beautifully and had me hanging onto the edge of my seatbr br for about the first twobr br and therein lies advent childrens biggest flaw its mostly just a bunch of hyperstylized fight scenesbr br a ff7 sequel of epic proportions had been promised for years instead they gave us a pretty piece of cg with barely a plot to excuse its justundertwohours running timebr br where final fantasy is famous for its intricate stories this movie falls short you dont really get to know the characters the only way youd have any understanding of most of what occurred in the film would have been if you had played the game we barely got to see them before they were battling it out with whatever current threatbr br what hurts the fans even more is the awful cameos that the majority of ff7 characters were given they were nothing more than clouds ill call if i need you but i probably wont back up singers and to add to the hurt they had each character individually throw cloud higher and higher this little part here was so cheesy i almost turned it off i would have been much more impressed if he had just simply jumped up all on his own ricocheting off of walls to get himself up higherbr br it hurt even more when they reduced the turks to lessthanjust comic relief that was fine for the game but this is cinema people do not act like cartoon characters in a harsh battle they took away their dignity br br and spoiler yeah right most of you probably already know anyhow who remembers darth maul being hyped up in sw episode 1 yeah now picture that but with sephiroth thats right he had maybe 5 minutes of screen time maybe that end spoiler pbr br if this movie was made for the fans then way to go square if this is any indication of the direction youre taking the ff series i doubt youre going to be seeing much of my money i played your games for the wonderful story and the excellent charactersbr br you had a chance to make something epic something truly beautiful a masterpiece that flies in the face of all of the disney cg filmsbr br instead you gave us a pretty piece of flesh with hardly anything underneath to hold it together way to gobr br and im sure if the rest of the fans paused for a moment and tried to just pay attention to everything but the cg theyd know what im talking about well i was gonna rate this a 510 but after thinking about it while righting this im giving it a 310 because they could have done better they have done better and this is just sadbr br if theyre gonna remake anything ffvii they need to do this one first
