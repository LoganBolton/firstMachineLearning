first i will say that i am going to be as subjective as i canbr br there will be some potential spoilers ahead so bewarebr br i hardly ever review movies but this one in particular i felt i had to review this movie final fantasy 7 advent children based off the ultra popular rpg final fantasy vii for the ps1 has been in the works for quite some time after the years of hype and the dozens of trailers none of which i ever saw i had only seen stills this movie got the legions of fans really excited about seeing their favorite characters on the big screen i myself had played and completed the game a few times like any good fan and being such a movie freak i was pretty excited myself so i had thought to myself what could go wrongbr br well the movie started out ok in the first 20 minutes but then things get out of hand as the movie progressed without a doubt this is the best looking cgi animation around but that wont help a weak plot undeveloped charactersand over indulgent action scenes br br here is the story basically these three silver haired nancy boys in leather who have nothing to do with the game are supposedly clones of sephiroth hes the villain of the game who had supposedly murdered all his supposed clonesare trying to kidnap all the children for some reason that was not really explained all that well probably to make an army of kids they also center some of the story on some kid named denzel i dont know who this kid is or what his point is he just seems depressed all the time so the sephiroth clones also are involved in some kind of scheme involving some disease called geostigma that only affects the children this disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin discolorationbr br so now cloud must save the day from these guys apparently cloud and his fellow team mates have learned the ability of flight i felt a little insulted that these characters where flying around a city fighting a dragon and landing on there feet all the time maybe if the movie wasnt so over the top then the view relax into it and then they can be amazed by something incredible the real problem of this movie is logic now i know what you are gonna say but its called final fantasy it should have those ideas in it well that is a foolish way to think the game based itself in some kind of reality and the movie should follow through in that context context and logic in this movie is inconsistent i could explain it all but if i did i would end up writing the screenplaybr br also some scenes in this movie were extremely contrived and trite like when all of the characters from the game show up just in the nick of time for their obligatory screen time so as not to upset the fans they show up do there bit and pretty much have no point in the storybr br if this is too long here is the simpler reviewbr br the pros the first 20 minutes topnotch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunningbr br the cons illogical over indulgent action unbalanced action leaves the viewer jaded at the climax weak plot super human charactersno suspense the jrock soundtrackscore what happened to the orchestra horrible endingbr br big time spoilerbr br now the ending of this movie really disappointed me they could have had gone the really cool and sweet ending where cloud dies and meets up with aeris in the after life but after the great battle at the end cloud gets shot in the back the kinda wound where the bullet blast out through the chest then cloud has his 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of lifestream now i remember the lifestream in the game but it did not have resurrecting properties if it did they could have brought aeris back to life thus making a completely different story so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have a ultra cheezy hallmark lifetime type momentbr br not that the movie doesnt have its moments its is worth seeing for its visuals but thats allbr br other than that its not really a good movie it is strictly for blinded fans of the game not for people who care about plot and character and story telling
