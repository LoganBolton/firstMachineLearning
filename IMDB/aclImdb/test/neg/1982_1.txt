when the spirits within was released all you heard from final fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it didnt seem like final fantasy this is a different story for better or worse the familiar settings characters music story and over the top action scenes should thrill fans of the original game the problem is that it just isnt a good movie in its own rightbr br the direction during the fight scenes is often sloppy switching camera angles ridiculously fast in an attempt to make the action seem more frenetic but only serving to make the scenes look jumbled and confusingbr br the cg itself is exceptional but i cant say its the best ive ever seen since spirits within had much more detail on the characters although i must admit that advent childrens characters moved much more naturallybr br the plot is virtually a black hole its a giant deus ex machina designed solely to bring sephiroth back for one last fight old characters reappear but serve no real purpose other than to please fans character development is nonexistent and the film does nothing at all to resolve any of the plot threads left hanging after the games end but its packed with neatlooking fight scenes with magic summons and limit breaks which is probably what fans wanted anywaybr br in the end advent children is a very flashy but totally brainless action flick that serves more as a side story for final fantasy vii than a real sequelbr br by the way dont think youre hurting my feelings by voting not useful it just makes me feel superior knowing that fanboysfangirls resent my objectivity so greatly
