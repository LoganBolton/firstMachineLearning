i really like kinski he is a great actor ive seen this movie because ive heard that there are autobiographic aspects in this moviebr br the film is full of symbols like a piano sinking in a river or strange shadowpictures at the walls then the narrator always says abstract sentences like a kid sells fortune but her box is empty now this is really disturbing and wasnt really necessary because everyone understands what this movie is all about the movie shows how kinskis character treated woman and how he kept them under control if there are really some aspects of kinskis life in this story  then he really was an swine so there is no need to watch this movie unless if you want to see kinski naked or if you like sick trash movies to laugh about
