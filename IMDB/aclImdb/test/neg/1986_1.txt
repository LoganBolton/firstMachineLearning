this is one of the worst films i have seen in a whilebr br the problem is that it doesnt know whether it wants to be an intelligent political film artistic or an exercise is eroticism as a result it fails on all accountsbr br the acting is atrocious the narration off putting and the supposed symbolism pointlessbr br klaus kinski is probably the best thing about this film but that isnt a good thing sure he has an intense and unique look but ultimately he cant actually act just look at how he reacts when his mistress leavesbr br really dont watch this film some say it needs repeat viewings i say one is too many
