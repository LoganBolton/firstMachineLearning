this movie is worse than heavens gate or plan 9 from outer space dont know why it got even one oscar it should have gotten a million raspberries just like the audiences that either walked out or didnt show up in the first place the hospital was a firstrate financial failure but im certain the elite classes of leftwing guttermouthed intellectuals railed that the american public was far too plebeian to appreciate biting socialcommentary when they saw it and on and on george c scott in one of mostartless and embarrassing roles along with aging sexsymbol diana rigg spend most of the movie trying to cuss in an increasinglyblas√© manner as they push along a silly plot poor old george is impotent and is just crushed by the event but after lots of dirty language between him and rigg he rapes her multiple times on lovely night in a filthy crumbling nyc hospital that looks so disgusting that i wouldnt want a dying pet rat treated in it theres also some sacrilegious junkdialog tossed about hither and yon laced with plenty of cussing as well it ends by portraying the faulty notion that unusual stress without physical exertion always brings on cardiac arrest never want to see another minute of this awful movie again
