im amazed that the hospital has been so wellreceived by the critics and the public i found it dreary visually ugly and generally meaningless after the first virtually unwatchable 40 minutes the film does improve relatively but it remains way too farfetched not to mention unfunny to be successful as a satire and has too little substance to succeed as a drama the films uncertain tone is its biggest fault overshadowing even scotts terrific as usual performance
