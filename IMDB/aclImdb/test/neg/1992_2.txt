cowardly and cynical the hospital represents the nadir of paddy chayefskys special brand of celebration of the status quo disguised as satirebr br thanks to hamhanded director arthur hiller this ludicrous script gets the visually ugly poorly paced presentation it deservesbr br only a great performance by george c scott in the sort of meanspirited role he was born to play keeps the hospital from being a complete disasterbr br ironically though scotts performance does viewers a disservice his magnetism keeps them watching when they might more profitably turn off the vcr and clean out the closets stare at the clouds or watch reruns of baywatchbr br certainly anyone who emotionally invests in the setup  modern medicine apparently gone amok  will feel cheated by the dismal payoff where chayefsky reveals that the system works just fine so quit your carpingbr br while the first half of this film provides some entertaining black comedy it all turns out to be a red herring before that becomes clear though chayefsky gives some good lines to scott as his middleaged middleclass white male standinbr br bitter alcoholic impotent scotts dr herbert bock has alienated those who know him best and he has the bile to keep alienating them in chayefskys worldview all that of course makes bock a magnet for a hippie chick half his agebr br playing a collection of adjectives the longhaired longlegged braless and almost bustless diana rigg struggles in the part of the girl the british rigg is miscast as a southwestern free spirit but any other actress would struggle as well like the rest of a good cast gone to waste rigg cant overcome a script that isnt interested in any character except bock or any philosophy beyond banalitybr br for fans of george c scott this is another star turn and worth watching for fans of black comedy turn it off after the first 45 minutes for anyone else dont bother
