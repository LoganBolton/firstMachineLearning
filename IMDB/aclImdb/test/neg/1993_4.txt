its okay  a few years later chayefskys classic network will be his true cinematic big home run  but for now this dark comedy isnt the classic it aspires to be its mostly awful although it has some good scenes the first murder victim being found the er clerk responsible for billing patients making a surprise discovery drummonds delusional confessional and the very last scene where scotts character regains his professional integrity and selfrespect it also has some ludicrous scenes scotts characters whiny monologue during his early visit to the hospital psychiatrist scotts characters raping riggs character dysarts horrible mugging in his brief scenes and the or doctor pouncing on the operating table to resuscitate the wrong patient because i already have one malpractice lawsuitbr br chayefsky also tries too hard throwing every conceivable hurdle at this one hospital ie the murders the administrative mistakes the poor people protesting outside etc it might have worked better as a look at the industry as a whole actingwise scott is passable rigg seems miscast hughes is inspired and dysart mugs through out his brief performance the rest of the cast is too onedimensional
