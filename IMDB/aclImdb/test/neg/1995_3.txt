after nearly getting killed by a big dog a stray cat thinks to herself why cant i be a skunk then everyone would leave me alone she looks around the junkyard and gets an idea white paint black paint and some limburger cheese and some garlichmmmm the next thing you know we have the forerunner to pepe le pew although in this cartoon shes still a cat shes a she and just a skunk in disguise br br the cat also is enjoying and taking full advantage of her new status as a smelly skunk hes a happy content guy nowuntil a real skunk with the charles boyer imitation voice shows up br br i did appreciate the cat putting on a bugs bunny outfit however overall i never cared for these frenchtakeoff characters finding the stereotypical dialog overdone and not really funny so i only rate this as fair i do this a point however for the moral at the end of the story
