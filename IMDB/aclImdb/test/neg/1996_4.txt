chuck joness odorable kitty is the cartoon that introduced pepe le pew to the world sort of there are a few key differences between the pepe we know and love or hate in the case of some people and the character in this cartoon for one the disguised cat who pepe amorously pursues in odorable kitty is distinctly male also pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is henry at the cartoons climax his french accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up pepe is not even the lead character here the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies for the most part the storyline largely follows the usual format of a pepe le pew cartoon but pepes aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character he is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated in fact odorable kitty is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every pepe le pew cartoon that followed this subsequent development has robbed odorable kitty of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull pepe le pew short with a weird surprise ending as a child i hated pepe le pew as an adult able to appreciate his more sophisticated verbal and risqué humour i love the character and most of his cartoons odorable kitty makes me feel like a child again
