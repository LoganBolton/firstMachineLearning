my guess is that the producers of this lowbudget spacehorror film wanted a serious movie but the director had his heart set on a parody sothis is what we get set in an abandoned spaceship 1000 years in the future and peopled with characters and props right out of the 90s the set is some industrial complex maybe an oil tanker whatever they use is as is so the controls consist racks of old tv equipment one location is obviously the employees lunchroom and sports an old tv and vcr as well as a water cooler with plastic demijohn tiny lister and coolio get the best lines arguing throughout the story the dialog is packed with terms that are pretty dated even now aok daddyo but then maybe the 30th century is very retro when the captain declares the ships cargo is a load of coffins from the transylvania station you know this is all a puton its a bit of alien part jasonx shameless ripoff of all the best scifi and horror titles at one point casper vandien even tells his pilot to make it so with a straight face this film would have been better if they had just let everyone run with the satire but they keep attempting to make the story seriousmaybe the backers were on the set that day anyway not a bad boredom killer if you arent too picky fx are as good as the sets are bad
