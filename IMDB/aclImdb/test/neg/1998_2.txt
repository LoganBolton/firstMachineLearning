i normally like casper in his movies a real credit to starship troopers but the box cover on this video ssooooo misleds the renters at my local video people rent it expecting a perhaps borg like vampire and instead they get a bad remake of lon chaney it had great potential and fell very flat ireally think i could have written a better story line and screen play why is it in every science fiction movie they the cast constantly refers to a solar system as a galaxy didnt any of these screenwriters or authors stay awake in science class it is a pet pevee of mine but a solar system is a single star with planets a galaxy is a whole bunch of solar systems it is like referring to a can of coke as a gross of six packs makes it sound even dumber
