just watched on ubuweb this early experimental short film directed by william vance and orson welles yes you read that right orson welles years before he gained fame for radios the war of the worlds and his feature debut citizen kane welles was a 19yearold just finding his muse besides vance and welles another player here was one virginia nicholson who would become orsons first wife she plays a woman who keeps sitting on something that rocks back and forth courtesy of an africanamerican servant paul edgerton in blackface during this time a man welles keeps passing her by courtesy of the scene constantly repeating i wont reveal any more except to say how interesting the silent images were as they jumpcut constantly thats not to say this was any good but it was fascinating to watch even with the guitar score by larry morotta added in the 2005 print i watched worth a look for welles enthusiasts and anyone with a taste of the avantgarde
