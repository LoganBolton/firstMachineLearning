this is a pale imitation of officer and a gentleman there is no chemistry between kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest the dialog is wooden the situations hackneyed its too long and the climax is anticlimactic i love the uscg its men and women are fearless and tough the action scenes are awesome but this movie doesnt do much for recruiting i fear the script is formulaic but confusing kutchers character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasnt his fault costners is raging against the dying of the light but why his conflict with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle i saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt i got my moneys worth
