this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen me and my husband own over 600 dvds most of which are scifi and horror bmovies that arent top quality but still entertaining dracula 300 had absolutely no redeeming qualities at all the writing was horrific and the acting was even worse it took us a 3 tries to get through the entire movie because we could only tolerate it in 30 minute intervals we thought surely it must get betterwe were wrong i would rather watch a corpse being embalmed than to have to sit through that again when it ended me and my husband just looked at each other like uhis that it the ending seemed like there was supposed to be more but they ran over their apparent 50000 budget and were like oh crapwe are brokeend it nowquickroll credits
