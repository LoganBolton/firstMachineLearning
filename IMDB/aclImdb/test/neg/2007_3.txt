wow theres a lot of venom directed at this movie and a lot of it is deserved but its not the worst movie of all time thats probably zoolanderbr br anyway if youre high on something really drunk or just in the mood for a bminus minus movie that you can make fun of this may be your cup of teabr br yes as others said the first part of the movie makes you think youre watching an updating of the bram stoker novel two of the main characters are named van helsing and mina the ship is the demeter and theyre in the carpathian galaxy you later find that van helsing is a descendant of the original and he just happens to be on a ship in the 30th century with dracula suuuuuuuuuuurebr br oh yeah and to add to the originality this spooky ghost ship movie has another character named ash sound familiarbr br theres paperthin character development and anachronisms like the aforementioned manual wheelchair and coolio and tom lister talking 20th century black slang but what really makes the movie ridiculous is the ending if thats what happens to the characters then the previous two hours have been a wastebr br like i said it you want a dumb movie to play mystery science theater with and your mind is in approximately the same mode required for viewing the great vegetable rebellion episode of lost in space then you may find this diverting otherwise put a stake in it its done
