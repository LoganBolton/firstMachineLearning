and thats a goddamn shame please make the sun rise and have it incinerate all copies of dracula 3000 this must be the worst vampireflick of the new millennium so far i havent seen reign in darkness yet but they dont get much worse than this dont be fooled be the movies cool hr gigeresque cover this is so bad its almost hilarious i cant describe all the emotions this movie conjured i laughed my ass off i yelled at the screen i sat there numb nodding my head in disbelief this film has cheap  cheese written all over it the best thing of this movie are the openingcredits and the openingshots which feature more or less okay cgi of two spaceships but when casper van diens voiceover comes on you start smelling something fishy and indeed it all goes downhill rapidly after thatbr br the crew of a salvagespaceship finds an abandoned vessel the demeter which seems to be heading for earth they enter it thus sealing their fate this movie is above all things a shameless lowbudget alienripoff mixed with vampires right down to the plottwist were erika eleniaks character aurora reveals shes a robot coolio goes badly overthetop as the dopesmoking bloodsucking 187 pffff code from the hood as a name casper van diens characters named capt van helsing hahaha and he looks likeer well casper van dien udo kier as capt varna former commander of the demeter is only shown on a monitorscreen and he really does seem to have trouble reading his lines from an autocue poor udo what where you doing in this flick and then we have langley kirkwood as count orlock one of the most pathetic and laughable draculas ever to disgrace the silver screen just look at his outfit instead of some coollooking futuristic black suit or something hes wearing a cheap oldschool halloweensuit with fringes you thought richard roxburgh was unconvincing as dracula in van helsing then wait until you see langleys performancebr br the setdesigners went overboard on this one the interior of the demeter looks like a cross between an oiltanker and an old steelfactory which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green pink blue and yellow the propmaster must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000 because the characters use guns which look like todays 45 magnums and prof uses a nonmotorized nonfloating wheelchair it has to be pushed around in order to movebr br aside from one driedup corpse a few impalements and one dismemberment theres absolutely no gore and the vampirefangs and contactlenses look fake as hell add to that also the most lame stupid and abrupt ending ever humvee and aurora are the only survivors instead of having one final bloody showdown with count orlock they lock themselves in the controlroom then aurora explains that before her program was upgraded and joining narcotics she used to be a protheus 32 pb in other words a pleasurebot so she says well then what are you waiting for humvee answers aint gotta tell me twice come on girl picks her up and boooooom the ship explodes and credits roll no sexscene no erika flashin her boobies no bloody climax just one more shot of udo kier reading a line on the monitor and its overbr br so this movie is a mustsee for every badmovielover but i must warn them it gets really painful at times and everyone claiming that van helsing underworld or even queen of the damned is the worst vampiremovie of the new millennium clearly is insane or just hasnt seen dracula 3000 yet
