imagine the worst thing that could ever possibly be conceived by human intellect now imagine something infinitely darker  i mean worse than that then multiply that by the quantity of the suckiness possessed by the star wars holiday special this movie is by far worse than thatbr br dracula 3000 infinite darkness starring such illustrious and reputable actors such as coolio and langley kirkwood as the films horrifying antagonist count orlock is equatable to eating ones own feces exclusively for ones entire life condensed into approximately one hour and twenty minutes to be frank there is no way to approach a review of this cinematic tragedy  riddled with communist propaganda promotion of drug use futuristic anachronisms and quite possibly the worst special effects since the original war of the worldsbr br the hammer and the sickle of the soviet union can be seen proudly displayed throughout the dingy sets they dare call a spaceship lenin can be observed on several posters throughout the film and of course religion has been abolished for two centuries by then so they dont know who this god is even though they have no reservations about using his name in vain but of course in the socialist republic of space presided over by interstellar president baker deathstick like drugs are legalized and quite common yet handicap mobility seems even worse off than it is today they dont even have a wheelchair rampbr br racial tension still festers throughout the galaxy in quite a familiarpredictable fashion we receive great commentary on ethnic division through lines such as is dracula a brotha us brothas gotta stick together and once you go black you dont go back speaking of the token black characters one is played by coolio playing a stereotypical stoner coolio becomes possibly the most annoying and ridiculous vampire ever oh wait second most ridiculous vampire ever that prized title goes to our friend count orlock from planet transylvania in the carpathian system these two make quite a pair between coolios attempts to cripple a paraplegic strange attempts at making highpitched animal noises a hairstyle 1004 years old and gigantic stretches of completely worthless dialogue and count orlocks twenty dollar generic halloweenstyle vampire costume exploding coffins or confusingly inane back storybr br one wonders if they did not simply give coolio the opportunity to get as high as a kite in space without gravity let him interact with the other actors and just went from therebr br count orlocks motivations are also somewhat in question does he want infinite darkness as the films subtitle would have you believe does he want to eat the crew or does he want coolio to kill them all or does he desire to give handicapped people a chance in such an inhospitably future it doesnt really matter because none of this films plot makes sense anywaysbr br the highlight of this movie has to be its ending more for the fact that it means the movie is over than by any merit of the abrupt trainwreck of a climax they phone in before the credits instead of facing count orlock off in some sort of duel the closest we get is a shot of orlock flailing around at breakneck speeds in front of our protagonist who dies shortly afterwards our heroes beat him by cutting off his arm in an ordinary door orlock then proceeds to collapse screeching in pain at a totally mundane yet understandably painful injury this is by far the most fun youll get from this movie watching a vampires contorted face as he cries in pain will have you on the edge of your seat  with laughter almost worth the four bucks for that alone of course right after that were treated with one of the films worst oneliners the mandatory allusion to sex and perhaps the most abrupt excuse for an ending ever theyre driving into the sun and their ship literally just blows up before they even come remotely close to impact i think they just outdid the wachowski bros for the worst finale everbr br i can only sleep at night because we know that a sequel is impossible secure in this fact we can safely say that this is the worst movie ever created and one which will never be exceeded in low quality lower budget and lowerest acting talent
