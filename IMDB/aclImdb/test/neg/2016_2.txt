a space ship cruising through the galaxy encounters a mysterious cargo ship apparently adrift in space the crew investigates hoping to lay claim to its cargo and acquire the ship however once aboard the ominous vessel their own ship mysteriously disengages leaving them to fend for themselves and battle none other then count dracula or orloff as this creature calls himselfbr br not a bad start i mean it follows any number of typical scifihorror plots the genres have been around enough that even the most original story will inevitably invoke comparison to some other film but when you start with a fairly typical horror convention the legend of dracula and vampires in general and combine it with a fairly typical scifi convention a crew happening upon something and becoming marooned to battle whatever theyre forced to confront the filmmakers better have some clever up their sleeve to imprint their own mark on the familiar genre staplesbr br director darrell roodt who also wrote dracula 3000 with ivan milborrow is primarily responsible for this utter failure so no roodt and milborrow have nothing up their sleeves but their armsbr br this film begins ominously enough with a very poorly delivered voice over by caspar van dien essentially providing enough exposition to explain who the crew on his ship are i should also point out that van diens character is named van helsing and oh so very cleverly this orloff character is from planet transylvania in the carpathian system no kidding i mean come on guys we get it and again dont be goofy and use such names unless you got something special in storebr br so after van helsings introduction of the crew we have essentially a film about this crew trapped in a space ship with a vampire lurking aboutbr br im a very forgiving viewer when it comes to low budget films occasionally they can be brilliant see raimis first two evil dead films dracula 3000 had a decent budget enough for some decent special effects and for the salaries of 3rd stringers like van dien erika eleniak coolio etc however unlike the evil dead flicks there is no talent behind the camera in front of the camera the talent is marginal but im going to give the actors some benefit of the doubt it really seems like they dont know what to do the best actor of the bunch alexandra kampgroenveld gets killed off quickly and the everenjoyable udo kier is reduced to being an exposition vehicle for the viewer as the deceased captain we hear and see via a video journal grant swandby is also okay as the professor but its hard to take seriously a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and rides a wheel chair and yes its a wheel chair as in there is nothing futuristic about it as for the rest of the actors wellim sure coolio really tried to be scary after getting turned into a vampire but well i dont think irritating qualifies as scary in most peoples book tiny lister and erika eleniak dont really provide much either lister is never really more then the il big brawny black stereotype eleniak actually appears unhappy throughout the film and never tries very hard eleniak is a pretty girl even in her mid thirties but looks a little worn out and uninterested for the movies durationbr br this brings us to count draculaorloff played by langley kirkwood to be honest i cant recall who exactly the vampire is supposed to be he introduces himself as orloff but at some point he acknowledges himself as count dracula as well go figure in any case you will be absolutely astounded by just how lame this vampire is have you ever scene those cheesy horror show hosts local networks would have on their creature feature time slots yes its that bad langley kirkwood the actor playing orlock must have found it almost impossible to concentrate in such a ridiculous outfit im sure hes still getting hassled by his friendsbr br there isnt much to the plot the vampire is the last of its kind and wants to go to earth for some reason and also there is some lip service about wanting to defeat caspar van diens character van helsing most of the crew get turned into vampires including van helsing and the crew use conventional machine guns and pistols to try and defeat them before they figure out the old stake in the heart routine yeah thats right bullets and yes the year 3000 keeping in that baffling vein one of the main areas the crew hole themselves up in while battling the vampires or vampire since there is really never more then one threatening them is filled with old soviet posters and insignia and such what the there are also references to godreligion being antiquated systems but these references only confused me did the soviet union make a comeback is there some point roodt and milborrow want to make with this it never really goes anywhere seems dumb and the posters etc just look cheapbr br on the positive side the film is competently shot and edited the cinematography is nothing spectacular but its clearly done by professionals and i had no problem with the special effects the ships look like ships in outer space although as i write this i recall how god awful the corpse of the captain looks when the crew discover him what were they thinking why didnt someone say something see how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without falling back on the negatives i guess ultimately thats the thing whatever positives you try and grant this scifihorror debacle you become overwhelmed by its lack of qualitybr br poor udo kier
