this might quite possibly be the worst movie i have ever seen i knew it was a bmovie before watching it it was actually the reason for watching it but id never thought it could be this bad the title promises dracula in space and does deliver however the story makes no real use of the fact that casper van diens character is a descendant of van helsing and watch out for the ending of the movie it comes at you fast ive never seen an ending scream out and now were over budget in a clearer fashion their resolution of the movie was rather comic though the story had so obviously painted itself into a corner if you feel you have to see it watch it with a friend who shares your love of bmovies if i hadnt i wouldnt have made it to the end
