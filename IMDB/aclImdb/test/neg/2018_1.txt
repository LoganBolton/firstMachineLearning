dracula 3000 is the epitome of painfully cheesy cinema from the getgo i assumed i was in for something pretty nasty with a cast line up that featured casper van dien erika eleniak coolio and tiny lister what could be expected well lets just say that expectations were crushedbr br if i really start up i feel like this review will go on for ages so were gonna keep this simple the vampire isnt even named dracula the space crew is carrying coffins from the carpathian sector of the transylvania system in his big scene coolio speaks of the most horrible things ever spoken of in film history in the year 3000 everyone wears bad clothes by todays standards they dont have anything more advanced than a modern wheelchair and they decorate with neon lights that appear stolen from a roller rinkbr br to top it all off the ending sweet merciful god it doesnt deserve to be ruined it has to be sen to be believedbr br ive rated this movie a 1 and i wish i could give it a zero yet i feel compelled to make you watch it what madness is this
