space is a vacuum right therefore space sucks vampires also suck a really bad vampire movie set in space would have twice the sucking power rightbr br it started with what could have been a fun premise retelling bram stokers dracula story in the future theres a salvage crew thats sent out to investigate a cargo ship thats lost in space called the demeter fans of the original novel will unwittingly assume that this is to be a straightforward retelling of dracula set in the future unfortunately short of sharing character names this one takes the lowbrow route and goes into the bmovie galaxy twenty minutes later when coolio becomes a vampire trust me when i tell you hes the best actor in the movie and thats not saying muchbr br casper van dien should be peddling his wares on daytime television erika eleniak should have quit after she left baywatch and poor udo kier is having trouble reading from the cue cards the guy who plays dracula in this one is more ridiculous than frank langella was in the 1970s version if you can manage to sit through the whole movie you will be rewarded with the worst ending imaginable the ending makes one wonder if the actors and the crew realized what a piece of garbage they were making and walked off the setbr br take heed vampire fans this one sucks twice as hard
