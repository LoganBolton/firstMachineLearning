the beginning voice over sounds like the wind could be quite an intriguing movie but as the story unfolded i knew it was downhill from there the major things about this movie that blew were the terribly bad acting jobs all the main characters did except for a few scenes involving the inner turmoil of mic there was a total lack of character development and absolutely no point to the plot  what were the writers thinkingbr br michael mongillo won 2 horrorsci fi awards for the wind huh what was so scary about this movie nothing except for the resident evil 2 video shots the rest was more of a made for tv thriller  it wouldnt even have to be edited if you want a far better movie about murder among friends rent shallow grave insteadbr br the wind
