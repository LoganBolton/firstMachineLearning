the wind easily one of the worst films ever made the only good that comes from this kind of pointless drivel is the fact that seeing films like this get distribution makes indy horror filmmakers like me confident that my upcoming feature will make the cut too i mean if this represents the market for indy horror i could make a fortune videotaping myself taking out the garbage for 83 minutes br br a complete list of what this film lacks would take way too long to write out but the highlites are no story terrible acting awful cinematography and virtually no editing that last one bothered me the most as an editor myself this film drove me absolutely crazy because it had almost no editing at all every scene was shot in a master they had absolutely no coverage at all for anyone who doesnt knowcoverage is shooting a scene from multiple angles to have cutting options when editing to make for a desirable viewing experience yeah this movie had none of that im talking about even the simplest of scenes example an ordinary conversation scene between two people sitting at a table would typically start out with a master establishing whos in the scene and where they are then as the conversation goes on you would cut back and forth to overtheshoulder shots as the conversation continues you may even throw in a cutaway shot or two of something on the table or in someones hand anything this is film 101 stuff guys it seems as though these people had no idea this is how films work every shot was a camera lockdown no movement no cutting no nothing if i was teaching a course in filmmaking this would be the visual aid for my what not to do lessonbr br in closing dont waste your time folks the only amazing this about this film is that it ever scored distribution at allbr br  br br
