alright this movie might have been good if there was a plot behind it the title didnt even fit the it after the first ten minutes the wind didnt have a whole lot to do with the rest of the movie the acting was subpar and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a childrens book of scary stories br br as far as horror movies go this shouldnt even be classified as one this was a disgrace to horror and thriller fans everywhere i hate to be so harsh but i felt i want the time i spent watching this movie back hopefully there will not be a follow up to this this movie should be locked in a vault and never released to the public for viewing
