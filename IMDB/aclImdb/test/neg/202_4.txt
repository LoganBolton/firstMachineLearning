this looks so good on paper  matt damon lawrence fishbourne jean reno nice right and a heist with 42 million  sounds like a kickass crime moviebr br big disappointment  i reckon the stars got all the money because the production values on this are lousybr br but more than that it the pseudo reservoir dogs atmosphere when the easy crime goes wrong its very much made for tv stuffbr br all in all hugely disappointing  it score points for being what it is  but loses them massively for being bluntly not very interesting at all
