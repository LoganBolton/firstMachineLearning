it is the early morning of our discontent and some friends of mine and i have just gotten through watching the wind truly a disaster film not in the sense of forces of nature wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting populace but rather an awful movie wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting audience to give you an indication of how frustrating it was to watch this particular bomb ill give you an example quoted during my first pained viewing if given the choice of watching this movie for a second time and say boiling myself im afraid to say the choice would not be an immediate one but rather than simply ranting ad peliculam with lousy oneliners im going to get specific as to why exactly my friends and i panned this particular filmbr br to start this off i like lowbudget horror flicks i even like artsy lowbudget horror flicks i liked cold hearts midnight mass jugular wine etc films that were ambitious and daring even if they were lacking in production value execution and even acting generally an interesting premise unusual camera technique or merely just a well done scene or two will save a movie that is running a little rough around the edges with these provisos in mind i would like to say conclusively that i hated the windbr br the movie was probably most disappointing in the sense that it was incredibly frustrating to watch from the actions of the main characters to the flow  of the plot to the big portents hinted at by the opening which ultimately aspired to dust and did not even attach themselves logically to what transpired in the remainder of the film and left the viewer expecting something more with a sense of much ado about nothing the dialogue was spotty at best woodenly delivered and completely unrealistic by this i mean no one in any of the situations that the characters were in would have reacted the way the characters did or said the things that they said in the way that they said them there was an obvious lack of vision and direction that would have corrected this problem br br character interaction and development was abysmal claire the lambent sex goddess or so the aggravating passiveaggressive lamesters in the movie thought was so overt in her manipulations she may as well have pulled a gun on the characters nevertheless she was the shining high point of the film the other main characters with the exception of micks milfy mom who was not terrible are so indistinct that they may as well have been portrayed by the same actor lets see if i missed anything borderline personality cosubmissive goons with profound feelings of sexual confusion and inadequacy spurred to fits of puerile rage through the artless orchestrations of a looselipped bimbettesuddenlyandunmasterfullyturnedcaligari no i think that about covers itbr br lack of scope was also problematic how did those involved with the making of this film expect the casual viewer to derive that this was the beginning of the end of the world from this amateurish unbelievable poorlyportrayed lust pentagon well what would you call it that occurred largely in the woods in the middle of nowhere there were no witnesses to the atrocities presented there were no witnesses anywhere in this filmbr br the believability problems stemming from this lack of attention to detail were rife even from the point where the plot begins to sicken caseinpoint if that guy bob took that route through the woods to come home from the gym and heres the key every day theres a jolly good chance that someone else would have been around to see something at some point afterwards while the perpetrators argued vociferously about the crime scene one would think that with the murder of a young man in the woods said town would have been in an uproar the characters would have been questioned etc but instead there wasnt a witness in sight other than earl the closet psychopath with no inner monologue we suggest that there be no witnesses for this film either br br as for the quasihomosexual meanderings present i dont have a problem with those either its not as if they came as a surprise considering we had been shouting as to the closet case stati of most of the male characters since the second scene again not problematic in and of itself but thrown in for the wrong reasons it was utterly unnecessary thrown in for pure shock andor dangerous art value and neither shocking nor dangerously artistic from any perspective what we had instead was an awkward attempt to redeem a boring clumsy movie with a boring clumsy plot the poorly hintedat sexual tension which was only hinted at heavyhandedly in anticipation of this flaccid snogging scene only pushed this film further down the totem pole from mediocrity warranting criticism to film sucking so bad that it lacks the inherent grace to suck enough to properly mock and haranguebr br so it is with most of the film a lot of artistic fumbling very little meat and a lot of aggravation its not that we dont get it oh we got it alright we just dont want it look the very fact that we were cheering the bludgeoning in the final scene as the only tableau that made sense on its face is an indication that something was terribly wrong with this film rather than moving briskly along as its name implies this movie oozed languidly forward like the sweat trail working its way down the side of your nose while your hands are full argh that sensation pretty well sums up the gutwrenching frustration realized while watching this train wreck there is no breath of fresh air with regard to this movie only the stale miasma of bad ideas poorly realized putrefying before coming to fruition
