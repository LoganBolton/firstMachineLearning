brilliant acting excellent plot wonderful special effects this is what i would say about this movie if i had been watching it with a bag of diarreha on my head for the entire film instead i endured a 2 hour craporama our brilliant story begins with some billionare who has nothing better to do than look in volcanoes in a vain attempt to find his lucky charms instead he finds a 54 man in a cheesy rubber dinosaur suit and some queer cavefolkbr br in his infinite wisdom along with his infinitely large nosehe decides to go inside this volcano with a team of special people to travel to this underground land they go by plane no boat no they use this giant soup can with a solid metal drill on the end that i swear i saw wobble in summation this movie was faker thanoh thats right this was the fakest movie ive seen for those of you who havent seen it and are thinking of sitting down on a sunday afternoon with this wonderful movie i warn you if you watch this movie you should be prepared to cut of any shred of your manhood and give yourself a full frontal lobotomybr br eccchhh the rating system only allows for a minimum of 110 i give this a 1010
