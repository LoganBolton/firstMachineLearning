kinda boring kinda gross kinda unsettling this wasnt horrible but not too good theres a good creepy bit when the statue comes to life though props to this scene not much happens and the movie just feels sort of scummy i was happy when it ended and dont believe anything about this being a true storyvery surprised this is averaging around 6
