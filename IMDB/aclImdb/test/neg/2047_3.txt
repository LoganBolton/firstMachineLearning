as americans we have come to expect crapiness as par for the course when it comes to horror and unknown directors directing unknown actors acting for unknown writers we truly expect this to suck  when they dont suckit becomes an over night successbr br this is not an over night success nor is it an over the weekend or over the month success this blows from start to finish and my only recommendation is this go into this knowing it sucks enjoy it for what it is for what it isnt  if you have something better to do keep this on the back way back burner its entertaining in the way watching the elderly cross a busy street during rush hour but dont expect muchthey almost never get hit by an actual car its just a lot of hoopla
