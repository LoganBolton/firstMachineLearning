simply i just watched this movie just because of sarah  am also giving these 4 stars just because of heron the other side this movie was easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen theacting was horrible the script was uninspired this was a movie that kept contradicting itself the film was sloppy and unoriginal its not like i was expecting a good film just something to give me a jump or two this did not even do thatbr br he worst thing is that the more i think about the overall plot the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we keep finding a real shame really as im fairly sure that there was a good idea lurking in there somewherebr br im perhaps being a bit harsh giving the film a 410 but given the actors involved and again sara obvious writing talent this film really should have delivered far morebr br this movie is just crap i cant put it differently since the very beginning one knows is going to be crapbr br the story dialogue acting special effects makeup pretty much everything sucks i like vampire movies and i know they will never be oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing i cant believe how somebody produced this thingbr br its not even about vampires its more about a dreamreality experience the development of the movie is incoherent the motivation of the characters is doesnt exist everything seems like a big joke maybe thats what they tried to do but i sincerely doubt it i wish i knew what they tried to pull but it just backfired its definitely one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life and ive seen many bad movies but nothing compared to this please make yourselves a favor and do not watch thisbr br ps its also full of clich√©s ps 2 bad script bad directing bad cinematography ps 3 i bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone
