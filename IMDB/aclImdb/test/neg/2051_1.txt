bled starts as young female artist sai sarah ferooqui meets a mysterious yet charming man named renfield jonathan oldham  they end up back at her studio apartment where he gives her the bark of some sort of tree which is used as a hallucinogenic drug when melted down sai quickly becomes hooked as she is whisked into an alternate fantasy reality which involve vampiric creatures sais photographer friend royce chris ivan cevic becomes concerned about her as she drifts further from reality as she becomes addicted to the drug can royce her kick the drug or will it end up ruining her life  why did the mysterious renfield get her addicted to the stuff in the first place  do the elaborate fantasy dream like trips have any significancebr br coproduced  directed by christopher hutson this anaemic arty vampire flick is pretty much 95 minutes of tedium  is throughly deserving of all the bad comments the script was written by the interestingly named sxvleithan essex how the hell do you even pronounce that anyway who is also credited as production designer  his unusual name is actually more interesting than anything that ever happens in bled i would guess that the makers set out to make a very serious fantasy based horror film with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs drug addiction  date rape drug at its core the majority of the film is spent on the drug issue with sais initial introduction to the drug how great the first time was  how she becomes hopelessly addicted which eventually destroys her her life  her friends lives its never explained where she keeps getting this drug from as renfield only gives her a little bit during their initial meeting but hey who cares the first twenty odd minutes of bled are really boring  dull the following hour or so arent much better before a mess of a final ten minutes which involve a vampiric monster  renfield making a reappearance the moral elements are patronising the fantasy elements seem like an afterthought  the horror is none existent theres also the dialogue which is awful every sentence tries to be profound have loads of hidden depth  just tries to have so much meaning that it becomes tiresome to listen tobr br the concept of the film is terrible  so is the execution as theres absolutely no gore or violence to speak of  the entire thing is set inside an apartment that doesnt appear to have any lights the fantasy setting looks a little better but its sparsely seen  underused there are no scares here no atmosphere  to make matters even worse the makers have decided to used muted very faded colours which i just hate  find annoying whats wrong with a nice colourful image it seems to me to be a fad with current filmmakers who seem to think that it automatically makes a film cool or adds atmosphere which it most certainly doesnt more often than not it just makes your film look dull  drab as evidenced here with bledbr br this probably had a low budget  was shot in los angeles  it has reasonable production values but its all so dull the acting didnt impress me i didnt care for or about anyone which is never a good signbr br bled is a terrible vampire film that goes for psychological horror as well as physical with all sorts of parallels to real life dug addiction  what it can do to little or no effect because the whole thing is so dull there might be an audience for a film such as this but considering the other comments not that big a one
