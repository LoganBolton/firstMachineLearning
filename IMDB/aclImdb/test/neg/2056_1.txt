once again i fell for it in my roots i crave a fun and gory horror film even a vampire one even if its stupid as long as i get my fun gore in the mix im a happy camper it doesnt take much so i saw the cover of bled over at hollywood video and was kind of curious what it was about it looked kind of interesting so i decided to rent it why why do i always fall for it not only did this movie not fulfill the satisfaction i needed for my gore and senseless violence and nudity but i was bored out of mind this movie has the kahoonies to say its a vampire movie and its really not im so close to going back to the store and begging for money back because this is one of the rare times i actually turned the movie offbr br an artist meets a vampire i think dunno im still trying to figure out what the heck he was but his name was reinfield so im assuming maybe hes a cockroach eating guy who likes to freak people out i think i dunno anyways he thinks the artist has a certain flare for darkness so he gives her a drug to go into an alternate fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive i think i dunno so her friends get excited and decide they wanna try the drug too i think i dunno so after they decide to try the drug things get weird the fantasies are real i think i dunno and the vampire is now enjoying the will big breasted girls in scandly clad clothing i think i dunno but a couple of the girls really end up being vampires i think i dunnobr br sorry for all the i dunnos this is possibly one of the worst reviews im going to write but thats because this movie was just awful boring and confusing i love just seeing these wanna be actors who you can tell are waiters looking for that big break not too smart that they fell in the clich√© of the horror genre sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt in this case they really should have read the script because the movie the look the feel the acting everything about this movie was just bad i really recommend that you just pass the movie if you see it at your video store this possibly could have been an interesting movie with its concept of a different dimension but why did they pick this director to display his creativity if he even has any this was a bad movie just stay awaybr br 110
