this movie is just crap i cant put it differently since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap br br the story dialogue acting special effects makeup pretty much everything sucks i like vampire movies and i know they will never be oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing i cant believe how somebody produced this thingbr br its not even about vampires its more about a dreamreality experience the development of the movie is incoherent the motivation of the characters is doesnt exist everything seems like a big joke maybe thats what they tried to do but i sincerely doubt it i wish i knew what they tried to pull but it just backfired its definitely one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life and ive seen many bad movies but nothing compared to this please make yourselves a favor and do not watch this br br ps its also full of clich√©s ps 2 bad script bad directing bad cinematography ps 3 i bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone
