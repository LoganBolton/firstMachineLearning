this film is a disaster from beginning to end 75 percent of the movie is made from scenes taken from hercules  the haunted world and hercules  the captive women badly edited together with original scenes that do not add up to anything but a complete ripoff im a big fan of those two movies and seeing scenes taken from them reedited and redubbed with nonsensical dialogue made my head spin these kind of cheap producers tactics to make more money by duping unsuspecting audiences basically killed the sword  sandal genre back in the 1960sbr br there is one memorable scene in the new footage and its the one when hercules fights with the bad hercules the fight is albeit cool and giovanni cianfriglia who plays antaius definitely stands out he makes a memorable nemesis to herc but the rest is borderline embarrassing that was probably shot in a daybr br avoid at all cost
