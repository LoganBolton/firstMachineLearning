this movie is of interest to the fans of the famous rock group the band in that singer keyboardist richard manuel appears in several scenes it looks to me like the movie might have been shot some years before 75 judging by richards looks interestingly jones would later act with the bands levon in a considerably better film coal miners daughter anyway you really need a special reason to outlast this tough to watch art film alas the famously sensitive manuel would commit suicide ive never heard how he ended up in a movie four of the five members of the band would appear in another bad film man outside
