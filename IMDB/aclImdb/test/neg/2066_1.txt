i dont even know where to beginbr br its is not worth typing a review so i will just quote what another user posted because i agree thoroughly but i give it 1  10 instead of 2  10 i am at a loss to find the words to express how bad i thought this film was the initial precept was promising but in all respects afterwards it was totally awful lets run through the main points plot  good initial idea but truly terrible development there were many points when i thought no nobody would do something that stupid the ending was amazingly anticlimactic characterisation  all of the characters were either completely bland or grotesque caricatures i keep trying to think of one that wasnt  possibly the mother but thats it music  intrusive inappropriate and generally terrible direction  totally amateurish cinematography  doubt theyve heard of it camera angles  stability  zoom levels often really bad i am totally bemused at how this film has scored so highly its the worst movie ive seen at the cinema for years if not ever
