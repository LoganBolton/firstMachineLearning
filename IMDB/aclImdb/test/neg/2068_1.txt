as the film reviewer for a local gay magazine i automatically get sent any dreck if it happens to have a homo in it chicken tikka masala is churning on in the background as i write this i gave it my undivided attention for 53 minutes before i found myself involuntarily shouting  like a tourrettes sufferer this is the shtest film i have ever seen were just coming to the emotional climax where the son is giving some coming out speech to his father at his wedding father seems to be taking it quite well an attempted honour killing at this point would at least have livened the film up a bit and made it funnier br br i didnt particularly like beautiful thing for example but could at least see why other people did it was made with some professionalism and i seem to remember it had at least a couple of good lines the lack of wit in this film is quite astounding  even the most mediocre sitcom will tend to have recognisable jokes the nearest this movie got to being funny at least in its first 53 mins was the subtitled comment delivered to the fat unattractive female lead look at her with her legs wide open  shes like the mersey tunnel completely witless and i didnt crack a smile but i could imagine someone with a low iq who perhaps works in a chip shop enjoying itbr br id imagine its some lotteryfunded atrocity if not i can at least console myself with the fact that the backers will lose a substantial amount of money as even a lowbudget british film will still set someone back a couple of million seriously if i met the most handsome bloke in the world and on going back to his place to make sweet love i found a copy of this in his dvd collection man i love this film id probably kick him in the nuts and leave forthwith and this from someone whos gone about six months without any of the aforementioned sweet love br br oh lord i hate this film
