another pretentious film from vicente aranda if juana la loca shinned of the same at least its quality was superior mainly thanks to the great performance of pilar l√≥pez de ayala but carmen is boring and full of topics ardent brunette with a dagger in the stocking poor man dragged to madness due to passion sierra nevada gangs torerosbr br obviously paz vega is a pretty woman but about its talent therere more doubts and sbaraglia role is so stupid that results almost incredible the script is weak and and arandas presumptuous character influences the entire film with these ingredients the result could not be goodbr br not the worst film ive seen but a complete failure in my opinion
