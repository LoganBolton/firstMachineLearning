when i saw this in the cinema i remember wincing at the bad acting about a minute or two into the first scene then immediately telling myself no this has to get better it didnt the performances are pretty uniformly teak n pine and no there is no sexual chemistry in this film whatsoever just the awkward posturings of a reasonably comely discreetly talentless actress who seems born to grace the cover of interviú and not much else besides if the scriptwriter thought that making mérimée a character was a stunningly original creative ploy he perhaps ought to get out more and aranda if hed given the matter a bit more thought would have realised that the story of carmen is just crying out for a thoughtful iconoclastic parodic deconstruction not this leaveyourbrainsattheturnstile affair of ersatz passion and comicbook dialogue this is contemporary spanish cinema at its worstbr br
