before launching into whether this film is worth your time or not i should inform you ive never seen another adaptation of carmen so if youre looking for a review on how it ranks amongst others this might not be of much use to youbr br the only time ive come across carmen was on the car stereo when driving through spain on a family holiday when i was a teenager i didnt pay much attention to it because i didnt like opera at the time and i didnt know any better the story has been around for 150 years or so do i feel ive missed out after seeing this movie yes mainly due to the plot but also because if all the actresses who played carmen looked like paz vega i would have all the adaptations happily sitting in my dvd collectionbr br directed by vicente aranda who also corewrote the story with joaquim jordà the story is told through the eyes of the original author prosper mérimée a french writer making his way through 19th century spain he comes across josé leonardo sbaraglia a delinquent soldier and one of many men who fall in love with carmen paz vega a sultry sexy bedazzling gypsy woman who has the mouth of the devil the temper of a toro and who recklessly leads men to their doom the moment she meets josé she is attracted by his standoffish behaviour but she hooks him reels him in and lets him go manyatime until one day josé is wanted for murder carmen persuades him to join her band of gypsy smugglers they seem to be settling shes fallen in love with him but she meets the charming escamillo the bullfighter can josé hold his jealousy in check or does it destroy him br br its a beautifulseductive story something that resembles almost a shakespearian or ovid plot with the portrayals of immense passion and emotion that can make or break us and transform us to do things out of character its poetic fiery and above all slutty i was left hanging on i didnt know which way it was going to turn i always hoped that josé might change carmens dirty little ways i wont tell you if he succeeded or notbr br the above synopsis is what i took away from the film but i was not impressed by the film itself it was only after i watched it that i dug a little deeper into the story and i realised how much of a missed opportunity aranda had made of retelling mérimées classic it was a shallow slutty perioddrama blunder that saw paz vega spend a lot of the time partially or completely naked not that im complaining about this in particularbr br first of all the acting was poor i was not impressed by sbaraglia as josé im still unsure whether he was a weak actor or josé was supposed to be a weak character ive not read the book hes supposed to be a man who with burning desire for carmen but he spends much of the time looking confused jealous and a bit dim paz vega was slightly better as carmen i was convinced by her hardened wicked character although i have seen more convincing performances by her in other films such as zapping and lucia y el sexo she seems too pretty to play a gypsy woman not that ive come across many andalusian gypsy women so in a way the role didnt really fit her the other actors in the film werent great either they seemed to do everything halfheartedly the story is passionate emotive  they looked halfarsed as if they couldnt wait to get out the tight 19th century costumes they were wearingbr br however the costumes i was impressed with  one of the redeeming factors of the film i like spanish culture i liked the soldiers uniforms the tophats and the womens flamenco dresses they fitted the time well thats all i can really say about that sorry back to the criticismbr br the script as stated above was corewritten by vicente aranda and joaquim jordà and done so badly so much that it would leave mérimée turning in his grave it was boring it didnt make best use of josés intense passion for carmen or maybe that was just the acting there were cheesy lines piled upon one and other satan and devil connotations everywhere amongst the millions of swear words i know the spanish are partial for the odd swear word but the film was littered with puta whore in literally every line maybe it was realistic in 19th century povertystricken seville but the story itself didnt need itbr br the editing and camera work was dull and ordinary there was only one bit i actually liked and that was when the camera follows a fly closeup in midair which lands on carmens face that was good but the rest boringbr br to conclude it is sad to see such a great story go to waste with unconvincing acting and directing if youre a literature teacher by all means let your class watch this adaptation to get an idea of the story however only the male half of the class will be paying any interest to the film thanks to paz vega otherwise stick to the opera version even though i hate musicals i give this film 4 just for the fact i love the storyline and paz vega
