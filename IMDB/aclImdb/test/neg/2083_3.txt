watchable but pretty terrible how shocking that this was the great gregory la cavas last directing credit even in his better known roles i dont care for gene kelly he seems to me to be smug hostile and selfinvolved here paired with a minor actress like marie wilson he seems to show those characteristics in spadesbr br marie wilson playing an heiress who falls for a military man is exceptionally hard and unsympathetic the actors seem to be working hard to get past the hard disagreeable core of the picture and they do okbr br the knowitall butler is apparently meant to be funny but he seems like an extended riff on the prissy bits for which franklin pangborn was famous and in which despite their stereotyping he was generally funny  unlike this guy phyllis thaxter is as always very appealing in a rather underdeveloped secondary plot
