i picked this dvd up for 399 at rogers video in order to get enough points to get a better movie for free i never actually was planning on watching this but it started poking at my curiosity and i finally decided to pop in it the dvd player the effects in this movie are horrible and cheap some of the dialog in this movie sounds like it was written by a swear happy 12 year old boy the acting is really cheesy in some parts and the action scenes are completely laughable youll burst out laughing at some parts which was a positive for me because it kept me mildly entertained the plot is some girl has a curse on her which causes her to vomit snakes so some shaman has to get her to los angeles there are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs there and a few other people that are unimportant to the plot not that there really is a plot at alldont expect anything from this movie and dont listen to the cover there are not 100 passengers and 3000 vipers there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakesbr br as for the dvd there is a trailer which is almost as laughable as the film a blooper reel which is just one shot over and over of one actor trying to say train and the deleted scenes are really pointless if they werent good enough to stay in this movie they must be pretty bad there is also a really bad making of featurette which doesnt really show much at all except that the people involved with this movie were kind of idiots i cant recommend it unless you want a really bad movie that you can laugh at with friends i give it 2 kitty cats out of 5
