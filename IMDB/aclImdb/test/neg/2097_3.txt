overall this is a pretty bad film but for 5 at pathmark it wasnt a total wastebr br the whole scenario has to do with a guy who is with this lady infected with snakes supposedly from a magic curse the actorsactresses arent names that are big even though some look like from tv shows so i wont do my usual troy mcclure thingbr br for awhile the film holds your interest as the couple hop a train and travel to la to see a shaman to undo the curse theres a bit of other plots going on too like two ladies smuggling drugsbr br but the last 20 minutes turn out to be a total let down as violent and gory as the whole film is the grand finale is just totally computer animatedbr br i saw the unrated version which had tons of language gore blood violence everything the bonus features were okbr br overall grade d
