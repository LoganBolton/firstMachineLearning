snakes on a train is a movie i rented due to the pure amusement of the thoughts i had about the movie snakes on a plane was an enjoyable action film so obviously the film makers wanted to cash in on the success with this low budget effort at 85 minutes snakes on a train is almost unbearable to witness i had to keep pausing the film to do something to entertain myself due to the lack of happenings in the film throughout the duration of the film its never fully explained why this girl has this curse or why she keeps coughing up this greenpurplish goo constantly not only that there is endless boring dialog of the two main characters brujo and alma discussing how to get rid of the curse i can appreciate low budget filmmaking im truly not picky on movies im open to any genre or budget but snakes on a train is truly one of the worst horror films i have ever seen were the writers on acid or something at the end of this film why did the woman suddenly turn into a giant snake and most importantly how on earth was it able to devour the trainbr br bottom line snakes on a train is a movie that needs to be avoided at all costs dont be intrigued like i was by the title this is a movie thats seriously bad lets put these snakes to restbr br 010
