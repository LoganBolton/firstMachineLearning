snakes on a train starts as mexican couple brujo aj castro  alma julia ruiz cross the boarder into the us they then illegally board a seventeen hour train to los angeles however almas family didnt approve of her  brujos relationship  placed an ancient black magic curse on her that turns all her insides into snakes aint life a btch as the snakes pour out of almas mouth  slither away to other parts of the train they begin to infect the other passengers with the same unusual ailmentbr br edited  directed by the mallachi brothers although the imdb claims its just one guy using a pseudonym peter mervis one has to say that i thought snakes on a train was crap its as simple as that really it seems the entire film was setup  made to cash in on the samuel l jackson cult flick snakes on a plane 2006 by every horror fans least favourite production company the asylum who specialise in rippingoff big budget hollywood flicks  that style of money  filmmaking is no more evident than here with snakes on a train making a film just because the title rhymes with a more successful film is not a good starting point the script by eric forsberg is rubbish for a start snakes on a plane was great fun whereas snakes on a train is a lot more serious  when you actually break it down  look at it this should have been much more light hearted in fact it probably would have worked better as an scary movie 2000 type spoof you know something i am struggling to find one positive thing to say about snakes on a train its that bad for a start the characters are rubbish  its impossible to emote with anyone the story is downright awful  makes no sense if people spew all those small snakes up where did the huge ones come from why did alma turn into the giant snake at the end why did bujo kill the train driver how was he going to stop the train once it reached los angeles where did that typhoon come from at the end it takes itself far too seriously the first seventy odd minutes is so boring  uneventful i am surprised i stayed awake  its just a very very poor film on just about every levelbr br director mervis only has a few train carriage car sets which all look pretty much alike so the film becomes very repetitive  dull to watch theres barely any blood or gore there are some snakes borrowing under a few peoples skin someone gets shot  thats about it the special effects are rubbish too the giant cgi snake at the end is truly awful  the least said about it the better its not scary theres zero atmosphere  its a bit of a bore from start to finish the real live snakes are a problem too they are just so docile  nonthreatening if you look at any scene featuring a real snake  an actor the snakes never make any move towards them or act aggressively  in fact always appear to want to slither away in the opposite directionbr br shot in california technically the film is obviously low budget  it shows basically it looks cheap because it is the acting isnt great not that the actors are given any sort of material to work withbr br snakes on a train is rubbish i am sorry but thats how i feel  i dont quite know how else to describe it i really cant see what anyone would get out of watching snakes on a train it really is that bad
