there are spoilers but trust me im doing you a favorbr br my friends and i like to watch crappy movies every so often inspired by mystery science theater and our knack for on the spot jokes we set out to find movies worth watching that are in factnot worth watching however trouble comes into paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them and i am a firm believer in not giving one cent to such a group of talentless scumbags so as another reviewer has said films like this are a reason why downloading movies for free should be legalized i prefer the idea of instead of straight to video you have straight to internet that way the assbags who made this travesty wont ever turn a profit which unfortunately you know they do they hire a bunch of actors who cant act special effects from a high school classroom rubber snakes you can get at the dollar store constant vomiting of green jello and the two main characters who seem to switch between being border jumping mexicans who only speak spanish to arabs to being 100 fluent in english random nudity a guy being shot like 10 times including one to the side of the head and living and the most retarded ending in the history of film book cave drawings and hustler magazine the fact that i actually predicted that the jello puking snake girl would actually transform into a snake about half way through terrifies mebr br anyways the movie is great to make fun of but you have to make sure theres at least 4 of you and youre all spitting out jokes in rapid fire because if theres even 1 second of watching this movie where youre not laughing your ass off you will feel physically ill i kid you not my friends and i were eating chicken wings and now i cant even look at such a thing anymore without being reminded of this piece of shtbr br this film is one above alien vs hunter which is by far the second worst movie ever made and ive seen lots of bad movies incidentally its the same production company as this film and that bald guy is in both as well just thought you might like to know that little fun fact 100 out 0f 10
