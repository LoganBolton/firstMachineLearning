oh good griefbr br i saw this movie title in the tv schedules and thought i must watch this movie ripping off snakes on a plane it will be terrible but hopefully laughable too sounds fantastically bad well i was half rightbr br this movie is eyemeltingly bad and sadly not even unintentionally hilarious its just bad even worse it takes almost an hour to get to anything resembling action for the first half of the movie we have to endure some mumbled foreign language mexican or spanish apologies for my ignorance and terrible acting as some woman vomits up live snakes for reasons we only find out later on then we have to endure even more terrible acting and we find out that those mumbling in the foreign language could speak english anyway as the snakes finally get loose on the train and things move from the sedate to the ridiculousbr br lowbudget does not always mean bad but in this case it does what we have here is a movie given no thought a terrible script a bad cast and not even the sense to capitalise on its very few strengths i give two marks for a few decent special effects and a whacky ending but that still feels a bit too generous avoid if you canbr br see this if you like stagknight the wicker man remake terrible cgi
