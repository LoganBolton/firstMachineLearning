i would probably want to give this movie a zero if not for the climax which involves not really snakes on a train but rather train in a snake the premise was cooked up far more than likely over the course of a night of beers after hearing about snakes on a plane in production this in fact was released to coincide with that films release the joke is probably not lost on those who will seek this out i dont think there would be a soul out there who would consider this anything as a serious actionthriller effort unless on an ironic level beyond the capacity for rational thought its about a mayan curse placed on a woman whos damned by her family for leaving with another man and is soon seen sickened and coughing up green slime laced with of course snakes she and her beau go on a train headed for los angeles and very soon after the morethanclich√© characters are privy to snakes overtaking the train with the originator woman becoming a snake herself br br if it would be worth listing more about the movie i would but there isnt enough time during the day all that can be said for the quality factor is that its almost onexistent there are student short films with larger budgets maybe that was a wise calculation on the filmmakers end that there would be so many copies sold just for the joke factor alone that they would recoup their budget in the first weekend because by looking at the sets the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of a scene the actors if you can call them that with only one other actor the one with the very thin hair who hits on the one woman throughout the movie who benefited from the flick being produced the fx also next to nonexistent making the effects in snakes on a plane seem like star wars and the actual cgi snakes themselves with the final huge behemoth snake something to behold in scifi movie channel termsbr br this all means basically that it is a laugh riot every step of the way especially as cruel as it sounds when a little girl becomes involved in a snakes attention with the very disregard for good taste working well in its favor this being said it is also 100 disposable like a bmovie sourflavor lollipop
