for their credit this is one of their more competent pieces of trash and thats because theres considerably good gore and an interesting take on ripping off snakes on a plane but if theres any more of example of the inconsistency behind asylums newest ripoff its the two characters at the beginning whom are illegal immigrants and cant understand nor speak english to a texas man sneaking them across the border yet when they get on a train and meet a friend they begin understanding and speaking perfect englishbr br aside from being a pretty bad depiction of a hollywood formula snakes on a train is utterly boring at least with snakes on a plane we were given the chance to watch actors wax comedic and attempt to be remotely interesting the mallachi brothers installment features some of the most boring characters ive ever seen from an electrical engineer gee i wonder how he comes in handy later on to some stoner surfers right down to our two main characters attempting to fight off the snake curse that lurks in the husbands wifebr br snakes is never entertaining and even when its very gory its still never as good as it has the chance to be because snakes could have been a funny short film and instead just takes itself much too seriously and never camps it up at any moment instead of taking their small budget and making original films that can set a precedent they instead force their small budget to work against them in these knock offs while the mallachi brothers seem to be trying the train just looks incredibly artificialbr br it seems almost like a stage play with these inconsistent and awfully bland set pieces that try desperately to look like actual train cars while every so often it shakes the background of the windows are blurred and the sound effects go off every now and then to let us know theyre actually on a train not to mention that in such a large extended train there only seems to be about ten passengers on it and beyond the train fight and a drawn out sex scene were forced to be subjected to a plot that makes zero sense and not even the directors can work around the fact that the lethal snakes that go on this train look far from venomous or dangerousbr br the rest of the film staggers onto only about a minute of snake carnage and a bad subplot of an ex drug agent trying to molest a passenger all of this dull exposition ends with a really ridiculous climax in which a poorly computer generated snake i saw better animation on the super nintendo completely swallows the train whole and is then dispensed in a method that should have been exercised from the very beginning asylum scores againbr br asylum scores yet again with a hackneyed lazy horribly directed and boring ripoff of another better film snakes on a train takes itself way too seriously and thats why its never entertaining or memorable
