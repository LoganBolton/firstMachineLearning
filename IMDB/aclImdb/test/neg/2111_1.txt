can i just start by saying im a fan of bad movies and this is a really bad movie it states on the front 100 passengers 3000 snakes but i think its more accurate to say 12 passengers and about 20 snakesbr br the snakes dont do anything particularly interesting the whole movie in fact just blunders on with little happening although there is occasionally a great gore shot of pulsating arms and green goo puke bad movies have to have green goo dont theybr br but then the ending comes along and will quite literally smack you off you seat in hysteria and for that this movie gets a boost up to a 2 ratingbr br there are certain movies about in the world that you will want to show to your friends just so you can watch there reaction when a certain event happens in thembr br for example the arrival of big man in r kellys trapped in the closet the line in shark attack 3 youll know it when you hear it the arrival of the mama shark in shark attack 3 almost every scene of troll 2 the ending of dracula 3000 just for utter disbelief and confusion and the end of this movie proudly sits in this category its worth sitting through just for that so get drunk stoned whatever your poison is and watch this movie with some matesbr br quite simply if you like bad movies get this but dont get it confused with snakes on a plane  theres no relationbr br and dont pay more than a fiver for it either
