i think this movie can be called the movie of misdirected ragebr br the characters of joe and bob were relics of the wwii generation who didnt quite understand their kids opposing the war taking drugs and listening to rock and roll but i think their real rage was at the fact that america was beginning her long decline from the heights the war left her atbr br joe himself is a lowrent archie bunker ranting at all the things that have made him angry living his life of quiet desperation until he teams up with compton a guy who wants to avenge himself on the hippies who ruined his daughterbr br honestly most of the movie looks silly the characters are worse than one dimensional theyre laughable peter boyle was capable of better stuff
