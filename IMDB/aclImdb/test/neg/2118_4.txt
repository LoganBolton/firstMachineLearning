this is a perfect example of the 90s mainstream horror crapnothing is scary here and the film is almost bloodlessyesthere is some violencebut everything is politically correct like in a tv moviethis is not a completely bad picturei can safely say that i found it quite enjoyablehowever a lack of the originality really hurts voodooall in all if you are a part of the mainstream audience and pseudohorror movies like scream are your favourite then youll love voodoobut if you want something very gruesome avoid this film
