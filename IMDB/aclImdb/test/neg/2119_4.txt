this is a perfect example of why many people say the 90s sucked when it comes to horrormovies a boring voodoooncampus tale of terror starring the once so promising corey feldman stand by me the lost boys etc there might be just enough stuff happening to keep you from falling asleep and it doesnt look too cheap but this still is horror aimed at an audience that were in their very early teens during the 90s i might have been part of that audience but still i got as good as nothing out of it when watching it now and nowadays teens are used to a lot more and better already and i cant imagine any of them knowing or caring about who corey feldman was or is actually as the dudes still making films but the only thing still linking him to his days of glory is the lost boys 2 the tribe sequel that got made recently and i imagine even that one isnt going to encourage anyone to seek out voodoo just another movie that got lost in 90s horror for obvious reasons
