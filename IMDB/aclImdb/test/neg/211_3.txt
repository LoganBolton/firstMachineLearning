after watching this for 15 minutes i knew how it would end its a clich√© film with a stupid setup im a big fan of thief films but this one does not deliver anything new smart or special its about an insider heist gone bad because hot headbad guy shots a bum and of course do goodybad guy goes on a moral trip the reason why its stupid and not believable is when youve already gone so far to kill a bum why not just kill the one guy that stands between you and 43 million they got 45 minutes to stash the money and stage a robbery nobody in there right mind would hesitate to shoot mr do goody and in this case he is a guy they known for a few days all and all i was leaning to fast forwarding from the middle of it but i duked it out and boy do i regret it
