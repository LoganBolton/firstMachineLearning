the lousiest of all lousy jaws ripoffs was regretfully made by one of my alltime favorite directors lamberto bava here under his john old jr pseudonym you know how it goes in these cheap european imitations right they only want their monstrous animal to be be bigger sicker and more threatening but this more than often results in the opposite effect bavas creature is a humongous seadevil and its more than just a shark were seemly dealing with a prehistoric monster here with the jaws and appetite of a great white but it also has tentacles like an octopus its up to a couple of dolphinloving oceanologists to discover how this monster was able to survive all these thousands of years and why exactly he only started his killing spree now the script of monster shark makes few to no sense and most of the action takes place on the mainland the shark itself is an unintentionally laughable creation and it was a wise decision of lamberto bava to only show it vaguely and in quick flashes the acting performances are above average and the underwater photography is surprisingly clear and wellhandled the twists in the plot are predictable and youll probably have the most fun spotting detailed facts about the characters for example count all the cans of beer dr hogan drinks throughout the whole movie
