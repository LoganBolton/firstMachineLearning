yikesbr br ive seen quite a few bad movies in my days a lot of them in the company of mike tom crow and the others from mst3k so was the case with this one as well and even though i found the movie in itself quite funny it wouldnt have been nearly as fun without the mst3k commentarybr br the movie is a prime example of really bad movies coming out of europe during the eighties horrible music horrible acting horrible plot what little there is horrible dialogue and really really really horrible editing cripesbr br this might be called a turkey if it werent for the fact that its not unique in any way whatsoever its pretty much the same kind of film that almost every italian hack of a director cranked outbr br so try and get the mst3k version its a pretty fun episode with mike and gang in quite good form
