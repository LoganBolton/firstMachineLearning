this cheapo exploitation flick is some genuinely insipid stuff courtesy of spaghetti land director lamberto bava who wisely left his name off this junkbr br the basic crux of this outing concerns the discovery of some brutally mutilated individuals being washedup on shore in the caribbean authorities initially believe them to be victims of shark attacks but as the investigation unravels turns out to be something much more sinisterbr br all of this ultimately amounts to very little however we have here  poor dubbing complimented by similarly weak script which often consists of nonsensical jabbering and is really of little consequence for the most part acting can only be described as subpar which is par for the course in this instance truly lax direction doesnt help things eitherbr br special effect mainly is for numerous closeups of various gory bodies missing limbs and so forth of course there is the obligatory creature which periodically emerges at feeding time which looks something like a big monster octopus thing where its animation only consists of its pointed teeth ascending and descending in rhythmic articulation overall the end result is none too convincing sure but admittedly is almost entertaining in a cheesy kind of fashionbr br it seems what the film makers were going for was a sort of lowrent hybrid of jaws and piranha but the final product is just a bloody shambles much like the corpses incessantly shown throughout this picture i find it difficult to think of any redeeming attributes to warrant viewing this so moreover strictly for incurable monster movie addicts
