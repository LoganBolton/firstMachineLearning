i wish i had something more positive to say about devil fish but i honestly cant seem to come up with much i cant even come up with many of those so bad its good kind of moments devil fish is just plain old bad the plot is completely derivative jaws anyone the acting is wooden the characters are uninteresting the special effects are beyond bad and the score is annoying add to that the seemingly inept direction of lamberto bava and youve got one stinker of a movie i think however that the films biggest sin is its lack of a budget it doesnt appear that bava had much to work with by 1984 the italian film industry was in full decline  especially as far as genre films go the funding available to bava was most probably very meager films like devil fish that rely on special effects just never had a chance to be good its not the only italian film to suffer this fate there are a number of italian movies made in the mid80s whose ideas and concepts far exceeded what anyone could realistically have expected given their budgetary limitations br br however having said all that and noting the films many weaknesses i cant bring myself to rate devil fish lower than a 310 ive even considered rating it higher but cant because i realize how bad a movie it is why dont i rate it lower well thats hard to explain despite the many problems found in the movie theres something about devil fish that i inexplicably enjoy it could be as simple as my love for lowbudget cheesy italian movies maybe my taste in movies is horribly skewed but i enjoy what i enjoybr br the mystery science theater 3000 treatment of devil fish is actually very enjoyable i rate devil fish a 45 on my mst3k rating scale the guys do a fine job of poking fun at the movies many flaws one very astute observation comes very early in the commentary when tom servo notes just because you can edit doesnt mean you should  highlighting yet another of the many weaknesses to be found in devil fish
