never before has such a large cast of ugly people gathered together to make an equally ugly filmbr br something huge and horrifying is loose in the waters off the florida coast something that leaves half chewed up bodies behind in its wake unshaven beer dependent bob thinks he has caught the things evil voice on tape bobs assistant the amazingly unattractive and painfully skinny stella decides to enlist the help of slimy ladies man peter an electrician whose equipment may be able to help them locate the mysterious creature but anyone who sticks their nose too far into the mystery winds up dead killed by a baboon faced hitman with a bad perm what is the terrible secret behind the sea killer br br ugly scientists have torrid affairs inept cops and doctors puzzle over the increasing numbers of corpses stella and peter make out on the beach and characters we dont care about are killed off or munched up the sea killer a weird combination of an octopus a shark and a pair of large dentures never really seems as threatening as it should the conspiracy behind the monsters creation makes no sense whatsoever none of the characters are particularly likable and the ones who might be are killed off immediately this is a poorly shot badly dubbed plot less mess the whole thing is so scuzzy and smelly it made me long for a hot bath ive had sushi plates scarier than this film avoid it unless its the mst3k version
