im not sure what the director and editor were thinking when they were editing this poor excuse for a film but whatever they thought of didnt help this movie it only hurt it and it hurt this film badly the acting for once isnt the problem its the horrible editing scenes will end for no apparent reason while in the middle of an action sequence or people will be cut off in mid sentence im not sure what the story was but it didnt really matter since what i did see was fairly uninteresting just bad all around a huge jaws ripoff and not a good one at that the mst version was funny though 7 for that none for the film itself
