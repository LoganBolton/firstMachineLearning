if i were to rate this movie based solely on the actingscriptproduction etc i would give it one star all these elements are awful i can partially forgive this in light of the films 250 budget the movie does contain many entertaining scenes mostly those of the unintentionally funny variety some of these include a 14yearold kid stealing and driving a bus teenage hooligans one of whom is sporting a joy division tshirt getting scared away from harassing the films protagonists by a woman brandishing an obviously fake firearm and an encounter with a plastic bulls skull in the arizona desertbr br i would have given it 5 stars just for the entertainment value were it not for the presence of that horribly annoying morally pontificating old granny i had to dock one star just because of her who the bleep makes a wedding cake with black frosting anyhow
