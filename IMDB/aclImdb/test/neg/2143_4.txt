ahem i think ill be the only one whos saying this but yes i was a lil bored during the film not to say that this is a bad movie in fact its a very good attempt at portraying the innermost emotions  dilemma sorrow love esp its the directors debut read from somewhere is it true i felt that somethings not quite right maybe its just me im not drawn to the characters enough to immerse me in their world this is a simple story about ordinary people ordinary lives through simple and short dialogs the director tries to relate a simple guys life and how copes with the news of his illness by laughing it away every time oh ya his laughter was kinda cute at first but gradually it gets to me such a deep hearty roar for a gentle man i must say i didnt feel the impact that most readers felt in fact i was more drawn to the trivial scenarios like spitting of watermelon seeds with his sis that clearly shows that theyre comfortable with each other the granny who came back for another shot  this is kinda melancholic the thoughtful gesture of writing down the procedures for his dad  hmm but this is predictable dont misunderstood that im an actionlover independent films are my cup of tea perhaps i just have a really high expectation after watching many deep films that have stronger imagery some asian films worth the watch br br tony takitani depicts loneliness wayward cloud only 1 dialog my sassy girl i like it 430 loneliness as well 15 gangsters lives in local setting before sunrise and before sunset i just have to mention these even though they are not asian films fans will understand
