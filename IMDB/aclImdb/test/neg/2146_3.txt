after slightly over 50 years of avid film watching ive come up with some simple rules for making good moviesbr br 1	introduce your main characters early certainly within the first half hour 2	keep your characters to a minimum if adapting a novel combine characteristics and actions of minor charactersbr br  into one person 3	make sure your characters actions have credibility if necessary create additional scenes to establish motivation 4	keep the action clear violence does not have to be explicit but it must not be confusing either 5	get the best music money can buy frequently it matters more than acting photography etc 6	usually if a movie isnt very good within the first 10 minutes its not going to get any betterbr br cannon for cordoba is a textbook example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed elmer bernsteins score is rinkydink one of the worst ive ever heard in a modestly budgeted movie this is altogether surprising considering bernsteins credentials man with the golden arm the magnificent seven the great escape sons of katie elder paul wendkos direction is lackluster and confusing performances vary from very good don gordon peter duel to terrible raf vallone giovanna ralli gabriele tinti with the usually reliable george peppard falling somewhere in the middle this should not be surprising considering the mediocre direction and amateurish script which breaks rules 1 2 and 3br br dont waste your time i give cannon for cordoba a 3
