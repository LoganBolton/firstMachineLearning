you know youve got a bad film when you hear that the soundtrack is performed completely on a single cheap programmable synthesizer without any melody or sense of rhythmbr br its hard to see how anyone could take this film seriously even while giving it a bad review this film is way beneath badbr br the continuity of this film is outrageously butchered in one fight scene we the hero wearing bluejeans and undershirt turn a corner with two revolvers in his hand he doubles back only now he has two semiautomatics in his hands he turns another corner and now he has an automatic rifle in his hands he chases down a hallway and comes out suddenly dressed in standard army fatigue jacketwith a shotgun after which he exits the building with yet another automatic rifle or heres one for the books  a bus slams into a car at high speed the car goes flying thrown by a gigantic explosion  cut to the bus which is completely unscathed from the same explosion the narrative continuity suffers from an equally numbing sense of unreality the bad guys really want to kill the hero  obviously  but every time they knock him out or otherwise get him in a vulnerable position they suddenly decide they want him to live to see this huh one of the funnier moments of the film is when the hero is released from isolation because his lawyer has come to see him then the bad guy decides hes not going to let the two meet after all and this despite the fact that the the villain the hero and his lawyer all know whats going on anyway so the hero writes a note to the lawyer and next we see the note being passed to the lawyer by another prisoner even though we never see the hero give it to him this lawyer btw has complete access to the offices of the atf in california including its confidential computer files huh well but its a mindless action movie  so howre the action scenes not bad surprisingly unfortunately they happen to be stoled from about a dozen hong kong films made five or ten years previously the opening scene a shootout in a junker garage actually has shots the composition of which are stolen directly from hard boiled  so clearly so that its a wonder john woo didnt sue for plagiarismbr br other hong kong films stolen from include prison on fire island on fire burning paradise police story i ii and iii aka supercop i thought i recognized a couple sammo hung clips here as well in other words the actions scenes are exciting only to the extent that they are successful duplications of action scenes from other filmsbr br theres nothing one can do with this film unless one shoots smack and just needs a lot of visual stimuli that neednt be make any sensebr br very funny film for all the wrong reasons
