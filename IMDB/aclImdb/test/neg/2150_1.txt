this has got to be the worst case of over acting since the silent era not just one or two actors but virtually the entire cast lee majors and bo svenson were fine but the rest of them look like their first time actingbr br so the budget was not tremendous much of the costumes and set were believable but there were many things that jump out at the viewer to let us know that they couldnt double check or get all of the props to match the periodbr br i cant think of one aspect of the film that i liked or didnt shake my head your time will be better spent burning lint collected from your bellybutton
