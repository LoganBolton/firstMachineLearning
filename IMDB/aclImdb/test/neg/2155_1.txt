theres no use trying to describe in detail the convoluted overly melodramatic plot involving civil war bitterness a crooked town boss and other complications its all badbr br stella stevens andrew prine bo svenson william smith tim thomerson and lee majors are all good actors that may not be big stars or big stars anymore but always made fun moviesbr br here theyre all wasted on a picture that looks like it was shot in a wild west tourist trap with costumes borrowed from the local high school theater department in fact most of the acting appears to be on the high school level too which might not be so bad if it werent so pretentiousbr br the name of ed wood is invoked way too lightly these days i think in this case the comparison is warranted however i suspect that old ed would have made a more entertaining western than this
