with matthias hues on the cover and only 300 i had to buy it i enjoyed some moments like hawks annoyance with the pleasure droids but i only really watched to see matthias hues scenes i particularly enjoyed the showdown at the end it was a cross between clint eastwoods the good the bad and the ugly and for a few dollars more a 3 man quickdraw showdown with a musical pocket watch used as the countdown timer apart from that theres really nothing more i can add the actors gave good performances all except the assassin droid whose performance was nothing outside of comical but the movie really lacked depth and purpose simply not enough to fill up 1hour and a half of standard movie time so were stuck with the main characters aimlessly wondering around from place to place for an hour or so until the ball gets rolling for example the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times taking up twofifths of the moviebr br the scenery really lacked depth and creativity probably due to the films budget i dont think we ever did get to see this perfect city of new angeles that was always talked about in fact when the main characters finally reached new angeles its set in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and walkways hardly the kind of kingdom the ownercreator of an entire city would dwell in the superhigh security of new angeles was also always talked about but only a total of 15 maybe 20 security guards were counted even when the alarm went off not even close to matthias approximation of at least a hundred men out therebr br if you are a fan of any of the actorsactresses in this film then you may want to watch it simply to add it to the list however if you value 1 and a half hour of your time or 300 of your money you may want to give this one a miss
