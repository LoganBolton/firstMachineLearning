how do you take a cast of experienced wellknown actors and put together such a stupid movie nimrod antel has the answer armored six coworkers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves but just as they get to first base with their plans everything unravels quickly with a plot like this youd think it couldnt be too bad at least for an action movie however in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal everyday kind of guys they joke they laugh have a few drinks together etc then we suddenly learn theyre planning to rob their own business the hero ty columbus short is sucked into the scheme because of the cold cruel world even though hes a decorated veteran nice guy and reliable employee oh my oh my then in the last 40 minutes of the film these former regular guys nearly all turn into moneycrazed psychos willing to butcher each other for cash in the last scenes mike matt dillon goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend the viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty its utterly unbelievable and b movie is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot i would say dont waste your timetoo bad no one gave laurence fishburne jean reno or fred ward the same advice before making this picture
