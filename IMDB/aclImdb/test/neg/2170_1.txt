when voting i was going to give a 2 but when seeing that 1 meant awful it hit the nail on the headthe portrayal of native americans as blood thirsty savages is deeply disturbing to methis is the third film ive seen of dw griffiths where races of men are stereotyped in ugly waysthe man isnt able to tell his side of the story so im going to try and keep away from attacking mr griffith personallyin my opinion the three films probably influenced the thinking of millions of people and their childrens childrenfilms like this probably made for many of the resentments that are still with ussome may say the camera work was greatthe action a first for its timethe positives are far outweighed by the negativesits like someone taking 10 from you and giving a dime back to make up for it
