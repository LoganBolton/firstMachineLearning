elderbush gilch was a big disappointment for me id heared how great it was how important it was it just didnt strike me it had a dimwitted story line plus some moronic and sadistic native american characters that are thurroughly offensive by todays standards while most of dw griffiths films have depth and intelegence this one feels more like a formulabaised programme picturebr br i loved seeing lillian gish and mae marsh in prebirth of a nation roles plus some of the staging of the battle scenes were pretty good acording to future griffith cameraman karl brown audiences were standing on their seats and cheering once the cavalry comes riding in at the end i felt nothing and beleave me i lve watching griffiths early work at biograph this film just isnt what it used to bebr br the best thing about this film it that for all of its flaws it has many of griffiths touches to it he handles his principal actors pretty well plus the scene where the indians are encircling the cabin it reminiscent to the climax of birth of a nation a far superior film that would send shock waves across america a little over a year later
