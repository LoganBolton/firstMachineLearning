why do i hate this let me list the waysbr br i have nothing against mary pickford but a 32 year old woman playing a 12 year old is just stupidbr br theres a fight scene in which kids are throwing bricks at each other and its considered funnyand it goes on for 15 minutes br br strange how none of the kids are even remotely hurtbr br the title cards contain plenty of racial and ethnic slursbr br for a family film the fights were way too violent loved it when pickford was punching it out with a little boy and the humor was just stupid br br seriously 40 minutes in i gave up and turned it off the slurs racism and little kids throwing bricks at each other got to me also there was no plot that i could see the only thing worth seeing in this film was william haines who was a top leading man in the silent erabr br just painful avoid
