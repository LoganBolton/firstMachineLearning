i dont normally write reviews but this film was special i couldnt turn it off i dont believe ive ever seen a worse movie but there i sat watching it was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway it was disgusting but i couldnt turn away where do i start the movie seems to think its a sports thriller but its so utterly ridiculous it can only be a comedy but its not funny not even in a dumbsilly way its like watching your cousins try to act out a skit on family gettogethers its painful to watch but at least its only for a minute or two second string went on for over an hour br br whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again the writing directing acting and everything was just terrible the problem is i cant describe how bad it was you just had to see it and im sure this will never be shown again so unless you saw it youre out of luck i mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other bad film ive seen over my lifetime and for every film i see in the future that i cant stand i will think to myself well at least it wasnt bad as the second string
