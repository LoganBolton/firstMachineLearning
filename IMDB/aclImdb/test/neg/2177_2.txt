chaplin was great a silent comedian but many silent era stars fell when the public heard their voices in the first talkies in my opinion chaplins voice simply did not fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous his career never recovered when sound came to film contrary to most of the reviews i have read chaplins lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected to be entertained by chaplin the comedian and not spend their entertainment dollar watching chaplins political commentarybr br despite chaplins awards and knighthood i would take exception to his contributions to humanity the great dictator was made at the same time stalins brutal dictatorship was having its show trials and both dictators signed the agreement that lead to invasion of poland by both dictators wwii started in an attempt to save poland the nazis were defeated in 6 years but poland disappeared as a sovereign country this happened during the time this film was made and the investigations of hollywood by the federal government had chaplin included joe stalin in this satirein addition to including the italian dictator perhaps he would have had less criticism about his politics by the politicians the soviets mistreatment of jews and dissidents exceeded the nazis in time and numbersbr br judged simply as a film many of the gags were too topical to be understood by younger viewers who wouldnt know who goebbels goring or mussolini were a classic piece of art must stand the test of time classic greek tragedy the mona lisa and beethovens 9th are still enjoyed centuries after their creation because they are timeless films which rely on topical political commentary or currently popular social views usually do not outlast the generation in which they are made but those that address issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating from mebr br chaplin as the writer director and lead actor must take the blame for what i judge as a dated and tiresome filmbr br chaplins apologists have excused his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous if chaplin found the us so offensive why didnt he return to his native land great britian fought the naziwith blood and money what did switzerland contribute in the fight against the european dictators switzerland is like a country club that picks and chooses its members based on race and class and cares little about people who cant join the club
