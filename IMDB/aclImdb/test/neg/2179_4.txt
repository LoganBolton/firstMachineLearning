maybe this was an important movie and thats why people rank it so highly but honestly it isnt very good in hindsight its easy to see that chaplin probably all of hollywood was incredibly naive about the magnitude of what was really going on in the ghettos so you cant fault him too much for the disconnect that affects a modern viewer but the disconnect remainsbr br more disappointingly the movie is just clunky its as if chaplin had no idea that movies had progressed in sophistication since the silent era the set pieces those involving both the jewish barber and the dictator dont flow into each other they just sit there like discrete lumps of storyline that progress in fits and starts moving somewhere but never arriving at resolution some are funny some less sobr br what charm the movie has is strictly in the person of chaplin himself his parodies of hitlers speeches were the best part of the whole thing and theres no denying that he had a physical grace that was delightful to watch but virtually everything he surrounded himself with was annoying hannah was too damn american the storm troopers were too damn americanbr br oooh oooh one more thing i dont know what purpose was served by having garbage be the source of evil behind the throne it almost seems like the film is saying that if it werent for malign influences like garbage hynckle wouldnt have been that bad a guy
