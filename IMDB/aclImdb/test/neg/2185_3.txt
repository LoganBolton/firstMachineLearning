this movie starts at a and never quite reaches b its title promises far more than the film delivers its superficial and filled with the usual cliches of a story in which a guy questions his sexuality the people are agreeable even the obligatory flamboyant type the lead kevin mckidd overacts insofar as theres a reason for him to act at all simon callow playing a horny straight is always worth watching and hes by far the only reason to stay with the movie however the rubbish about his mens group meditations or whatever they are grows extremely tiresome in short order they seem to have been thrown into the movies mild mix in a misguided effort to vary the setting and nonstop inaction the same comment applies to a really odd and unconvincing camping trip dont worry about pausing the tape so you can get a snack let the thing run you wont miss anything hugo weavings character is superfluous he appears in a sequence with one of the lesser leads and doesnt even meet the rest at all the outcome of that sequence isnt explained and hugos real estate dealings have nothing to do with the story the movie is a total disappointment at the end because there is no resolution the thing simply fades out and were sent to the closing credits this is an interlude with no structure
