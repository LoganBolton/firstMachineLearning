the movie is okay meaning that i dont regret watching it i found the acting purely and the most of the dialog stupid oh no this was my grandmothers bible its sort of bad remake of uturn a man arrives to a desert town out in nowhere meets the wrong people and falls in love with the wrong woman and off cause gets involved in something he thought he could leave behind him the movie is quite predictable and there is really nothing new in it when its finish you didnt really care most of the characters are stereotypes specially brian austin green all in all just another movie from the states but okay entertaining on boring wednesday night imdb vote 410
