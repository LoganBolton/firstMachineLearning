los angeles physician tom reed vincent ventresca survives a tragic auto accident but ends up going to prison in the high desert of california when his time is up he lands in a small windswept town named purgatory flats his first stop is a bar where he quickly slams a beer and gets hired as a bartender so much for excons having a tough time finding work this is the first in a long line of absurdities that make up the plot of writerdirector harris dones silly attempt at modern desertset film noirbr br his first night on the job tom meets a sexy femme fatal named sunny alexandra holden who hangs out with a family of bad boys the mecklins consisting of uncle dean gregg henry and his two nephews the drug addicted owen kevin alejandro who is sunnys husband and awol soldier randy 90210s brian austin greer after his shift is finished theres a shooting and dr tom just happens to be nearby he agrees to treat one of the wounded and most importantly not tell the cops im not sure thats a good move for a guy fresh out of the pen but this script cowritten by diane fine has very little to do with logicbr br tom makes a series of poor decisions that get him further and further entangled with the criminally inclined mecklin boys including stealing medical supplies and hopping into the sack with sunny everybody in the theater is screaming dont do it walk away but tom does it anywaybr br in a classic film noir like body heat or double indemnity we root for and empathize with william hurt and fred mcmurray as they get sucked into the web of bright sexy devious femme fatals like kathleen turner and barbara stanwyck its not their fault wed probably be tempted by all that money or that particular dame too but dr toms weakness seems to stem from stupidity more than circumstances sunny is sexy but not a very compelling character and theres no money to tempt him youre left wondering if he attended the same medical school as dr nick riveria from the simpsonsbr br the silly script would have you believe that a rednecks rural home has almost everything you need to treat a gunshot to the stomach and that one so wounded could easily hop to attention and effectively participate in a fist fight it gives us an implausible car chase with one of those the club things clamped to the steering wheel oh that oil tanker that just exploded  no one noticed thatbr br i wonder how such a ridiculous script ever got greenlighted perhaps brian austin greer has more juice than i gave him credit for its obvious that he took the relatively small role of randy  a hotheaded murder  to show producers that he had more acting range than he displayed on 90210br br its also sort of sad to see nicholas turturro playing a stereotypical hispanic drug dealer he deserves better than thisbr br if you have an iq over 50 purgatory flats will have you shaking your head in disbelief ill give it 3 stars for the unintentional laughs and the scenes with the sexy miss holden running around in her red panties
