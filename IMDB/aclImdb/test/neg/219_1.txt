this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the cast was fantastic but the movie itself was horrible it was so awful i had to register just to say how bad it wasbr br i watched this movie and i wanted to break it every minute i watched it could have been great had a great premise if youre going to rob an armored car and theres a homeless person which sees you you have to do what you have to do for the main character to decide to get a cop killed and kill his friends and coworkers after the homeless guy was already dead its just ridiculous and yes im sure there will be responses to this about how his conscious got to him but come onbr br the main character crawled out the bottom of the armored truck no one saw him he blew up the stash of money and grabbed and dragged the cop right behind the other guards and no one saw him he was able to get back in the armored car and no one saw him this movie had potential but blew itbr br you couldnt pay me to watch this movie ever again dont ever watch it aggravating
