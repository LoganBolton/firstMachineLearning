this is basically just a dumb chase story nearly identical to zillions of other chase stories in terms of acting suspense plot dialogue characterization or lack thereof and pacingbr br the one area in which the net diverges from traditional chase movies is in its subject material computers unfortunately the scriptwriters clearly didnt understand the differences between a pocket calculator and a craybr br computernewbies shouldnt watch this movie because it will make them paranoid about computers no matter what hollywood tries to tell us its just not that easy to erase someones identity by hacking theres still too much paper documentation in the world and there was even more of it in 1995br br computerpros shouldnt watch this movie either i mean a magical virus that can melt your entire pc when you press escape please and the whole virus including the cool multimedia effects of your screen dissolving whats that all about can fit on a single 144mb diskette yeah  whatever
