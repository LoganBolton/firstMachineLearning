made and released at the time when the internet was just becoming huge this is a storyline hitchcock would have lovedbr br sadly hitchcock wasnt around to make it and were left with an occasionally suspenseful but mostly silly thriller that is held barely together by bullocks intelligencebr br it was released in 1995 but is already dated and the amount of mistakes and inaccuaracies regarding computers must be seen to be believed and you dont even have to be a dotcom person to spot them
