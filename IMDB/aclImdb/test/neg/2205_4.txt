i am a huge randolph scott fan so i was surprised and disappointed to find he is barely in this film the movie really belongs to robert ryan who is the hero in the jam and the one embroiled in the love triangle good grief gabby hayes gets more screen time than mr scott in this movie for many viewers that is not a problem but i am from the walter brennan school of sidekicks not gabby hayesalthough i will say that his lines were a bit more humorous than annoying in this film than in many of his films with randolph scott and john waynebr br personally i found the movie very slow going with a convoluted plot that was muddied even more by the unnecessary romance subplot by convoluted i dont mean impossible to understand or figure out i just mean too messy for its own goodbr br the direction is uninspired and the two main bad guys have the most unsatisfying comeuppance at the end the whole movie comes across as fake unrealistic and poorly filmedbr br just so you dont think i cant find anything good herebr br on the plus side anne jeffreys is very sexy in her alltoobrief parts of this film not sure if it is actually her singing or someone else but whoever it was had a very pretty voice ms jeffreys also had a couple of nice acting moments the script needed either a lot more of her or to remove her character altogether as it was her nice few moments werent enough to help the filmbr br lastly there is mr scott he looks fantastic in this film and is the nononsense lawman out to set things right some folks complain that his characters prior to 1950 were too goodygoody perfect but thats never bothered me at all ill take him goodygoody pre1950 or gritty and violent post1950either way randolph scott was a real western herobr br it saddens me to have to say it but i would have to recommend passing this film by unless you are a diehard fanthere are so many better scott films out there that this one wont be missed
