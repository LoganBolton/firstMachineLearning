this movie is total dumbness incarnate yet ive seen this movie several times already and plan to watch several more times because despite its sheer dumbness its very entertaining and it has one of my favorite hokeymovie actors casper van dien who is here in his full hokeymovie glory here casper van dien is fully casper van dien and ya gotta love him for it if he hadnt been in this movie it would have been totally unwatchable dreck or at least far dreckier than it already isbr br the cough cough science used here makes absolutely no sense at all no one else in the world noticed that big asteroid approaching the earth besides that small group not even with thousands and thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers constantly searching the skies for just such a thing an asteroid that big would have made itself completely obvious to anyone who has a pair of eyes even vaguely capable of sight and a chunk of the asteroid bounced off the atmosphere and no one even noticed it a rock that big hitting the atmosphere would have caused enormous shockwaves that would have in turned caused an enormous amount of damage to the planets surface surely someone would have noticed such a thing bwahahaha the science used in this movie is so completely ridiculous that somehow it works for making this movie as entertaining as it isbr br one thing i noticed is that despite the uber heat all the characters werent dripping with sweat and their clothes completely soaked with it at the most the characters looked like they had been lightly spritzed on occasion by someone offcamera with a water bottle to give a sweat sheen authenticity was not a goal that this movie assiduously and constantly strived for which in a weird and hilarious sort of way gives this movie its entertainment charmbr br is this movie actually worth watching definitely assuming of course you have absolutely no expectations of anything that even remotely approaches reality and its your desire to wallow and luxuriate in total hokeyness at the moment
