meltdown opens on a scene of scientists preparing to conduct an important test on a missile system developed to deflect asteroids should they be on a collision course with earth nathan vincent gale mentions some misgivings to his but the test appears to be an unqualified success then the asteroid breaks apart and the largest piece is pushed into a direct collision path with earth fortunately the huge rock skips off of earths outer atmosphere and ricochets into space unfortunately the glancing blow is just enough to alter earths orbit and the planet begins to spiral closer to the sunbr br while all of this is going on above their heads los angeles cops tom casper van dien and mick greg anderson are on a stakeout theyre supposed to collect evidence against a suspected drug dealer but the deal theyre watching quickly devolves into a shooting match afterward tom takes a few minutes to be interviewed by a local television reporter who also happens to be his girlfriend carly stefanie von pfettenbr br at a nearby hospital where mick is treated for a minor injury tom has a brief chat with his exgirlfriend bonnie venus terzo who is a nurse he tells her hes concerned about the fact that their 17 yearold daughter kimberly amanda crew is dating a man named cj ryan mcdonell once tom explains to bonnie that hes discovered cj has a criminal record shes a little worried herselfbr br its not long however before everybody has something else to worry about the temperature is rapidly rising all around the world carly is one of the first nonscientists to learn whats really happening nathan who is her brother calls her to say he may have a way that they can survive carly calls tom he of course promptly contacts bonniebr br in relatively short order the motley group is on the road before they can reach their ultimate goal however theyve got to make their way through bands of looters deal with a catastrophic water shortage and manage to travel in temperatures that are high enough to killbr br casper van dien is a good looking guy and i actually enjoyed him in starship troopers that may be because hes good in action scenes it might also be because he didnt talk much in that movie in meltdown hes unfortunately given just enough lines in situations that are just dramatic enough to showcase his entirely average acting abilities amanda crew is also okay and ryan mcdonell isnt bad either vincent gale and stefanie von pfetten are also both reasonably good but venus terzo is sadly on a par with van dienbr br what really makes or breaks a movie though is the story and the script while the story here is okay and actually has some real potential the script is just awful the science part of the science fiction is nonexistent starting with the asteroid pushing the earth out of orbit and escalating with the notion that the gravitational balance of the solar system might pull the earth back into its usual orbit over time when the temperature in la hits 120 degrees cars start blowing upbr br you know whats even worse than the bad science the bad continuity okay really hot why are people in the movie not only wearing long sleeved shirts but jackets too why are people mugging each other for bottled water instead of turning on the taps at home why are the streets completely empty but the freeways completely full and why are the freeways full of unexploded its almost superfluous to note that the sets costumes and production values were good especially when that only forces me to say that the edits were notbr br so basically you take a pretty good story idea and combine it with mostly mediocre acting a terrible script lowend special effects utterly irrational plot twists and poor edits and what do you have a movie thats even less than the sum of its inconsiderable parts im sorry to say that i cant recommend meltdown days of destruction to anyonebr br political notes there is mention here that congress finally loosened the purse strings enough to fund the tests that start the movie rolling while the tests here were wholly irresponsible targeting an asteroid with a nuke and not knowing the composition of the big rock is in fact well beyond irresponsible and approaching the insane the fact is that such scenarios are a very real danger to the planet unfortunately weve tracked nowhere near all of the near earth asteroids that could be worrisome in some orbit some day and our ability to spot something on a collision course with us is limited at bestbr br once we do discover were going to be hit we quite literally have no system in place to deal with it there are no nucleartipped space missiles we can launch the space shuttle is completely incapable of going beyond earth orbit and if it were we couldnt launch enough of them or launch them quickly enough for it to matter im not big on the government doing anything beyond its constitutional mandates but i certainly think protecting the planet from destruction coming at us from outer space could be construed as defending the country dont you family suitability meltdown days of destruction is rated r for some violence i frankly didnt find the violence here anything beyond a fairly typical trated video game if your teens are keen on seeing meltdown and you cant talk them out of it the rrating shouldnt dissuade you from letting them see it its not however a good idea to leave the younger kids in the room with their elder siblings while the shootings arent too graphic in the main some of the dead bodies are
