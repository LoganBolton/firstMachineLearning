yeah it may not be for adults and some adults may find it stupid but if you dont think about it its really not that badbr br the story has alvin and his gang going across the world in search of jewels for a bad person and the misadventures that they come in contact withbr br so the animation is good and the story is cute and the songs are forgettable but its a good moviebr br i give it a 6 out of 10 or  out of 4 stars
