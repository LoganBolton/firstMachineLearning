its amazing to think that this movie came out only one year before star wars but seems a million years behind it in sophistication and special effects actually the art direction and set design nice victorian space ship arent bad its the monster costumes that are the most laughable resembling the guy in a rubber suit monsters from the lost in space tv show the evil caveman makeup reminded me of some of the aliens from ancient twilight zone rerunsbr br the script is stilted and outside of peter cushings comic relief the acting is pretty miserable too this movie is only recommended if you really enjoy bad kitschy sf and the musicyikes a horrible 70s experiment with synthesizers that doesnt fit the time period of the film and which sounds like someone rambling with a minimoog and a 2track tape machine
