at the earths core was on television yesterday i was at my computer working and happened to glance over and see what must have been some of the worst action sequences ever made i was instantly enthralled by the films shoddy production values appalling acting by all included  even peter cushing and horrific unintentionally hilarious action sequences and puppetmonstersbr br the film is about a victorian scientist who takes a stereotypical buff american hero on a groundboring trip in the welsh countryside little do they know that a great evil lurks at the center of the earths corebr br forget the fact that the title doesnt make sense if they were really at the earths core theyd be about 2700 kgm3 underground and burning alive in a sea of iron or whatever it is down there forget that the puppets used in the production rival the beast master for being the fakestlooking of alltime no the real genius of at the earths core is its naive stupidity  a gungho action spectacle without real action and without real spectacle it is in essence just a gungho movie and a stupid one at that people who enjoy mst3kstyle stuff will love this  its appallingly bad and indeed so bad it is almost enjoyable in a strange way
