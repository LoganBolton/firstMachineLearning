doug mcclure has starred in a few of these british produced genre adventures and this one has got to be the worst of the lot  i know the land that time forgot has its critics but please at least that movie featured location filming and relatively good production values  thats the problem with this movie  the production values go way beyond  so bad theyre good  affectionate territory and become  so bad i think ill go and see whats on the other channels  br br one case in point is the first scene featuring the intrepid cushing and mcclure encountering a monster  its painfully obvious the monster is an average sized man dressed up as a rubber monster being made to look over twenty foot tall via overblown back projection  it becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running on the spot  have i mentioned that this is one of the more convincing set pieces  no really this looks like it was filmed in somebodys living room with the spare change left over from that years doctor who budget  even former doctor who peter cushing is bland and what should have been an amusing line  you cant mesmerise me  im british  is delivered in a very flat way  a very similar line is spoken by cushing in horror express  in a script devoid of characterisation  plotting and memorable dialogue  its not just the fact that the dialogue is unmemorable its also infrequent and rare since the monsters dont speak  wouldnt it have been better having the chief bad guys humanoids like in warlords of atlantis so that they could explain the plot  does anyone here know what the plot actually is  br br a very tedious british movie that even the twin talents of caroline munro can not save  the whole mood of the movie is summed up by the final sequence featuring two keystone cops
