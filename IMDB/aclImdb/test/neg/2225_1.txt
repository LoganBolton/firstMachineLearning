what annoys me with so called science programs such as these is that it is presented as if it were a fact that dinosaurs live millions of years ago firstly nobody can even conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the earth is millionsbillions of years old its a shallow theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods with huge assumptions thrown into the evolutionary potbr br secondly nobody can prove that evolution ever happened all darwins missing links are still missing  if you look at all the fossils anywhere in or on the earth they are complete animals of a certain kind eg a dog or a cat nobody has ever found the skeleton of a dog turning into a cat or in the example presented in this series a dinosaur turning into a birdbr br this is utter hogwash theres more proof that santa claus exists than any animal changing into another kind of animalbr br all the ideas presented in this series is an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and the everything in it was createdbr br this series is not science it is a religious world view that hides under the banner of science science is something we can observe and repeat what you are seeing here is science fiction br br if you want to watch a science fiction program that has the decency to admit that its a science fiction program then rather watch star trek or star wars
