a few of my fellow writers have covered this movies plot elements so i will stick to some of the cuff remarksbr br 1 this is entertaining  but not for the reasons youd think its cheesy but somehow still watchablebr br 2 tamra daniels love interest has to be about thirty the christian girl that dan ignores is way cuterbr br 3 muriel stole his shirt from mr spock also if my guardian angel looks like muriel im going to have to apply for a transferbr br 4 okay so apparently dan is responsible for his parents divorce what kind of horrible guilt trip is that muriel says that it was dans prayers that kept his parents together i just thought that was absolutely ridiculous listen i can pray for my parents as much as i want but the only way theyll stay together is if they decide theyre going to do itbr br 5 ill echo the atheists comments on how this movie portrays nonchristians apparently theyre all slovenly bulliesbr br 6 for something positive  david white is a decent actor he gives the movie a little bit of credibility even if he is the only one he pretty much holds this film together on his own
