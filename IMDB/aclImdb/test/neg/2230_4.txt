my take typically routine and lazy straight to video attempt from disney br br disney must have fallen in love with the family movie tradition that is the family dog many movies have devoted themselves with stories that solely center themselves with mans best friend disney themselves have made a handful they also made a handful of those that are literally dogs add this one to that bunchbr br i havent seen the original for a very long time so probably im not the right person to judge if this straighttovideo sequel fares any better anyone above the age of seven arent the right people to see it either perhaps only the youngest of the young will want to see lady and the tramp ii scamps adventure and even they would grow up and say it wasnt the best kind of family entertainment they have ever seen i guess to be fair i can say is that it warrants a rental but that aint much to saybr br this sequel pretty much picks up the parts left behind after the original oftcalled classic lady and tramp now have a litter of cute crocker spaniel pups and one mischievous mongrel named scamp who is a chip off the old block instead of the confines of home scamp wishes to run off with the other junkyard dogs of town unknown of his dads own past as one of those mongrels of the streets to capture the charms of the original this one throws in the same poor dogrich dog love story in viceversa scamp falls for a one of the junkyard dogs named angel and who wouldnt with a name like that and a voice that sounds like alyssa milano que replay of the famous spaghetti scene other than the cute factor there is nothing in store for any audience in this lazy straighttovideo effort stick with the originalbr br rating  out of 5
