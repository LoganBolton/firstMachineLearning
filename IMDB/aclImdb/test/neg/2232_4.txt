if regarded as an independent feature i cant say its too bad at all but from where im standing this sequel and the original lady and the tramp dont agree with each other they are two completely different movies with different style different voice personalities different narratives and about the only thing that they share with each other is the visuals eg the townhouse of jim dear darling lady and tramp and none of those have changedbr br if youre seeking any kind of continuity years after the release of the original for those memorable songs like bella notte and the siamesse cats song this sequel wont give you any at all just about every song has a little pop to it and those good old characters like jock and trusty jim dear and darling and aunt sarah and her cats may well be seen but theyre seeming to be somehow replaced by new characters not to mention peg not appearing at all whose voices are quite annoying even lady and tramp dont appear often enough and as for scamp he is so spoilt and treats his father tramp with utter disrespect then runs away with no remorse even after hearing how much hes being missed at home and they called his shameless getaway an adventure id say scott wolf truly brought out the abusive bad boy in scamp wiping out the typical cute disney animal even the old characters just drive you mad in this trusty sounds like goofy sick in bed jock jeffstupidbennett  and his voice  sound neither scottish nor worth hearing zap him off as far as possible to free our poor ears from his voice and as for the dumb featherbrained exasperating junkyard dogs somebody put them downbr br lady and the tramp 2 isnt completely bad if youre not already having a tough day but i expect a lot more charm from a sequel to a true classic  scamp is chavvy so is his girlfriend angel and there is a feeble storyline still i think you should try it at least once because as i say there are much worse movies around
