this is the second addition to frank baums personally produced trilogy of oz films its essentially the same childishness as in the other two pictures although i consider it preferable to the others because its shorter as in the other films there are performers in animal costumes an adult woman pretends to be a boy and the characters and plot jump all over the place while the camerawork is static this time at the centre is a magic cloak that grants wishes and the boy played by a woman is made a kingbr br most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning fairies are represented by multipleexposure photography and theres a man in the moon that looks just like those made by georges méliès years before most famously in le voyage dans la lune 1902 méliès imaginative fantasies and creative trick effects made him the leading pioneer of early cinema and the films he made around the turn of the century were far better and even technically more advanced than this trifling oz series
