for one thing he produced this movie it has the feel of later movies with international casts that are dubbed the opening credits tell us it was filmed in viennabr br bey was a delight in the universal adventure movies of the 1940s he was also superb in a movie i saw maybe ten years ago but have never heard of since the amazing mr x maybe it was dr x i remember it as a thrilling and frightening moviebr br this one is pretty wooden unfortunately the plot isnt easy to follow when i got the hang of it i was disappointed anywaybr br francis lederer looks great as a concert pianist he was a very handsome leading man ten or 15 years earlier he never really caught on as a major star though he should havebr br this isnt terrible but its pretty heavy going
