i went to see the movie because my boyfriend was raving about how much he wanted to see it and how his friends had already been and loved it so i came in with a neutral attitude not really expecting the worst unfortunately that is what i got i could write a 15 page paper on why this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen but for your benefit i will point out the pros and the endless supply of cons to begin the acting was very good especially christopher waltz and melanie laurent there were also a few lines that deserved a laugh and a couple suspenseful scenes sadly good acting a little humor and suspense is where the good points end the whole beginning story could have been great a jewish girls family is butchered she goes into hiding later encounters the man responsible for her pain and then hatches a great plan for revenge sounds very good but the movie wouldnt be quite as satisfying for the americans and jews craving nazi blood i have no problem with wwii movies or killing nazis i saw defiance and like it very much however its the way and attitude with which our wouldbe heroes kill ill give you a prime example of the kind of hypocrisy this movie oozes our hoodlum gang ambushes a german unit and killsscalps all of them except a sergeant and two other soldiers no problem so far they ask the sergeant to divulge information on another german unit when he respectfully refuses to betray the lives of his fellow soldiers they bash his head in a with a baseball bat cheering and swearing as if they were at a football game they took that nazis head off yaaayy now lets look at the hypocrisy in that scene heres a hypothetical situation a group of american soldiers are ambushed and taken captive by the enemy the same scenario follows and the american commanding officer would rather die than betray his fellow soldier the enemy bashes his head in with much celebration this would infuriate an audience if this scene were in a movie that american soldier was a hero for placing his men above himself and those barbarians brutally murdered him wellÂ…what about the nazi sergeant well hes a nazi and deserves to die the cruelest death possible right coincidentally the nazis felt the same towards the jews see the hypocrisy by celebrating the butcher of the nazis we are placing ourselves on the same sadistic level br br major hypocrisy 2 the nazis make a propaganda movie about a german sniper who kills nearly 300 american soldiers near the end of the movie the film is revealed hitler and his cohorts giggle with delight as they watch an american soldier get shot out of a window and fall into a fountain the nazis cheer as soldier after soldier falls to the snipers skill this is supposed to enrage the american viewers of this scene those evil nazis are laughing over the deaths of our brave men well the irony is isnt that what we were doing or supposed to be doing the entire time were watching inglorious basterds laughing over the pain of others simply because they were the bad guys how would we feel if native americans somehow made a hit film in which they reek bloody vengeance on the american settlers or what if blacks made a movie glorifying the nat turner rebellion ok enough about the hypocritical flaws br br ill summarize other reasons for the 1 star rating 1 there were view admirable characters throughout the movie brad pitt even tortures a woman by sticking his finger in her gunshot wound because he suspects she betrayed him hes the good guy 2 scenes dragged on way longer than they needed to 3 brad pitts southern supposedly tennessee accent is horrible and thoroughly annoying throughout the entire move ill quit now since im at 700 words br br unfortunately it seems that the general population doesnt think anymore they just want blood and that is why this movie received such a high ranking i recommend this movie for the ignorant or if you are jewish and simply wanting to see a nice fantasy justice personally when i finally got out of the movie theater i felt like i had been scalped or wish that i had so i wouldnt have suffered over 2 hours of mental rape
