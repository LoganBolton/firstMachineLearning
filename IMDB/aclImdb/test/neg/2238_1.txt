inglourious basterds is tarantinos worst film he has ever made its full of his usual ingredients ie snappy dialogue brutal and sudden violence but it all feels dejavu the directing is typical tarantino and nothing seems new at all its almost as if hes copied exactly from his only masterpiece pulp fiction br br there is nothing new or exciting about inglourious basterds to be honest its just a war drama that isnt funny nor brilliant as pulp fiction was basterds supposedly is tarantinos tribute to leones spaghetti westerns but seems misjointed and out of place especially with the continuing use of big subtitles and throws the audience of balance
