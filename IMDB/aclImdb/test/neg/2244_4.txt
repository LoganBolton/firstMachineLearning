the first half of this movie was quite good it was interesting and suspenseful the second half was pretty bad the comic book revenge story came full circle and we see lots of comic nazi characters and some badly acted good guys blowing them away theres a lot of violence in this movie im not squeamish about violence but i think it should at least have some purpose in a movie there was little purpose to the violence here except to create a genre film where we see lots of people getting mowed down with rifles were somehow supposed to be amused by thisbr br i watched reservoir dogs recently there was a movie where violence was employed effectively it was realistic within the world the movie created there were never any overthetop sound effect it was a crime movie which played it straight inglorious basterds should have played it straight but didnt i was rolling my eyes at how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets to the head and facebr br none of the backstory of any of the basterds is really explained either theyre simply nazi hunters we dont really get to like any of them either because theyre too busy cutting scalps off and shooting people in the face its all about revenge and very little elsebr br there was 2 12 hours to work with here but few of the basterds were really examined in depth this seems like it was simply a revenge flick pure and simple we saw that in tarantinos last flick death proof which i didnt care for either it suffered the same problems the characters were almost interchangeablebr br the first half again was pretty good i wanted to see the exploits of the inglorious basterds across europe i was presented with a much lamer movie about the resistance movement plotting revenge against some comic book nazis when they all go to one movie premiere in france
