this is one of the worst movies i have ever seenbr br what is the purpose of this movie a bunch of americans enters nazioccupied france and starts slaughtering germans you see them scalping their enemies and beating them to death with baseball bats while making jokes of coursebr br some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre for a parody it is neither witty nor funny the contents is zero it is exceptionally brutal and disgusting underneath lies a subtle political message because it is again the good guys killing bad nazis the whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around could you imagine a storyline where nazis while making jokes kill everybody in the warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers probably not but this movie is exactly about that with the exception that is satisfies the weird moral expectations of a certain audience slaughtering people is so cool when done by the right peoplebr br this movie only works because of the hidden naziideology underneath it does not regard the enemy as people and if the latter is supposed to be an element of the fun i am happy to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to mebr br another mystery is how such violence can fascinate the american crowd while a bit of nudity will freak them out but if a naked body is pornography this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at its very worstbr br inglorious basterds is a pointless boring and tasteless waste of time and money
