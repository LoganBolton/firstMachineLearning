i had been amazed by director antals kontroll back in 2003 his first american project vacancy was less impressive but a decent start armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable the film never rises above the level of a b movie br br its a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesnt really deliver in that department either br br what you are left with is one implausible situation after another a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money if you look past the sharp cinematography cast and the tight music score youre left with what could have been a below average directtovideo featuring van damme or seagal br br this was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time
