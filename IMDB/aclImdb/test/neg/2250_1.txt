i will never go to another tarantino movie again the entire film was worthless my wife and i both regret that we didnt get up and walk out at the first indication of what the film was really going to be about which is still hard to determine since it was such a ridiculous storylineblood guts and violence seemed to be the only real theme but we kept hoping thered be something redeeming just around the corner unfortunately there wasnt because there wasnt anything that made sense we along with a lot of the other people in the audience walked out of the theater muttering that was disgusting what a waste of time i shouldve walked out where was the comedy that was pathetic etc it actually made us the audience voice our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly ripped off the only thing of merit in the film was the costuming and the acting ability of almost everyone in the filmthere just wasnt a plotscript worthy of their talents i rate this a 1 because there isnt a 0 i cant quite understand how anyone could rate this higher than a 0
