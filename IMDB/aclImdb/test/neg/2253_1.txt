previous tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies this one is from a guy in love with his own writing it isnt inglorious its disgustingbr br i absolutely hated inglorious basterds the entire point of a film is to entertain  if u call bashing peoples heads and removing their scalps entertaining  and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit it is extreme boredom or disgustbr br the movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages there is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table before thankfully they are all shot i wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes even woody allen knows when to shut the fk upbr br this table talk style is a tarantino hallmark but in other films i actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking here i couldnt care less all of quentins films display an enormous confidence particularly jackie brown but here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene tarantino had no idea where he was going with the filmbr br is it violent sure theres torture and scalping galore but youd have to remind me thankfully the film was so thin i didnt even remember i had seen it earlier in the day when until i saw a review headline on msnbcbr br hes out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel but do us a favor qt and spare us the moviebr br i walked out of this movie halfway through and i would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a diehard quarantino fan he or she isbr br i give it 0  10
