this usually all sounds a lot better in my head so forgive me for rambling im hardly tarantinos biggest fan and will try not to stoop to calling him a hackwhich is quite hard i dont like to mock or critique a movie before seeing it so with cautious hesitation i walked to the cinema today to watch inglorious basterdsbr br now to call it a ripoff of a ripoff would be unfair here tarantino is happy enough to take the title from enzo castellaris less than spectacular dirty dozen clone but not its plot points that he takes from all other genre of movies inglorious opens with a nazi officer and his lengthy interrogation against a farmer who is hiding jews in his basement this is such an anticlimax in that its dialogue is stale and outcome signposted a mile off of course one of the hidden jews makes her escape but more of her later we the obviously easily pleased audience are treated to the introduction of lt aldo raine haha that name almost sounds like bmovie king aldo rayhaha quentinkeep those tributes coming and this character is played by none other than brad dallas pitt sorry dallas was about the only good thing hes ever starred in and with jawjutting mr jolie treats us to a hounddogged southern drawled smirking nazikiller meanwhile mr tarantino forgets that actual grownups may be in attendance so assumes that the teenyboppers wont have heard of the dirty dozenbr br raines platoon consists of john cassavettes looking bloodthirsty jewish soldiers all looking to get the big payback on adolf hitler tarantino in all his superior knowledge pays special attention to two of these men by casting his long time best buddy and fellow homagesycophant eli roth as the baseball bat wielding bear jew the other man is called hugo stiglitz and ill wager more than half the qt fanboys had never heard this name before this movie keep up the good work tarantino youve managed about 6 or 7 hommages so far in the first 15 minutes keep adding them and it may detract from the plot or lack ofbr br anyhow cutting a long and extremely boring and protracted story short both raine and his men the inglorious basterds and the sole survivor from chapter one both have separate plots to kill hitler at the showing of a nazipropaganda movie in a french cinema owned by the forementioned survivor now grown upbr br more boring and pointless conversations follow two and fro as pitt mugs away at an audience past caring and any genuine suspense leading to the assassination of the most deadly tyrant of all time is thrownaway by the directors insistence of placing a 1980s david bowie song in a wwii moviebr br my problems and there are many with this movie is the reoccurring problem i have with most tarantino producthe rarely knows when to either start or stop i dont need homage after homage to get the joke whatever it may be i knew of inglorious bastards enzo castellari aldo ray hugo stiglitz and the ultimate crime of the entire movie ennio morricones haunting score from revolver i go to the cinema to see the starsif the best you can do is the dire barad pitt ill assume you mr tarantino are the main draw here i dont want the audience directing the movie i pay to see your vision your ideas your creativitynot how you can patchwork time and time again endless scenes from endless movies its high time the fanboys on imdb employed some tough love on your idol god knows if you dontthe studios shouldbr br the tired old argument with tarantino worshippers is well if you can do betterdo so let me tell you if i was a 46 year old director with the unfortunate pull qt hasid want to offer you a lot more than a warmed up muddled rehash of better wwii movies than this tripe the directors he attempts to emulate made movies so bad by accident or due to budgetary constraints its a cop out time and time again to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as art im sure hes capable of better but after giving him the benefit of the doubt once moreand not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life maybe he isnt
