a very untom and jerry short jerry narrates this tale that revolves around tom the cat falling in love and losing her to his rival butch tom is best friends with jerry here which irked me a bit the cartoon is also presented in cinemascope overall i found this tom and jerry cartoon sad and depressing the should have just put puss gets the boot on the dvd instead and i wouldve been happy this experimental animated short can be found on disc 2 of warner brothers 2dvd spotlight collection set its the last one on the set and im hoping that warner brothers chooses to release a second volume soonbr br my grade c
