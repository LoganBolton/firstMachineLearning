after reading fool for love in a drama class of mine i was looking forward to seeing how sam shepards wonderful play would be translated to the screen much to my dismay it was nowhere near as entertaining as the play the film seemed to drag the music was inappropriate for the tone of the movie and all the raw energy of the play seemed to have been sucked out of this film version its a shame to see this come out this way even with shepards involvement playing the role of eddie do yourselves a favorsee the play next time its being performed in your area or simply read the book instead
