this is not a good movie at all i cannot believe that after fifty years this movie gets the national award when there have been such gems from marathi cinema that have been so systematically ignored this is a very overrated movie that got very very lucky it was given the national award harvested the popular opinion and now is going to represent india before the international audience anyone with even a marginal understanding of good quality cinema will know very well that this will not even be nominated at the oscarsbr br i cannot understand where to start there are just so many things that are wrong and lacking in this movie that it amazing it even got considered for the national award that this movie is awarded as the best movie to come out this year goes to show the biased judgment of people who hold the reins of indian cinema and the diminutive understanding of the people who blindly appreciate this moviebr br the topic chosen is great it is important that such movies be made  but only by people who are able to handle them sandeep sawant does not measure up to the task  not even close his direction is jumpy confused there is no clear thought process he tries but is not able to explore the depth of the characters especially the grandfather he is not able to show the initial horror anxiety and then hopeless detachment and yet the insurmountable courage of the grandfather he wastes our time in the hospital when we should have been shown the time pair spend together he is trying to cram in everything without any priorities he does not understand his subject properly and that really counts against himbr br however the cast does not help sawant either worst job  amruta shubash she is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any sensible acting job how did she get tee phulrani extremely lucky andor extremely influential andor extremely pitiful casting having said that she goes out of her way to do an even terrible job in this movie her act of the msw should have gone to the more responsible actor  sonali kulkarni amruta subhash did not understand it msws work under constant emotional stress and yet it is important for them to project a calm strong exterior as this is reassuring to the patients amruta subhashs asawari seems even more scared and in need of support than the people she is working forbr br second worst  arun nalawade i have never seen a more wooden face in marathi film industry it is abound and everywhere in todays hindi cinema though he is the producer and so he chose himself no second thought no consideration any good actor would have jumped to play this role even if he had to pay the producers to do it but arun nalawade would not let anyone else do it over ambitious and obtuse he contributes to bring down the movie more than everyone else combined his acting lacks research and even the basic acting skills my choice for this role would be vikram gokhalebr br the music is uninspired the movie is technically lacking it could well have been an ftii project jobbr br on the up side brilliant performance by ashwin chitale it is amazing that such a young boy could give such a respectable performance he put many of todays actors to shame unintentionally maybe but he brought his own innocence to his character and that made it a memorable performance also sandeep kulkarni really gave a very believable performance really put in all his efforts and it shows the script too is well writtenbr br shoestring budget cannot be a valid argument to praise this movie lack of funds dogs all of the marathi movies cricket and hindi movies sponge all the money and the rest are left to fight for the scraps it is a sorry state of affairs but yet not reason enough to praise any immature movie that comes out doghi was brilliant movie and it too was made on a shoestring budget doghi also lacked technically but it was well researched and well made it was abound in details and supported by wonderful performances by everyone and that made it rich cinema why did it not receive the accolades it so very deserved  only proves my point of biased judgmentbr br lack of research and not of funds is what makes shwaas such a bad movie
