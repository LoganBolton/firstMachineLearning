fool for love is one of the several now forgotten films robert altman directed throughout the 1980s this one a screen adaptation of a sam shepard play that features shepard in the lead role just simply isnt very good altman made many notverygood films over the course of his fascinating career and many times the fault was his but here i think the fault lies with shepard for writing such a flimsy play altmans direction is assured the performances are ok given what the actors have to work with but this inconsequential screenplay goes nowhere and takes its time getting therebr br shepard is eddie a stuntman who has a lovehate relationship with may kim basinger the two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere while a mysterious man harry dean stanton who may be either a figurative or literal father to both eddie and may quietly observes randy quaid rounds out the fourperson cast as a gentleman callerbr br the only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that eddies and mays relationship is incestuous however this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything the screenplay doesnt explore their relationship in any detail and it doesnt use their relationship to explore any more universal themes shepard and basigner create eccentric mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes stanton and quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots br br the last half hour or so of the film is especially bad when eddies and mays back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone somnolent voice overbr br chalk this up to another of altmans experiments gone awrybr br grade c
