the comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable sadly this version falls far shortbr br the casting is uninspired and the acting wooden one gets the impression the director did not read the bookso did not understand the charactersbr br sir walter elliot is portrayed as pompous but his inadvertent silliness which redgrave brilliantly captured in the 1995 version is nowhere to be foundbr br the musgrove sisters are so unlikable one doesnt understand why wentworth or anybody else would give them a second glancebr br the relationship between wentworth and anne is devoid of feelingbr br in the 1995 version hinds and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions in this one it is hard to understand anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read the bookbr br this production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters relationshipbr br in the scene where wentworth walks in on anne and mary having breakfast it seems to the viewer as mary thinks they are only slight acquaintancesbr br in the 1995 version when wentworth walks in the first time he sees her in years the tension is thick resentment is coming off wentworth in waves while anne is almost overcomebr br in this version while wentworth is courting lousia it is as if he is truly invested the undercurrents are missing in the 1995 version the viewer sees wentworths anger at anne he is flaunting his courtship in front of anne as if to say see what you gave up i dont need or want you anymorebr br yet he still cares if she suffers as the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to take anne back to house illustrates in the 1995 version the viewer feels annes shock that he would care if she was tired we also feel wentworths discomfort that he does still care in this version he just walks on with lousia as if nothing happenedbr br the pivotal scene where anne is conversing with harville about who loves longest man or woman is totally botched the actors are just reciting lines with no emotional investmentbr br when anne reads the letter from wentworth it is as if she is reading a grocery listbr br contrast this to the 1995 version where the viewer feels annes joy at her second chance we are there with her as she reads the letter the director had both actors reading the letter and you hear both their voices wentworth is full of frustration passion and hope while annes is at first incredulous then evolves in to joybr br this production has more scenes after the revelation probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened the 1995 version didnt need to explain we knew and rejoiced for the characters the only thing this production has in its favor is it kept the mrs smith sub plot intact while the 1995 version did notbr br the 1995 version however did include part of austens original ending the scene where wentworth is commissioned by the admiral to find out if anne and mr elliot will want to move back to her house which he  mrs croft are renting after they marry br br this is a production to avoid at all costs
