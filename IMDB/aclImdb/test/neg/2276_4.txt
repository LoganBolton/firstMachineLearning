this fourhour miniseries production is about two hours longer than necessary primarily because the filmmakers seemed not to have a clear idea how to adapt a novel to the screen they seemed not to know what should be kept in and what might safely be left out the film opens with sir walter reading from the peerage book that is his primary solace in his troubles this introduces the family  all of whom we get to know intimately over the next four hours anyway  but serves little other purpose similarly the scenes where the musgroves lament poor richard serve no purpose but to drag the story down some of austens actual dialogue is allocated to different characters and some of her narrative is recycled as dialogue that falls awkwardly from the tongues of the characters there is some fillin dialogue too and this is uniformly dreadful the scene where charles hayter is boring henrietta with his concerns about getting dr shirleys curacy was only barely interesting as narrative in the book as a scene in this production it is stultifying the scene on the cobb when louisa falls and is taken up lifeless is entirely without urgency and i wondered whether wentworths line is there nobody to help me might have been directed at the writers as well as the other actorsbr br this production often looks and feels like a play that has been filmed rather than an actual film and this is most evident in the acting which is the opposite of subtle booming delivery of lines exaggerated gestures and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands feet or faces when they are not speaking their lines charles musgrove stands in his parlour feet shoulder width apart and appears to project to the balcony if there were one when speaking to the other people in the room with him louisa musgroves face when not actively simpering or giggling seems to be in confused repose louisa is a giddy giggly ditzy creature and i did not for a moment believe that wentworth would be interested in her br br the costumes are a mixed bunch but mostly awful and anne elliots green tartan gown is quite possibly the most hideous alleged period costume ever devised we are given the dates at the beginning of the show  it is the late 1790s or perhaps very early 1800s  and yet many of the costumes seem to be of victorian design and thus about 60 years too early the hair is just so wrong that i wont even mention it here except to say that i wont mention it br br this production does do some things right however mrs smith is given her proper importance and her history with mr elliot his dissipation and his intrigues are fully addressed i was also pleased to see the fleshed out reconciliation scenes with anne and frederick at the end which are precious reward for the reader but were glossed over in the 1995 productionbr br if you love the book persuasion and even vaguely like the 1995 movie dont waste a moment or a penny on this production you will find it sorely wanting
