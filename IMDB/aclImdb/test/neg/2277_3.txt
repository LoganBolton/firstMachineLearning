boring utterly predictable soap opera mary tyler moore is married to ted danson whos having an affair with christine lahti moore is friends with lahti and doesnt know about the cheating danson dies in an accident and lahti is pregnant with his baby yawn br br im ashamed to admit i paid money to see this in a theatre in 1986 i liked all three stars but even their considerable talents couldnt pull this off i constantly knew what was going to happen like another poster saidthis plays like a pgrated lifetime moviebr br it does have lahti swearing nonstop at one point and even moore lets loose once also theres a pointless shots of topless women playing football  other than that its tv friendly the only good thing about this was timothy gibbs playing moore and dansons teenage son very handsome and quite a good actor that aside theres nothing to recommend this youve seen it beforeand done better its obviously been forgotten skip it
