this is what used to be called a womens picture and later a chicks flick when times and movies got more juvenile the plot is just soap opera for women and will only appeal to those types the only appeal for most guys is if they wanna see a too railthin mary tyler moore in leotards if youre of a certain age like me that might still be enough to give it a look otherwise mtm gives another of her typical bythenumbers performances that shes been giving since the early 70s when she took it to heart that she was americas sweetheart christine lathi gives another of those abrasive and unpleasant performances that seem a real part of her as a person and probably only appeal to those of that type sorry but it seems true ted danson is too young as mtms husband and usually gives off a slightly creepy appeal unless he has an acting partner who can soften it and it doesnt happen here allan burns wrote  directed and probably got it all through because he worked with mary before wrote it as a project for her and she had the juice at this point to get it made there seems no other purpose to it
