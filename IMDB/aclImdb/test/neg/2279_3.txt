directorscreenwriter allan burns seems to have patched two different scripts together before coming up with this minor outing a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage it results in a wincingly unfunny film christine lahti plays a crass cynical tv news reporter who makes friends with aerobics instructor mary tyler moore and is soon having dinner with moore and her familyonly to discover marys husband ted danson is lahtis secret affair burns has a strange stopandstart rhythm to his dialogue which is neither realistic nor effective just increasingly annoying because nothing important ever seems to get said railthin moore looking alarmingly frail in her leotard has a radiant smile but doesnt convince as dansons wife and danson gets stuck with a paltry thankless role hes just there to be a cad the movie attempts to cover all the bases in a classic case of overreaching womans role in the workplace the tv newsbiz the cheating family man the working wife and mother who wants more a womans need for female friendships et al but nothing substantial comes out of these ideas since burns only halfheartedly examines the issues as a writer he is surprisingly free of punchlines but is devoid of a purpose as well and the heavy plotting just gets all fouled up 12 from
