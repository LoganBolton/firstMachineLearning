it only took one viewing of this dog for me to say never again its so profoundly unmemorable that i had to read other peoples reactions to it before i could remember anything beyond 1 it was awful 2 connery should have quit while he was ahead and 3 the film included a total grossout bit involving faking a retinal scan through the most gruesome not to mention horribly inefficient means possiblebr br actually ive never understood why anybody would prefer even the best of connerys bond films over even the worst moore or dalton outings or lazenby brosnan or even david niven for that matter i personally found octopussy and moonraker among other canonical bond films to be far more entertaining than this and probably for the very same reasons why others deprecate the moore bond films namely their wry humor and their willingness to surrender to the preposterousness of the whole basic bond milieu
