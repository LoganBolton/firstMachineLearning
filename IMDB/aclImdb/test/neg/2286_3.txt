connery climbs aboard the moore buffoon train in this stinker of a movie tossing away everything that made bond successful in the first place this movie further degrades the bond character throwing him into the category of inspector gadget get smart this aint there is no style here only second rate actors performing on cheap sets its a shame that connery couldnt lend an element of class here but it doesnt come across everything here reeks of mediocrity including connerys bad toupee perhaps if i was snowed in and given the choice between watching never say never again and howard the duck i would choose the former if you want the real james bond pick up any ian flemming novel
