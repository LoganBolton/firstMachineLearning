actually i feel like having my review be that one word my friend whose opinions i almost always trust about movies especially horror movies warned me not to rent this no matter how tempted or bored or desperate to see a new horror movie i was because it was a complete waste of time unfortunately i havent talked to him in a while and i was in a hurry to pick a movie and thought what the heck how bad could it be why dont i learn what was i thinking did i think it would magically turn into a better movie while sitting there on the shelf for years waiting to be rentedbr br the plot concerns a guy who edits films for some company his boss is a jerk the guy who had the job before him went insane and blew himself up in the precredits sequence so for some reason the boss picks nerdy ed for the special project of editing loose limbs splatter movies he never says what ed is supposed to edit but i guess that doesnt matter ed is upset by some of the clips working on them up at this house all by himself that the boss has decided to relocate him to for no apparent reason he asks his boss if he can stop or do another project but his boss doesnt care he starts to slowly go insane supposedly from watching the clips and wants to carry out the gory murders in real life or has he been this way all along please note that i am making this plot sound much more deep interesting and coherent than it actually isbr br we dont care about the characters at all or have any sympathy for them or even hate the bad guys the plot is really really boring and predictable the splatter isnt even that gruesome or creativethis is not worth renting just to see the gore because what there is isnt interesting or originalbr br all the tributes to sam raimi just come off like really bad ripoffs and noone in the movie is anywhere near good looking enough as bruce campbell so you cant distract yourself with that i think an evil dead iidead by dawn poster is only prominently displayed in one scene in the hopes that sam raimi will be flattered and not consider any sort of legal action a trained chimp could have written a better screenplay every time i hear lines like are we having funyet which even bride of reanimator couldnt pull off without making me wince i start feeling like picking up some sort of deadly weapon myself characters just appear out of nowhere with no explanation wandering in only to get killed this might be ok if the movie was even remotely amusing or entertaining but it was all i could do to keep from fastforwarding through most of it fortunately i chose to pay some bills and balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was playing trust me it did not require my full attentioni still felt like 90 minutes of my life were wasted just by having this on in the backgroundbr br dont watch it no matter how tempted you areyoull hate yourself for wasting your money horror fans will be completely disgusted by how incompetent it is even those who havent seen too many splatter movies should stay away as there are so many movies out there you could rent that are much more well worth your while if you want something brainless lowbudget and fun rent something else complete waste of time with no redeeming qualities whatsoever be smarter than i was at the time and dont be fooled by the warningnot for the faint of heart on the box you have been warnedbr br
