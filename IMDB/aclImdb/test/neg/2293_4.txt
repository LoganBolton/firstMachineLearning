a swedish splatter movie has the world gone insanebr br probably not but its still not a common sight in these days with swedish goreflicks the bmovie business in sweden seems to have troubles these days long gone are the golden days of rymdinvasion i lappland and this movie seems to have some troubles on its own its just too much talk in it it still manages to be somewhat amusing mainly for the good fx which are great for a bmovie the script and most of the acting is still pretty bad though but that actually dont matter that much its supposed to be a gore flick and nothing more thats where it goes a bit wrong for some reason theres is simply not enough blood to fill the void br br every person who know about gert fylking will have a good laugh over his role as a sgt though i nearly laughed my ass off its really that hilariously bad br br besides the good parts ive listed theres really nothing else to recommend here unless youre starved for swedish bmoviesbr br 410
