this swedish splatter movie tries to parodyimitate american horror films such as the evil dead gremlins and others writerdirectoractorcinematographer anders jacobsson and writerproduceractormakeup effects supervisor göran lundström did i miss something were obviously inspired by sam raimi but the camera work is a bad copy of what can be seen in the evil dead and elsewhere some other users have written that they enjoyed the humor of this film but i didntbr br the film rather disturbed than entertained me it tries to combine suspense and comedy and the final product just left me with a feeling of oppressiveness although it wasnt scary or shocking at all the combination of different genre elements made this film very strange i was never sure if it was meant to be scary or funnybr br the story is quite inventive except for the showdown at the hospital but i didnt like the way it was staged for the reasons mentioned above the gore  make up effects are considerably good and at least the loose limbs sequences were quite entertaining because in these scenes the filmmakers didnt try to mix scares and jokesbr br all in all a strange film that you will either hate or love rest in pieces evil edbr br my rating 310 made me stick to american productions
