calling this film a decent or enjoyable horror tribute is far too optimistic heck you cant even refer to it as a nice spoof of the genre because its way below average  its funny but not hahafunny you know but still id say to give it a look if only for the huge amount of trivia elements in it by the way all those people whore complaining about this movie here in their comments have only themselves to blame when you see the dvdcover of this film you should already know that its not going to be on the same level as the piano for example so dont come complaining afterwardsbr br evil ed couldve been something but the totally screwed it up i suppose the main idea behind this film is criticism towards the growing cuttingcommittee in horror nowadays it shows an editor named edward whos slowly wellnot too slowly going nuts by seeing all the violence and gore in the movies produced by his company produced the big boss is named sam campbellfunny isnt it  personally i also expected a character named bruce raimi but to my surprise there wasnt anyway this guy became rich by making movies called loose limbs they feature  and im not kidding you  scenes in which a girl is getting raped by a beaver  and then gets shot in the head by a bazooka  now who says horror isnt original anymore br br with all the gore and the loose limbs its hard to believe it but it really gets boring very quick after a decent first 25 minutes evil ed turns into complete boredom and never recovers from that the only think left to do then  besides pushing the ejectbutton of course  is look for the obvious amount of references to other much better horror films i saw scenes obviously stolen from the evil dead silence of the lambs braindead and several othersand theres a huge amount of classic horror posters on the walls to admire as wellbr br evil ed finds it origin in sweden im convinced theres a lot up talent there far north  take the danish nattevagten as an example but none of them talents joined the cast or crew of evil ed only to see if youre in a dumb mood and you dont want to use your brain at all
