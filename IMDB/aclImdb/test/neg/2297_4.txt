the glorious edward gets to move up in the world when his supervisor tells him that he can drop those filthy swedish drama movies and head up stairs to the splatter and gore department excited along with his big anticipations for the new type of movies he soon will be going to edit he asks all sorts of questions about the wage his workspace and lunch brake well not really edward is maybe quite the opposite calm stuttering guy on top of that he got glasses with the exception when hes insane i guess that created a much creepier atmospherebr br evil ed is with all reason a swedish movie but somehow a magical force came across the good actors and turned their lovely swedish accents into stereotypical american voices i guess thats some of the expertise an actor needs these days the acting is veryÂ…wooden as in they are inflexible not bendable well hey what did you actually expect on top of that the movie has a jamming techno theme song sounds like its etype in any case this only makes the movie experience worse since im fairly harsh against this movie so far there will usually be a breaking point where i tone the level of happiness up but theres really not much to say the blueprints look good but somehow hanz spelt coffee over it and partially destroyed it thats how i look at this movie if the movie ended where edward is taken to a mental institute and they refurnished the parts from where he goes insane and kills people the result would have been much better but thats just my radical view i would also like to see more footage from the lose limbs moviesbr br there are also illogical things to discover in this piece of movie lets to say that the actors really are american living in america why would they then work on a swedish movie like edward did and also that delivery man why is it that he never uses the doorbell which is located directly beside him instead he goes away with tapping softly at the door good old edward really got some good ears to hear all that while he is editingbr br anyway this movie had its moments its just a shame there were not that many but that doesnt mean i would not recommend it its a rather cheap movie go ahead and buy its almost like i see a pattern for the price and the movie on the other side if you like watching dubbed movies getting crappier by the second this might be it my verdict would then be a rock solid 4
