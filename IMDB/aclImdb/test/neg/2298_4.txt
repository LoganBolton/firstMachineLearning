you know i really have a problem with movie lists i was reading maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the 50 greatest bmovies of all time and knowing me i of course have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them this is why you see reviews of movies like gator bait and barb wire and coffy on my list so i noticed hots at the video store the other day and recognized it from maxims list of the 50 greatest bmovies and i decided to rent it and check it out my only consolation is that i rented it because i recognized it from a list of bmovies so i already knew it was going to suck br br given the type of movie that it is i cant say that hots is a total failure since it is nothing more than a late 70s ta film and it never pretends to by anything else the only place where it strays widely from its objective is in a ragged subplot involving a couple of excons who have stashed a lot of stolen money in the house that the selfnamed hots move in to because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary br br the story is based on a couple of rival sororities at the beloved fu which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of one sorority until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the snobs in the other one this new sorority help out the seals hots is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals the seal subplot is another one that doesnt really belong in the movie and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie br br this is going to sound weird but there was actually one scene that i was pretty impressed with in this movie one shot that i was impressed with i should say about midway through the movie one of the girls in pi the rival sorority is pouring alcohol into the punch and she pours some for herself in a glass and drinks it oddly enough what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that charlie chaplin would do which really brightened up the movie obviously nothing in this movie comes close to anything that chaplin ever did but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a 2 to a 4br br as a whole however the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes i liked how the removeonepieceofclothingforeveryscore in the football game at the end was one of the girls ideas riiiiiiiiightÂ… and not much thought is put into much of anything else there is for example a scene early in the film when a couple of the pi girls pour hot sauce into the refreshments at a hots party accidentally getting caught in an incriminating photograph the girl taking the picture didnt realize that she photographed them at the time although the photograph never comes up for any reason later in the film br br ive seen movies like this before its kind of like gator bait but without the violence and the rednecks and coffy wasnt far off even barb wire is much the same just with a bigger budget and more silicon thankfully maxims 50 bmovie list contains only a few more comedies because while these cheesy teen ta films are entertaining every once in a while as bad movies with the occasional seminude scene after watching hots i think ive decided that i like the bad horror movies better than the bad comedies id rather watch a lot of terrible actors pretend to be scared than pretend to be funny
