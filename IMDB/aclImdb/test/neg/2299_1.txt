when my mum went down to the video store to rent a film for the night my sister and i learned a lesson to always company my mum to the video store in fact the only reason why she chose it was because colin firth was in it and she cough thinks hes a good actorbr br it starts off with some beautiful veiws of africa and then goes down and down and down and down after this film i was very surprised that colin firth got as far as he did since this pointless film could destroy any actors careerbr br the story is about a divorced women whos son is trying to matchmake her to a man called matthew fields who he met whilst impressing his friends because of his large housebr br nimi the divorce does not like matthew at all and is going out with the local vicar who does not like her son john and the same with himbr br i am sorry if you disagree with me and i hope i havent offended you but to all the people who havent seen this film i leave you with one word of warning dont watch this film
