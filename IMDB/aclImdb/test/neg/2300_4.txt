the murder of the red comyn in grayfriars abbey was a long way from one of the most horrendous things ever done in the scottish war of independence and fights and killing in churches wasnt unusual at all not that much later robert bruces wife daughter two of his sisters were captured during a fight in a church in which people were killed and comparing it to the massacre of berwick in which the english slaughtered at least 8000 noncombatants some yes in churches is ridiculousbr br that said this is not a wellmade movie it is slightly antidote to the absolutely ridiculous sniveling representation of robert bruce in braveheart whatever bruce was it wasnt a wussbr br too bad that they didnt do a better job of this because someone should make a really good movie of a war that is so amazing that it sounds like something someone made up going from complete defeat at the battle of methven to a secret return from hiding to a long guerrilla war to bannockburn this isnt it though poorly made and to a large extent poorly written and acted too bad
