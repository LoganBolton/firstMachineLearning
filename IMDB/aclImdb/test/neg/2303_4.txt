dubbed beyond comprehension the hbo version of lumumba is a disastrous rendering of what looks like what was once a decent film some scenes simply dont make sense in english and the actors bring zero energy to their voice reading add in the selfcensorship involving cia operative frank carlucci and you have a film stripped of both its drama and its power heres hoping the subtitled version gets to american television screens at some point
