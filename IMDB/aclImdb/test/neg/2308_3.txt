i remember when the love machine was first released to theaters i was a mere 13 years old too young to see the muchballyhooed motion picture release but not too old to take my moms paperback copy of the jacqueline susann novel to school and pore over the naughty bits with my schoolmatesbr br though im not sure what my problem was at such an early age but i was very much into the book i bought and wore an ankh ring just like on the paperback cover and i remember the ads for the perfume xanadu that was crosspromoted and featured clumsily in the film despite such an interest i didnt actually see the film until several years later i should have left things as they werebr br the love machine is hands down the worst of the many bad films adapted from susanns novelswhich of course makes it the most fun to watch its faults are many from its hopscotching script that jumps choppily from one incident to another with nary a connecting thread its dated horny brass instruments i mean music score of ersatz bacharach the flat firsttake performances the boring sexuality ive never seen bathrobes featured so prominently in a movie before its like a fetish whenever sex nudity or something sleazy is called for out pops somebody in a blue robe very odd that and most certainly the circus train of awful 70s fashions that are on endless display poor dyan cannons performance which is no great shakes anyway but heads over the rest of the cast is consistently undermined by the jawdropping get ups shes called upon to wear however the films chief liability is the stoic stonelike john philip law as appropriately enough robin stone the object of every girls and one overÂ–thetop flaming male photographers affectionbr br law is just awful and performs as if he were pulled off the street handed the pages of the script in hurry and told to give a cold reading on the spot just lifeless not only that but he appears in desperate need of a blood transfusion or something he looks wan and sickly throughout and is several pounds smaller than most of his female costars robin stone should be a hunk not a hankiebr br for anyone finding the film hard going its rather slow by todays standards i beg you to stick around for the climactic fight scene here ms cannon balancing 23 pounds of teased hair finally abandons her heretofore starchy acting style and lets loose with that infectiously raucous laugh of hers setting in motion a truly memorable free for all that should have become a cinema clip highlight by now trying to rival valley of the dollss infamous wigdownthetoilet scene the love machine finally does something rightbr br jacqueline susanns unique brand of trash is sorely missed perhaps someone out there owns the rights to rona barretts the lovomaniacs and will revive the genre
