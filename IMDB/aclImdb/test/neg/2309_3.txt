to preface my remarks on the film i know the topic is horrendous and words cant adequately express the compassion any decent person would have for people dealing with the posthorrors of an atomic bomb dropped near them br br however this film doesnt really deal with in a horrific way except for the first 10 minutes some of the images there are horrifying and should be as a reminder what devastation nuclear weapons can produce seeing burned people walking around aimlessly or man combing his hair and clumps of hair coming out etc is not a pretty sight br br but after the first dozen minutes this japanese film concerns people dealing with the aftermath of hiroshima in the midtolate 40s i actually found the story developing quickly into a boring soap opera br br almost all the story occurs five years after the bomb and deals mainly with one familys problems at that point this is why it became more of a melodrama than some shocking story of nuclear disaster its simply a story about how these people got on with their lives from about 1950 on whether one of the women was permanently damaged and if so should she marry br br this could have been a real impact film but it didnt go in that direction
