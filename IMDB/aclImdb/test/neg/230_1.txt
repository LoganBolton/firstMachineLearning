bruce willis as usual does an excellent jobbr br warning may be considered a spoilerbr br while my friend thought it was good i kept glancing at my watch during the entire movie wondering when it would end after seeing such great flicks as the patriot and chicken run i was really disappointed in disneys the kidbr br willis plays a middleaged man with a harsh and realistic attitude on putting a positive spin on peoples images hes an image consultant an unknown kid shows up yes its him but younger and even lily tomlin can see him at this point im reminded of a cross between a poor quantum leap episode and a bad time traveling flickbr br kid and willis go through trying to figure out why hes in that time period they figure it out they meet willis when hes older nevermind that it never goes into detail how old willis teleports them between time periods and gets them together to begin with how he got that knowledge to begin with how he came to the realization that he needed to do this and so onbr br basically its a very tired unoriginal uninspiring plot that has some great actors in it the good news is that the kid actor is nowhere near as annoying as hes presented in the trailers on television
