id really have to rate sex is comedy as one of the worst pieces of dreck i have ever seen the film inadvertedly showcases those which are the worst aspects of the french or at least how they are stereotyped narcissism snobbery and pseudointellectualism i myself am frenchcanadian and feel slightly ashamed that the creators of this film are from the same culture as me that should give you an idea as to how bad this movie really was one doesnt so much watch this film as undergo torture to it there was a total lack of humour and it seemed to me as if the entire film was a documentary interviewing people who were neither famous nor talented as if to celebrate something that has never happened to begin with instead why not watch auberge espagnole happenstance or je taime a la folie three fantastic modern french films
