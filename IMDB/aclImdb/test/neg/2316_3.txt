zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz if imdb would allow oneword reviews thats what mine would be this film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film the singing the story everything is dull and washed outjust like this public domain print like other comedy team films with roots in traditional kids stories such as the awful snow white and the three stooges and the overrated babes in toyland this movie has limited appeal and just doesnt age well now that i think about it i seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable so my advice is dont watch this film if you must watch an abbott and costello film almost any other one of their films except for ac go to mars would be an improvement
