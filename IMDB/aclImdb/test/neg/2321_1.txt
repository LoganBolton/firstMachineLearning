absolutely inane film starring abbott and costello even our young children would become increasingly annoyed with this complete mess of a filmbr br abbott as dinklepuss what a look he had on his face sure he had to be part of this dreadful filmbr br did anyone notice that costellos mother in the film sounded and looked like fay bainter luckily for ms bainter that she wasnt in the filmbr br there is really no excitement hear for children the jokes if any are quite stale some of the singing is nicely done but the lyrics are ridiculous
