im not really much of an abbott  costello fan although i do enjoy whos on first and to be honest there wasnt much in this movie that would inspire me to watch any more of their work it wasnt really bad it had some mildly amusing scenes and actually a very convincing giant played by buddy baer but somehow given the fame of the duo and the esteem in which theyre generally held i have to say i was expecting more as the story goes the pair stumble into a babysitting job and during the reading of jack  the beanstalk as a bedtime story with the kid reading it to costello costellos jack falls asleep and dreams himself into the story theres a wizard of oz kind of feel to the story in that the characters in the dream are all the equivalents of reallife acquaintances of jack and the movie opens in black  white and shifts to colour during the dream sequence the fight scenes between jack and the giant and the dance scene between jack and polly dorothy ford are among the amusing parts of the movie polly of course also leads to one of the questions of the movie  what happened to her jack and gang apparently left her behind in the giants castle i know  it was just a dream so who cares still  i wondered there were also a couple of cute song and dance routines my 4 year old giggled a bit during this so she was able to appreciate some of the humour i found it to be an acceptable timewaster but certainly not anything that would convince you of abbott and costello as comic geniuses 410
