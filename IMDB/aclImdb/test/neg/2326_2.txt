i bought the video for Â£13 at hmv we pay more in britain as a friend had told me it was highly rated and the reviews on this site were generally impressivebr br i have to say that the opening credits were a let downthe dancingmusic not very powerfulbr br the car ride and unexpected crash just as the lady passenger was going to be harmed was a nice touchsomething unexpectedthough the way she walked away from the car with hair perfectly groomed and still carrying a handbag looked corny for most directors but for lynch was something elsebr br her dazed walking around after such a shock was enhanced by a regular low noise similar to fingers scraping along a blackboard i thought another lynch master touch perhaps portraying the demons gnawing into her shocked and traumatised self conscious after a while this noise became somewhat annoying and on further investigation i discovered the new video cassette squeakedbr br i dont know whether this squeak took away a lot of my enjoyment but this movie became a waste of timeand moneybr br the two female characters had some presence and the lesbian scenes were fair enough though predictable there were no male characters of any merit and apart from a few vaguely good scenes the hoover switching on there were far too many dreadful scenes that were plain weak and ridiculous eg the coffee being spat into the napkin by the menacing loon and the silly monster face at the back of the diner oh and what about the paint in the wifes jewelsboring and naffbr br this whole film gives you the feel of the failed geniusyou know when you listen to the worst dylan track ever and think my god that was embarrassingwas that really bobbr br the whole feel is that of a failed tv movie  badly put together with a few not many extra bits to give it a 15 ratingbr br i whizzed it on during the last 30 minutes br br do i give it another chance and watch again if i want to be puzzled and work hard at understanding a film i will watch frank woods guide to consolidated accountingbr br lynch did one classic blue velvet and straight story was nicebr br this like wild at heart was a let down  his weirdness is now predictable and stale anybody want to buy a 2nd hand videobr br make way for some younger original talent davidbr br four out of ten and no more sorry
