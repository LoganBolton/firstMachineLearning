i cant emphasize it enough do not get this movie for the kidsbr br for that matter youd best spare the adults from it as wellbr br all right perhaps im overexaggerating a little this isnt the worst kids movie no let me rephrase that this isnt the worst movie made by dissilusioned adults for dissilusioned adults and somehow marketed towards kids that would be jack which ive been meaning to review  gut like a fishbr br adults wont learn anything surprising well if you must fastforward to just before the end credits for a educational bit about an interesting cosmic phenominon we dont usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way well duh i could have told you that so can four years of college at an art school but i degressbr br i have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie most likely it will only upset them we get to watch the moment when russ was traumatized at eight years old theres a better movie kikis delivery service that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head and the adults will like it toobr br by the way there is a moment in the movie made with amature mst3kers in mind if they think of that other bruce willis movie with a sad little kid in it
