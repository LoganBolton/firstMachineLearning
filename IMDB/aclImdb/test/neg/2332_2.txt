there is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a film such as this i remember feeling the same way after disliking dogma if you do not like a film that is odd and controversial like mulholland dr you are seen as not getting it of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it anywaybr br i have heard from several different sources that the unique and likable aspect of this film is a dreamlike quality it has in other words the plot isnt structured like other films with the case of mulholland dr it seems more like an unfocused collage made by a third grade boy who procrastinated until the last second to do his art project it doesnt make sense it isnt supposed to but i know it was to be a tv series at first it appears lynch had a stack of unused film and decided to mash it in with a bunch of new stuff you will notice that toward the end the nudity sex and foul language increase all things he would not have filmed for televisionbr br for a better film not told in a traditional linear fashion rent the thin red line from 1998 that was a great film this is notbr br rating 2 out of ten
