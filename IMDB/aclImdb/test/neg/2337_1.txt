some directors take 2 and a half hours to tell a story david lynch takes 2 and a half hours to piece together scenes with clues and his trademark oddity but theres never a story no plot no progression of the characters unless you find revealed delusion a progression it amazes me how anyone can call lynchs garbage art but if beauty rests in the eye of the beholder so be it lynchs movie and tv work in the 1980s came off as avant garde and alternative fine 20 years later work like mulholland drive comes off as a 25 hour david lynch masturbation piece its embarrasing ive finally seen the movie that takes my top spot as the worst ever at least the people churning out godzilla and rodan werent passing them off as art
