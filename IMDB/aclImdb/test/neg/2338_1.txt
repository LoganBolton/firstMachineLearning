i get the feeling a lot of people liked this movie not all people but a lot of them because they dont want to admit they dont understand it people of middling intelligence if you will who pretend to be ever so avant garde and trendy who think lynch is a geniusbr br lynch to me is like tarantino theyre both great but neither one is the messiah as so many fanboys want to believe no director can change the world so chill out and both make sucky flicks sometimes it just happens everyone has a bad day and clearly since this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then hackjobbed into a feature film it wasnt made with all the passion and forethought one should put into a movie face it much of the movie is gibbering unintelligibility which cannot be understood we can all make up meanings lynch may have his own view but none of that matters it was strewn about the screen incoherently admittedly the first portion had the semblance of an intentionally convoluted passingly interesting story but then it faltersbr br the cowboy the mysterious organization of men with their phonecalls the lawyers come on i can almost picture david lynch yelling cut forcing the crew to gather around him and explaining to them all look how crazy and weird i am isnt it great its so weird and crazy weird and crazy works if its a byproduct of your style however its pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do nothing but that its like all those half assed pulp fiction throw backs that came out after pulp fiction its just not cool
