like most i rented this after i heard the universal praise and despite countless bizarre unexplainable moments along the way i was very interested and entertained through 100 minutes of the film then the two women went to the performance late at night the rest of movie which is another 40 minutes by the way is even weirder than the first part and completely contradict and dump on what i had already seen then the movie abruptly endsbr br baffled i wandered over to my computer to see if i could buy a clue as to what just happened nothing made sense and im a pretty clever guy none of these other user comments made sense even when they say spoilers i still have no idea what theyre saying someones dream not real then whats the point of a 2 hour 30 minute movie if its not real or is it real im forced to make a choice eitherbr br a the movie is a work of genius on a mensa level and im simply too stupid to understand itbr br b the movie is weird for weirds sake and just doesnt make sense everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend like they get itbr br i choose b screw you guys im going home
