to me this film is just a very very lame teen party movie with all the normal clich√©s and boring stereotyped characters nerds jocks popular girls sleezy guys etc but with an underlying anti drugdrinking theme br br if you ever have the unfortunate chance of seeing this film keep an eye out for all the references to responsibility and keeping it real dunno how else to word it i guess the only thing thatd make this film cool would be if they tv playing it was on fire that or dvd it was on explodedbr br 1 out of 10000  watch animal house instead
