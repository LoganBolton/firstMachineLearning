i watched this film on telly the other night and little did i know what a cringefest it would bei knew it would be stupid but not this bad this film exemplifies everything that is awful in australian comedy apart from the most tedious uninspired scenarios and characters i have ever come across aside from those dubious french produced american tax break comedies most of the situations were boring unbelievable stereotypical and so not funny justterrible br br one such scenario that really annoyed me was the nerds on the bus scene from a screen writing perspective the writers used the most uninteresting  not to mention unbelievable  scenario to get these three stranded without their luggagethey are on the holiday of their lives and theyre going to risk it all including a 300 deposit luggage and room to exert their rights to dance on a bus i mean theyre about half an hour away from their destination at least they could have had the bus driver kick them off but no they leave willingly cos they cant take it anymoreand wreck their holidayanyway i cant believe the writers didnt workshop this appalling scenario out i think a ten year old could come up with 5 setups more clever funny and believablebr br i can go on with many others  the really unimaginative stereotypical psychopath the whole relationship with the angry jilted girlfriend and tag along virgin the wow man out there goth girl inhaling stuff on the train  everything was just woeful i cannot think of one redeeming feature of the this film except that maybe the third wheel nerd was kind of cute spoilt his career by appearing in this trash though
