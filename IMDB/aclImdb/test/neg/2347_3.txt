the cellar is an intolerably dull and overly childfriendly 80s cheese parade directed by kevin tenney creator of the much better films witchboard and night of the demons and starring the incredibly untalented patrick kilpatrick supposedly depicting a guy with feelings the pacing is really slow the plot feels far too familiar the monstereffects are all but petrifying and the film opens and ends with tedious narrative ranting that somehow feels unrelated to the actual subject matter of the film the voiceover keeps on nagging about wind and creatures riding on wind but what the hell theres no wind in the plot like so many 80s horror movies the cellar handles about cursed indian landscapes and alltooreal mythical monsters hidden in basements and quagmires mance cashen and his family move into a house build on what once was the home of native americans but then white people came and turned the land into oil fields half of the script is wasted on explaining the origin of the monster but i can easily summarize it for you an ancient indian witchdoctor summoned the creature which looks like an oversized papermâché rat to annihilate the white people overflowing his land but he buried it again because and i quote the sob kills indians as well mances hugely irritating son accidentally awakens the beast and naturally cant convince his parents about the big hungry rat in the cellar the allegedly emotional family situation daddy constantly wants his son to love him is very pathetic and redundant and the film badly needed more bloodshed kids movie or not the youthful hero chris miller is quite annoying but weve definitely seen worse kid actors in the 80s the cellar is very much not recommended unless of course youre a fan of cheesy and typically 80s monster designs the big dodgy ratthing is a real hoot to see
