first of all let me make it clear this movie is a real piece of garbage but although it is a real piece of garbage it is an better piece of garbage than it could have been it could have sucked bigtime but it doesntbr br what this movie didnt have was for example scary moments good acting and a good script it wasnt very entertaining either but the movie had cool music fancy locations and hot girls it also works great as a dracula spoof hope it was meant that way although i really dont think sobr br the story focuses on three girls in transylvania awaking an ancient vampire which then terrorizes and kills the girls one by one sounds familiar yes so it doesbr br after reading through this you may think that i should have given it a better vote the reason i dont is because i almost felt asleep at some points
