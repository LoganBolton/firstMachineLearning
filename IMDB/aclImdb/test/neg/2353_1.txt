hitchcock is a great director ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch i admire hitchcok on a purely visual and technical levelbr br first the positives hitchcock invented the notion of the probing camera the curious eye that is able to withhold or search for information it isnt exactly a new visual grammar but it was revolutionary thenbr br secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie he has an economical style and is always thinking of the audience he gives them regular thrills regular jolts of humour and regular shocks in short he anticipates the audiences base needs and plays them like a fiddlebr br unfortunately the base needs of a human being are mostly stupid food sex the thrill of danger and a little comedy hithcock caters for all these needs on screen with the exception of food which judging from his size he catered to off screenbr br its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films a second downside is that most of hitchcocks camera work and visual grammar are now common place what keeps his films watchable are the simple economy of his tales the intelligence of his camera work and his skill at crafting tense action set piecesbr br so on to saboteur this is a lighthearted romp in the vein of the 39 steps it jumps from sequence to sequence until it concludes at the typical hitchcock final act set piecebr br on an emotional level the relationship between the leads is not up to par with robert donat and madeleine caroll in the 39 steps hence the whole story lacks a certain energy the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes and new scenes only bring us nearer the end since its not clear if the hook is the heros escape from the police from the villains or his action to stop the plotted sabotagesbr br there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws for example a guy with handcuffs frees himself using a car fan belt etc why doesnt he just drive away in the car surely handcuffs arent that restrictive hes able to swim in them after allbr br if you want a better hitchcock wartime propaganda flick from the 40s i would advise you watch foreign correspondant they are both silly chase movies with a catchy finale but foreign correspondant makes great use of umbrellas and tulips something spielberg rips off nicely in minority reportbr br 7510  some good set pieces beyond that however theres nothing much to sink your teeth into
