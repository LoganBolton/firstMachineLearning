as i post this comment imdb currently rates alfred hitchcocks subpar saboteur a 7310 personally i rated it less than half that honestly i cant tell how a movie this bad couldve come from what is probably the most consistently good director i know of ive seen about 10 other hitch movies from the 30s60s vertigo is thus far my hands down favorite while saboteur is easily the worst its hard to believe that 7 years earlier hitch used the very same formula in the 39 steps far more competently my recommendation would be to see that instead and avoid this like the plague its the only hitchcock movie that i turned off before before the end and have no desire to go back and see the rest if you must watch it then rent or borrow dont make the mistake i did and buy the dvd on good faith earned through notorious rebecca vertigo rear window etc even a master screws up sometimes i guessbr br edit maybe i was a bit harder on this film than i shouldve been its certainly nowhere near ed wood or manos or anything like that but theres three reasons i feel i must rate it so lowbr br 1 the name hitchcock brings with it certain expectations of quality this film delivers on a few of them but theyre way overshadowed by the darn near nonsensical plottingbr br 2 i want to compensate a bit for all the 8 ratings this film is getting hitchcock is like the john coltrane of directors true fans will find reasons to consider anything by him a work of art but the high rating on imdb gives more casual movie enthusiasts like myself the impression that this movie is far better than it actually is br br 3 i spent 18 on this maybe if itd cost me 5 or even 10 id probably be a bit less bitter
