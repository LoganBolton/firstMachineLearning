human traffic is purely a been there done that experience  only this time its quite limpbr br major themes explored are paranoia male impotence and jealousy  but only mildly and poorlybr br a lot of the movie seems to want to imitate trainspotting drug  clubbing culture  but it fails to include the low times  comedowns that trainspotting deals with eg issues with death  dependence etc it even tries to come up with a similar monologue to ewan mcgreggors classic choose life speech  but the milky bars are on me yeah  what the fudge is that all aboutbr br the characters try to analyse their lifestyle but when their lifestyle is so shallow  their analysis becomes boring and repetitiousbr br the soundtrack for a movie that is trying to be cool is pathetic it includes the likes of fat boy slim and cj bolland  come on people  good dance music is be better than thisbr br the characters become grating and annoying especially half way through the movie and the lack of careforthecharacters soon dawnsbr br there are a couple of funny scenes  but they are few and far between the mother catching the son in the bedroom was quite amusingbr br but please  im sick to death of the star wars analogy scenes i thought it was much more sharper in a couple of kevin smiths movies ie clerks and chasing amy according to the characters  yoda is a drug fiend hence thats why he is short and bald  huhbr br my score  4 out of 10  do yourself a favour and see trainspotting or go instead
