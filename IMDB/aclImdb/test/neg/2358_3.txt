if i wouldnt have had any expectations of this film it might have received a 5 or 6 as it stands i give it a 3 the acting is poor the factual accuracy of the drugs it discusses is lacking and i feel no empathy whatsoever for the charactersbr br i watched adam  paul immediately before watching this film and i both laughed and cried on several occasions this film did not strike even a similar chord the directors of human traffic may have some offhand experience of ecstasy but there is no demonstration of actual drugrelated semantic knowledge here in fact i find it rather offensive and contraproductive to the strife of making current drug laws less politically orientedbr br watch requiem for a dream if what youre looking for is an amazing touching film about drugs
