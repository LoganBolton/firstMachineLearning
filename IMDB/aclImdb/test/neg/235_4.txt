first of all i wasnt sure who this film was aimed at  it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids wouldnt understand and find boring there wasnt really much to it bruce willis wasnt stretched as an actor at all he did a lot of glancing to the side with that half smile of his  unless you are a big fan of his i wouldnt bother and if its the story youre interested in guy who seems to have it all but is lacking emotionally is taught lessons from a child i would go to see about a boy it has everything this film lacked humor sadness and reality
