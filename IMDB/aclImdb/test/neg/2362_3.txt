this extremely bargainbasement blaxploitationkungfu hybrid was in my country released by a questionable dvd label that usually speaking just occupies with the transfer of pure crap onto disc so that wasnt exactly a favorable herald several other titles were released in the same series like the black six the black gestapo and the black godfather and judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews none of these belong to the elite of the 70s blaxploitation hype neither tnt jackson is a pretty lousy film completely lacking a significant plot but featuring far too many laughable fighting scenes and horrible acting to compensate apparently roger corman  never too embarrassed to make some easy money  assigned two of his most loyal acolytes to rapidly invent a simplistic story that would appeal to fans of both oriental kungfu movies and contemporary trendy blaxploitation flicks the result cirio h santiago and dick miller came up with was tnt jackson the tale of an arsewhooping black babe traveling to hong kong in search of her missing brother she quickly discovers he was killed by a criminal network of drugsmugglers and swears to avenge him mrs jackson smoothly infiltrates into the underground and encounters macho pimps helpful undercover agents loads of vicious kungfu fighters only one things for sure they all want a piece of tnts ravishing body in one way or another i sincerely doubt movie concepts get any more elementary than this but  unfortunately  all the other aspects suck too the battle scenes are overlong and moreover pathetically staged jeannie bell and the other poor suckers try really hard to stare menacingly and assume a tough position but eventually all they ever do is kick in the air and stupidly leap across rooms the cinematography is horrid the soundtrack is vastly disappointing whatever happened to soul music the few dialogs are poorly written and the acting performances are inferior speaking of which jeannie bell is undeniably a beautiful woman but still she cant hold a candle to tamara dobson or pam grier theres only one really good and memorable scene in tnt jackson namely the famous hotel room battle where bell entirely naked except for panties repeatedly switches the light on and off whilst kicking the hell out of some goons amusing scene  i just havent figured out yet whether its thanks to the light switch ingenuity or bells perfectly shaped breasts
