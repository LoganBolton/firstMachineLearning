a young woman nicknamed tnt for being virtual dynamite in a fight and a knockout in terms of looks to boot goes to the most lawless part of hong kong in search of her missing brother stag jackson when she learns he has been murdered she decides she will bring the killer to justice in a fashion only she canbr br sounds good doesnt it well theres really nothing wrong with the basic premise as a starting base for a martial artsblaxploitation action thriller which is what this aims to be the leads actually prove pretty good too with jeanne bell fitting nicely into the role of tnt and stan shaw doing well as the ambitious powerhungry charlie where this fails miserably is in terms of the fighting action it offers up the fight scenes are totally and completely unconvincing andor sometimes so completely over the top it reaches the point of ridiculousness which doesnt at all help when the basic focus of your movie is a kung fu action heroine also the poor lighting actors sporting accents making them hard to understand the confusing camerawork and the sometimes poor sound doesnt help this obvious low budget effort out either any this does deliver in one area which may delight some fans it does offer up plenty of the t in t  a in fact practically every fight scene in the film is proceeded by some type of nude scene and jeanne bell actually does have one extended fight scene in which she is completely toplessbr br in the end this fails to be something you want to revisit because the fight scenes are so pathetically laughingly bad
