doesnt this seem somewhat familiar oh wait thats right 90 of the jokes in this movie have already been done in the tv series whats the point in repeating yourself you may ask is it for the benefit of the americans who havent seen the programme did the scriptwriters run out of inspiration or maybe everyone on set suffered a sudden attack of amnesia and forgot theyd covered this ground already either way for someone who has sat through the first three series this was just really boring i had to turn it off during the tablets that turn your water green part yes it is very funny but give us something original for goodness sake actually if the best new stuff you can come up with is leonard rossiters take on saturday night fever you can forget itbr br the guy they got to replace the late richard beckinsale is a lookalike alright but not half the actor personally i would exorcised the role as a mark of respect to him or better yet not bothered making the film at all and just let the hilarity of the tv series speak for itself but no they couldnt do that not as long as there was money to be made sad really 410
