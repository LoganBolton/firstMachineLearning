like a lot of movies involving little kids this starts off real cute and likableand then after about a half hour or so becomes the reversebr br thats certainly the case here in this timetravel story which i usually love where an adult meets a kid who his really him at the age of eight great premise and a great lead actor in bruce willis butbr br the kid rusty is a smartaleck and whiny brat and willis rusty grown up now as russell gets abrasive with his constant yelling that is entertainment no thanksbr br young breslin has gone on to become a very good child actor being involved in a number of films including the cat in the hat opposite a more famous child actor dakota fanning br br overall a disappointing film especially with all the good press this movie got when it was released
