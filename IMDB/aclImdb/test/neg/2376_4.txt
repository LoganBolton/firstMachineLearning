this asterix is very similar to modern disney cartoons soulless technically good and the usual injokes for adults maybe its because this is the first cartoon i watched after laputa castle in the sky but it was quite disappointingbr br the plot is contrived and forgettable but it involves asterix and obelix going to the vikings territory to rescue a spoilt teenager who then learns humility and finds love as well oh and initially they dont get on but after facing adversity they all share a deep bond of friendship yadda yaddabr br the best bit is to watch out for the little jokes the vikings get all the best ones such as vikea the vikings chiefs wife giving a list of furniture and skulls to bring back from the next raid or the vikings not knowing the meaning of mercy literally oh and olaf the dumbest viking is actually hilarious as much for the voice acting as the dialoguebr br for example aboard the viking ship after a speech by abba the captains daughter olaf who is this new guy captain thats my daughter codbrain olaf your daughters a man
