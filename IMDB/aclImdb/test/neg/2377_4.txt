this film is a perfect example that a movie can not be successful with a high budget alone its obvious that there was a lot of time and effort dedicated into this the animation is fluid detailed and superb the soundtrack isnt too memorable except for the ending song by celine dion at least i think it was her the musical score is powerful full orchestra material kudos to the animators and music composers 910 however the story and characters fall flat it feels very been there done that predictable and plain uninteresting the characters have distinct personalities but nothing too likable they annoyed me to no end i tried really hard to like this but i didnt care about the story it was cliché actionadventure plot there were jokes that werent funny it was vomit inducing predictable from start to end the dialogue was cliché and awful especially the last line its not  that gives you wings its love whatever it was i remember cringing i was wishing it would hurry up and finish i wasnt the only one either the people i went with thought it was boring please watch the asterix and obelix cleopatra film if youre going to watch any this was a waste of time
