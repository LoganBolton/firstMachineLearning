i think its the first time that i go inside a theater and go out so disappointed there were two reasons why i went to see astérix et les vikings first as a film buff and second as a big astérix fanbr br in the end the film doesnt satisfy any request its simply a big animated mess and it proves that the astérix franchise is going from bad to worsebr br in fact it has been this way since the death of first scenarist rené goscinny in 1977 his faithful collaborator illustrator albert uderzo took his place but the following books were clearly lacking of the quality that was present during the goscinny yearsbr br astérix et les vikings is based on the book astérix et les normands which was published during the goscinny reign the basic story is the same goudurix abraracourcix nephew arrives to the village and astérix et obélix must turn him into a real man while the vikings come to gaul in order to discover what fear is because it seems that fear gives wingsbr br the similarities end here what follows in the book is a nonstop series of laughs gags and hilarious dialog with the result that the vikings do discover fear and they flee gaul the movie is silly unfunny fastpaced corny well just name a default and it has good chances of being appliedbr br the difference between the book and the movie could be more acceptable if the movie was good but the new ideas simply crashes it in a bottomless pit even older astérix movies such as astérix le gaulois which almost transferred the lines one by one without changing them are easily betterbr br animation has the quality of other 21st century movies but it has its faults and any film beginner could find the mistakes the greatest example is the continuity mistake where the day follows the night after a fraction of second in the same sequencebr br imagine they took animation studios from numerous countries and they still cant get adequate filmmakingbr br the changes of the original story are simply unbearable and they still could be even if there was no original story goudurix in the movie has a pet pigeon named sms and who act as his cell phone  grossebaf the viking chief has a rebellious teen daughter named abba  and she constantly defies her fathers authority theres also a stupid viking wizard his cartoonish dumb and muscular son the faithful bride of grossebaf who is obsessed with decoration her name is vikea and well i cant stand that much longerbr br were far from the original gags from the original book the biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring the images to the big screen mainly because the greatest laughs in the books come from the verbal jokes and visual gags which do not have the same appeal on a theatre screen i remember that the greatest moments in the book were obélix laughing at the invaders names which all finish in af and goudurix tries to scare them in ridiculous waysbr br and if everything wasnt enough somebody in the publicity staff decided to write on the movie poster that theres an already existing céline dion song which would be featured in the final credits if it was a new song i could have understood but using an old song is only another proof that the movie is so badly made that theyre ready to do anything in order to attract filmgoersbr br the only good point for this movie is that it is so stupid and the end is so bad that we just cant walk out of the theater without being left cold in a summer release it just cant hurtbr br the only other acceptable point of the movie is how goudurix becomes courageous his psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and not credible while its better pictured in the movie and the motivation point is more believablebr br so if you havent seen the movie yet dont waste your money on it grab the book insteadbr br oh rené why did you leave us
