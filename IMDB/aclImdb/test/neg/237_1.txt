the robot vs the aztec mummy was one of the silliest and least believable films ive ever seen ok i can buy that the woman in the film is a reincarnation of a virgin that was sacrificed to an aztec god what i cant buy is that the incredibly phony looking mummy and the even worse looking robot when you want to watch a film like this you want to see lots of fighting action but the robot and the mummy fight for about a minute total probably worst of all was the dia de los muertos art they had in the credits its the worst ive ever seen avoid this one if possible
