ugh unfortunately this is one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time none of the characters are remotely likable which makes this film difficult to watch theyre all miserable thirty year olds who dont take responsibility for their crummy lives i was only able to make it through a half hour of the film so theres a chance things got better afterward but i doubt it i cant imagine five people as selfabsorbed as they are would manage to remain friends with each other for ten yearsbr br three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing as they had no relevance to the plot and were clearly a gratuitous failed attempt to bring some life to this otherwise dull filmbr br save your time and money and skip this movie
