talk about marketing the posterhome video cover of the new twenty broadcasts a halfnaked male in a wolfe video for those familiar with the gaythemed movies  this broadcasts a mustsee i loved reading one reviewer from another site stating they had been tricked into seeing a sodomite movie are you serious the tagline itself as the word gay the lord gives you eyes yet you cannot see that being said despite the number of gay characters stereotyped no less see the lonely gay the aids victim gay and the closeted gay its more about longterm friendship and characters that grow apart in fact if anything theres more heres one for christians to complain about heterosexual couples having sex outside of gasp marriage not to mention backstabbing drinking to excess and drug usage i see this more of a made for tvlogo or showtime movie than big screen effort sure i loved the cinematography some of the actors could act and i always love seeing a biggroupoffriends that actually act like theyve known each other for a million years but weve see this all before nothing really new here barely an original idea  hence bringing back the same ole i have aids lets deal with that for a good portion of the movie and boy our friend has a serious drug problem but lets not deal with that until its almost too late thats so us queer as folk and broken hearts club respectfully the film deals with a group of college buddies now grown in size not minds who have to eventually grow up and each trying their best while failing strangely as in most of these independent movies the most interesting to me at least was the heavierset one ben he stole each scene but again there wasnt much to take
