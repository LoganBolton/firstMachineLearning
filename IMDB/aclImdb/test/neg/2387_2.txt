if you see the title 2069 a sex odyssey in the video store beware the cover has tori wells and three other 80s porn stars and has a copyright of 1986 if youre like me and i hope youre not youll think 80s porn tori wells alright trickery it was made in 1974 and has dubbed german stars theres nothing inherently wrong with 70s german porn but its not my cup of tea and its nothing like what the cover leads you to believe youre getting once i got past my rage about the blatantly misleading jacket i watched it anyway its a bad bad movie sorry i guess i didnt really get past the rage
