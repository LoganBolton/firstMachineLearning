though not a complete waste of time eighteen really wasnt all sweet as it pretended to be nor are the ages of the actors theyre portraying  18 my butt mckellen could have actually shown up in the film telling us he was 30 and ask us to believe it even michael j fox was more believable as a teen in back to the future parts ii and iii okay maybe not theyre probably equal believability if you can get past the obvious age flaw youll have either the complete void of acting or simply overacting paul anthonys so called anguish clarence sponagles lifetime moments and even though i do favor brendan fletcher its best to just watch him and more in freddy vs jason incomprehensible scenes a faster than britney spears marriage incest to prove a point and a man who needs help to urinate but still has one hand free  im guessing this was the writers fantasy an entire movie of despicable characters anthony might be playing someone thats 18 but acts like hes 12 and some odd john thrown in so anthonys character pip can save the day  was there really a sex scene in front of a baby and practically every character questioning their own sexuality by strange actionsscenes on the positive side i did enjoy ian mckellens voiceover seeing a rarely well portrayed straightgay friendship puppy love from someone who collects stuffed puppies that is good score some decent dialogue love the separation of gays and pedophilia  wish more people would realize that and acting from the female leads as well as cumming i cant really recommend it as its really trying to be too many things  gay tolerance gay hustling homelessness wwii epic priesthood first love flawed judges etc etc etc  on a shoestring budget
