how better to describe it than scuzzy criminals on tv and i dont mean in the show cops here theyre actually being presented as protagonistsbr br i dont see any remedial value in this show unless you have a perverse penchant for human tragedies whitney houston is a tragic example of the fallen star a star which bobby brown helped pull from the sky bobby brown is nothing but a lowlife criminal why watch him why does whitney stand by him no matter how despicable he is this couple should be locked up and its a loathsome shame they are making money and achieving a modicum of fame from watching the septic tank which is their lives and the human waste which is their character
