im sure that the folks who made this movie think theyre doing something wonderfully politically correct because they manage to criticize us wars in afghanistan and particularly iraq by suggesting that the us does war well but doesnt clean up afterward thus sowing the seeds for future trouble furthermore they do this without making islamists the enemy and without making republicans the enemy since its the republicans that are in office and are doing this supposedly great thing bringing down the ussr by covertly supplying a war in afghanistanbr br but seriously now    do we really want a movie that repeatedly says lets go kill some russians like thats the greatest thing a redblooded american can do and are we supposed to find this congressman adorable because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and revealing clothes even his supposedly smart assistant who is always dressed professionally keeps looking at charlie like hes just the most wonderful handsomest greatest guy around as if shes nancy reagan to his ronnie julia roberts does a bangup job in her role but basically women are really demeaned in this movie and it was really annoying
