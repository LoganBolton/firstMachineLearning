the filmmakers neglected to connect the dotsthat is the sequence of events and choices that led from charlie wilson and the antisoviet mujaheddin to al qaeda and osama bin laden and eventually to 911 the filmmakers of course neglect to tell us the backstorywhy were the soviets in afghanistanbut that omission pales in comparison to their failure to reveal that support for islamicist extremists in afghanistan in the name of rabid anticommunism ultimately strengthened the hand of antiwestern forces and was a big contributing factor to the mess that we find ourselves in today 911 terrorist networks a prolonged ground war in afghanistan etc because these consequences are not spelled out the movie leaves the viewer feeling sympathetic to mr wilson hey check out his latest projects on the internet instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the west as a whole
