when the american movie industry tries to critically look at their own government they make damn sure it looks good even when its badbr br the film does 1 thing right it demonstrates perfectly what is wrong with the american politics the motto seems to be to fk with whoever it takes to get things done mix an american congressmen a cia agent a jew and an arab just to fk the ruskies thanks to us for giving us osama bin ladenbr br the disappointment of the film comes in the face of muddling up the issues using imagery of afghan children with no arms and the stories of soviet atrocities and then making a blatant attempt to suggest a link between those and the reasoning behind the american help every sensible person knows why the 1000000000 was raised not the dying afghani children thats for surebr br as usual the serious issues are covered into facade of bullshit dialogue here is to you you mr fs hoffmam chants at the end all thats missing is the american flag in the background and the stupid military solutes the films can not help but leave the aftertaste of the feeling of american pride and glee on how we the americans have saved the world once again not even the last 5 minutes of the film can save it where an attempt is being made to stop praising yourself and wake up to the fact that its just another american fk upbr br the acting and editing was good though
