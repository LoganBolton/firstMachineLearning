spoiler  this film gives away plot points and discusses the ending i hated this film  mostly for political reasons but also for moral and aesthetic reasons politically this film glorified war and military technology  blowing things up real good we are led to cheer as the music swells and the afghans use our weapons to blow the ruskies to bits and no us soldiers put their lives on the line  so its a fun war aesthetically there isnt a touch of real human emotion in the film just smug privileged people being sarcastic feeling superior and doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences and speaking of consequences the film only makes a few small hits at what the arming of the afghans actually led to i had read an earlier draft of this script and it ended on 911  with charlie wilson realizing that things had gone horribly wrong but that wouldnt leave the audience feeling good this is a feel good movie about killing ruskies and it made me sick
