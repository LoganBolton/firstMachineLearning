simply put the only saving grace this movie has is settings costumes and an ok punk concert how hrgiger must feel about his cyborg picture on the cover of this movie i wouldnt like to know right away all i could do was make sardonic comments about the films protagonists i was hoping that the freaks in this movie would execute them in gory fashion i sense spoilers a comin i was wondering if this film in the spirit of the first 20 min was intended to be as humorously halfbaked as the rest of it examining all the obvious political outcries police trying to rape a freak the discussion of superficialities between the freak and the frat boy and the punk concert w the female vocalist and the use of slowmotion in the fighting sequences which screams martialarts coordinator i just dont know the character named steve irked me since he tries to pick fights w people off the street he shoulda been mugged and raped and looks bad when he broke that guys neck towards the end want me to show you how to do it i must say this though if they wouldve developed other characters better than they did splatter this might have gone somewhere if there was a 0 to give this movie it wouldve got it but alas its a 1
