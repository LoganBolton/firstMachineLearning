i didnt really know what to expect from futurekill but i certainly hoped it would be a little better than what i got i knew the rating was bad and the reviews were unfavorable but the subversive dvdcover illustration looks beyond cool and i cant resist that for a very long too long in fact time this film raised the impression of being an unofficial sequel to porkys with lame vulgar and offensive fraternity pranks five megadorks one of them resembling an exact young clone of jim carrey desperately want to become members of a frat house but their ultimate initiation might just be a tad bit farfetched and dangerous they are dropped in the city center with provocative marks painted on their faces simultaneously with the outbreak of a violent gang war it doesnt take too long before they are confronted with splatter a seemingly halfman and halfmachine warrior who leads a gang of which i never really figured out who or what they were were they a government experiment cyborgs terminator imitations from a distant future does anyone care futurekill is a bizarre amateur flick with a scenario that leaps from one subject onto the other without any form of logical connection or narrative the plot borrows vital elements from great cinematic cult classics like the warriors escape from new york and the terminator but the end result is one gigantic scifi monstrosity the costumes and special effects are quite pitiable and theres a truckload of cheap and gratuitous nudity the acting is terrible but im willing to blame the retarded dialogs instead of the cast members one to avoid at all costs in spite of really cool dvdcover art resist it
