im sure i saw future kill for the same reason as most people the awesome poster by hr giger and like everyone else i was disappointed to find that the movie could not live up to the poster giger said that director moore actually begged him to do it when i first saw this at the age of 14 i thought it was the worst movie ever made id still think that if i hadnt seen certain movies on mst3k since thenbr br the plot has a bunch of annoying college boys driving into the mutant city to kidnap a gangleader for their fraternity thats when they meet splatter ed neal a mutantcyborgpsycho who kills the gang leader and blames it on the frats as an excuse to hunt them down and seize power the rest of the movie consists mostly of chases a handfull of frats try to battle their way out of mutant city which i think is supposed to be la even though it was made in texas theres some pseudopolitical stuff about the frat boys society being pronuclear weapons and the mutantsociety being antinuke theres talk of how splatter became a freak due to radiation most people develop cancer from radiation but splatter just shoots spikes and slaughters girls yeah that makes tons of sense at one point our heroes rescue a mutant girl from two pronuke police and she shows them how the other half lives the other half it turns out are all punk kids who dance around to a bad 80s popband so our little epic is both dumb and dated thats really all there is to it frat boys running around in messed up buildings while guys who look like bikers try to kill them oh and its the futurebr br i dont think youll have any doubt about why ron w moore never made another movie this thing is a real stinker if you like giger buy his books they have the poster without the horrors of the movie or just watch alien again future kill is a waste of time that nobody needsbr br if this description makes the picture sound good theres another crappy movie that does the same thing only bigger and better after the fall of new york its crap but it blows future kill off the screen
