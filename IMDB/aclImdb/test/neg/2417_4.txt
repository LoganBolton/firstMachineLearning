if youre not old enough to remember yoram globus and menahem golan heres the rundown  theyre a couple of film producers and finaciers from israel who set up the cannon film company in the early 1980s  the only israeli to get a worse press than these two was menachim begin  begin probably deserved the bad press but globus and golan were a god send to film makers because no matter how bad your script was theyd happily fund your movie and would normally employ directors who couldnt direct and actors who couldnt act  in fact you often got the impression that people would just walk up to yoram and menahem ask them for some money and theyd oblige without seeing the film makers resume  if only producers nowadays were so trustingbr br the young warriors isnt a cannon film but globus and golan did finance it and it has their signature all over it  its badly directed  badly acted  badly edited but its the script that jumps out and attacks you with its awfulness  it starts with a bunch of high school jocks getting involved in all sorts of zany pranks  in fact the first 20 minutes of the movie plays out like a sex comedy and its something of a shock when the young warriors turns into a vigilante movie  but its not just any type of vigilante movie like exterminator 2 or death wish 3  notice a connection  theyre both sequels and theyre both vigilante movies made by cannon films   no siree this is a laughably bad vigilante movie about pretty boy high school jocks and their poodle going on a mission to wipe out scumbags  this film is proof that globus and golan were giving money to people regardless of their film making abilities and you have to worry about people who seem to spend their entire reserves on making movies set entirely around vigilantes
