mexican classic was the third entry in the aztec mummy series as you will soon find out this movie is anything but a classic instead its more like a movie that deliberately tries to bore youbr br some scientist wants to steal aztec treasure from a tomb but guarding that tomb is that walking toilet paper commercial the aztec mummy knowing he cant beat the mummy he then builds a robot and a very bad one at that we only get to see mrrobot in the last reel as he clunks around and does battle with the aztec mummybr br i have seen a lot of lousy scifi films hell most scifi films i see are lousy but this one for its entire duration of 64 minuites is the worst movie ive seen with fubar coming in a close secondbr br in conclusion dont waste your time
