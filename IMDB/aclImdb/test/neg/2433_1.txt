i cannot believe this show was okayed first off jp manoux does a horrible job filling in for david spade and pachas voice is too deep compared to john goodmans the theme song is so annoying and the plots of the episodes are so stupid the only good thing about this show is that eartha kitt and patrick warburton remain as the voices of yzma and kronk this show is a waste of money and a waste of your time half of the episodes are copied of the movie in my opinion the emperors new groove was one of the best childrens movies in years but they complety ruined by making kronks new groove and this show you should watch such shows as spongebob fairly oddparents danny phantom or kim possible but not this show
