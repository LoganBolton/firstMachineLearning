its hard to tell who this film is aimed at the characterisation and style smacks of a childrens itv series crossed with an aussie soap yet the subject matter nudity and language aims it at an older audiencebr br the first halfhour has the heroine justine philosophising about losing her virginity and is excruciatingly embarrassing to anyone over 18 a complete ripoff of ferris bueller from the talkingatthecamera bit down to the onscreen graphicsbr br her nerdy friend chas brings her to a computer fair where an explosion during the use of a virtual reality machines turns her into a man or actually creates a male alterego of her called jake dont look at me like that im just relating it the way it was shownbr br after this the film is mildly amusing for a while amongst all the dramaschool mugging only rupert penryjones brings a real comic touch to his womantrappedinamansbody role of jake theres some funny scenes with jake dealing with his new body and new feelings nothing you havent seen before but then in this film youll clutch at anything thats entertainingbr br unfortunately justine and jake meet up and hilarious antics ensue i wish involving the owners of the virtuality machine who want to kidnap jake in order to have sex with him or examine him or something anyway its just an excuse to fill an extra half hour with some explosions and car chases for such a cheap looking movie the explosions come often and loud suggesting the money was spent in all the wrong placesbr br in the end the heroine realises she cant fall in love with herself deletes her alter ego and ends up in a onenight stand with the nerd to lose her virginity this presumably is what is meant to pass for a happy ending in the 90s but only after he removes his glasses and puts some hair gel and a leather jacket on god forbid she actually have sex with someone who looks like a nerd of course this is a bit subversive  in these days of pc movies which tell you to love and be yourself and that everyone is special in their own way its refreshingly reactionary to have a film which screams conform at you and treats virgins and nerds with the contempt they deservebr br the characterisation is simple dire the nerd is very nerdy room full of computers thick glasses social retardism virginity no leather jacket theres a slut shes very slutty blonde tight dresses orange tan vampy accompanying music theres a jock hes very well you get the picture you can get away with this kind of characterisation in a broad comedy but virtual sexuality isnt very funny its only mildly amusing in parts and excruciating in others it takes a lot for a woman as cute as justine played by laura fraser to annoy me but she manages itbr br dont be fooled by the title theres absolutely nothing erotic about the film and it doesnt deal with the topics of how the new communications technologies are changing the way we view and acquire relationships unless you actually think there is a chance your playstation might blow up and change your sexbr br
