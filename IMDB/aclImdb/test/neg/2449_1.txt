before i saw this masterpiece i never would have guessed that a devastating and hideously contagious virus could be defeated by the use of lutheran prayers and erbs ralf moellers performance is gargantuan the realism incandescent i was so inspired im flying straight to zambibwia tomorrow to crack out the pesto and get my hands together for third world prosperity god bless this filmbr br seriously im going to have to watch troll 2 and anus magillicutty just to believe that it is possible to concoct more hamfistedly clichéd dialogue its so tortured that taking a cheesegrater to your knuckles might well be preferable to sitting through it the only subtlety it manages to achieve is in its thinly disguised racism as the poor islanders turn to ineffectual dumbass collective prayer which achieves nothing until the übermenschlich linenshrouded teutonic hero moeller with his direct line to yahweh can provide a blood sample which the hornblowing yankee scientists can get to work on and save the hapless natives this movie sucks
