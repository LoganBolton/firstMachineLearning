greetings allbr br isnt it amazing the power that films have on you after the 1st viewing br br i was so delighted by the first viewing of this film i couldnt stop talking about flatliners to all my friends for weeks  mind you i was a very impressionable 18 year old back then and my taste in films have become a little more conservative since thenbr br then somehow i forgot about this film until i saw the dvd in my local department store and remembering how great it was i thought right  ill pluck you off the shelf when they bring out the special editionbr br last week i was overjoyed when my best friend invited me over to watch flatliners on dvd the expectation was that i would love this film even more on 2nd viewing how wrong i was br br verdict after 11 years my view on this film had changed from a very scary 1st class movie to total junk which overplays on the religious and supernatural side of things ratherly superficiallybr br i have never been a big fan of julia roberts acting excepting for erin brockeridge in which she deserved her oscar i think the problem with this film definitely lies with the director and a so so mediocre script i left this film feeling it had no real substance or potential and just a couple of scarey cheap thrills which werent very well done at all not even the score by jamesnewtown howard who i rather like as a film composer could captivate and thrill mebr br in 1990 i would have given this film 95  10 but in 2001 id be lucky to give it 2  10 at bestbr br
