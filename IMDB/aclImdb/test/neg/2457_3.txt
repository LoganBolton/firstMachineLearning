the only thing more full of holes than this movies premise is its script flatliners is the ideal showcase for joel schumachers glorious flamboyant brazen lack of talent the plot is totally illogical but super fakeponderous and everything is artdirected within an inch of its life in the most clich√©d overheated way i love how the med school autopsy room is a cavernous vaulted marble mausoleum lowlit in red with huge rembrandt paintings hanging from the walls i love how keifer sutherland drives a canvasbacked army jeep no one in joel schumachers movies lives in an uneccentric manner its always an alternate universe where everyone is young and painfully hip but hip strictly and obsessively according to an outoftouch middleaged billionaire manchilds idea of hip and holy crap the part where baldwin brother 16 dies and comes back to life and then is haunted by all the women hes slept with who intone ill call you and i just need some space is the funniest friggin thing in the whole universe what kind of a world do we live in where joel schumacher gets to keep having people throw money at him flatliners made me want to review the mans entire oeuvre solely for the kind of highquality yuks contained therein
