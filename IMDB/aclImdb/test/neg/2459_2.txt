i dont much mind the factors that others here have objected to  acting lighting and so forth for the most part these things were executed well enough to carry the film and put its points across its just a horror film after allbr br what bugged me were the points themselves because this is a deeply moralistic film and its morality is deeply tacky in fact its actually fundamentalist christian morality and this is a fundamentalist christian film look at the sins br br  sutherlands character picked on a kid at school when he was a preteen leading to his accidental deathbr br  baldwins character used masculine wiles persuasion and good looks to shag quite a few women some of whom he videotaped ooh the swine how unlucky for him that women are such passive gormless creatures that they had no complicity in the matterbr br  roberts characters dad came back from vietnam a junkie so ashamed to be caught shooting up that he kills himself yes what a terrible sin why couldnt he have just become an alcoholic like all the othersbr br  and bacons character picked on another schoolkid how awful the fact that he was a child himself apparently counts for nought children it seems are divinely judged by adult criteriabr br well maybe lots of people support this level of moral absolutism it certainly seems to have gone unremarked in this movies comments does everyone just buy this stuff at least human laws treat children differently from adults recognising that their ethical sense is partiallyformed this film has no such qualms and i find that pretty objectionable ditto the notion that women are helpless fluffy creatures before young mens evil lusts or that a vietnam vet driven to drug addiction is so shameful that suicide is a valid option pathetic
