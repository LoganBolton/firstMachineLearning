the first 23 of this film wasnt that dissimilar to the american mummy films of the 30s and 40s two lovers in ancient mexico dared to defy the law and were doomed to die one became an aztec mummy whose job it was to guard the sacred treasure and his lady love and the lady was reincarnated in the present day and the mummy was naturally attracted to her so far its all the typical mummy filmthough its quite a bit slower and duller than the american versions oh and of course the aztec mummy looked really really crappybr br however into this standard but boring film there is a supervillain why i dunnoit sure didnt make any sense to have one it seems this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and have her show them where the aztec treasure is buried why does he need the treasure well to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots dummy but first he has to construct a single mummy to defeat the mummy as the mummy has so far been unstoppablebr br youve got to see these humanrobots as they look like the enormous clunky robots from flash gordon and other serials but they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside they really look hilariously funny and seeing the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot is worth sitting through the rest of the dull movie both battle in superslowmotion like they are bathed in taffy and its done in such an artless and silly fashion that it is bound to elicit chucklescertainly not thrillsbr br overall the film is dreadfully dull and a muddled messespecially at the end however for bad movie fans its a mustseeits bad but unintentionally funny and great to watch and laugh at with friends
