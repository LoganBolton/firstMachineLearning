jb jack black runs away from home after being spanked by his father meat loaf years later he finally makes it to hollywood and comes across the greatest guitar player he has ever heard kg kyle glassbr br after a little squabble the two decide join forces and perform at an open mic night at what appears to be a less than popular bar to their shock they dont do that goodbr br back at their less than spectacular apartment the two are trying to figure out what the legends of rock have that they dont while looking at some old magazines its only then that they realize that the guitarists on the covers have the same guitar pickbr br while trying to look for a similar pick an employee of the music shop ben stiller who is also the films executive producer tells him the ancient story of the pick of destiny of which they seek this employee who has long gray hair and thick glasses also tells them that the pick which was made from satans tooth is in a history of rock museumbr br now the two potsmoking losers with delusions of grandeur goes on a musicfilled adventure to steal the pickbr br let me say this up front if you are not a fan of tenacious d which gave us the comedy actor jack black then you should skip this one i am not a fan of these two and only watched it because it was suggested by flixtercombr br the jokes for the most part produce silence more than anything i laughed at maybe three of the jokes and chuckled at a few others tenacious d is only for a certain audience of which i am notbr br this movie lags in numerous places and this is where the worst jokes appear and let me say that when black and glass are not working off one another they are completely lost on screenbr br all the songs in this movie is by and performed by tenacious d many of the songs perfectly advance the storyline by describing their adventures at the time in the film however i felt that the songs sounded too similar to be told apartbr br another problem with this film is that the language will turn off a lot of people there are a lot of fourletter words in this film there are also some drug references i would not recommend this for childrenbr br part of tenacious ds schtick is that black is in your face and glass stays in his shadows for the most part this is how they are in this movie and it doesnt really work now this may have been part of the act but i felt that glass just didnt want to be there in one scene he performs his background lyrics at a party and he just cant work alonebr br tenacious d are supposedly rock fans in real life and have maybe two rock legends in the movie i lost count because i was so bored with this film personally i would have liked to have seen more rock legends and icons in the film however we dont get thatbr br what we do get is a movie filled with completely lame jokes lots of foul language a lackluster script you also get horrible acting and an unoriginal story however you get some pretty good songs that pretty much sound the samebr br the story could have been promising but many of the scenes appeared to have been added into the film at the last second this is somewhat similar to the blues brothers movie many years ago but the blues brothers had a much bigger following  and two songs on the billboard music charts tenacious d only has a small following with a few hbo specials under their belt and unlike the blues brothers the comedy is not well thought out at allbr br if you are a hard core fan of tenacious d then i suggest you check it out however like most of the movie audience when this film was released to theaters i would say avoid this one save your money on this one folks
