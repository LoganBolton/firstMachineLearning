once again we have a movie that packs about 20 minutes of entertainment  much of it involving the bands occasionally funny lyrics  into a 90minute package for anyone old enough to remember this is along lines of the first bill and ted without the story line if that doesnt say enough as to how brainless this movie is think about jack black singing for about 20 minutes of the movie and that being its selling point if you actually like listening to tenacious d because of their musical prowess then knock yourself out and buy the soundtrack dont waste your time with this though if your a stoner looking for a good bad movie filled with laughs youre still barking up the wrong tree no matter the potency of your buds youll still be left wishing youd popped in grandmas boy again instead
