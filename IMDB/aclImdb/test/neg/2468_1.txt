this movie is awful if youre considering to see this movie two words do not its tasteless the storyline is really lame and the jokes are even worse the acting is really pathetic i cant believe that this movie was made rather watch american pie going greek or road trip if youre in the mood for a teen comedy its about two girls who head for malibu on their spring break as usual they didnt do much planning and called i think her names michelles uncle to crash at his malibu mansion uncle bennie strictly forbids them of having any kind of party and as you would of guessed they go ahead and do it please i urge you do not see this movie
