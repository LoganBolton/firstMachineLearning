23 of this movie is recycled footage of the previous movies a fact thats sadly obvious even to someone like myself who hasnt seen the original movies and somehow it feels like a ripoff even though i havent seen the stuff before its like that episode of every tv show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you just see recycled footage of other episodes ive seen some producers do extended montages of recycled footage but never anything beyond 5 minutes or so this movie is mostly stuff that had already been seen by audiences so you could mount a case that its one of the biggest ripoffs ever foisted on the motion picture publicbr br i got to see it in the theater in a 16mm print which is good enough i suppose considering how rare this kind of material must be on film these days i give the movie some credit for semiconvincing gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor but thats about it the aztec mummy monster looks good even has some mobility in his face which is better than most movie monsters of the period but the robot is pitiful although its interesting that they made the human face totally visible its a robot human or something of the sort as they somewhat explain in the movie i think thats considered an android so technically in hard scifi terms this movie should be called android vs the aztec mummy but i doubt anyone was too worried about technicalities here anymore than they were worried about quality in fact the movie is so sloppily put together that it makes television look good even the dubbing from mexican into english is lazy and weak  for example at one point the hero says i might as well begin at the beginning what the heck kind of translation is that couldnt they at least have him say start at the beginning so that it doesnt sound repetitive a high school newspaper editor could have fixed the screenplay of this movie its the epitome of utilitarian filmmaking just absolutely nothing is in this movie that doesnt need to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the film they put no more effort into making it than they had to and considering the extensive recycled footage i would doubt that they actually spent more than a week making this moviebr br i will now cease posting about it on the principle that i dont want to expend more energy in the process of commenting than the creators of the movie actually expended while making it
