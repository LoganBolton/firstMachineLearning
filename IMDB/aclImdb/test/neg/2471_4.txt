for what its worth this is a fairly decent road runner cartoon if a little short just under 6 minutes the gags are adequate at best the animation is competent and the new restored dvd master looks nice however thats where the qualities end allow me to provide a little backstory in 1958 thanks to a labour dispute wb got hold of a bunch of canned music that would be used in 6 of the years cartoonsbr br there is only one phrase to describe this shorts music and that is it has the 4kids sound i use that phrase to describe music which has absolutely no correspondence to the on screen action and feels like it was recorded by an orchestra consisting of members of a sonic youth cover band the music in this short feels hopelessly tacked on and incredibly obnoxious especially considering there are scenes in this short namely the piano trap that would have worked best with little or no musicbr br i didnt think a wb cartoon would be ruined by awful music even lavas scores arent this obnoxious but considering the cartoon isnt that notable anyway it becomes almost painful to watch with the music its kind of like how late 80s episodes of doctor who could be bad anyway and yet be made unwatchable thanks to keff mccullochs unbelievably awful music which sounded like he hit the demo button on all 5 of his casio keyboards at the same timebr br i am going to have people call me crazy for this but id easily watch one of larrivas rr cartoons over this at least the canned music was usually in sync with the action on those
