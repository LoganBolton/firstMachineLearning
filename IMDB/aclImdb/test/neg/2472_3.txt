well it is standard hollywood schmaltz that you can see coming a mile off its enjoyable in parts but just oh so predictable i must confess i did not really enjoy it but i am pretty tough to please and a lot of my friends loved itbr br it is quite sweet and the actors give good performances its a nice backdrop and the eye candy is pretty good but the irritatingly predictable unoriginal and really quite dull storyline holds the film back personally i can think of better ways to spend a couple of hours of my lifebr br the chick flick genre gets some bad press but there are some genuinely good chick flicks out there this isnt one of them
