i cannot believe i actually sat through the whole of this movie it was absolutely awful and totally cringeworthy and yet i sat through it thinking it had to get better it didnt and i have wasted 2 hours of my life will smith is much better in action movies  i loved him in i robot enemy of the state and independence day  and i dont think he can really be expected to carry off an entire movie as the romantic lead in the way that cary grant could then again the script was unbearably awful and the dialogue was so cheesy br br i disliked everyone except for alberts character and even that i found was done with a heavy hand if you want to watch a modern feelgood romantic comedy watch something like how to lose a guy in ten days or when harry met sally the 40 year old virgin left me with a smile on my face i even preferred music and lyrics above this  and yes i know its cheesy but at least it didnt take itself seriously and was sweet i also disliked the main female lead  and wasnt convinced of the chemistry between her and will smiths character br br in all i think there were two scenes that i liked and definitely not the ending which was nauseating and unconvincing  hitch calling sarah when she hadnt given him her number was quite sweet and  no sorry thats the only thing i liked about the entire film dont waste your time
