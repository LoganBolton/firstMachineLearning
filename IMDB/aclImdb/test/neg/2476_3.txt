nothing about this movie stands out as either being great or terriblebr br in the end that is what kills it the blandness is just not good i cant say i expected better from will smith but i definitely did from kevin james of the king of queens but hey im getting used to saying that a lot lately this film attempts to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy but it never hits the bullseye in fact it never hits anywhere within the target the allergy scene is disturbing the fact that kevin james cant dance is something that wouldnt exactly catch anybody offguard and is therefore in a movie like this not funny this movie constantly tries to win your heart but always with the wrong ploy at the wrong time some parts are okay but im searching my brain for examples but i really think this movie should be avoided
