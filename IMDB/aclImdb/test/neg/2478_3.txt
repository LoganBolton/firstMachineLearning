1 if you want to make a movie that deals with social realism its quite important that the audience identify with the characters that are being portrayed 2 the audience cant identify with characters that are highly stereotyped or with situations that are to obvious 3 if you got a bad actor then you cant build any character anyway even if you got nice actors their job will result ridiculous if you force them to speak with a fictitious andalusian accentbr br jes√∫s ponce ignores those 3 points and also makes some cheap jokes that are completely out of place his script is so predictable a woman comes out of prison she meets his old junkie boyfriend lifes tough etc whatever the fact that the story is everything but original wouldnt be that bad if only ponce werent a complete incompetent writing and filmingbr br i wonder how long will they keep giving money from our taxes to make movies such as this onebr br my rate 310
