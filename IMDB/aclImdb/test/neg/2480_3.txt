ive seen every episode and the characters have all remained the same self absorbed whinny little brats thought out theres no character development in 5 years getting pregnant is not development if your still the same daddies girl only now delinda whines to danny because dad isnt around sam never changes or grows which makes her boring repetitive and just so annoying its sickening after season 3 danny is a typical soft character that gets ordered about by everyone in his life he has no principals morals of his own especially mary and delinda the old boring cliché will they wont they on and off relationship does get boring very fast indeedbr br james cann can act and his character is ok to watch only he is just another hack writers wet dream an ex cia man that has huge contacts and training etc so he can stop any thief or cheater known to man even though the cameras cant do half the stuff they make out its fun for a while however in 5 years the writers act very dumb why because they have all this expensive and advanced technology but no simple walkie talkie communicating is fast and easy you never see security walking the floor only when theres a situation and suddenly everyone is just therebr br the plots very quickly move from the cheating and robbing the casino in one way or another to awful typical american boy girl relation ships the same done to death material seen all over the world they have sex but i hate you ive always loved you i think i do but i love herhim instead but what if maybe one day blah blah blahbr br id recommend hotel babylon to people who like las vegas it has so much more going for it simply because the characters are interesting engaging and not forced down our throat for 6 months of the yearbr br im glad to be british  id rather see the same actors in 5 different shows rather than 5 years consistently getting worst in the same one
