wownot in a good waybr br i cant believe people dig this trash most of the shows on television are pretty bad and this has been a running trend for a while now  they just keep getting worse but las vegas definitely takes it home what a terrible showbr br the actors are a bunch of hasbeen c losers that never went anywhere except james caanwho knows what he was thinking when he signed on to this pos so its not their fault that this show sucks they just cant help it blame the producers and the writers i cant believe they shot this and were actually proud enough of their work to air it
