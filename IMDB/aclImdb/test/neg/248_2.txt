i saw this on mystery science theater 3000 and even that show couldnt really make this movie bearable i could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures of course you expect terrible special effects with a movie this old but ive seen silents that were better the storyline has enormous gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are even at certain scenes the cameraman apparently doesnt know what a tripod is and had too much coffee or something harder maybe because the camera is always shaking around i couldnt even follow the plot but suffice it to say this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my lifebr br update i saw epic movie a while back and have decided to give this movie a 2 its not the worst movie ive ever seen anymore
