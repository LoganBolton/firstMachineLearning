i did a screen test and read the script for this turkey in 1988 it was awful then and even worse now  i spotted it on vhs at the local hollowwood video and said oh what the hey for auld ang sine yechbr br they had to shoot most of it in mexico after they ran out of money a couple of the stars pitched bitches because they ran out of some kind of exotic fruit drink crap the movies plot is ok i suppose but i happen to know that the writer intended for it to have a spy catcher thread running throughoutbr br dr o ended up being a cartoon character he must still be whirling in his grave over in the kremlin wallbr br technical errors were all over the movie not only with the infant atomic technology but with the uniforms insignia and military jargon they were too cheap to hire a professional military adviser of course even mr newmans august and expert presence couldnt have saved this bird from being stuffed for thanksgiving
