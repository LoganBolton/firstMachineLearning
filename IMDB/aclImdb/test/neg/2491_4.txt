this movie is a definitive 5 i finally caught it on hbo the other night i remember when it came out in theatres telling a friend that it would never be a hit because americans didnt want movies about history especially movies that were more about ideas than action i dont know if that was the reason fmlb didnt do well but now having finally seen it i can add a few observations of my ownbr br first while dwight schultz has been fine in star trek and the ateam as the lead in this movie he is offputting i kept expecting him to shout out jon lovitzlike i am acting he phrasing and tone of voice sounded like he was trying very had to be an actor on a stage where he had to emphasize strangely various words and phrases br br second i enjoyed the sly positioning of paul newmans character as a manipulator who at every turn strives to herd these cats the scientists along to get to his goal br br third there was some discussion of the moral implications of creating the a bomb and whether the us should use it probably not enough of this or as in depth as warrantedbr br finally there seemed to be an awful lot of twists thrown in for dramatic effect i dont know how much of the events in this movie are true to life but things like having the test bomb slip in its chains or having a lab accident caused by a spilled coffee cup and a scientist killed as a result were stretching the bounds of believability maybe that stuff or events that were similar really happened but it sure felt like various scenes were added solely for dramatic effect which undermined the whole tone and purpose of the moviebr br fmlb was ok i need to read more about the actual events to know if it was over the top or just mostly accurate
