i watched this years ago on television when i was sick i dont know i tend to be more complacent with my tv viewing when im sick too much effort to use the remote control i guessbr br from what i can recall every aspect of the moviecasting acting writing directing etcwas illadvised at best i could have forgiven the historical inaccuracies if this film had created a sense of what it was like to work on trinity but it didnt there were attempts to humanize the scientists but they were insufficient and never transcended caricaturebr br i didnt know very much about the people involved in the manhattan project at the time but the portrayals in the movie were so cartoonish that i became interested in learning about the real personalities and i did so i guess this horrible film has done a very small amount of good after allbr br this is not an indepth review but fmlb neither deserves nor requires one you might enjoy it if youre a fan of bad movies
