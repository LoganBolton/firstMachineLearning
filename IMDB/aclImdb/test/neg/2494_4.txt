it s easier to watch this film if one views it as a scenario created by star fleet lieutenant reginald barclay during his holodeck addiction barclay is a recurring star trek character played by dwight schultzbr br dwight schultz is miscast as oppenheimer oppenheimers character is poorly written so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge instead we see a shallow two dimensional figure from a soap opera paul newman is also miscast as general leslie groves but this movies problems go beyond having the wrong actors in the wrong rolesbr br the factual errors and great liberties taken with the chronology of events in order to advance screenwriter bruce robinsons political agenda make this movie embarrassing to watch thats probably why this movie has found a home on the socalled history channel br br fat man and little boy combine bad science bad history bad screenwriting and mediocre acting to produce a movie that should not be viewed by impressionable high school or college students who know nothing about the manhattan project
