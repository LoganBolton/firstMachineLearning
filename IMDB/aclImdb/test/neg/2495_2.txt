ive read just about every major book about the manhattan project most people know what it was but few people understand the depth and breadth of the project its scope was immeasurably massive  rivaled in us history perhaps only by the space program of the 1960sbr br there were  literally  millions of people involved from all walks of life at numerous sites most clandestine around the country each involved in a specific and different aspect of the project that they couldnt talk about to the person sitting in the cubicle next to them much less their family the logistics are overwhelming particularly given the considerations of wartime communication security and transportation in the 1940sbr br as an example  my colleagues father was a carpenter who worked for one of the companies that had a contract with the federal government for the manhattan project his job was to supervise a crew of about 30 other carpenters who were responsible for manufacturing forms for the pouring of concrete for the massive research installations at hanford washington thats all he did six days a week for nearly two years these carpenters needed food housing sanitary facilities hospitals and materials just as much as did oppenheimer and his crowd at the top of the pyramid just think about it that being said its simply impossible to do the subject justice in a 2hour movie in defense of joffe however i would say that they had an impossible task particularly since he chose to have a diverse screenplay with multiple plots multiple angles and multiple characters what exactly was he thinking and how could he be so arrogant to think that this would work thats hollywood i guessbr br fat man and little boy has so many flaws that it would take a book to list them all horrible casting dreadful and politicallymotivated writing bad science the portrayals of groves and oppie are particularly inaccurate and downright galling notwithstanding the screenplays alltooobvious agenda it is still incredibly bland and sloppybr br these flaws have been listed elsewhere on imdb but i was particularly struck by the fact that the scientists had so much time on their hands  softball horseback riding parties semiformal dinners ballet etc not to mention romance and of course circulating political petitions according to fmlb if these great brains had gotten off their duffs and actually spent some time in the lab instead of seducing laura dern we might have won the war before ddaybr br one final gripe  fmlb mentions that fat man and little boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs but it doesnt mention that these names were a semigoodnatured jab at groves fat man for heavy stature and oppenheimer little boy for his slight stature another reason paul newman should not have been in this movie
