well since its called porno holocaust and directed by joe damato i went into this film expecting sleazeand while i somewhat got it porno holocaust was a massive disappointment as its just so damned boring the title suggests that the film will feature porn and thats not wrong  porno holocaust is pretty much just porn and most of it is just the same stuff over and over again i was fast forwarding before the end the first sex scene is between two women and it got my hopes up but after that it just degenerates into normal porn and the rest of the film for the first hour is made up of talking and you can imagine how much fun that is to sit through the plot focuses on a deserted island where believe it or not something strange is going on naturally its not long before a group of people  made up of a few men and some scientists who all happen to be sexy women land on the island they have sex a few times and some strange things happen then over an hour later theyre attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for the ladiesbr br this must have seemed like a good idea for an original porno  a zombie who likes to get it on but unsurprisingly it doesnt work well at all the film clocks in at just ten minutes short of the two hour mark and that is far too long for a film like this i have no idea why porno holocaust is as long as it is if theyd just snipped one minute out of every sex scene the film would have been under ninety minutes and that would have made it much more tolerable the zombie takes what seems like an eternity to appear its quite a long time before theres a sex break long enough for them to actually travel to the island in the first place and when it does finally appear its a huge disappointment i realise that this is low budget bmovie trash but damato surely could have tried a bit harder and come up with something better than this im not even going to bother mentioning the acting atmosphere etc theres no point porno holocaust is basically just your average dull porn flick with a slight sprinkling of horror and i cant recommend it
