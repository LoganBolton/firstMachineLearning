damatos hardcorehorror hybrid doesnt really live up to its extraordinary title and intriguing premise wherein various vapid contemporary types are attacked by a monster on an atoll previously used for nuclear experiments but for the most part the film is so slow the action so dreary and the cast so clearly repulsed to be having to have sex with each other that the film becomes a chore to watchbr br this is a pity because the film sets up a promising idea a group of scientists are taken to the atoll by a naval officer in a small vessel the scientists  three women and two men  are an intriguing cross section of sexual types suffering to various degrees from nymphomania codependency and frigidity theres even an intriguing foray into the world of female sex tourism where one of the women stops off at a brothel to get serviced by two hunky caribbean studs for hire the creature himself  a mangled native islander with a horribly scarred face and an unfeasibly long pizzle  bears some affinities with the old creature from the black lagoon and is the kind of nuclear nightmare that has hovered over postmodern man since the cold war commenced despite those of us in the west having retreated into hedonism and relativistic sciencebr br porno holocaust certainly is a film which shows the postsexual revolution westerners coming across their mirror image in a nuclear monster yet the torpidity with which it unfolds really lets down the fierceness of the idea there is a promising interplay of action shots with pov shots which suggest that the monster who looksstalks on as horror monsters from their pov position tend to do is akin to the voyeur in the audience getting off on the sex between the beautiful people the sight of the monster forcing a gorgeous young woman to suck his oversized member certainly throws the target audiences ugly fantasies in their face but damato has developed similar ideas better in other films and porno holocaust is a potentially fierce idea let down by the execution even damatos usual cinematographic skills let him down with much dreary camerawork
