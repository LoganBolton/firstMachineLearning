bloody birthday is an odd and at times humorous lowbudget horror flick along the lines of mikey or a less intelligent version of the good sonbr br set in a small californian town three babies are born at the height of an eclipse where planetary alignment means they are somehow born without emotions ten years later our three little psychopaths take themselves on a killing spree doing away with parents siblings teachers and anyone else who irritates them only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them there is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time arent equally as twisted but there you gobr br for a slasher film its very tame in terms of violence and gore which i suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to instead its amusing and a little disturbing seeing three tenyearolds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns knives and crossbows the main reason why it doesnt descend into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they slyly play the little innocents in front of undiscerning adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truthbr br bloody birthday is rather mediocre as a horror flick with few scares and little blood but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers it is a bit unique in that way one to watch if theres nothing else on
