as a serious horror fan i get that certain marketing ploys are used to sell movies especially the really bad ones so i wouldnt call it naiveté that i assumed this was softcore horror ripping off cannibal  zombi  jungle holocaust unfortunately i was completely wrong as this is very hardcore i should have realized that when i saw the odd no actual or identifiable minor was used warning notice the identifiable part as though he is daring us to catch him a group of scientists half of whom are pretty women in bikinis are led by a sea captain with a penchant for 69ing on the beach in search for a mutated native killing villagers due to a nuclear bomb detonated on a supposedly evacuated island the radiation turned this last man into a rapist killerbr br writer actor george eastman is the only one trying here and succeeds in keeping his clothes on the sex scenes are whacked out women walk around nude exuding a strange overconfidence and one even asks for rape when her husband turns her down well two chicks slapping each other naturally turns into a lesbo scene because women are horndogs i saw the chick toss another chicks salad and finger herselfbr br if there is anything you should know about this film it is that because the rest of this insane movie is just the same oh who am i kidding there is a ton more to tell here like the white duchess that pays for 2 black guys to tag team her in a parlor or the duchess taking off her top to use as a bandage when the captain cuts himself when he refuses her advances she starts crying so being the good gentleman he is he reluctantly lets her pleasure him in front of the other crew members i was honestly waiting for the pizza guy to show up and the duchess to ask if there is any other way to pay himbr br and all of this happens before they depart for the island to conduct their research wait i thought this was a zombie flick but the zombie doesnt enter until the 73min mark but by that time everyone else has been entered plenty i found myself hitting fast forward a few scenesor several this is my first splatter porn flick and i dont think it does that subgenre any justice i guess it is the woman in me talking when i say that i would like more plot and less sweaty slobbering hairy sex funny thing is this could have worked as a decent horror film as the idea of atomic bombing mutating a bitter man and killing his family was a good one even eastmans character shakes his head and walks away from a couple copulating it makes me wonder if it was the character or the writer himself that was disgustedbr br i dont feel like going into the sound or film quality because you should have already guessed it was bad this production was shot back to back with 3 other movies including erotic nights of the living dead which sports most of the same cast eastman has said this was done because everyone wanted a vacation and a paycheck nevermind i feel like talking about the sound suddenly the sound was weird during the sex scenes because while the cast is speaking italian it seems as though they recorded english voiceovers and played that over their dialogue so while 2 people are boning i can clearly hear someone in the background say no yes wonderful wait there was a slightly amusing italian score that couldnt save this movie the sfx were minimal at best and consisted of some blood in only a few scenes and i would like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes as the bright warning label said on the dvd cover ahem another marketing ploy so no fear there only fear the bad moviebr br presented in widescreen 1851 aspect ratio i watched the region 1 not rated version running at 113min released in 2005 by exploitation digital there is apparently a xxx version by alfa digital which is the same running time so i doubt anything is different prices vary but you shouldnt pay more than 2500 for a copy or as i would recommend pay nothing and pretend it doesnt existbr br favorite quote shipmate civilians are bad luck women are bad luck theyre scientists too they must really be monsters dvd extras original trailer with hardcore shots  kills to make it look more interesting than it is trailers for ss hell camp emmanuelle  enotld and a very informative interview with eastmanbr br bottom line lame porno but even weaker as a horror film either get real porn or watch real horrorbr br rating 310 by molly celaschi wwwhorroryearbookcom
