joe damato might have made some other notable movies in his very long and very prolific career prolific of course by turns of making very cheap zgrade movies in italys big exploitation boom of the late 70s early 70s but porno holocaust isnt one of them or at least shouldnt be granted i should not expect much from a movie with such a title but i thought considering the back of the boxs description that it might have some fun horror scenes with the horny mutant cannibal zombie turns out the zombie doesnt appear until more than halfway into the movie and at every turn we get instead a tawdry sex scene as hardcore as one can imagine which is fine but its not very enjoyable except in the most what the f is this bs kind of way theres laughable dialog involving lobsters costing more from mailorder japan than in paris hot slim women play biologists and zoologists who have particular sexual hangups letting the door be unlocked to be raped and a bipolar kind of enjoyment out of getting gangbangedbr br it all leads up to the island where the main attraction is a guy who early on just spends an absolutely pathetic forget ludicrous amount of time just staring at the newcomers to the radioactive wasteland of the shotoncaribbean island and once revealed has a face like one of the guards in jabbas palace and has a sweet potato for a main genital but much dumber than anything before it is the relationship that develops between the monster and a darkskinned lady who has an inordinate amount of time to escape but just sits there blankfaced as the monster brings gifts and for what must be a raciallymotivated exploitation move on the part of the filmmakers the monster only rapes and kills the white women and not her and it ends of course with a happy ending i use quotes of course out of a kind of shock that this could have any kind of legitimate ending at allbr br bottom line this is not what you might expect as possibly being a bloody horror movie with plenty of tacky but cool looking italian monsterzombies devouring human flesh if anything what violence is in the film is done on a shoestring a log hit to the face is immediately cut to the bloody aftermath which is like the aftermath of a tomato hitting someone so really the last part of the title is meant more for market sake yet even as a porno movie it has little to go on except as a reason for the cast and crew to get a paid vacation to the caribbean as an interview with george eastman suggests this was just one of a few quickies made while on the island its got pennybought schlocky camerawork and similar actors filled with genitalia about 34 of the whole time and with wretched lipsyncing and music like nino rota forced at gunpoint to make something snappy in a bordello and its still a piece of celluloid dung all the same all of this could be an immense guilty pleasure but it isnt
