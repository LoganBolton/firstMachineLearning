this is a pretty pointless remake starting with the opening title shots of the original was a real mistake as it reminds the viewer of what a great little period piece chiller that was the new version that follows is an exercise in redundancybr br brian kerwin plays a city boy photographer who returns to a semiabandoned desert town populated by a scattering of underdeveloped clichéd stock characters the lollipop sucking dabydoll lolita the ornery old coot prospector the crippled vet and his asian wife etcbr br kerwins character witnesses the crashing of something into a hillside and shortly after strange things start to happen as pieces of weird blue rock are scattered around the temperature starts to rise all the water in the area vanishes people start to act weirdly things explode kerwins character gets in and out of his car more often than is humanly possible in one movie the film develops no sense of place no character development no humour no tension everything that made the jack arnolds original a creepy little coldwar paranoia classic has been abandoned it just runs through its minimal hoops and then just endsbr br the special effects arent very special  the interior of the ship looks like bits of cling film wrapped round some ropes which were then dangled in front of the camera to frame some of the most uninspired and clumsy wirework ever put onto the screen the script is repetitive  everyone says everything at least twice kerwin gets to say lets get out of here at least three times during the movie twice in one scene loads of things are left unexplained at the end  why do the aliens need all the heat and water for example  not that anyone watching would care if the film makers didnt care why should webr br the acting is adequate  better than the script which at times has an underrehearsed improvisational quality deserves though often the actors look like they just want to get the thing over with as quickly as possible  a notable example of this is when elizabeth peña registers the briefest token moment of frustrated despair hands to face gesture before following sulking son stevie outside to watch him do angry sulky teenager smashing something off a table gesture br br continuity errors include the gb sticker on the back of kerwins jeep appearing and disappearing a double action of the gas in the exploding car a townsperson being in two places simultaneously  once in the alien stevies pov shot then immediately afterwards in a reaction shot elizabeth peña appearing to shut a car door twice you can tell i was gripped cant you the movie commits that greatest of errors its boring
