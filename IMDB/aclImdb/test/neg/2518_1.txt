i like most other people saw this movie after hearing of it from patton oswalt oddly enough it was easier to find than i thought it would be though it shouldnt come as a surprise that i found it usedbr br the plot is summed upped masterfully within the title its a bed that eats nothing more nothing less there is an effort to throw in a story line but not a very good onebr br a demons blood ended up on a bed and as a result it becomes possessed it devours anything that happens upon it by absorbing and then dissolving it in what appears to be orange fanta there is an artist who fell victim to the bed but was sick and ends up behind a painting in the room it inhabits the narrative is told entirely through himbr br this movie fails horribly at everything even at being bad still its not without its own brand of charm
