this movie should have been billed as three moviesummaries linked together to form a fulllength feature film including lots of shots of people slowly walking down dark corridors and streets be warned the first hour of this movie is simply a rehash of the first two aztec movies as told by the main character the actual movie doesnt start until the thing is almost over i must say the overacting on the part of the bat is quite hilariousbr br as for the robot i thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not resemble a human the bats robot consists of a radioactive reanimated corpse encased in a lead robotbody as tom servo put it hes not that impressive he doesnt even have knees that and it takes the robot about an hour just to lumber across the room but once he catches you watch out hell disintegrate you with a touch powered by radium pluheasebr br this is a great movie when accompanied by joel and the bots otherwise youre just a glutton for abuse
