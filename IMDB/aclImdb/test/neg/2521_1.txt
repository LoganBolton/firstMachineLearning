its difficult to criticize a movie with the title like deathbed the bed that eats and involves a ghost narrator whos trapped behind a 2way painting he drew and a bed that snores and  if im not mistaken masturbates now thats getting back at its human companions furthermore it foams up in orange for whatever reason to absorb edibles lying on its surface including apples wine fried chicken and of course people again its suffice to say that dont expect too much when you see what i guess is stomach acid  the final remains of anything that orange suds takes  dissolving only certain things itll drink the wine but the bottles okay and itll eat away at the chicken bone but the buckets just fine heck the bed even replaces the unused containers hilariously at one point it downs peptobismol i had to laugh at that one i dont think they really wanted you to take any of this seriously its low budget and its extremely easy to see where they cut costs and saved oodles amounts of money i thought in a world where there can be a killer lift and a blood beach this deathbed might be amusing to watch for reasons that might involve cost 90 of the film is voiceover no one screams or shows extremely low signs of frightconfusion on why a bed would attack i can think of one  and i never was one of those kids that jumped on the bed and youll have to suspend your disbelief beyond belief a victim loses all flesh on his hands barely saying ow only one scene that went on too long was minutely tense  a woman attempts to crawl away only to be dragged back using a sheet where are the mst3k guys
