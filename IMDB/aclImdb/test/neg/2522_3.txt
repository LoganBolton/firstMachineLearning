this movie was really stupid and i thought that it wasnt so bad and i could tolerate a movie about a bed eating people then the part near the end where the guy has skeleton hands ended up being the cherry on top of a bad movie i could see the screws in the plastic skeleton hands for goodness sakes the brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones the funny thing was that he could still move his hands that was just not right without muscles you really cant move your hands but he did the brother should have bled to death even before he was moving his hands the movie wasnt great but it was okay until the hand scene i was laughing so hard that i dont really remember how it ended it had something to do with foam or something
