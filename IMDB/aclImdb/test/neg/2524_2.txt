i had read online reviews praising this obscure outing as a combination of gory horror quirky black comedy and borderline arthouse the film has elements of all three to be sure but they are at the service of such a supremely silly premise the title immediately gives the game away  and amateurish production to boot  that its longterm neglect due to a lack of proper distribution  basically until cult epics picked it up for dvd release a full 30 years after its inception  was no great loss to cinema or even the genres the bed was apparently created for the purpose of accommodating a demons dalliance with a woman anyway a dying man who had made use of the fourposter and even painted it ends up trapped in the wall behind the canvas and provides intermittent commentary to the action several people from teenagersonafling to gangstersinhiding supply fodder to the perenniallyhungry bed latest on the menu are a trio of girls  one of whom however recalls its mistress of long ago and consequently the bed seemingly fears her seeing various objects  from cigars to pieces of fried chicken  and people getting swallowed up the belly of the bed is depicted as a vat of honeycolored liquid makes the film mildly amusing at times especially when a young mans hands are reduced to their skeletal formation which he seems to take rather too easily in his stride but also awfully repetitiousso that at even a brief 77 minutes the whole pointless exercise feels strained and downright desperate
