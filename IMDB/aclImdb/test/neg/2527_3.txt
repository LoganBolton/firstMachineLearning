while everyone does a decent job in this film i agree with the other comment its too loose and scattered too much like a scriptless experiment with really talented actors as such it isnt enough to hold your attention having said that there are a few really funny moments one involving dylan mcdermott and a flaming shot glass that i think anyone whos been that drunk would find as funny as i did the other is a splitsecond with an inflatable dinosaur crispin glover does his usual nutty twitchfest guy and does it fine harry dean stanton does his usual nutty patriarch repo man anyone etc good cast not enough to keep it going just a few gems seconds long
