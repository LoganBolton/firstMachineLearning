this movie starts off promisingly enough but it gets a little to convoluted and caught up in its stylistic charm the set designs costumes and music were wonderful as close to perfect as one can get but the more i got into the movie the more i felt like all this effort was for the directors entertainment not the audience although i loved looking at it except for a few brief musical scenes i cant say i enjoyed it the director shows enormous imagination but if he had fun with this film he failed to share that with the audience or at least with me i didnt get a sense of whimsy and i didnt get sucked into this universebr br a big cause of this was surprisingly zhang ziyi you can tell shes trying very hard but she seems to have been so miscast that she comes off almost amateurish shes a capable actress but she has her limitations ive noticed in her acting that she has yet to truly react to her fellow costars a flaw that creates a void of chemistry the language barrier in this film seems to have only exacerbate matters she and odagiri act as if theyre on separate planets shes also not a very good singer which made me cringe every time she sang but thankfully there werent too many scenes of that odagiri was ok but doesnt make much of an impressionbr br i didnt even care for the characters separately there really is a sore lack of characterization the only reason to care about them seems to be that theyre goodlooking royalty without the compelling love story at the center of the film though its hard to care what happens the film also takes detours into minor scenes that added nothing to the story and was actually distracting i had to rewind because after going into a subplot i couldnt remember what the heck they were doing in the main storyline there were also scenes where it was hard to tell what the action occurring was because it was so stylizedbr br mostly im just disappointed because i really like the concept behind this and there are a lot of things i do like the music and dance choreography are really greatthe supporting performances are uniformly excellent fantastic in both the acting aspect and the singing its just too bad the lead actors were so bland
