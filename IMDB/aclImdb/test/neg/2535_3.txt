i think the problem with some reactions to this film is that  with few exceptions  they dont focus on the main disconnect hence the main split in the audiencebr br on the one side there are those who are taken by the visual design pretty costumes and variety of elements going into the film some childrens movie fans love the colour and animation and all the unscary magical effects shapeshifting animals and so on some culture vultures like the complicated references the layerings of different folklore elements and the fact that they can watch zhang ziyi singing and quasimiming in two different languages in what really was intended to be a childrens comedybr br on the other side there are those who say that a childrens movie should still have a point that a blend of folktales is not a tale at all and that its easier to believe in magic when enough thought and care has gone into the technical aspects to make it seem realbr br in other words the ideas could be lovely but when you put them onstage they have to deliver here they dontbr br a good folktale  from any country  has a clear story a point and characters who interact strongly with each other this lacks them all a few oversophisticated gestures to opera western and japanese are no replacement for a solid themebr br as a fantasy fan i must say that ive sat through some turkeys and loved a few but this one really tries to do too many things  cheaply putting in zhang ziyi to try to add a little glitter smacks of exotic flower syndrome the other problem isnt that theres no plot theres half a plot which means that you keep getting pulled in then dropped again as another nonetoosharplyexecuted dance number kicks offbr br the characters all seem to know that theyre starring in a movie unless you really like watching other peoples amateur video this aint good id like to test this on real children i think theyd drop it for uproar in heaven after about 20 minutes
