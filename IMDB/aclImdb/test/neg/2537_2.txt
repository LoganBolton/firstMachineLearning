abysmal indonesian action film from legendary arizal triumphantly sculpts a template for future cinemax pap like china obrien and do or die with erik estrada while simultaneously burying poor rising action star pat obrien with a hackneyed backyard script and three cans of hairstyling gel to perm his impressive 1984 mullet this guys physical prowess resembles a more femme mark gregory and his next credit would be second fiddle to chris mitchum as tom selick powerful at least the action is mindless and nonstop with some daring asian stuntmen risking their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teens andor meth addicts with no concept of reality one poor extra gets gornoly shredded by an electric hedge clipper and many more are killed by getting hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box classic rape scenes are tasteless and priceless and quotable dialog such as i would rather trust a rattlesnake are delivered with such exuberance and fervor from the thirdrate polizioteschi voice actors random highlight some crazy dude eating live lizards movie also holds the record for most cars driven through walls 210
