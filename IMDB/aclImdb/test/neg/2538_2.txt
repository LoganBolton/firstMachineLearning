anyone who will pay to see troma movies knows and appreciates what they are going to get having said that i didnt think it was possible to make a movie this bad and still be compelling i found myself watching just to see how much worse it could get before the end first off its an indonesian action movie with an american main character who looks and acts like the bastard son of taxis christopher lloyd and rambo he puts posters of himself dressed up like slys cobra all over the place and even has a custom built firing range with actionposed cutouts of his greatest enemiesin jakarta although hes in the cia and has just arrived days earlier there is a lot of action involving gunplayno muzzleflashes on those m16s only sound effects motorcyclesthat bust through walls karatewhere no one makes physical contact and even some sexwhere all the actors are ugly the main plot of an epic like this should at least be reasonably plausible but not here it involves the worlds most dangerous drug cartel going all out to find a drug detector device why would they need it that is never revealed why not kill drugsniffing dogs makes no sense but it is taken seriously the actors are to be commended because they really seemed to think this movie would make them all famous and tried hard to act best line now dance to your grave you dirty whore best scene rambo jumps onto flying helicopter pulls machine gun out of baddies hand lets go falls shoots helicopter as hes falling helicopter blows up cut to mannequin thrown in water fking genius if you cant appreciate trash dont watch it if you can its awesome one last thing did i mention it was directed by the three punjabi brothers
