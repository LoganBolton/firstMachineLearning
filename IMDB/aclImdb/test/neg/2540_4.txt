this movie was different from most of jimmy cangeys films of the 1930s in that it was not done by warner brothersfirst national but was a loanout to a smaller studio because it was a poverty row studio the production values are lower than you might be used to seeing with cagney films plus the plot is certainly one of the strangest i have seen instead of him being a gangster he was a good guy in this onefighting for the law this isnt all that unusual because cagney frequently played lawmensuch as an oss leader the forefather of the cia of fbi agent but to make him an investigator for the bureau of weights and measures was indeed oddespecially since at times he acted pretty much the same way he did in the movie gmen br br all in all a time passer and thats about itbr br finally the videotape i saw this on from memory lane video was perhaps one of the poorest i have ever encountered the sound was terrible and scratchy and the print looked very white and had lots of torn film and gaps
