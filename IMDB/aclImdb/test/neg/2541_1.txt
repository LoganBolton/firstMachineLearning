first off this is the worst movie ive ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not bad in a good way its boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effectsbr br worse it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun wallowing in a sense of japanese uniqueness and victimhood everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans the most noble characters choose seppaku  going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks only japanese would think this way says the prime ministerbr br if this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their place in world opinion the first thing they should do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like this
