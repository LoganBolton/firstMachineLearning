i have just finished watching this movie and for me it takes ages to finish because it is so boringand the storyline is extremely badbr br now where should i starto the movie is called sinking of japan yeah yeah it does show that japan is actually sinking but the action part is very bad compare to the movie the day after tomorrow i would have rate it at least 810br br the sinking of japan does not show much about the disaster that actually happening right in front of our eyes there isnt much excitement at allboring all i can saybr br one more point i would recommend this movie to have a better title maybe something like the romance of sinking of japan because this movie does have lots of talkings waste of time talk nonsense  the love story is extremely boring  have been dragging too longhonestly i almost get frustratedbr br overall this movie does not show enough details of the disasters eg many people running like hell to avoid deathlove story part was extremely not touching enough for mebr br but hey there is one thing we should appreciate about this movie though  its has got good songs
