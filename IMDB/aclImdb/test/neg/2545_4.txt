this film has some nice special effects tearing apart the japanese archipelago to a degree that would humble godzilla the two leads also put in abovepar performances apart from that it is all a bit ropey in this understated disaster flick the incongruities in the pacing are bizarre at one point we have hokkaido sinking into the sea and pyroclastic snow falling on the rest of japan while osaka is buried under an immense tsunami yet elsewhere in the country people are still strolling around sightseeing and licking icecream when another tsunami rolls in kusanagi also manages to travel great distances without any hindrance or even a crease in his cream shirt other people turn up with burns ripped clothes and mudstreaks on their faces br br the japaneseness of the film is both touching and repugnant kusanagis sacrifice in his final evening with shibasaki is a touch of chivalry seldom seen in this genre these days however the illfated pms musings on the japanese psyche and the seduction of death and the fact that japan is abandoned by everyone and has no friends in the last instance hint at a darker paranoia that infects japanese concerns regarding their status in the worldbr br sadly the final sequence is a ripoff of armaggedon edited with a cookiecutterbr br finally my own particular bugbear  the heavy handed product placement for cigarettes this time around it is madorishe scientist toyokawa who gets to be the poster boy for japan tobacco at one point he manages to light up 5000 meters below the ocean surface in a miniature sub the size of a phone box gimme a break
