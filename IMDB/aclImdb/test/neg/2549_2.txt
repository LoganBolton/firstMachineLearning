mexican werewolf in texas is set in the small border town of furlough where anna erika fay lives her best friend is rosie martine hughes  she has a mexican boyfriend named miguel gabriel gutierrez who are determined to track a beast down that has been terrorising the town killing livestock  several residents including some of their friends local mexican legends speak of the chupacabra an evil creature from myth  legend erm im struggling now because not that much else actually happensbr br written  directed by scott maginnis i wont beat about the bush here  simply say that mexican werewolf in texas is awful period the script only ever mentions the word werewolf once  the rest of the time its referred to a chupacabra in fact i suspect this wasnt really conceived as a werewolf flick at all the werewolf creature looks mostly hairless  more like some vicious dog there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon  it actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions there is no transformation scene  at the end when it is killed it doesnt change back into anyone either to be honest apart from the title theres nothing here to indicate a werewolf film at all  even then the title is just a ripoff of the highly popular an american werewolf in london 1981 this is the type of home made crap that i personally think is killing the horror genre how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like dawn of the dead 1978 the evil dead 1981 halloween 1978 or friday the 13th 1980 which were all made on shoe string budgets maybe the blair witch project 1999 but thats it in recent years  crap like mexican werewolf in texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic the characters are awful  things just happen around them the dialogue is rubbish the pacing is terrible the story sucks  virtually sent me to sleep  as a whole this film is just crap im sorry but i dont know how else to describe itbr br director maginnis does nothing to make this watchable theres the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache  quick blink  youll miss something editing which just annoys  irritates in equal measure its not scary theres no nudity theres no tension or atmosphere  the special effects are awful the monster really does look poor  its no wonder maginnis keeps it in the shadows or cuts his scenes so quickly you never get a good look at it theres virtually no colour to the picture either its either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand oranges which makes the thing an eye sore as well the gore consists of some fake guts blink  youll miss them a few bloody wounds  a severed arm big dealbr br with a supposed budget of about 300000 i admit the budget was low but i simply refuse to accept that for making such a rubbish film there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their meagre budgets go far the whole thing has the look of a home movie it has no style  is throughly bland  dull to look at the acting sucks too although you probably already knew thatbr br mexican werewolf in texas will probably con a few people into rentingbuyingwatching it because they might mistakenly think its a sequel to john landis classic which it most certainly isnt  it isnt even a proper werewolf flick either dont be fooled this is awful  im fed up of having to waste timemoney on home made amateur crap like this
