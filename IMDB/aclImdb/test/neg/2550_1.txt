first off mexican werewolf in texas title is misleading as many others have pointed out it is actually about el chupacabra which is a similar creature to a werewolf but by no means the samebr br the production and editing just plain suck when it was over i probably wouldnt be able to give a very accurate description of what exactly the chupacabra looked like for whenever it was in a scenedespite one or two exceptions the camera turned all shaky and you could only see the monsters face clearly the special effects were laughably bad but that has to be expected from a low budget horror moviebr br along with the terrible production comes the bad actors now a couple give fairly plausible performanceserika fay and martine hughes but then there were the bad actorseverybody else who seemed to have no emotions whatsoever when people died then theres the absolutely terrible actorsara erikson who gives one of the 2 worst performances ive ever seen in a movie i mean my god she was indescribably badbr br the plot was very simple basically a chupacabra is in a small texan town killing off local residents and a group of teens look to stop it however even with the plot being this simple a few plot holes managed to leak throughbr br anyways horrible movie however if you are looking for a movie to make fun of and laugh at with your friends one night this would be a pretty good one my friends and i had a good time watching this probably the 2nd worst movie ive ever seen 110 awful
