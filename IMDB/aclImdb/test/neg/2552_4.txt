first of all mexican werewolf in texas is not a werewolf movie this title is bullcrap the story is actually about a chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of furlough in texas i suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something and i guess it actually works because thats the reason why i bought this piece of crap it sounded so stupid anyway the movie isnt any good actually its bloody awful but i didnt expect anything else when i bought it its a low budget horror movie with a chupacabra monster if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog actors and some gore then you should check into this movie but i must warn you this movie is really baaaaaaadbr br this movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen the actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous they almost never say a line in a normal way they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say its so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody its like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo shes the worst of them all i have never seen an actor as bad as her and ive seen pteradactyl even when her boyfriend dies she cant stop being a bimbo about it i hate herbr br some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project but most of the movie is shot in the night when the chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark the gore scenes are few and short but really grizzly and violent the effects are pretty hilarious really but thats the way i like it the chupacabra looks pretty messed up and its easy to see that its a guy in suitbr br overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and its very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death i recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer
