if it had not been for christopher guests hilarious role i would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes the jokes were flat the movie choppy and slow paced certain characters were obnoxious and painful to watch but guests character kept me laughing so i stuck with itbr br i do feel there are much better choices out there
