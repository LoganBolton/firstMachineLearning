i thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including peter otoole susannah york michael craig  harry andrews might be worth watching alas i was wrong utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both otoole and york overacting wildly i watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about ive a feeling otoole plays the laird of a scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister york he is also barking mad but apart from that your guess is as good as minebr br the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever i can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary unimaginative stagy piffle clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director risible
