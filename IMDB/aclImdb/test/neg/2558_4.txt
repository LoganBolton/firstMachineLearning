this movie was a rather odd viewing experience the movie is obviously based on a play now im sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesnt feel terribly interesting enough to watch the movie is way too stagey and they didnt even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie instead what is presented now is an almost literally refilming of a stageplay with overthetop characters and staged dialog because of all this the storyline really doesnt work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore and obsolete viewing experiencebr br it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy youre watching at first you think its a drama youre watching with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses youll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy that leans really more toward the comedy genre rather than the drama genrebr br the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and overthetop one that at times really become unwatchable sure the actors are great peter otoole and susannah york amongst others but they dont really uplift the movie to a level of watchable enoughbr br the story feels totally disorientated basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brothersister characters played by peter otoole and susannah york but what exactly is the story even about the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer like i said before im sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isnt fitting and simply doesnt work outbr br the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences br br more was to expect from director j lee thompson who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed stageplay translated to screen projectbr br really not worth your timebr br 410
