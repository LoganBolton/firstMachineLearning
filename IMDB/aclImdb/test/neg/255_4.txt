im in two minds about following  the film debut of christopher nolan  part of me admires it for costing 6000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house  in many ways it reminds me of the cult movie pi  a film i disliked  and i cant get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around  wouldnt it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write  br br oh well i guess following gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing 6000 over two thousand imdb members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it  but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasnt made by the director of memento
