this is indeed the film that popularized kung fu in the 1970s however if it ever had any kind of excitement or even halfway interesting plot it doesnt seem to have aged very wellbr br long story short extremely drawn out slowmoving confusing plot with runofthemill choreography typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every punch and kick and constant plot twists that never come to an end by the time the film reaches its emotional climax i had long had all the wind knocked out of me to actually carebr br watch it for its historical value as a milestone of chinese kung fu cinema  just leave your expectations at the door or youll be bitterly disappointedbr br for hardcore fans only
