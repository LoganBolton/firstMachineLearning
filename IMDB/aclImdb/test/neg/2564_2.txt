okay some other people have commented that this isnt an action flick so i dont need to rehash that even though i just did this isnt exactly a let down in fact its nice on occasion to see an actor try something different but unfortunately this isnt one of those occasionsbr br now the story nonexistent this film lacks in storyline almost as much as showgirls did sure they throw in a couple environmentalist no not even environmentalist something else tidbits here and there to please seagal being that thats what hes into this doesnt make a story not even close now the ending even those amongst us who actually liked this film the ending you have to admit it was a bit much or a lot stupidbr br now from what i understand this was a directtovideo film at least in the states but this is even too good for this one this piece of garbage should have been cable only on tbs or starz late night
