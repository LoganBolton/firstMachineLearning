i dont know about the rest of the viewers of this movie but personally im dead sick and tired of steven seagal films when above the law came out it was a great action film wahoo now in the patriot steven seagal plays steven seagal from above the law i get tired of seeing no character changes its the same character time after time after time he needs change this movie was probably one of the worst action films i have ever seen calling it an action movie is giving it almost too much credit because theres too few action scenes and theyre spread far apart throughout the film i guess they wanted to go for some drama but it was a meaningless try as the film portrays nothing but the regular squintyeyedstevenseagal weve seen thousands of times over get a new look and lose the pony tail is all i have to say i definitely do not recommend viewing this film in any form go out to eat heck rent barney goes to vegas but do not under any circumstances rent this movie under the precept that seagal will make a great performance
