steven seagals intent is to be commended and his acting in this film is equal to that in many of his others if you ignore the fact that he is supposedly portraying a brilliant scientist the problem i had was with two items of the plot which stretched my suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking pointbr br first how is it that a carefully engineered variation on a nasty germ whose antidote must be just as carefully researched and engineered by a big lab is cured by drinking tea from a flower growing high in the mountains and that grandpas family seem to be about the only people who know anything about thisbr br second and this one really takes the cake having gathered up enough of the cure to fix a whole town wouldnt you expect the army to land the helicopter and start rushing bags of flowers to all the homes in this small town no they instead decide to sprinkle the flowers all over the town and force the sick people to go out and gather them up all over again just plain silly unless under native belief the power in the drug somehow depends on ones having gone out and gathered the flowers oneselfbr br add in the cardboard nature of the villains and the unsuitability of the title and you might think my vote on this movie is actually high
