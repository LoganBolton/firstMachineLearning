in 1932 humphrey bogart was a relative unknownan unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films and because he was an unknown the movie they gave him was clearly a bmoviea quick film with relatively low expectations after seeing it i could see why it would still take bogart many more years and another film studio before he became a household name while the film isnt terrible it certainly isnt goodmaking it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen todaybr br bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company however when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way his dreams all seem to go on hold as one of the characters in the film said the combination of the two is like oil and waterthey just dont mixbr br while bogart is throwing away his promising career his sister is going full speed on the road to skankvillehaving met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash bogey has no idea his sister isnt the actress she claims to be and doesnt realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress isbogarts sister all this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable however what follows is one of the dumbest scenes i have watched in a very long time by now the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with bogeys sister whew but because shes now poor and no good for bogart shes about to fly away and kill herself bogey finds out chases the plane on foot jumps on the plane as its taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her this is so utterly silly and ridiculous i found myself laughing out loud up until then i might have scored it a 4 or 5this sunk the movie to a 3 how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond mebr br the bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film on top of that its all wrong for bogart as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s manly and solid better suits the manone of americas great actors but clearly out of his element herebr br by the way those who love precode films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one practically everyone in the film believes in and practices premarital sex and bogey curses in the filmthings you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic production code was adopted in 1934
