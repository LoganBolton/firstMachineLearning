i saw this at the toronto inter film festival in sept 2005 the description seemed intriguinghow wrong i was this could easily be the worst movie i have ever seenin 50 years i see the director is my age b 1948 and lived with nico of the velvet underground which leads us to andy warhol which coincidently is the one i thought of while watching thiswarhols 24 hour movies of nothing much happening this is not art this is boredombr br specifically black  white ok maybebut what is the purpose here surely they had color in 1968 and there is no contrast with the present and yes the subtitles were in white naturally i dont think i missed much but that made about 20 of them illegiblebr br next its pure chronological order but with seemingly random events thrown in whats the purpose of the conversation with the old man at the dinner table it adds nothing to the movie there were many similar scenesalmost like someone took a camcorder and filmed random people and spliced them together to make a moviebr br plot none the riot consists of some figures in the distance occasionally heaving a rock off screen mostly its an excruciating length of time watching people in the distance stand around the repetitive opium smoking is just as boring when the main character got a cute girlfriend i perked up but no she was boring too this is perhaps the only french film ive seen where no one takes off their clothes probably they were too bored to botherbr br romance none the girl seems totally indifferent to everythingmaybe her sculpture holds some interest but if it does were not shown that we are completely indifferent to the fate of the characters because they are all unappealing maybe thats the point of all this
