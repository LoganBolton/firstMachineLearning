i saw this film last night and came online specifically to see if others thought it was as awful as i didbr br granted obviously some people see a lot in this film that i didnt so if youre one of those people fine  good luck to you but im a patient person ive enjoyed extremely long films before but this was an exercise in torture for mebr br i honestly felt that this was one of those films with little to say and that it was more about style than substance  however the style too made me feel like tearing my hair out pretty much anything interesting that happens during the course of the film happens offscreen its like a deliberate attempt to make a film entirely from outtakes  the bits that would usually be reserved for the deleted scenes section of a dvd if they were shown to the public at allbr br you dont even get to find out in the end anything about the main character francois i had no sympathy for any of the characters in this film except perhaps the violinist  his goat and the old man who believes that octopuses live to 300 because theyre really smart seriously i was excited when it cut to a shot of francois holding a gun to his head i felt so ripped off when even his inevitable suicide turned out to be gutwrenchingly boringbr br oh and where was the editor off smoking opium too i swear i almost screamed every time i was subjected to an extended shot of absolutely nothing happening except perhaps someone pacing backwards and forwards and then finally there would be a very abrupt cut to the next scene and it would be a year later and wed missed everything interesting that happened in the meantime and everyone was still wearing the same bloody clothesbr br so in conclusion if you liked it  great but this review is intended as an antidote to the fawning youll love this film if you love cinema dross ive seen posted here and elsewhere see i hated the film and i still included a sly winking reference to its content
