im usually quite tolerant of movies and very easily entertained however this movie was dreadfully disappointingbr br i watched this movie after seeing on the cover that william zabka was in it the karate kid bad boy and during this movie i could see that this would be the only reasonbr br this film is a tremendous waste of the actors talent the music and sound is dreadfully tacky  i couldnt believe this of a movie made in the 90sbr br i wouldnt really recommend this movie unless youre interested in one of the actors
