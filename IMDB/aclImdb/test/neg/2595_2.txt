have you ever seen one of those shows that became so popular that it could eventually get away with any crummy nonsense and repetitive halfhearted gimmicks that its creators can get away with if you havent then youve never seen family guybr br fans of the show seem to think of it as witty edgy and poignant its none of these it is however dull repetitive insulting and uninspiredbr br the humor of the show comes from two sourcesbr br 1 irrelevant idiocy the show often has flashbacks to things that have nothing to do with the plot and are mostly just absurd and pointless and then theres the random movie references in which the shows characters reenact a scene from a popular movie without effectively parodying it    or parodying it at allwhich isnt funnybr br 2 the same crap thats in every episode the show the one guy is a sexual deviant with stds aha ha isnt that funny hey ya know whats even funnier making the same joke about him anywhere between one and fifteen times in a single episode and dont just tell it numerous times in a single episode make sure you drag it out so that an entire scene is devoted just to telling the one joke now also imagine that this same routine is used over and over again for practically every character in the whole seriesbr br the offbeat unpc humor isnt as unpc as they would have you believe mostly they just say whatever morons think about the latest newspaper headlines politicians and random celebritiesbr br the series had its moments but now i think its time just take the show off the air and be done with itbr br you know what is funny i still like this more than nausicaa of the valley of the wind
