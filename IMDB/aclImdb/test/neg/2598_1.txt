i havent seen a lot of episodes of family guy and its a pretty safe bet that i wont be seeing too many in the future some people say to compare this show to the simpsons is unfair i absolutely think this show wouldnt exist if the simpsons hadnt come first and i absolutely think it wants so very much to be the simpsons i dont understand whats so funny about this show in the episodes that ive watched ive understood where theyve wanted me to laugh i understand that someone thinks a joke was just told but the joke isnt funny i find the whole show to be lazy the title the jokes there is a complete lack of inspiration throughoutbr br the best shows on television cartoon or not are created like this a script is written it goes through several rewrites stuff that doesnt work is taken out inspiration is sparked good stuff is added there are more rewrites and then it is filmedbr br i picture a family guy episode to be created like this a script is written and its filmed
