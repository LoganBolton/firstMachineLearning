family guy is easily one of the worst shows ive ever forced myself to watch not at the bottom though  ive seen the jersey shore a popular hit with high school and college kids who mistake immaturity for edginess this show is unoriginal and stalebr br as this has been dubbed a comedy show lets take a look at its humor 1 random flashbackscuts to celebrities or movies or politics or anything that can be cut to for a kneejerk laugh it got old after the 5 or so repetitions per episode simple solution every time you hear this is worse thanlike the time plug your earsbr br 2 inappropriateness for its own sake this show is notorious for inserting inappropriate gags that have little to do with the overall plot solution watch south park they did it rightbr br the bottom line is that family guy is not worth your time and doesnt hold a candle to the simpsons
