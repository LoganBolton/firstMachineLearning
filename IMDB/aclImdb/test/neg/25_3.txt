is it a poorly acted clicheridden pile of trash of course anyone who doesnt realize that when they pick up the box in the video store probably doesnt have any right judging movies in the first place thus i will now rate the aspects of the film that we actually care about on a scale of 1 to 10br br violence and gore 4  for this genre there are very few deaths and the gore is almost nonexistent anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere the only redeeming quality is the fact that kids are doing these awful things which raises the bar a littlebr br suspense 1  okay i feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of dorky looking kidsbr br nuditysex 7  lots of boobage from three different women one of whom is the mtv vj julie brown there are two sex scenes but little is shown in thembr br unintentional humor  4  there are a few good laughs with the kids trying to act scary but all in all its just bad not funny badbr br overall  4  its not unwatchable there are a few fun moments and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie however only watch this movie if youre a big fan of the 80s slasher flicks this definitely falls on the lower end of the scale but its not all the way at the bottom the real downside is the disappointing ending it almost ruined the movie for me
