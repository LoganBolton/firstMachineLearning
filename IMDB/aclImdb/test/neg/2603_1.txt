everything about this show is terrible its premise even sets itself up to get cheap laughs with bad writing a disfunctional familytheme has already been used too many times most notably by the simpsons which is an excellent show with great writing and many laughs meanwhile family guy has about five minutes of story in each episode with tons of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks thrown in now if this was original or funny sure id think it was clever but no its not funny at all in fact the only reason the episodes are like this is because it is the easiest way to effortlessly crank out episode after episode of this junk much of this show is unoriginal and what is original is just lame it is also amazingly crude and irreverent which again can be fine if its still intelligent animation isnt everything either but from an artistic point of view this show fails also proving yet again that family guy strives for as many cheap jokes and easy shortcuts as possible people enjoy this show and i dont really care because people can enjoy anything they want no matter how much it aims for the lowest common denominator but no i dont recommend this especially for anyone who wants to someday study film or become a writer this is cheap entertainment that aims low and has found success in this the fact that this is so successful says bad things about america
