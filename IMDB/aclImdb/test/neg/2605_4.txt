this could have been great the voiceovers are exactly right and fit the characters to a t one small problem though the look of the characters mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same the same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size it looks kind of odd to see a really big guest stars voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here if i am not mistaken kathy griffin did a voiceover for this show and it looked too odd to be funnybr br there is a few other problems one being the family plot the simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into here we get too much annoying diversions like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off as you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the simpsons or even more married with childrenbr br if i should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is its repetitiveness peter griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others lois should have been named lois lame because she is sort of onedimensional seth green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the showbr br so what more can i say there isnt exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the simpsons has done for almost two decades
