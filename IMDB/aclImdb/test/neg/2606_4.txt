when family guy first premiered i was not in a discriminating mood with the 1990s containing a wealth of clever surreal cartoons why should i be nickelodeon produced doug ren and stimpy and rockos modern life among other fine cartoonsyes this includes spongeboball had quirky dreamlike animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialog the simpsons became an outright phenomenon perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest defenders claim it to be but a very fine investment of your time and certainly dismisses the false axiom that all tv is junk south park started out as a crude but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath it evolved to become a monty python esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally swift and sharp societal critiquessuch as their defense of the noble underpants gnomes and eventually settled to be entirely self referential and meta like the simpsons did and has unfortunately jumped the shark family guy is superficially like the simpsons and south park it pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts however what it has in loquacity it lacks in true witbr br the show is famous for its use of gimmicks especially for flashbacks many are references to bad tv sitcoms or commercials some are funnyespecially from the first two seasons most are not are references inherently funny im not sure but they are mostly what the show stands on considering that its characters are painfully uninteresting where homer and bart have charm and cartman has an artillery of self awareness and pure outrageousness to back up his awful behavior peter griffin has no excuse hes just a loud obnoxious pig anything funny coming from his character is only because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day lois is also very shallow and dull meg is a prop only to be abused chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny and the two main stars of the showstewie and brian are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all really kind of pointlessbr br other gimmicks i cant stand are when a character points to something obviously and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time this happens a lot lately and i cant bear it any longer not just the oft mentioned chicken that likes to beat peter up im talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture and prod it as if they are alien spectators thats not wit or even ironic humor its totally boring and lifelessbr br not that the show cant be funny in fact some of the earlier episodes had me rolling highlights include the pilot episode where peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television when peters religious zealot father shows up and wreaks havoc when peter becomes a narc at megs school and the pancake episode i suspect these are the episodes that accidentally incorporated actual human traits in its characters or merely were times the writers had actual comedic inspirationbr br one last thing the show is not offensive its only offensive to those who wouldnt watch the show in the first place so its almost like a circle jerk to the choir of hipsters
