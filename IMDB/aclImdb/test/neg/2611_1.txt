this film may have been the first puppet master but this sure bored me to death when i saw this stupid moviei wanted a refund this was a bad series to the puppet master and im sure that i am not the only one that thinks this was terrible to some it was great but to others it was a ticket to snoresville and boy are they right the puppets didnt even do anything nor did they kill people it shouldt be seen by people so im warning you not to see it you will be disappointed even to the fans who love puppet master it was a waste of their time and it didnt make so much moneynobody even got kill but one or twovery pointlessbr br 110
