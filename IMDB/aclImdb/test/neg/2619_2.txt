in the literal sensebr br reminds you of those copsandrobber or cowboysindians roleplaying games you played with your 8 year old friends br br tedious and uninspired the storyline was obviously written to make bad acting and dialogue seem as part of the plot but all it does is showcase it i cant believe john badham let his name be associated with this piece of crap this could have been done better by a high school film buff who had been given the camera lighting filmstock and editingbr br destined to be a timefiller on scifi channel when theyve overused everything else from their library and barely better than the paid programming shill downstream
