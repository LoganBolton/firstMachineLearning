when i read the reviews of kahin pyaar na ho jaaye i thought huh it was that confusing to be sure i went to watch the film and what do you know its a remake of the wedding singer several scenes have been changed to suit the whole essence of indianness but the rest of it is a direct lift from the 1998 hollywood hit bollywood is no stranger to remakes but this is one so poor that it pains me just to watch it i groaned so much watching this and i realized i wasnt the only one doing so one guy actually walked out of the theater and never came back salman khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles he shrieks and whines too much why cant he just take it easy he doesnt do justice to the role originally acted out by adam sandler he doesnt have sandlers sense of comic timing rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites but shes no drew barrymore either the scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname hi im mrs pugalia doesnt match up to barrymores version hi im mrs julia gulia i felt embarrassed watching that scene even though i had loved the original the music is not too bad its probably the only saving grace of this otherwise horrible film avoid this at all cost
