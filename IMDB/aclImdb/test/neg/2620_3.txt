now this is a movie i really dislike its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere the settings are not even attractive for the eye and do not serve for the movies purpose br br the puppets look really cheesy  not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks what did they do to our favorite toysbr br the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible br br i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs
