i watched the first few episodes a short while back and felt i couldnt take it anymore the horrible looking fight scenes are the worst ive ever scene in my life about onethird of each episode is dedicated to flash gordon and his mighty fight moves i know fight choreography from that era isnt exactly up to par with todays standards but this is ridiculous they dont even try to make it look realistic flash gordon who hardly resembles a fighter uses his drunken slow moves and bare fist to knock out four or five guys with knives guns and other weapons give me a break theres also a scene where he does some similar act while in the water basically every episode has scenes similar to that as for the rest of the episode theres not much else i remember i basically viewed it out of curiosity on what science fiction looked like 70 years ago
