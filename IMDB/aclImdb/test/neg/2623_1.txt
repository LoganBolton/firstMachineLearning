thank god i was not operating any heavy machinery it could have been an even worst disaster shots were slow  very repetitive different scenes same shots medium shot medium shot medium shot snooze story line was rather empty william hurt was the worst where did he get that stupid accent from random shots of scenery just to include them really didnt add much there were more shots of arbour traveling in her car than anything else the direction really didnt take us into any of the scenes  it also didnt make me feel for any of the characters i would have rated it a zero if imdb had the option great sedative if you cant sleep there went 2 hours of my life i will never get back
