changi is an australian comedydrama set in the world war 2 japanese prisoner of war camp of that name the story cuts between past events and the present day when the aged veterans plan a reunion this is a much publicised and controversial miniseries here in australia the budget ran over 65 million aust dollars historians and veterans criticised its authenticity and critics pilloried the uneasy mix of comedy and drama shades of pearl harbor series writer john doyle half of the successful roy  hg comedy team has tried to defend himself with comments about the characters are composites of actual people the troops used comedy to cope with the situation its only based on actual events one of our actors was actually there etc i dont have a problem with any of these points many superb fictional and factual dramas have come out of the japanese pow camp experience king rat tenko merry christmas mr lawrence bridge on the river kwai paradise road empire of the sun blood oath and a town like alice black comedy has often been used successfully in pow dramas life is beautiful the great escape seven beauties stalag 17 the colditz story and even hogans heroes so why is changi a monumental failure  the acting in changi is uniformly excellent the music and cinematography is good  it is the writing and direction that have let it down every scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu when anthony hayes is made to stand in the blazing sun i thought didnt i see alec guinness do this in bridge on the river kwai the sudden flashes into surreal song  dance brought back dennis potters singing detective but without the finesse this borrowing happened so often it smacked of lazy writing by cut and paste rather than homage the constant intercutting between the past and present stories left me unable to concentrate on either flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool  here it left me distanced from characters where intensity was called for the ausiness is overdone  every conversation seemed to include stone the bloody crows  such that i was saying i get the point i know theyre aussies cultural stereotyping extended to the british and japanese too sadistic young japanese officer uptight british officer wiser japanese commandant funloving rascally aussies etc i thought i was watching hogans heroes on the river kwai after 3 episodes im tuning out
