there are no  no redeeming qualities to this film they didnt check a single fact  not one about anything i feel sorry for larry miller and even more sorry for his agent for not being more capable for finding him a more suitable venuebr br the adults are all idiotic the effects are cheesy and devoid of any sense of reality the music is honestly cheesy the plot is beyond beliefbr br i you want to see something good with your family see anything else take some time and check for mildew in your attic my tenyearold is mocking this film as we watch it hes unfortunately learning that not every movie is worth watching
