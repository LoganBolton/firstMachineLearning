this movie sucked sooo bad i couldnt even watch the ending milos voice was too low and i couldnt understand what he said as well as some of kendras lines also where did he get all these wedding dresses from it was very impractical the movie failed to elaborate on milos drowning and how it made people ridicule dr jeter and his practice overall i was disappointed that i was unable to give this movie a rating of zero because by grading this movie as a one i felt i was giving it undeserved praise
