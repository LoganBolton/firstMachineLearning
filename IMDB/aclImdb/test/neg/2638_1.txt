this movie was so weak that it couldnt even come up with good cliches to rip off i love horror movies and will see practically anything but if i had it to do over again i would have skipped this one entirely you may think that im exaggerating but i challenge anyone to find anything even remotely satisfying or interesting about this piece of garbage not scary not funny not curious not worth it
