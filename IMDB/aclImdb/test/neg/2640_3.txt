in a quiet town a couple of girls witness the murder of one of their friends to a strange young boy named milo who lives on the other side of town after the murder his body is found in a river and his pronounced dead so sixteen years later a weddings draws the girls back to their childhood town and claire a school teacher becomes obsessed that milo hasnt died as she has recurring visions of him and her friends are dying one by one and no one believes her when she claims milo is apart of it so now she sets off to find out the horrifying truthbr br when i came across this film i was pretty sceptical about it especially when it had from the creators of anaconda on the front cover but reading the odd little plot outline on the back of the video case it sounded alright and rather refreshing for a change well guess what i thought it was a good idea at the time but it was a totally different story when it came to watching the film it just seemed to try to hard to be smart and very psychological based but that latter element didnt come off that well for me and it was basically a prolonged and mostly unconvincing thriller hey ill admit it had its moments but hardly enough to make it neither effectively chilling or memorable but a bravo to the filmmakers at least the story isnt a rehash of those slasher imitators that followed scream and shock horror theres no selfreferential humour evident actually there isnt even a hint of humour although maybe it was too serious especially since the plot is rather absurd but thats not its main problem what a disjointed plot we get i didnt know about to much that was going on as it seems to skim a lot stuff in favour for some supposedly shocking and disturbing sequences no more like irrelevant scenes and yawn inducing clichés that we see from time to time also you can see some influences from some good 70s horror films one being dont look now this when our main character keeps on seeing the figure of her past in a slicker the other would have to be one of my favourites alice sweet alice with the person causing the trouble wearing a yellow slicker and committing grisly deaths interesting idea but it comes across quite shallow and too many faults pop up i liked it more when the scenes dealt with the characters childhood as the performances and circumstances had something creepy about it but when it leans into their adulthood its tired and uneventful for most part and the performances werent awful but incredibly mundane and hardly involving is a good way of putting it most of the dialogue had me groaning in disbelief at how contrived and awkward it was youll be yelling no duh at the screen because you just cant believe what youre hearing the police detective gets the brunt of it br br quality wise  the film isnt bad actually its better then your usual straight to video i would say very slick stuff with some inventive and prominent camera angles and a faint score that works reasonably well another factor that stood out and was a key to building on the moody atmosphere was the creeping sound effects and that bicycle bell does leave a ringing sensation in your ears the setting of a quiet elementary school was well done and rest of the action takes place in a house but just dont be expecting any real suspense or surprises as the execution of these are nonexistent the deaths arent pleasant and theyre mildly bloody and its more the aftermath to what happens to these bodies which tries to disturb you the villain in this piece the meanspirited child milo jeeder was mildly unnerving well that voice and yellow slicker does make an imprint to begin with but it does seem to lose its effect when we come to the films conclusion the cheesy tag lines on the video compare him to move over jason watch out freddy and this isnt childs play chucky but you got to be kidding me right hes labelled the new face of evil yeah sure all he needs is to be taught some manners and problem solved overall the film just left me with a sour taste as ive couldve gone without seeing it i probably wished i didbr br just dont expect too much in this blur of a film or even better just skip it as you wont be missing out on much really
