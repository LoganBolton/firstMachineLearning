why is it that such romantic movies that never actually go anywhere always start and probably end with crappy jazz its not clever and it makes it look like a bloody tvmovie this film was sappy slow paced boring unoriginal wooden and did i say boringbr br harrison ford was probably trying to be mysterious and crude but he was just a crawling mumbling cop that seemed to walk into the congresswomans home like everything was fine when he behaved like a pervert  staring at thomas with a pervy glare hardly ever bothering to speakbr br and why the hell do they always get british actors to put on crappy accents  theyre casted because theyre famous and everybody knows theyre british precisely because theyre famous
