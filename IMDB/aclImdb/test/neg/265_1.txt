oceans twelve just plain stupid bad and nothing compared to the other twobr br an art robbery 10 known actors at least a weak script and very slow developing idea thats why i characterize a movie i only saw at least 20 minutes of it dont get me wrong you may like it but i only like the oceans films because of the heist theme if oceans 12 its not about heist then whats the point to see it glad soderberg saw his main error and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first one kudos for thatbr br steven soderberg isnt really a good director apart from his hit sex lies and videotapes nothing else happened so much great to the career of this director shame on him but his fault only
