nothing could be more appealing than the idea of a good love story featuring kristin scott thomas and harrison ford the cool refined english beauty and the warmblooded american male  what could possibly be more lovely well this is not that movie right away they ruin it by casting kristin scott thomas as an american congresswoman thats like casting hugh grant as babe ruth or colin firth as al capone kristin scott thomas is exactly the sort of woman you dont picture shaking hands with greasy exjunkies in filthy slums or squeezing into smelly crowds and kissing babies she would have been far better cast as the english born widow of an aristocratic senator the kind who belongs to the hunt club and goes to flower shows but has no idea how the other half livesbr br then theres harrison ford as a regular guy cop certainly hes tough enough for the role but the idea that hes going to romance this stunning high society beauty is a bit hard to swallow why couldnt he have been say a tough but wealthy reform politician with bluecollar roots who inherits kristins late husbands senate seat the two of them are initially quite cool to each other but for dutys sake kristin is cordial to him and he in return starts showing her some of the rawer side of life  things her husband sheltered her from her political awakening coincides with the jolting passion of a newer more blue collar lover  one who appreciates her polish and refinement far more than her aristocratic husband now thats a love story instead of that though you get a blank meaningless thriller where the action drags and nothing happens well there is one ghetto style drive by scene where harrison almost gets killed but its so abrupt and unexplained its really more like welcome comic reliefbr br the sky is always gray in this movie and our refined lovely kristin always looks a little chilled when shes supposed to be dreaming of passion she looks more like shes dreaming of a wool blanket and a cup of tea she also looks a bit sleepy most of the time like shed really rather be napping in the bed than screwing harrison fordbr br all things considered id say you cant blame her
