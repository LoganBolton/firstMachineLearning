ok just what the hell is all this supposed to mean halloween 6 lets just call it that ok is without a doubt the most confusing film in the series and from what ive heard seeing the original producers cut doesnt sound like it makes things any less bewildering than the official release what a messbr br this isnt a really bad film as some have said it has its scary scenes and some rather intense moments  it just doesnt make any sense dont tell me that michael was engineered from the beginning to be evil and kill and destroy and blah blah blah it was bad enough when they turned michael into jamie lee curtis brother just so they had an excuse to keep her in the second film  this is too muchbr br it would seem this is another case of the creators of the film trying to be too smart by coming up with a new premise that will shock and impress us all bad move guys were not looking for an explanation of why michael kills so please dont try and feed us this crap show me michael looking menacing and killing a bunch of people show me dr loomis trying to track him down and as always coming up just short dont waste what turned out to be the last performance of donald pleasance by telling me in the most confusing way possible that michael was created by some cult from hell and that his seed will be passed on to another and oh brotherbr br halloween 6 has its moments dont get me wrong and we all know there have been far worse sequels than this hellraiser anyone so get what you can out of it the scene toward the end of the film with michael charging down a deep red corridor is particularly effective and try to ignore the screwball plot hopefully one day we can all see the producers cut and maybe get the chance to make a bit more sense out of all of this till then this will have to dobr br ftm
