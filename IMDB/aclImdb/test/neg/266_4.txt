i enjoyed oceans 11 i thought it was quite enjoyable helped by the performances and the direction however i was disappointed with this film dont get me wrong it is not a complete dud thanks to the stellar performances from brad pitt catherine zetajones george clooney and matt damon especially and the efficient direction from steven soderbergh however the film really does suffer from truly lethargic pacing some of the film was so slow i almost fell asleep between one key twist second the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up the camera work wasnt as innovative as it was in the first movie either whereas in the first movie it was smooth and professional it was jerky and awkward here and the music wasnt particularly memorable the screenplay also wasnt as witty or as fun and the film felt anticlimatic at the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy despite the expert playing and direction so much potential but really a missed opportunity 410 bethany cox
