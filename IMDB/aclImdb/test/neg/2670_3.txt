avoid this one it is a terrible movie so what if it is very exciting all it is is just pointless murders and the whole thing with thorn and michaels curse that was the absolute worst thing they could possibly do to the series why couldnt they leave michaels story a mystery hes supposed to be the boogeyman not part of some stupid cult ugh thank god for halloween h20 which wiped out halloween 36 they all sucked but anyway if you see this movie please expect no more than pointless murders and gore
