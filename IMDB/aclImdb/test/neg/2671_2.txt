most of this film was okay for a sequel of a sequel of a sequelbr br i was impressed by the amount of suspense there was i had actually expecting that to be chucked out the window in favor of gore gore gore it wasnt but theres some pretty ridiculous deathsbr br the thing that i disliked however was all of the plot complications those could have been okay if the scriptwriters had taken the time to explain all of them through but what was the purpose of the secret society in the mental institution specifically why were they protected from michaels damage until a certain point what exactly were they going to do with the baby how did jaime lloyd get pregnant for that matter why lock her up for 20 years for her to get pregnant too why did michael kill all his coconspirators in the end why were there fetuses in the lab the actors seemed to have figured it all out once they saw the fetuses but it was never explained to the audiencebr br if youre just going to watch this film to see people get snuffed then thisll be okay for you however if you cant stand a plot being thrown at you which remains unresolved by the time the credits roll you should go watch something else
