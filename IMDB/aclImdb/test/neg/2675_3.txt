if halloween 5 was a cruel joke to the fans of the series than halloween 6 is a like a vicious insult the storyline has gone to the dogs everyone michael is used as a helpless pawn in this film and he isnt at all scary he reminds me of an overweight alcoholic man than the boogeyman that struck fear in our hearts back in the original there are almost no redeemable qualities about this feature and im so glad h20 came out because it would be an insult to fans to have this be fresh on our mindsbr br halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that i liked having an adult tommy doyle in the film was a nice touch and it linked it to the original donald pleasance is herein his last performancewhat a bad film to end an otherwise nice career on when hes on screen he makes you remember the good old days when halloween was actually scarybr br thats about it my friends the stalk sequences are unoriginal one of them being a blatant ripoff of the lauriemichael chase in the original the other characters are terribly underwritten and just arent likable the music on of halloweens highlights even when the film is bad is tortured in this film we get a silly rock version of the stalkchase theme what were they thinking when they made this filmbr br spoilerbr br their biggest mistake was killin off the character of jamienow played by another actress who isnt worth mentioningwe watched this character escape death in two films we rooted for her and when she is killed in this film you cant help but feel sorry for her and realize that the filmmakers dont care when good characters are established in a filmbr br end spoilerbr br the less said about thi embarrassment the better i wish it didnt exist i suggest skipping this film and even 5 and just going straight to h20 because if you watch this you may not want to see another halloween film again
