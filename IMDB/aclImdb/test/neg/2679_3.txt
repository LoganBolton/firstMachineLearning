man the 90s really were an horrible decade for movies the movies are lacking in a good style and also the storytelling is often lackingbr br this 6th entry into the long running halloweenseries is certainly a bad one you just never really get into the story because it isnt a very well constructed and buildup moviebr br its simply a poorly done film that also suffers from its imagineless writing and noncompelling characters that are in it dr loomis seems to be in it just for the sake of being in it its a real shame that this had to be donald pleasence last filmrole its nice and also sort of suiting that his last role is in an halloween movie but he definitely deserved to be in a better onebr br there is never a sense of real danger in the movie and the character of michael myers just never comes across as threatening or scary perhaps its because hes featured too prominently throughout the movie from pretty early on already he does his usual stuff again but without too much class or originality also the attempts to uncover myers past dont really work out for the main reason that it just doesnt get explained very well its obvious that the script went through various rewrites before and also very possibly during filming several scenes even got reshot or added after the first cut turned out to be far from pleasing br br the movie more often looks and feels like a made for tv one this is also due to the lack of some real good gore as an horror movie it really is lacking in basically everything to make this a good or even original one to watchbr br so far the worst out of the seriesbr br 310
