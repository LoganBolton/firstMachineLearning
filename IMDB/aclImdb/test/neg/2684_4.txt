scotts collection of 80s icons cannot save this teen disaster but then i suppose thats why it was only a tv movie and not a major motion picture william a schwartz writer comes up with something closer to stewardess school except this movie is more boring this movie isnt really stupid just boring and completely plotless the only reason to see this might be to see tina yothers in an actual role after family ties after this movie and equally dumb class cruise i guess mr scott wised up and went back to directing sitcoms which was his best move yet 4 out of 10
