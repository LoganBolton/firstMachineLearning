this movie was unfortunately terriblebr br clich√©d hackneyed stilted dialogue and acting make it almost unwatchablebr br the feelgood finale is laughably lamebr br there is a reason judge reinholds career has vanishedbr br if you dont live in new york and arent jewish several of the jokes will be inscrutablebr br i too found the need to have the unacknowledged lesbian daughter go straight at the end quite insultingbr br i simply cannot fathom how this film was so popular at film festsbr br it is without a doubt one of the worst films i have seen in quite some time
