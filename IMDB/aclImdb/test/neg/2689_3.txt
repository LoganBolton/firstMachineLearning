the discussion has been held a thousand times is the merchant of venice antisemitic i think it is isnt it unfair to always point out this little bit of antisemitism in an otherwise great piece of art i think it isnt does this play stain shakespeares reputation as the worlds greatest playwright i think it does does it play a role if he didnt do it on a particular racist purpose i think it doesnt michael radford knew all this and this is why he added to his movie a prologue about the pitiful situation of the jews in renaissance venicebr br in vain for the play remains what it has always been and the new makeup only gives a first but futile hope that someone has dared to set something right that remains a permanent outrage not because its degree of antisemitism would be particularly shocking but because the play comes under the name of william shakespearebr br why spend so much time in portraying the hatred of a man  shylock why employ a great and serious actor like al pacino if in the end everything is getting ruined in this outrageous but hey imnotresponsibleshakespearewroteit court room scene and now id like to be very precise just like shylock himselfbr br hes demanding his right according to the contract which the  not very responsible  christian antonio who always used to look down on him signed in full awareness of the consequences sure what shylock demands is cruel and useless but thats not the point what we see or should see is a man who has been humiliated for all his life to the point where all what remains on him is his hatred i think it is certainly a bit inappropriate to lecture such a man on things like compassionbr br but what the playthe movie they are one and the same now does at this point is become a soap opera the cruel madman with his knife the horrified but rather shortminded audience the poor victim tied to his chair true antonio accepts his fate but why cant he just say one word sorry i think we need not lose many words on the ridiculous verdict of the young dottore from padua its a truly popular verdict not much different from what would be seen 400 years later in the show trials of the nazis from one minute to the next this jew is robbed of everything he owned sentenced to being baptized christian and kicked outbr br isnt that outrageous obviously not the story moves on to the romantic intricacies of the rings and its happy endbr br what one can learn in libeskinds jewish museum in berlin and similar places all over the world is that antisemitism often goes unnoticed by the mass because whats so devastating for a minority or some individuals is embedded in the alleged greater good for the majority it should be exactly the task of everyone of us to develop a sensitivity to detect and unmask such tendenciesbr br i dont accept the excuse that this film was made to create empathy with the badly treated shylock it just doesnt work out i dont think that anybody can be forced to be mercifulbr br i dont recommend this movie in particular not for an oscar
