last week i watched a royal shakespeare company production of macbeth it was 25 years old filmed wno props except swords no furniture except chairs it was riveting the acting was super  all the actors trained brits contrast that performance to thisyawn yawn yawn al pacino as shylock was tragic heavy and couldnt quite lose the new yorker accent despite the longpausesbetweenlines the whole thing was soporific even the comic scenes were barely even worth a smile let a lone a belly laugh this is supposed to be funny they tried to make it tragic it was neither just boring i give it four points for costumes scenery and jeremy irons who is good at playing a dull depressed deepvoiced guy can he be anything else
