watching this movie and then listening to the commentary its clear that michael radford doesnt understand this play the first clue that he fails to fully grasp the work is that he takes pains to set the film in seventeenthcentury venice which sounds truly odd yes that misunderstanding the film would mean trying to make it as accurate to its location as possible but anyone whos studied shakespeare knows that while he set most of his plays in exotic locals the culture and values are always contemporary england this doesnt hurt the film but it displays a lack of necessary knowledgebr br where radford kills the film is in making it so dead serious he manages to suck every joke out of the script leaving the whole production flat every ounce of passion is beaten out of the characters even shylocks do we not bleed speech is a mild awkward ranting from a choleric who seems to only be saying and doing what he does because hes supposed to the lovers are solemn and far too restrained joseph fiennes delivers some of the most romantic lines in the cinema this year in a barely audible whisper gratiano who has to promise to behave at one point is more sober and collected than bassiano who makes him promise to behave jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spends her life with lorenzo poutingbr br in the commentary for the bland and watereddown court scene the director voices his shock that an audience laughed at portias a pound of flesh no more no less sentence ultimately concluding that it had to tension release laughter the merchant of venice is a comedy and radford scoffs at the idea that the most absurd and hysterical portions of the story are anything but the most daringly provocative dramabr br the film has no intelligible focus yet cuts out some of the most entertaining scenes the characters are forced into high drama veils so they come out sounding like ibsen characters reading victorian poetry and the comedic ending where all of the good guys go to bed happy is drowned in a dignified despair that feels like theyre finding stiff upperlip peace with impending death rather than reconciling with lovers even lancelot and antonio exit the film holding their hats like aristocratic mournersbr br the film is poorly done because the creative powers that be dont understand the script it is stern where it should hysterical it is reserved where it should be passionate it is michael radford where it should be william shakespeare
