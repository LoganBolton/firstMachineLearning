this is one of those wonderful martialarts movies that begin with two posses of tough gang members facing off in a park and when the deal goes wrong and the battle starts it turns out they all know karate and kung fu the everwooden cynthia rothrock plays as usual a cynical deadpan good cop this time in los angeles she and her police partners are trying to break up a counterfeiting ring and when that plot line is exhausted the story just switches over to something else and cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy greatlooking tycoon within the films obviously rockbottom budget theres some helicopter action some speedboat action some car chases a brawl where cynthia beats up everyone in a countrywestern bar some swimmingpool scenes with bimbos in thong bikinis and a surprisingly good horseback chase about a dozen and a half cops get gunned down a lot of plot twists happen that just dont make any sense dont worry about them and counterfeiting currency is a federal crime so where the hell is the fbi i guess they were too busy the fight choreography was done by cynthia rothrocks frequent costar richard taylor whose classy and witty presence in front of the camera would frankly have made this a better movie he also tended to make cynthia a better actress when they appeared together and frankly she could use it she seems tired and bored and does her best acting in guardian angel when she is playing opposite a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter drunken monologues the dog almost outacts her she also wears some of the most godawful clothing any leading lady has ever worn in any movie loose baggyleg jeans with pale acidwashed areas over each buttock were the most shocking the other actors are all over the map you can picture many of the minor characters being cast this way hey me and some other guys i know are going to be in a movie you wanna be in it too no dude im serious then there are the slumming professionals the most fun is lydie denier the stunning french model and veteran of red shoe diaries baywatch melrose place and of playing many many other variations on the sexy french bombshell here she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in baisezmoi or an alias episode and not some directtocable trash like this theres also the tall dark and handsome daniel mcvicar now a regular on the bold and the beautiful john oleary who has played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again here and aharon ipale the veteran arab character actor perhaps best known as pharaoh seti from the mummy and the mummy returns for these professionals guardian angel must be the most laughable entry on their resumes i gave this movie a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters who are enthusiastic martialarts students both like to see a woman kicking ass and having the big action scenes for a change theyre still a bit too young to care what a lowquality picture this really was and just enjoyed cheering cynthia on as she did her swivellegged highkicking stickfighting thing if you like this kind of flick you could probably enjoy it on that level
