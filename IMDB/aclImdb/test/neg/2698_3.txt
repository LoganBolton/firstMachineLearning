i actually trawled through the entire set of reviews searching for the ones which gave this film less than 5 stars they were few and far between which is utterly baffling yes i know its a disney film and it isnt directed by christopher nolan but good lord this is straighttothebargainbucket nonsense they shouldve had done with it and animated the bloody thingbr br and whats even worse is the fact that imdb wont let me simply finish my rant there because my review needs to be longer br br the awesome ingame camera shots are literally taken from tiger woods pga tour golf on the playstation the story plods like a sulking school boy the multistranded character and plot development cripples an already weak setup and the grand finale is plain boringbr br aside from that it really was the greatest film ive ever seen in my entire life br br good authenticlooking costumes sets and sports equipment there i said it
