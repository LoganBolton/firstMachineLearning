i went to see quitting with high hopes because the directors shower had impressed me so despite a few lapses into mawkishness shower ranks high on my list of alltime favorite movies for its penetrating insight into family relationships and its generally superb acting and direction and ive seen it at least three times nowbr br but quitting fell flat in my estimation it seemed a pointless exercise and i was quickly so tired of the main characters insufferable personality that i was longing for the movie to end i admit to falling asleep six or seven times but it was only for a few seconds at a time so i think its still ok to write this commentbr br i did admire the parents and sister the device of using all real characters in the film is a nice one ive never seen used beforebr br disappointment aside i will still make an effort to see any film bearing yang zhangs name simply on the basis of the beautiful shower
