i didnt expect a lot when i went out to see this but my god what a disappointment the original was kind of fun within its genre but this is so bad i felt abused when i left the theater theres no plot its not funny its not enjoyable to watch its straight out embarrassing after an hour i hoped my patience would be rewarded but now i regret not leaving the theater do yourself a favor and ignore this one see it when it comes to the small screen or see it on budget dvd whatever you do dont waste any money on it dont say i didnt warn you
