for people who have absolutely no idea of what a comedy is that not only includes the people who liked this movie but the people who made it what could they possibly have been thinking madonna playing judy holliday please she cant even play madonna if there actually is a madonna i hope griffin dunne was paid well he deserved every penny he got because if this didnt kill his career nothing will im sure that the few people who actually paid to see this movie left it feeling like their pockets had been picked madonna is apparently past the point of feeling embarrassed by her virtually complete lack of talent as an actress but you cant help feeling embarrassed for her anyway she has no connection with the rest of the cast it appears like she showed up on the set and said ok im here im gonna embarrass myself by doing the absolute worst judy holliday impression anyones ever seen now stay the hell out of my way and then proceeded to do exactly that i know the phrase rotten madonna movie is redundant but it certainly fits this its painful to watch a totally inept and talentless actress make a complete fool of herself but it apparently doesnt bother her as she does it again and againbr br the only remotely funny thing about this comedy is that she actually managed to find people who gave her the money to make it now thats funny
