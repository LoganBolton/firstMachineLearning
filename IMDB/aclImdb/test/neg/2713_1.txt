this has to be one of the if not the worst movies i have ever seen after watching this piece of sht i felt as though i should write to madonna and demand compensation for my time but now i feel that i should write madonna and demand a great 80s album considering she cant record a good album to save her life anymore in return for this disaster br br on to the movie itself which can be summed up like thisbr br it consists madonna jumping around acting like a spoiled teenager who lost her way she is trying to impress this absolute douche of an actor who plays the lawyer in the movie but the best was the ending i was staring with my jaw on the ground into the television as the credits rolled by thinking to my self thats it thats the ending what a piece of sht if madonna wasnt a pop icon at the time of this film this movie would have single handedly destroyed her career and the funniest thing of the whole situation was that i just watched the damn movie to see where they placed the song whos that girl well guess where they placed itat the end
