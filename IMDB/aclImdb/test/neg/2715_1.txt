yes it was an awful movie but there was a song near the beginning of the movie i think called i got a woody or something to that effect i would love to find a sound track of that if there is one available i saw this song on mst 3k and as awful as it was it had its moments and that song was one of thembr br if you like babes in bikinis this is the movie for you but if you dont then dont bother it was great material for mst 3k i have to admit though i would really love to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack though not just that song but a couple more were really funny and are classics as far as im concerned
