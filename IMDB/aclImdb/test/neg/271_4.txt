the people who bash this movie were looking for it to be as cool and slick as the first one which this isnt this movie was supposed to be the complete opposite as oceans 11 this has been said by a lot of the cast members and also the director steven soderbergh oceans 12 while it did lack a gripping plot is being bashed because it was different then what people wanted if it were released before oceans 11 it would be taken much differently not as a failed sequel the problem with sequels is people go into it with a preset idea of what it should be like it and have lots of expectations they should go into this movie with an open mind and not expect it to be oceans 11 again
