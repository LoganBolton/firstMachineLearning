i am disgusted and appalled by the positive reviews this movie is receiving not only is it hokey manipulative and melodramatic its also shamelessly offensive the character of radio gooding jr is paraded around as a cute little stuff animal like a puppy thats so cute you just want to take him home this mentality is shameless radio is never treated as a human being but as a manipulative device to draw sympathies from its audience even more atrocious are the films numerous moments in which radio gets hit in the headtripsfalls overetc these moments of slapstick comedy had the audience howling with laughter merely purely because its funny because radio is retarded this is shameless now i do not feel that the word retarded is an appropriate word at all to describe the mentally disabled but this seems to be the stance the film is taking radio is retarded but thats okay because hes cute and we like him goodings portrayal seems better suited for a john waters film than an inspiring family drama to add insult to injury the film is incompetent on every level debra winger is uninspired in the role as the stereotypical housewives that the very reminder of her heinous monologues insights laughter in all who see the film the score by john horner is pure sap always overlaying its tear some score over the tired cinematography ed harris is decent in a role he could have slept through but manages to retain much of the audiences attention throughout the film in conclusion if you consider yourself a decent human being ignore this travesty of a film read the book but otherwise skip this dire film on an interesting character from american history
