the vindicator is a weird little canadian bmovie at first glance it would appear to be just another cheap extremely cheap terminator knockoff but strangely enough it also shares some qualities with the original robocop which hadnt even been released yet when vindicator appeared 1986 coincidence who knows anyway the story is thus scientist carl lehman seems to be a pretty nice guy who works for a super duper secret government hightech research lab reporting to a sleazy boss named whyte whom he butts heads with about project funding early in the movie carls got a loving wife at home and a baby on the way which makes it all the more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a lab accident but wait carls not really dead after all whyte has extracted carls brain and inserted it into his pet project some sort of experimental biomechanical space suit when carl wakes up inside his new body he understandably goes a little nuts trashes the lab and escapes this is a problem because whyte for reasons known only to himself has programmed the mechanical suit with a rage reaction program which will cause carl to kill anybody who touches him for any reason in hindsight that little addition to carls psyche was probably not the best ideabr br so robocarl wanders aimlessly through the movie for a while killing a couple of random muggers and other assorted background characters till he returns to his home and contacts his wife this scene is supposed to be heartbreakingly touching i guess but turns out comical because carls robot voice is so heavily synthesized that you can barely understand a word he says he of course tells her to leave the city and never come back because shes in danger but she wants to stay and help him yadda yadda yadda eventually whyte hires a gang of commando thugs led by hunter an apparent ninja assassin played by pam grier to hunt down and destroy his runaway creation using carls wife as bait and predictable but laughably cheap looking mayhem ensuesbr br im a bmovie kind of guy but the vindicator was so halfassed that it turned into high comedy pretty quickly im assuming that a good hunk of the budget went into stan winstons robocarl suit design because that actually looks pretty cool but the rest of the movie suffers from a cheap madefortv kind of look the script couldve used a lot more work but then maybe the filmmakers had gotten wind of robocop going into production and rushed to get vindicator out so they couldnt be accused of ripping them off either way judging by the other comments here on imdb im not the only one whos noticed the parallels between vindicator and robocop and obviously robo is the superior film so theres no need to waste your time sitting through this piece of nonsense unless you want to see a film that can best be described at best as a rough draft of robocop if it were made by an 8th grader
