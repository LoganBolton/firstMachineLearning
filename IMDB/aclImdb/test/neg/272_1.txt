just like most people i couldnt wait to see this oceans 11 sequel but it really stinks i must say it stinks because theres simply no good screenplayit was just cheap i hope the producers donate all the money this movie has made or will make to the tsunamivictims in asia so this movie will have at least one good reason to exist it is so bad i even cant write a decent comment about it buti still advise the creators of this thing to make oceans 13 oceans 13 will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal a screenplay well hidden somewhere in hollywood the 13th member will be a foreign mayberussian screenplaywriter who knows all tricks to write a copy of this well hidden screenplay so they can replace the original theyll have to steal or they need to find at least 13 people to write a decent screenplay for a movie in which not only julia roberts plays herself but even all other starmembers of the oceansfilms 13 people because its the lucky number of andy garcias character
