this movie was so awful i dont even know where to beginthe only positive thing i can say about it is that luke perry gave a good performance the entire movie was all over the place there was no explanation as to the causeonly theoriesof the eruptions or rationals for their solutions or why it would work it was ridiculous all the characters and relationship between them was so cheesy you just wanna laugh there was just no background to any of them the love relationship seemed to have been added on to the script it was so awkward theres an army man big black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth with the aaarrrghim the man attitude such a pathetic bad guy the two sidekicks who are supposed to be geniuses are acting like two 16 year old frat boys and then to create some action they decide to drop a rock on somebodys shoulder and for the rest of the movie hes coughing as if he was dying of a pneumonia or somethingand then plays hero cheesiest scene of all to help the plan which is to do who knows what its never a good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud in the middle of the dramatic scenein a nutshell dont waste your time
