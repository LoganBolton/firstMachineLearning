this movies script is indistinguishable from others most notably the core another bad movie its pretty clear why luke perry doesnt get much work but to see the beloved lt commander worf michael dorn resigned to something like this is just sadbr br i really cant think of one plot twist that isnt seen coming a mile away thats not an exaggerationbr br special effects are very poor even by tv standards the lava flow at the beginning of the movie signaling the coming global disaster starts things off at a very amateurish level and it gets no better from that point on
