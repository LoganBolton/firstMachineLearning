usual awful movie ill not bother you about the synopsis just put together the core armageddon an evilplanner military officer and one or two solveall nukes and youll have the movie if i can call it that way br br seriously nukes in this kind of movies are more useful than swiss army knives br br the big one is approaching nuke some places and its over a tornado wants to destroy insert important city name here nuke insert another important city here a volcano is erupting nuke it a nuke is near to go off nuke it coffee is cold nuke it you didnt like transformers nuke yourself but i cant assure this will fix thingsbr br in the end how many more movies like this can be made before they start copying one another i doubt there are still many things to blow up with a nuke
