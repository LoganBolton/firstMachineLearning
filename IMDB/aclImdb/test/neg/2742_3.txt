this was pretty inevitable this movie borrows from the core and from the film it borrowed from armageddon and the films it borrowed from and so on except this time theres luke perry too this films version of the familiar savetheworld plot involves superearthquakes beginning in the pacific northwest and extending too the whole ring of fire its soon determined that everybody on earth just might be doomed so the military and some scientists build one of those hightech drilling machines to go inside the earth and fix things it just wouldnt be as much fun if they didnt have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet theres even a line the tries to make the journey into the earth sound more impressive than the journey into space like the one in armageddon its a scifi network movie so the script is paint by numbers disaster movie there is infighting between scientists and military guys there are rockmelting lasers people die and sacrifice themselves for the good of all and above all there are weak cgi special effects not original and not all that entertaining this is a movie to watch when you have nothing to do particularly if youve got beer
