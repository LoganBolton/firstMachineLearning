i admit to a secret admiration of the original love thy neighbour tv shows  mostly because they exhibit the kind of exuberant brashness and bad taste synonymous with so many programmes of their era  but id be lying through my teeth very uncomfortable position if i pretended that this bigscreen spinoff is anything other than an abomination the opening scenes of wanton vandalism are not only pointless but baffling as well  its never explained why the film opens with a tracking shot of people trashing each others houses  and nothing improves from there by the time the film unearths the oldest joke in the book  the horrible dragon of a motherinlaw turns up unexpectedly to stay  is followed by the crashingly obvious revelation that shes developing a soft spot for the black neighbours father moving her bigoted son to ever greater depths of selfrighteous ignorant rage most discerning viewers will have switched off take that as a warning unless youre keen on cheapskate spinoffs with terrible acting static direction and the overall comic flair of a burning orphanage
