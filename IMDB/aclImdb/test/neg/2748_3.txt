before i had seen this film i had heard some negative comments about it however when watching it i found myself thinking ok its a little slowpaced but this is quite interesting as it built toward the end it created a complex moral dilemma leading to a shocking yet within the context of the film entirely believable decision with extremely powerful dramatic consequences if this had been followed through it would have been a tremendously powerful ending and would have given me a very favourable impression of the filmbr br however due to an ending which not only cops out emotionally tacking on an unnecessary happyish ending without real emotional credibility but also within the context of the film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for you clearly see one of the character take an action which should end her life but inexplicably doesnt incidentally please tell me if i did miss something here and there is a reason why she survives as i just couldnt how logically she could have and this wrecked the whole film for mebr br this said all three leads put in powerful performances although kevin mckidds characters transformation by the end goes a little further than is fully convincing and it does create a very powerful ethical trianglebr br this film is recommended if you ready yourself to walk out when the mother and the sister are lying on the bed but do not watch further than this unless you have only a pinch but several mountains of salt
