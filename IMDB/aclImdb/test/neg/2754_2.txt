make no mistake about high school bigshot is a bad moviebr br high school bigshot is about a geek who makes a plan to become rich and get the girl however he goes about it all wrong and of course by the end of the movie ends up dead along with a few other people thankfully including the girlbr br the moral of the story is all women care about is wealth also for us men i guess were just supposed to accept we either have it or we dont have it br br i could easily see how this movie could be rated a 1 however it is above that of the very worst of movies the actings not totally horrible and production values arent ultraterrible over all its a bad movie and not worth viewing for many reasons if you insist of course at torturing yourself watch the mst version br br 210 maybe a 1510
