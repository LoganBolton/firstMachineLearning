this movie reminded me a lot of a song by the dead kennedys called straight as however unlike this film the hero of the dks song turns to suicide youll wish this bozo had resorted to killing himself instead of doing the crime he did the whole thing was convoluted and in the beginning you sympathize with the hero of the film then he quickly betrays your sympathies the long sequences of just showing the heros face while he delivers a monologue drag the film down quite a bit avoid this if possible
