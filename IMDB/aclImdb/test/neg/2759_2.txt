times i look back to high school and it amazes me that i never went lower than marvin did in this bad filmbr br poor marv is the main character whos bad luck just gets worse and worse despite his intelligence he manages to get bullied exploited supports his lousy deadbeat dad and plenty more goofups including a daring heist which lets say doesnt go fully to plan of course the viewer feels no empathy with anyone in this film so all this disastrous gloom bounces off like harmless zeta rays recommended for those days youre feeling down pop this film in and youll smile and say im so glad im not marv
