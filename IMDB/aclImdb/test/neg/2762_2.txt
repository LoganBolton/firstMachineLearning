a good cast a good idea but turns out it is flawed as hypnosis is not allowed as evidence in courts so many good actors and they are all acting so badly so why did they all get attracted to this mess and yes it has its good points such as lighting etc but ultimately i wondered two things how could so much talent lead to such a bizarre mess what is that accent that nigel hawthorne is putting on he iswas a great actor and so what is that accent all about it is impossible to identify what was he trying to do maybe it is his subtle indication as if to say to us ive got involved with a turkey so heres a crap accent to go with it
