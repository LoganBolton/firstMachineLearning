someone should teach the people who made this movie that there is a difference between presenting multiple twists and screwing the audience over they even use hypnosis as a tool to cover up the plot holes whenever they cant find their way into or out of a scene they just say she is regressing to her past now or shes snapping out of it now and they think that explains everything this movie is a dishonest cheat and in the last 20 minutes becomes a fullblown fiasco 12
