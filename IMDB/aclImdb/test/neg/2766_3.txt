the film begins with a little girl rita seeing her father killed he apparently was a criminal who squealed on his fellow crooks later and this part makes little sense the girl has grown to adulthood and still her fathers past haunts her a bit later rita meets a goodfornothing and dates him during one of their dates hes a bit intoxicated and driving like a total fool the cops give chase and he speeds awaykilling a pedestrian in the meantime here comes the really stupid part he convinces her to confess to the crime as he assures her his lawyers can get her off scotfree why oh why would she agree to this yet she does and spends the next couple years in prison and soon after her conviction this boyfriend disappearsshowing that hes a total heel what a chump later after her release her friend jack la rue informs her about the truth about the boyfriend then he explains the boyfriends family is loaded and she should shake them down for lots of cash for all the trouble he put her to by taking the rap frankly this does make senseas they certainly owe it to herespecially since they knew shed go to prison and had every intention of using her and then casting her asidebr br now the idea of bleeding money from the rich chumps is a good plot idea however there is no way this would have occurred in the first place because its hard to believe anyone could be so stupid as to take the rap for a hitandrun in an interesting twist the dumb lady decides on a life of crimedonning a wig and picking up a rich guytaking him into the desert and robbing him at gunpoint wowhow shes changed apparently she loves the idea of stealing from phoniesie rich hypocrites however and this made no sense she soon stopped doing this and began shaking down the father of the old boyfriendwhy she bothered to do some petty robberies in the meantime made little sense and what also was a bit hard to believe was that instead of wanting money from the old jerk she was interested in getting him to put his influence behind a mobcontrolled man for mayor oddvery very oddbr br in the meantime another plot develops involving a young alan ladd hes an undercover agent who has infiltrated the mob he was chosen because he just happens to be a dead ringer for a real crookwhat a clich√© but what makes no sense is that this real crook isnt in jail and is out committing crimes while the fake one is infiltrating the mob in another townbr br eventually evidence that ladd is able to uncover is enough to issue warrants to the mob kingpinsincluding rita this is a case of very bad timing as in the interim shes made a decision to become a decent and legitimate woman as shes met a really nice guy who she wants to marry wowwhat are the odds overall this is a goofy and rather dumb movie that suffers from kitchen sink syndromein other words there is way too many plot elements and weird twists to make the movie the least bit believable plus since the movie is only a little over an hour long it all seems very forced and contrived its a relatively bad bmovie from crapstudio prc of note only for the performance of alan ladd just before he gained great fame the following year at paramountbr br by the way this dvd was released by alpha videoa company which sometimes releases some wonderfully obscure titles mostly public domain but which never cleans up the prints or adds closed captions in other words the dvd production values are strictly 3rdrateat best
