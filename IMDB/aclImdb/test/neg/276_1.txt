man i loved oceans 11br br smart movie all eleven characters were crucial to the heist as each had their own specialised skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finalebr br what on earth was oceans 12 what was the purpose of the twelfth person i assume its supposed to be zetajones but she wasnt really a part of the 11 as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film it was more like the story of brad and zetajones characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the moviebr br with o11 the gang were always a step ahead of benedict garcia they were always able to outsmart him what happened here he catches up with them after a tipoff and suddenly theyre all wusses the whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back benedict for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier so next movie theyre going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist puhleasebr br this movie could have been achieved with just brad pitt zetajones and 5 mins of matt damon for the switcheroo scenebr br slow moving movie not the energy of the first one i tried hard to like it and im usually very easy to please but im really disappointedbr br spoiler the twist  the whole movie didnt need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past 2 hoursbr br end spoilerbr br wait until it comes on tv or if youre a fan of the original from 2001 please dont watch this
