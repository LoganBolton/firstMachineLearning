this obviously was a pretty low budget production but the cast was pretty decent the basic premise had promise and something more could have been done with it but the script wasnt that great the plot is incoherent and seems almost random at times and the dialog is stilted and terriblebr br basically a girls father gets whacked by fellow gangsters and later she becomes a robber and wants to avenge his death and then it goes into a mob protection racket involving corrupt politiciansbr br alan ladd gets top billing but he really plays a very minor rolebr br i have to say i found it mildly entertaining in its archaic bgrade hokiness but it really is shoddy and pathetic
