what i liked best about this flick was the chance to see joan woodbury who awestruck me as one of the several beauties in the charles boyer classic algiers in a leading role she does well as rita an orphan who rises to make good as a lady crime boss her ascent to the top reminds me of joan crawfords characters eg mildred pierce who realize their ambitions by fierce determination and willpower if youre looking for a film noir classic better look elsewhere at several points its difficult to know where this story is going i first got the impression that it was going to encompass ritas plot for revenge against the father and son who tricked her into taking the rap for a drunk driving death perpetrated by the playboy son but payback time ended up being only a minor point and a springboard to the somewhat confusing second part of the film where rita becomes increasingly involved in city corruption anyway its only 72 minutes so a second viewing should clear up any haziness my copy is from a platinum box set called mobster movies the picture quality is good but the soundtrack sucks constantly skipping fragments of dialog there are eight films in the 550 box making each movie a fair 69 cents look for anne archers father john archer as ritas childhood friend bob alan ladd doesnt get much screen time its definitely joan woodburys picture
