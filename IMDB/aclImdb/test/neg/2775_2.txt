this is a cheapo movie made by al adamsona man who was perhaps the worst film maker evereven possibly worse than ed wood jr adamson specialized in extremely low budget horror and skin films during the 60s 70s and 80s and with such titles as five bloody graves hells bloody devils satans sadists and lash of lust its obvious he wasnt making shakespeare his movies all had rotten production values sensations gore and amateur actingbr br here in brain of blood several stock adamson actors such as his wife regina carrol zandor vorkov and angelo rossitto are along for the ride and had appeared in adamsons previous film dracula versus frankenstein this is fortunate because the prior movie was so terrible and so poorly executed on every level that brain of blood cant help but look good sure the makeup is laughable the plot dumb it involves the ubiquitous brain transplant scheme and acting is level z but its still better than their last film br br about the only positive things about this film are that aging supporting actor midget angelo rossitto actually had a better than usual partwith more dialog and a more important role in the plotand there is actually some sense of danger and tension at times as for ms carrol she still looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast limp through this silly flick however its bad enough that it makes for good watching by bad movie fansyouve just gotta see makeup on the guy with acid burns as well as the ray gun that appears to be made out of an old tail light
