i was watching this movie and getting increasingly bored with the silly plot that was going nowhere when suddenly the story takes a surreal turn for the worse and has an actor playing herself oh how i guffawed because its sooooo funny isnt it we know julia roberts is playing the character of tess and here they are in the film cracking the joke that the character of tess looks a bit like julia roberts so julia plays someone impersonating julia how well she does this well never know because 99999 of the audience dont actually know julia roberts personally and reading about her in hello magazine doesnt count br br and then bruce willis turns up apparently hes julia roberts best friend well he is in the film how would i know whether or not bruce willis and julia roberts even know each other im not in the least bit interested in the personal lives of actors  i just pay my money and expect them to do the job theyre paid to do anyway they start cracking jokes about the plot twist in the film where willis rather unconvincingly plays a psychiatrist the one with the little kid in it you know the one i dont ive forgotten what its called willis even drops in a comment about how well that film did at the box office  how modest of you mr willisbr br the problem is that not only are these scenes pointless and horribly horribly selfindulgent it also remind us the viewers that were simply watching a bunch of actors strutting around and getting paid vast sums of money for very little effort you see when i see a movie i want to suspend disbelief and forget that im watching actors  i want to believe in the story im watching when you start pulling the scenery down mid movie you simply ruin the illusion for mebr br you know that a tv series has jumped the shark when it starts introducing celebrities playing themselves stand up and be counted the simpsons friends etc but this is the first time ive seen a movie jump the shark i usually stay away from movies like that eg scary movie the naked gun etc the trouble is i honestly never thought the oceans 11 films would go in this direction what a shamebr br so with suspension of disbelief thrown out the window and the plot now languishing in the movie then cracks the most wicked joke of all on the audience  the heist actually happened way back in the story and the final 90 minutes or so of the film was pointless posturing yes thats right steven soderwhatsit and his actor friends all get up point at us the audience and say ha haaa youve all been had thanks for your money then they give us the single fingered salutebr br well right back at you i didnt actually pay to see this movie i downloaded the dvd for nothing how dya like them apples now thats a plot twist
