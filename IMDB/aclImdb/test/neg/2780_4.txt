dark harvest is a very low budget production made by a bunch of rank amateurs which manages to come off as a kind of semiprofessional movie unfortunately the poor effects wooden acting and unoriginal story makes this a very mediocre horror slasher at best by no means is dark harvest the worst horror movie ive ever seen it just isnt anything special and has nothing in it to warrant a second watch or hope for a sequel you know a director has doubts about their own horror film when a there is some pointless nudity and b the movies so short they add some rather boring outtakes at the end credits that nobody really cares about because the movie wasnt that good a slightly better movie which i cant help feeling was the inspiration for dark harvest is the eighties movie scarecrows which is an ok movie but still pretty averagebr br dark harvest isnt as bad as some of the other comments say it is but dont think that you will be entertained much either one thing i also have to comment on is the character of angela who has a really terrible english accent what was the point in that to maybe give it a certain touch of class yeah right english people do not say waahtaah when they mean to say water and i dont care what part of england they are from if you cant find a genuine english actress or a nonenglish actress who can put on a brilliant english accent not many of them about then dont bother sheesh final score 410
