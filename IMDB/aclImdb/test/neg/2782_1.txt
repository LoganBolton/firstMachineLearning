i knew full well when i rented this dvd that it could very well be one of the worst movies ive seen in my life but to say that it was one of the worst movies ive ever viewed would be putting it lightly im wondering if there isnt some legal action that can be taken against the individuals that allowed this film to produced i mean the financing had to come from somewhere someone had to put up money for this to be producedbr br id pinpoint several production values that led to the failure of this film but this film violated every production standard in the universe i couldnt make it thru the entire movie as i started getting dizzy the from horrendous filming techniques i also cant tell you how many scenes i just ended zoning off during because of the inexplicably horrific dialogbr br i feel like ive been permanently scarred for life if you viewed this movie before getting this warning you should think about starting a support group with me for the poor people who did view this monstrosity
