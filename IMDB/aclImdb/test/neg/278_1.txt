this was the biggest disappointment of a movie sucks cos i was really looking forward to itbr br all the twists were crap they were all flashbacks br br what makes a good heist movie is the believability of the the job yes it has to be surprising so the audience is stunned but if you walk away and go thats bullst whats the point br br plus the main heist was a bag snatch anyway you didnt get to see the team operating at its full deceptive and brilliant potential there was not even one good heist in this movie they were all rubbish including that french idiots break dancing crap to get through the lasers its easy to do that when they are composited in afterwards plus that kind of stuff has already been done in at least one other movie and it was stupid then as wellbr br also theres no reason to have even half of the 12 or 11 in this movie what difference do half of the cast really make to the outcome of this movie half the scenes dont even need to be there br br the first one was classy this was cheap and it makes the whole team loose credibility especially ocean himself for bowing down the bennett
