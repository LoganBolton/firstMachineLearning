bad script check awful effects check horrible actors check lame direction checkbr br after seeing the dvd box at blockbuster video and being a fan of the horror genre i placed my 428 on the line and rented this film my girlfriend was out of town and i was bored so on a late tuesday night i decided this would be a perfect time for me to watch what appeared to be based on the box cover art a horror movie what i got instead was the worst film ever made up until that point i had always declared slumber party massacre 3 the worst film ever madebr br if you are the type that wants to see a movie because you heard how bad it is this is for you if you dont want to lose 400 and 80 irreplaceable minutes of your life steer clear of this garbagebr br an added note i noticed a few of the actors come on here and post comments on the bulletin board how can you brag about being in this film you were all horrible i mean really bad if there was an american idol for actors you all would be laughed at in the first few episodesbr br peacebr br sutter cain
