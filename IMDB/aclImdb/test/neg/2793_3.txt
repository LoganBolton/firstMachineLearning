okay im sorry to the cast and crew for this review but this movie is by far the worst ive seen yetfirst off the acting was okay it could of been better especially in some parts but it was okay then there was the cheapest video camera which they used the violence was pretty good if it were paced faster it would be awesome but they didnt sighscares the scares were well written in the script but not well done for instancespoiler here in the loft a girl is half way in it and the other half is in the dark bottom area of the barn house then she gets it the monster yanks her down and then you hear someones guts getting ripped out the scares could have been better if the music wasnt ripped from a cheap horror sounds cd the blood effects were pretty good but the blood was like that of kill bill kb pulled it off because it was meant to resemble old kungfu movies but when the crew cant tell the difference between red and pinkits sad the ripped up bodies in the movie were good but the scarecrow costumes were something you would see for 25 bucks at a halloween store dont let the cover fool you the costumes suck my overall grade is a 310 if you are interested in independent movies are easily satisfied or just have 3 bucks burning a hole in your pocket go to blockbuster and see the horror of failure
