now i am going to do this without putting spoilers if i can my cousin and i were renting movies the other weekend and we stumbled across this with the big freaking scarecrow on the cover it looked cool so we rented it alongside kungfu hustlebr br wow just wowbr br to start off the movie was horrible now the box art opening scenes and music was decenttowell done but the movie itself is horrendous the acting is subpar sean the lead shows hardly any emotion andor effort in his character the scarecrows look nothing like the one on the cover false advertising perhaps and the camera shots and angles were that of a bad wrestling eventbr br and trust me im a wrestling fan i know bad camera angles and honestly this is right up there with gigli and pootie tang its done so bad that it amuses me it makes me laugh so somehow this movie takes its place as a good comedy to mebr br but to be fair it does serve as a what to do and what not to do in movies especially of the slasher genre i recommend that people do watch this just to get a good grasp of what to avoid
