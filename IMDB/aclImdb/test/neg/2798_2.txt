dark harvest is about a group of friends that go to a farmit belongs to one of the friends relatives or something for a getaway but there are killer scarecrows lurking therethere was something about a curse in there too but i forgot what that was aboutbr br the acting in this movie is awful i dont know what the director was thinking when he was casting actors and actresses the script is the same story as the acting awfulthis statement coming up is very obvious but if there was better acting and a better script this could have turned out okaybr br the directing stunk too i see no potential in this guys future after all these negatives this movie still maintains a fun factor that bumps it up to a two the last plus is they dont use cgi my overall thoughts on this film are its bad real bad but so bad its fun so it gets a 210
