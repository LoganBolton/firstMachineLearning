i was in blockbuster and i saw a film called dark harvest the cover art looked great the plot wasnt that bad and the tagline you reap what you sow made the movie look pretty good but i was dumb that day because i did something i should have never done i rented a straight to video independent horror film walking out with my much better rentals i went home popped dark harvest in the dvd player and it began i figured i would watch the trailer after the film was done bad idea but went ahead and watched it anyway now to the reviewpossible spoilers first off the acting by the kids sucks and the scene when the 2 main characters are talking the lighting sucks and the buildings even look fake now they go to this house where sean connels i think hes the main character i dont care relatives lived there all of a sudden one by one they all start getting killed bygasp a killer scarecrow ahhh the scarecrow is obviously the definition of low budget and the scenes where the scarecrow is computerized looks so fake its hilarious it makes dinosaur noises and everything and then at the endthey shoot the scarecrow with a gun that is red for gods sake and looks like it was purchased at a local family dollar and it pauses for a while and thengasp blows upbr br save yourself some time im telling you this movie sucks if you need to pass an hour and a half look at the wall because looking at the wall is a fun compared to this disaster it is quite funny thoughbr br overall grade f if there was anything lower f than i would give it that
