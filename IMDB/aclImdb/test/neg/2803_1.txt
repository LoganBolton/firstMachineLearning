rent this only movie if youre in the mood for laughs for sheer stupidity  as this movie wouldnt scare a bunch of kindergartners at a halloween party the trouble is there is too much gore for kiddies so definitely dont put this in your vcr for the toddlers it starts off with a little bit of promise giving you the impression that the box cover artist may have actually started watching this film before designing the cover but then descends quickly into epic stupidity the killer scarecrows are clumsy oafs that are about as scary as the one in the wizard of oz but not quite as smart if theyd only had a brain i got this movie for 120 at a local discountcloseout store and even so i feel somewhat ripped off i think with all the other comments posted here if you actually pay to see this you can only blame yourself
