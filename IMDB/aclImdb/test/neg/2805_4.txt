ive expected a comedy about the nva but this is a parody it shows the national army of eastern germany in a light that is not appropriate and definitely not truebr br one can make a comedy about everything as long as the underlying facts are not changed even a comedy about the german kz is possible as roberto benigni with life is beautiful has shownbr br the movie nva would be an ok comedy because the jokes in it are overall ok nothing special  not hilarious but enough to live with itbr br the point is that the movie makes a farce and a parody about the nva a death machine that was ready to attack western europe along with its friend the red army an institution that used everything to get the utmost from its soldiers an army that marched into the cspr in 1968 and was ready to march also in poland to destroy the solidarnosc you cant make a movie without showing the tiniest bit of evil or would you make a parody about a kzguantanamo or 911 showing osama bin laden as a funny screwed guy 90 minutes about a funny osama in a afghan taliban camp where he makes jokes and is training his soldiers would be comparable to what this movie is doing about the nva
