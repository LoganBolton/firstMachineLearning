i didnt expect too much from this movie but i was still disappointed its supposed to be a comedy but there are only four or five scenes where i actually laughed and i think thats rather poor there is no real plot either i always had the feeling that most of the scenes could have been put anywhere in the movie because theres no connection between them but the worst thing was the acting of kim franke he has one facial expression during the whole movie as if he was supposed to play some retarded guy but i believe thats not the case all in all i rate it four out of ten ive seen worse movies than this but i wouldnt spend money on this one again
