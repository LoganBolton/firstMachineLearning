reports of this films brilliance appear to have been greatly exaggerated and unless the other reviewers were watching a different movie i fail to see how anyone can find this film anything other than dull unscary uncreepy overlong and at times unbearably irritating im not some schlocky horror fanatic i love jhorrors and eurohorrors over american horrors any day but i feel the need to warn any potential viewers about this film before they invest two hours of their life in itbr br it could have been so great a reporter is investigating a series of bizarre deaths and occurrences which seem ostensibly unlinked but a series of unnerving tropes appears to connect them  dead pigeons thudding noises the presence of strangely tied knots our reporter goes from person to person interviewing them filming them and then passing on three important characters are among this jumble of people a young shy psychic girl an immensely irritating insane psychic man and a crazy old woman and her boy whose importance is not revealed until later onbr br the problem is that the film is not even remotely interesting which makes its two hour running time unforgivable its also not even remotely scary or creepy supposedly scary scenes like shots of ghoulish faces are done incredibly poorly shown twice or worse we are told when they are about to happen other techniques such as telling us that a family just interviewed died five days later simply dont make me care let alone mildly creepedbr br the film does pick up a bit towards the end as our reporter cameraman psychic and cursed woman go to a village in order to remove the curse which is linking all these deaths however by that time i was in a state of catatonic boredom and couldnt care less so all the fairly creepy camerawork and shocks were wasted on me the final tape is quite good but once again id given up caring and just wanted this film to endbr br boring and dull not scary and not creepy i would advise you keep away from noroi it has promising moments but this is a film that was poorly made and not worth your time
