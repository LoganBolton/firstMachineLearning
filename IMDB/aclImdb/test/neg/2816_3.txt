while i was watching this movie i never thought id be defending it its honest enough from the begininning about not having much of a plot theres no real characters to latch onto except the killer some of the acting can be better but most of it is capablebr br i know a three out of ten isnt stellar but there are reviews saying it was shot poorly and completely useless etc i think it set out to do what its supposed to fairly well the lighting is minimal at times more natural than most audiences are used to but its supposed top look like a camcorder snuff film in fact at times the quality is probably still too high to be true to that but nobody would make it through tne minutes of camera work thats truly that badbr br its not particularly scary but it is disturbing at times there are one or two characters who dont come across as believable at all and the soundtrack does get tiring at times but overall it was put together cleaner than a lot of camcorder movies
