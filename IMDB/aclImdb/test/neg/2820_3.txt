im a big fan of sleaze and horror movies when you put them together thats my sweet spot horrible sleaze youre not going to get it in this film thoughbr br there is certainly sleaze in the form of girls being kidnapped and tortured tied naked to various things the sleaze isnt very sleazy though it didnt register very high on my sleaze meter mainly because none of the girls were in the least attractive nor did they attempt to act as if they were even threatened they seemed to be thinking more about what was for lunch or maybe when they could score some crackbr br forget the effects they were lame in the extreme the lameness was contributed to by the bad acting effects are harder to believe when even the actors and actresses arent buying into thembr br cinematography was pretty bad they could have hired a couple cameramen from a porn movie and done better in fact that might have raised the sleaze factor enough to make it enjoyable as it is there are a lot of dark shots where you cant see very clearly and what you can see isnt looking too goodbr br the horror factor is nil null zero nada zip zilch ive seen kids movies that were more frightening theres no camp here either its just a movie that attempts to be shockingly sleazy but doesnt even come close
