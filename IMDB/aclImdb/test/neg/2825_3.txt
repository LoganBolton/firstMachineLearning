well the film starts good but after half an hour it becomes boring and stupid when all the plot is about karens that was the name of the girl right pregnancybr br the end of the movie its really corny and the characters really dumbbr br i dont know who is more stupid if the girl because she came back with her old boyfriend or the boy for the way he was used for herbr br anyway my conclusion is this definitely not the best eighties comedy just another movie like many others with nothing special they could do it better but they ruined it if only the plot had take another way but they keep that pregnancy stuff and they definitely ruined so final conclusion i dont like
