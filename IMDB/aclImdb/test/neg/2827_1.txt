ya know i have no idea how everybody elses teenage life was but this does not reflect the folks i knew and hung around with let alone myself and just in case if youre wonderingnowe werent pristineclean cutpat boone type teens if there was ever such a thingbr br look im not saying being a teenager is easy the better well actually the best teen movie of this time is fast times at ridgemont high now those kids i knew and were as realistic as it got back then and maybe nowbr br this was crap this was a low rent version of fast times and even then it didnt do much for me it had a few moments but not enough for me to recommend this or even claim this is how it was for teens back in 1982 i couldnt relate the lead girl girls did nothing for me and please if they really wanted to keep their virginity they would have in which case this film would not have been made pure crap and a bad staple to be left behind as a timecapsule cinema for teensyoung adults in the early 80s
