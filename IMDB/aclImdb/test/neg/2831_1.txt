first of all this is one of the worst softcore straight to cable erotic thriller ive ever seen in my life of course like all erotic thrillers are want to do its about a brothel madam and is set in a brothel this of course makes the softcore simulated sex that pops up every other 10 minutes seem in context whateverbr br forget for one moment that this was never meant to win any awards the actors are terrible and their line reading made me cringe the woman who plays the female cop is so bad its beyond description she must be a really really good friend of the guys who put up the movie for this terrible adventure if you know what i meanbr br the production values are only slightly higher than porn other than that i suppose if youre really drunk and you need something to laugh at this would be a perfect film and if thats the case i recommend fast forwarding to all the scenes with the female cop whats that accent brooklyn hilarious
