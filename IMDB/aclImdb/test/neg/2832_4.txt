as a big fan of brian yuzna and the majority of the movies hes been involved in i guessed id enjoy progeny i didnt although in ways it has its moments however if youre expecting something of the calibre of society or beyond reanimator you could be in for a shock in a way this is similar to society being a tale of a seemingly ordinary world with a horrific supernatural underbellybut thats where it endsbr br im not covering for yuzna when i say that the fault doesnt really lie with him as bad direction is bad direction but the direction is sound what trips the movie up is both script and acting stuart gordon reanimator dagon has written an intelligent script but one that doesnt really work with yuznas style of direction leaving him paused on actors delivering lengthy dialogue when really he wants to throw that camera around and get down with his bad self this matter makes the movie awkward enough as it is but theres worsebr br if the movie had been made with great actors the movie would have probably held its own unfortunately this is very far from the case the acting is wooden shockingly so even for a lowbudget b feature the inexplicably successful and renowned arnold vosloo wrecks every damn line with near pinpoint precision handing in one of the worst performances ive seen in a long while the man manages to turn every line of well considered dialogue into the kind of hamline youll be throwing drunkenly at mates next time youre in the pub hey bob good god am i going mad whatscome over me noooo in fact i may try that one myself next weekend the last minute addition of genre veteran and personal favourite brad dourif instead of enriching the film like it should almost seems to hand dourif the movie in a last ditch effort to stop vosloo from hamming but quite frankly dourif looks deeply uncomfortable possibly waiting for the next assault of bad acting next to vosloo and even an eccentric turn from him fails to resuscitate the filmbr br if the acting was better this movie would have been okay hell it might have been pretty enjoyable but the lack of character makes the movie a soulless affair and makes the horror element seem tacked on and tasteless instead of an organic part of the film i found the alien torturerape scenes a little difficult to stomach already but the fact that the characters were so lacking made them seem gratuitous as well as unpleasant leaving a nasty taste in the mouthbr br so if you really like scifi and dont have a problem with bad acting pedestrian pacing and a really garish nasty rape scene progeny will probably be your cup of tea but since i do im probably never going to watch it again once was enough on the plus side this is the only scifi movie yuzna ever bothered to make so he obviously wasnt really that pleased with it himself
