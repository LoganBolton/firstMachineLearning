i love brian yuznas other work even cruder stuff like necronomicon but progeny was too much even for me my chief complaint is that its needlessly exploitative of jillian mcwhirters nudity im no prude but these nude scenes just drag on and on and on only to culminate virtually every time in a tawdry wink nudge insinuation of sexual violence the scene where she attempts a coat hanger abortion after several minutes of naked screaming is a prime example arnold vosloos performance is utterly turgid but even jeffrey coombs couldnt save this festering heap of a film the aliens are boring the uniformly dull lighting saps your interest and the plot is absolutely predictable the only highlights for me were an alltoobrief glimpse of the aliens true form very nice model and the scene where vosloo finds his wife in the closet was ok too but youve been warned
