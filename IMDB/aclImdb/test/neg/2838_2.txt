now let me see if i have this correct a lunatic serial killer is going around murdering estate agentsokaywhats wrong with that scenario i can live with thatbr br what next a slasher with tax inspectors butchered traffic wardens sliced to death are we supposed to feel any sympathy for empty headed and shallow money obsessed property people ernobr br sadly joking aside its just not a very well made film with poor acting and crude effects the climatic scene is particularly silly you can almost see the director shouting action to the stuntman as he falls through the glass of the windowbr br as another reviewer quite rightly said after starring in the fog this was the nadir of adrienne barbeaus career therefore i was happy to see that she had rekindled it by becoming the voice of catwoman in the batman animated series while watching the extras on the live action catwoman film nb not quite the awful film its made out to be by the waybr br this however is a bad film think a poor episode of kojak or streets of san francisco and you will get an idea of what is on offer here
