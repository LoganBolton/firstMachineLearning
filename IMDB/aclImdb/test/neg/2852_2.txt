this is probable one of the worst movies i have ever seenbr br the only reason i gave it 2 stars out of 10 is the appearance of the gorgeous lydie denier in some of the scenesdespite her 42 years she is an amazing woman in every aspecther nude scene in the bathroom with armand assante is as hot as hellbr br anyway about the moviewell nothing really interesting to saya neonazi and a turkish gang fight over berlin in scenes that include people open firing on the street in daylight and inside a club where 3040 people fire at each other with machine guns in a place no bigger than my house and amazingly after some hours of firing just three die and ten are injured lolbr br while the gangs fight over berlin terittories a serial killer is killing young children and then dumps them painted white on various places around townbr br armand assante appears as the turkish detective who although now working for the police was an ex leader for the turkish gang and now is up to solve the serial killer crimesbr br the movie is obviously a very bad rip off of the classic m moviethe killing of the childrenthe involvement of the underworldthe character of the serial killer and the ending scene with the trial of the serial killer are more than influenced from this classic moviebr br the acting is terriblethe script just stupidthe production of the lowest standards possible and in general this was a great waste of time and moneybr br dont even bother renting this one
