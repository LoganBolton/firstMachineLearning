before watching this film at a screening attended by the director herself we were informed this had won the short film prize at the galway film fleadh surely this result will give filmmakers hope anyone can do better than thisbr br how anyone cannot notice the flagrant ripoff of donnie darko in this ill never know the film is pure drivel the acting cardboard the dialogue ridiculous  the ending just flat the only crumb of comfort we enjoyed after seeing this rubbish was to loudly comment on how dreadful it was in front of the director yes that was mean but liberatingbr br at least irish filmmaking cant sink any lower
