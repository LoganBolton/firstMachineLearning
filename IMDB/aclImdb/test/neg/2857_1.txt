i have never seen a b movie like this one on the part that the nanny sofia is being killed a hand of a woman appears on the tape handling the stick how bad is that lol i seriously laughed and wanted to stop seeing the movie but i kept watching it to see if this movie could get worselolit is bad for itself poor pinocchio the only nice bit is the first time you see some special effects of pinocchios face moving apart from that the whole movie is awful its not really worth your time if you dont really have much to spare but if you have nothing to do go on treat yourself with some z movie cos bmovie is still too good for this onelol
