pinocchios revenge is not a good movie nor is it terriblebr br the acting was wooden at least on pinocchios partthe puppet had all of 2 expressionsas did most of the actorsexcept strangely enoughthe secondary charactersmost of them were enjoyable over the topbr br the special effects in this are pretty b and as i said earlier the puppet really blewbr br the 2 best scenes in the movie are the knife through the handlooked pretty goodi think they spent about a 13 of the budget on thatand the shower scenewowi think they must have spent the other 23rds of the budget on talking the actress who did that scene to do itoutstandingbr br seriously this is a slightly below average b horror puppet movierent chucky if you have a urge to see puppets killbr br the story had a few interesting ideas enough to keep me watching it to the end
