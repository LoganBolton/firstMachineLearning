when i first heard about this movie i eagerly went out to rent it believing mistakenly that it was one of those sobaditsfun movies and that i was in for a treat i was wrongbr br for starters the pace is agonizingly mindnumbingly slow the pace doesnt even begin to pick up until the last 1520 minutes of the movie the plot was boring and the ending was nonsensical and confusing for those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills look elsewhere this movie provides the cheesiness in spades but is sorely lacking in thrills cheap or otherwisebr br try childs play instead
