i bought this movie hoping that it would be another great killer toy movie i am a big fan of the childs play series and was hoping to see the same here boy was i wrong most of the movie was not the least bit scary plus the only time we really see pinocchio alive is the final few scenes of the film the little girl in the film her acting is so bad its almost laughable plus the ending never showed what happened to the puppet or what made them put the little girl in a asylum or wherever she was at the end of the film so in my opinion this movie is the worst of the killer toy genre if you want a good killer toy series stick with the childs play franchise pinocchios revenge is a waste of money and time
