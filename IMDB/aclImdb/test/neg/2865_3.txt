i have really enjoyed several movies by g√©rard depardieu and expected id like this movie a lot more than i did the biggest reason was that i just didnt find the movie very interesting or funnyso it didnt hold my interest also although he does not sleep with his headstrong daughter the idea that she is lying by telling everyone that he is her much older lover is just plain icky yes i know there is no incest and i know that nobody around them knows he really is her father but i found that any kid passing her dad off as her sexual paramour is too yucky and prevents the movie from truly being funny in addition i really didnt like this little brat very much apart from her lies she seemed very sassy and selfinvolved i would have preferred if somehow shed gotten her comeuppance and somehow been punished as i just didnt like her
