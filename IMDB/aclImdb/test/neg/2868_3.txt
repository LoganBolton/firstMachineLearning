ive just watched fingersmith and im stunned to see the 810 average rating for the showbr br not only was the plot was difficult to follow but it seems character development was randomly appliedbr br the actors were adequate but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional once this happens the story really falls flat and becomes tediousbr br and just in case anyone didnt see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the filmbr br the end scene is disappointing and phoned in and anyone who sat back and went ohhh so they were carpet munchers all along must have been out for the eveningbr br two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy none for the rest of it
