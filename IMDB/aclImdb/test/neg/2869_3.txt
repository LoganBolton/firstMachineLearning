i like cky and viva la bam so i couldnt resist this when i saw it for £199 in gamestation it is bam mageras debut scripted film penned by himself and brandon dicimaillo and stars the entire cky crew ryan dunn raab himself rake yohn jenn rivell don vito etc etc brandon also is in charge of the artistic direction  which is one of the films greatest merits  its quite ckyish in its colour style  but also shows progressionbr br basically it follows very loosely ryan dunns break up with girlfriend glauren played by jenn vilo played by bam named after vilo valo by any chance and falcone bran play his best mates who reek havoc by doing various stuntsbr br its a bit like the cky films but with a linear storyline which is very basic indeed and poor acting its strange the usually super charsmatic gang seem to have the life sucked out of them when they know what their meant to say nextbr br the acting and script is pretty appalling for the most part but the second half of the film is much better than the first 90 mins is a stretch for the flick though and there are a number of redeeming factors such as tony hawks cameo dicimaillos sub plots such as the futurstic invention awards and the diamond bike the soundtrack is also very strong its not all cky and him  in fact bomfunk mcs steal the film in terms of its use of music in the second half of the film the sense of fun is much more real  especially since don vito has a fairly prominent role in the latter part  and he seems to steal every scene he is inbr br the film will appeal to those who like the cky antics but only because of the core material and not the filler or story line bullshit oh and will someone tell bam that skating montages especially in films is sooo 1998br br however the best part of the package on the dvd is not the film  but the 40 mins making of docbr br the last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with raab himselfs alcholism and the crews real feelings towards each other amazing candidly as usual bam comes across as a bit of a dick especially towards raabs drink problem and ryan dunn comes across as a really nice down to earth guy the last ten mins of the documentary deal with a friend who is an infrequent cky member trying to kick heroin whilst staying at the magera household with the crew  and a caring unitary side of gang espcially ape and ryan really comes across  a startling gem in an otherwise dull dvdbr br for £199 im very satisified  although i hope bam stays to the improvised and short skits from now on
