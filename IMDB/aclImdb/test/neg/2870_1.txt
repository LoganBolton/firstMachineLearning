i kind of like bam margera so i was curious br br but watching a home production with somebody elses friends and family with a decent camera and a sound guy just isnt good filmmaking br br writing direction acting and editing is abysmal at best but i sat through half of it and whybr br this film gives perfect examples of what not to do it is a film students dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process cram it into film school curiculums all over the jointbr br so thanx bam now i know jackass is for real  cause you aint looking to win an oscar dude
