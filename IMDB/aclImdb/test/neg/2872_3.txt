this movie was really bad it has that quality that a lot of indie movies have moments of humor filled with long spaces that are completely boring any diehard bam magera fan will prolly like this movie but then again thats probably the only person who would see it someone gave me this movie to watch knowing i am a fan of jackass and was a fan of viva la bam before the scripted nature of that show wore thin to explain why this movie doesnt work i should just say the premise itself is played outbr br a guy who is with a girl who is horrible to him and pretty much the whole movie youve got this ryan dunn guy whining and bam magera skipping around like a merry mischief maker dicamillos performance is strange at best its a humorous little nonspecific canadian french accent that pretty much is the extent of his performance basically funny for 5 minutes and then its like ok youre pretending to be foreign enough alreadybr br maybe it would work if they were going for parody but all they succeed in doing is making a movie with an iq of zero i love toilet humor as much as the next guy but this isnt even lowbrow its just stupid its like the only humor to be gotten from this movie is completely inside and the audience even those savvy to magera and company are left out of the jokebr br next time magera is handed a sack full of money lets hope he doesnt blow it on some lousy pet project
