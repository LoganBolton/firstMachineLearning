to me bollywood movies are not generally up to much though they are still quite desired and bollywood is a big file maker as they have their own fansbr br the only motive that made me watch the movie was to see to what extent an american actress could change or affect the logic that indian movie were based on not only did not it change the movie story also this blending caused some ridiculous series of eventsbr br i mean it is quite common to see heaps of illogical things through indian movies as they have their own world in their movies but once you see such incidents happen to an american it makes you laugh for gods sake can you believe a famous american actress is stuck in desperate situation and feel impotent can you imagine an american actress falls in loves with a dance instructor whose fiancée already fell in love with americans boy friend and they met each other at the same time there were lot of similar things to mention the less said the betterbr br perhaps i was wrong as i expected too much from indian movies
