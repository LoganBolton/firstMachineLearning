i do not fail to recognize hanekes aboveaverage filmmaking skills for example i appreciate his lingering on unremarkablenaturaldaylighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism however regarding the content of this film i am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize dominationsubmission relations or feelings andor bdsm practices the problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by walter i dont mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way which is understandable i mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy or as if he was a monk come on i mean ds is not something new in the world and i think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something freakish or pathological it isnt in general films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the timesbr br so for me i feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories isnt it nearly embarrassing and that does not really relate with reallife lives and experiences of those engaged in ds relationships personal experience forums irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this
