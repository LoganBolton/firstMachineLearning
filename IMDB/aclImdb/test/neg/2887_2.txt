yet again not quite bad enough to make it enjoyable in fact this one is just boring its reasonably well made even though the script is bad the effects are ok and the acting average apart from james mason who is always great but in this one underusedbr br i suppose it is hard to write anything about this film because it didnt evoke any reaction in me what so everbr br dull dull dull dull dull
