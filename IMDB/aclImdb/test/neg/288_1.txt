question how does a film merit two different titles like the librarians and strike force br br answer the film is sooooooooo bad that the filmmakers couldnt even decide on a title br br this film is a hodgepodge of martial arts death wishvendettas melodrama romance and other clich√© film techniques the story focuses on a vigilante group called the librarians led by agent simon william forsythe the group is hot in pursuit of a nefarious multilingual pockmarked creature named marcos andrew divoff who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of south florida br br burt reynolds appears as a cameo in this film and his scene is entirely extraneous to the action burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest drawls i have ever heard this may have been burts attempt at an irish dialect but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of marlon brando in the godfather br br also appearing in this film is erika eleniak who has infiltrated the inner circle of marcos bizarre world erikas character kickboxes her way into an alliance with simon the librarians and erika will become a powerful strike force against evil in a film that has been delivered directly from the editing room to your cable tv converter box
