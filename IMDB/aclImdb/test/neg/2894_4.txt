this is a very dull film with poorly developed characters subplots that go nowhere and barely tolerable acting it comes across as a poorly conceived ripoff of 2001br br the only thing making it worthwhile are the sets and costumes and visual effects but even that wasnt enough to keep me from nodding off i would like to get the soundtrack especially the music during the space flight sequence for nights when i have trouble falling asleep
