im also a sf buff among other genres and i especially like those films from 60s and 70s with their ideas over effects premise that produced so many intelligent and likable stories put on screen in a nutshell i completely agree with scott886s review of this movie i heard of this film and being what i previously mentioned a 60s and 70s sf buff with a penchant for sf stories with touch of the twilight zone i expected a lot and my expectations were heightened with reviews ranking the effects of this movie second best to kubricks 2001 space odyssey what a fraud journey to the far side of the sun was ordinary convoluted half baked silly looking film with laughable amateur special effects and remember i love films from that era and despise cgi and it can be fully compared more to 60s sf disasters such as marooned which journey very much reminded me of the idea behind it all is not that bad but building the plot on a story of a twin planet to earth on which the same world is inverted asked for a master like kubrick to direct needles to say robert parish is nothing like that so he delivered boring and silly movie that looked and felt like a matin√©e tv series of those days not worth wasting your time on even if you are an absolute fan of the genre
