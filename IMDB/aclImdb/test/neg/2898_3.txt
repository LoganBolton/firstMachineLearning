ninja iii is not quite as bad as enter the ninja the first part of this trilogy but its still a very bad movie it will hardly please the fans of martialarts movies because there isnt enough action but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by laughable excesses and needless violence as if the film wasnt already weak enough the filmmakers turn parts of it into an idiotic the exorcist ripoff the only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the dominated heroine she is a beautiful and athletic woman which the director doesnt forget to exploit in various sleazy ways  she just happens to be an aerobics teacher i dont mind a little softcore exploitation but it must not pretend to be something else
