you know after the first few chuck norris movies i got so i could tell that a movie was produced by golanglobus even if i tuned in in the middle without ever looking at the credits or the title whats more i could tell it was golanglobus within a minute of screen time something about the story structure the goofy relationships between the characters the mannered dialog the wooden acting spiked with the occasional outright terrible performance the scene tempos and rhythms that made albert pyun look like john mctiernan the paperthin plots and notreadyforprimetime fight choreographygolanglobus has been incredibly consistent over the years in style subject matter and pointofviewbr br what can you say it must work for them since theyve produced literally dozens of movies you go to one of their productions and you know exactly what youre getting and it aint brain food folksbr br ninja 3 is another piece of hackwork in a long line of products from the gg sausage factory and offers the typical limited pleasures to the moviegoers palate youve got a bad ninja slicing up cops and criminals and anyone else who gets in their way youve got a good ninja pledged to stop him youve got a westerner thrown into the mix so we americans can identify with him or her in this case and be reassured that we can still beat those pesky orientals at their own game youve got a love interest who is usually also the worst actorress in the film fencing with the hero youve got your endless string of assaults assassinations and lingering shots of men gurgling in agony while an arrow or throwing star sticks unconvincingly out of their eye neck or chest youve got your beefy white guybodyguards in suits calling a ninja a son of a btch and throwing a roundhouse punch only to get his ss handed to him youve got a final confrontation between the good guy and the bad guy which goes on for 20 minutes and just sort of stops like a roadrunner cartoon instead of reaching a climax or a resolutionbr br ninja 3 is a little different in that the plot revolves around a scrappy female athletic type getting possessed by the bad ninja so she ends up killing a lot of the cops and criminals and beefy white bodyguards in suits while under his spell but all the other elements are there as formal in their way as a kabuki play or a noh dramabr br i actually thought lucinda dickey was pretty likable in this film shes nicely muscled and curvy has great cheekbones and some athletic ooomph to her movements and you can actually suspend belief enough to accept that her character could do some of the feats she pulls off in the movie she can almost but not quite carry this thing one extra start for her participation and good energybr br naturally sho kusugi is in here and he pretty much dominates the last 1015 minutes of the movie and just to show you how 3rdrate and uninspired gg movies are the director and editor intercut the last climactic fight between kosugi and the bad ninja scene with numerous reaction shots of dickey and her boyfriend watching the life and death battle with an expression of mild bemusement im seriousfor all the emotion and reaction they show to the proceedings they could be looking at a sea turtle in an aquarium at marineland i can only imagine how dickey must have felt when she saw the finished product  she probably wanted to run the editor through with a katana for real because those reaction shots make her look like a complete idiot br br an enjoyable waste of timebut it definitely is a waste of time maybe if you are a sho kusugi fan or even a linda dickey fan youd find it worth your while
