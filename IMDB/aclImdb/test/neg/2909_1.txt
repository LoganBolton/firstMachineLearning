and i may be being generous the overwhelming majority of the movie consists of looped footagethe shambling monster two women exercising the shambling monster again a bunch of people in the pool the shambling monster again none the worse for wear despite having been injuredyou get the picture i restrained myself from yelling get on with it already on several occasionsbr br and it doesnt help that the footage they used was poorly produced the sound is disconcertingly out of sync with the image and in the one scene where they tried to get artistic with the lighting and camera techniques the lighting guy holding the flashlight that provides the scenes only illumination is clearly visible in the shotbr br my hope is that the production was the victim of some horrible disaster in which the original audio track and most of the footage was destroyed but they decided to release it anyways cobbled together from the editing room floor in memory of the heroic crew members who gave their lives trying to save the real film  the one with the plot and the interesting dialog sadly theres no evidence of this and im forced to conclude that in the immortal words of joel and the bots they just didnt carebr br
