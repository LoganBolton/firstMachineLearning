as stated by others this is a ludicrously horrible movie not a film it is not bad in a funny way just painful to try to endure dont waste your timebr br erika eleniak is pretty hot but there is one scene where she is in a bathtub and you can see the wrap covering her breasts under the bubbles also shes getting fatbr br the fight scenes are so bad as to be unwatchable if you know or care anything about martial arts or even decent choreography and the editingeffects are abysmalbr br there is no payoff it goes nowhere and sucks getting there
