id have little to add to bowlofsoul23s bullseye comment here but as the first brazilian born raised and living in rio de janeiro in a neighborhood just a few miles away from the favela of vigário geral depicted in the film to comment on usfinanced favela rising here on imdb i get mixed feelings on the one hand its good that the dire situation of brazilian favelas are getting more attention from filmmakers and the media both from brazil and abroad since local governments seem to have given up a long time ago one the other hand its incredibly frustrating that favela rising turns out to be such a missed opportunity for enlightening nonbrazilian audiences on the issue because firsttime directors jeff zimbalist and matt mochary who are from the us and understandably neophytes on the matter turn the biography of afroreggae group leader anderson sá into a glamorous canonization in this superficial onesided underresearched and misleading documentary good intentions muddled results favela rising looks like a tvad is shallow as a primetime tv interview and biased as a promotional videobr br favela rising feels uncomfortably phony for a brazilian viewer and not only because of its hype visual treatment of a bleak reality and its misplaced feelgood happy ending city of god is an obvious reference here with cog actors leandro firmino and jonathan haagensen cameoing for no apparent reason other than hype favela rising is allegedly a documentary about the afroreggae group and its leader anderson sá but beware when you see the scenes shot in favelas overlooking the beautiful rio shore line you might as well be warned that vigário geral the home of afroreggae and anderson is located in an area of rio far away from any beach strange choice of location to say the leastbr br favela rising is probably confusing for nonbrazilians who wont know many of the interviewees and the film wont tell them either and will have to wait for the closing credits to find out that many of the songs on the soundtrack are not by the afroreggae band though youll get suspicious when you start to hear pink martini of all people they wont know either that important issues were simply left unmentioned why does the film push the notion that afroreggae is a oneman project why not acknowledge the many partners who supply it with substantial financial and logistic support like rios city council private brazilian corporations multinational recording companies and international ngos without which afroreggae might not even subsist why not state clearly that vigário geral is still plagued by violent drug wars and that its dwellers still live in constant fear of attacks by traffickers and cops why not state clearly that many of the archive footage clips showing police violence and corruption did not take place in vigário geral how and why did the kid richard murilo finally join afroreggae why on freaking earth wasnt he interviewed once again at the end of the filmbr br as for anderson himself the film leaves a lot of loose ends for the viewer whats the story about anderson having two mothers is the baby he holds in his arms his son why is he inspired by shiva is he a buddhist why does a candomblé woman appear on the beach when the films mentions andersons miraculous recovery from the accident is he a candomblé follower why not let him explain the contradiction of starting a group that fights drugs and simultaneously praises bob marley if afroreggae is also a pridebuilding movement for black people from favelas why are the girls in the afroreggae band limited to bootybouncing routines no you wont get any answers to these questions eitherbr br instead the filmmakers are interested in turning anderson sá into a composite mix of popstar malcolm x gandhi and christ check out that last image of the statue of christ the redeemer atop corcovado hill immediately after showing anderson miraculously walking after his surgery and thats the worst thing the filmmakers could do to anderson and his cause turn him into a special chosen one by the time they show his surgery scar youre ready to believe its a mark from god br br because whats remarkable about anderson  whos the most ordinary guy you could ever meet  is that he helped change his environment not by being special but by copying and adapting winning projects like the olodum movement in bahia among others to his own community with strong support by friends artists intellectuals politicians businessmen and the media if youre not fluent in portuguese you probably wont notice that anderson isnt particularly bright or articulate unlike his sharply witty partner josé junior as much as he isnt particularly talented as a singer lyricist or musician yet his ordinariness might have been the films true inspirational core to show that anyone with idealism perseverance and steady support can in fact contribute significantly to his or her community no need to be jesus incarnate because what really matters is the movement  afroreggae  not the guy see havent we had enough of personality cult br br by the end of favela rising you probably wont know much more about rios favelas than you did when you walked in  youll just have seen what some of them look like
