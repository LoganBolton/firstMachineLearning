remember those old kung fu movies we used to watch on friday and saturday late nights when our babysitters thought we were in charge well this movie plays exactly like one of those movies patsy kensits biggest claim to fame was the love interest to mel gibsons character in lethal weapon 2 and this performance was one of the reasons why shes never made it big shes a terrible actressbr br in lethal weapon 2 i thought she was cute cute enough to check out some of the other movies shed been in including loves music loves to dance another big let down which i obviously was not impressed with either but as attractive as she is to my eyes my soul screamed at me to turn it off because she played another cheap predictable role and done it very badlybr br in this movie kensit stars as a comedienne and not a good one either whos working the clubs of france couldnt cut it in her own homeland so shes making their ears bleed whos down on her luck but even worse the french government wants to throw her out because of an expired visa or maybe they just caught her act but she gets married to this casanova freiss who is just as down on his luck and the predictability beginsterribly is there any way to give this movie a negative rating 1 out of 10 stars is over rating it
