possible spoiler alert though theres not much to spoil about this film i saw project a part ii not having seen the first movie i dont think i missed much project a part two is not only the worst jackie chan film ive seen to date yes worse than fantasy mission force this film is one of the most unwatchable films the world has ever seen its right up there with plan 9 from outer space on the sleep inducing scale the plot is twisted up and knotted like a 50 foot ball of yarn the cats been playing with and finally left for dead the humor if you could call it that seems to have been written by an annoying high school freshman who despite how many people tell him hes not funny is determined to get his lame humor out no matter how painful a movie is made and this movie is painfully bad the plot involves jackie chan as a navy officer recruited by the police force to round up all known criminals he rounds them up in the first half hour of the movie and i prayed for a quick ending which i didnt get why the movie bothers to progress from this point i havent a clue the movie drags on and on and on with no purpose no plot and attempts at humor that fail so miserably they make carrot top look like a comedic genius the kung fu in this movie is lame and forgettable theres better kung fu in that movie about the 3 ninja kids project a part ii is neither an action movie nor a kung fu movie it is however a complete waste of the talents of jackie chan and maggie cheung who have made films worlds superior to this as jackie chan repeatedly escapes certain death i enter blair witch mode asking and wishing is he going to die now so the movie can end  an example of how ludicrous this movie is jackie chan is handcuffed to another man a gang of pirates that look nothing like pirates throw axes at jackie does jackie grab one of the wayward axes and break the chain on the handcuffs no you see that would spoil the hilarious gag of him being handcuffed to another person if you have a friend who laughs at everything i encourage you to watch this movie with him or her and watch as even they wont get a chuckle out of this film if youre an insomniac this movie is sure to put you to sleep do not operate heavy machinery while watching plan a part ii possible side effects include headache retinal strain and death by boredom 09 stars
