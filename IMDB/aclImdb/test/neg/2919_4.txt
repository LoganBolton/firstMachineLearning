while this isnt an all time classic comedy it is a pretty good little movie to watch if you catch it on a rainy saturday morning with not a lot else going on right thenbr br harold lloyd plays ezekiel cobb an american coming home after growing up in china where his dad was a missionaryhe has come home from china to find an american wife and plans to return to china to continue his fathers workcobb unwittingly is recruited to run for mayor of his corrupt home town when the existing political machine that controls the town realizes that he would make a perfect patsy to run against the current mayor who also is the head of the towns underworldthey figure the bumbling stumbling cobb has no chance to win and therefore the current mayor continues to run the town and run his schemes which makes them all richbr br lloyd isnt doing the physical comedy here like he did in his silent filmshe does a convincing portrayal of cobb with a reserved understated dignitythe acting was good from all involved and the story and script were also quite goodbr br being made in 1934 the film does have some rather racist language when talking about the chinese and it also has a typical black character from that era but these stereotypes arent nearly as mean as ive seen from other films from that timebr br although not close to being lloyds best film this movie does entertain and lloyd is very good as cobbyou wont be blown away by this film but it may be enough to peak your interest in lloyd and make you want to see more of his work
