ive just been at the cinema in down town prague watching this film br br not due to the poster i found very holywood oldfashioned heroicbr br style not due to the high level starring which remind me that mostbr br of those high starring french films are usually pathetic but justbr br because there are not so many films in my french mother tongue in abr br city like prague and because i love adjani depardieu and rappenausbr br cyrano then i decided to write up this small comment because i thinkbr br i really dont agree with the comment main stream on this film on imdbbr br i was not disappointed the film just look like the poster thebr br characters are just as stupid as they look like for a while ibr br thought adjani would be like a caricature  just a funny characterbr br you can laugh at no she is not for example when she decides to tellbr br depardieu she is the one who murdered the fat one she killed at thebr br beginning of the film then come the violins in a big fat patheticbr br music which should make you cry and realize adajanis character is abr br deeper person as she looks like maybe this was humor at the 10thbr br level but i am sorry my sense of humor is not that high if i want tobr br see some funny french film on the wwii i watch once again la grandebr br vadrouille it is definitively more fun i have also read on imdbbr br that lemoine is making a great performance in this film i have tobr br say i have never seen a so bad acting well i have never seen any edbr br woods film nevertheless the film is good filmed with a lot of goodbr br very costly scenes like the one with the pantheon in the morningbr br when the german army arrives at paris or when the refugees settle downbr br on a bridge in bordeaux i think rappeneau is a good filmmaker butbr br that he does better with a good script it was easy with cyrano hebr br had not to write the dialogsbr br i give 110
