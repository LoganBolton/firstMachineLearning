recap simon leads a little team of special agents that has specialized in finding and returning missing people against all possible odds their latest mission is about the granddaughter of a friend of them she seems to have been caught in the web of a particularly brutal criminal and everyone that has gone looking for her has gone missing but now the librarians are on the casebr br comments this is pure baction through and through the key phrase for this is unlimited supply there is unlimited supply of ammunition they dont have to reload once there is an unlimited supply of bad guys so the heroes have something to shoot at there is an unlimited supply of breasts many of them bare in an vain and as always failed attempt to distract from the plot holes and there is an unlimited supply of bad acting it is almost like erika eleniaks performance shines in this what about that and actors that dont seem to care more than the paycheck and why should they when no one else seem tobr br and as in most baction movies there are an unlimited supply of bad gunfights but these almost seem to be of a ridiculously bad kind i think i saw more realistic gunfights when i played cowboy as a kidbr br but then again i didnt really expect much either how could i from a action movie named the librarians and it actually delivers about what could be expected 90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes to connect the dots between but i am unsure if i can call it entertaining it didnt keep my interest very longbr br 310
