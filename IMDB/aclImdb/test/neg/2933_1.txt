maybe i expected too much of this film but at the very least a comedy should be funny and this one has very few amusing moments it manages to be insulting to homosexuals heterosexuals women the obese and probably several other groups as well the scene at graduation where everyone claims to be gay is one of the most distasteful i have ever seenbr br tom selleck and matt dillon are ridiculously miscast and kevin kline seems bemused most of the timebr br other reviewers compare the film to will and grace but at least will and grace is funny
