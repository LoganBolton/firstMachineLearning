well where to start describing this celluloid debacle you already know the big fat nada passing as a plot so lets jut point out that this is so pc its offensive hard to believe that frank oz the same guy that gave us laugh riots like little shop of horrors and bowfinger made this unfunny messbr br so this guy doesnt know hes gay till this actor points it out ok sure if anyone ever says im gay ill know the truth even if i currently like girls more than george luca likes a dollarbr br and how to know the true nature of my sexuality well if i like classic litterature dancing and barbra streisand im gay if i dress like a blind man in a hurry with half my shirt hanging out im straight oh surebr br and heres the big cliché of clichés no matter how you look theres always a very attractive hollywood actor wholl adore every bit of grease under your skin or a top model wholl love your zero iq your buttugly face and your pointingout ears if all those gay common places werent enough to get me angry this did in real world looks matter folks and i know for surebr br i see it coming now youll say relax its a comedy dont take it so seriously if being a comedy gives anything carte blanche to suck out loud i think the world has a serious problem wouldnt be much better and funnier to make a movie to denegate those old tiresome clichés instead of magnifying them over and over againbr br so one of the absolutely worst movies ive ever seen 1 out of 10 if giving this rating has something to do with my sexual tendence please let me know im interested
