stay the hell away from this one no really im serious  i know you might think this is a fun campy cheesy hong kong action style b movie i did but trust me its not in fact the only thing accurate about that description would be the words hong kong and then only used in a strictly geographical sensebr br yes donnie yen has codirected it jackie chan has a cameo the guy ekin cheng from storm riders plays the lead it got vampires it should be good  or at least fun charming and action packed once again  its notbr br i could digress on why this movie sucks  i could dissect it hack it to tiny shivering pieces but where to start theres so much to hatebr br to make it easier and to give this hatefest some credability let me say that im usually a big fan of hog kong cinema the heavier drama stuff as well as the more lighthearted action andor comedythe really good movies as well as the really cheesy ones i can sit through hours of bad subtitling jokes lame enough to make first graders roll their eyes i can handle lovers as chaste and celibate as a convention of nuns that and pretty much anything else the average film goer would bang their metaphorical toes against on their way between action sequences also hong kong or any other origin  i love it when a movie goes from just being bad to bad enough to be goodbr br but this  arrgh its just horrible stupid unwatchable garbage so far from being funny or charming its actually painful so derived of action it makes a bergman movie look like the texas chainsaw massacrebr br why why waste such an opportunity this could have been so much fun
