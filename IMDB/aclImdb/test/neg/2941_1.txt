i saw this movie in blockbuster and thought it might be a good sunday evening movie when there is nothing else to do so i bought it used 3 dvds for 25 although it was cheap my money would have been better spent on a nail to drive through my footbr br the film started out nicely kinda dark and mysterious i was always enthralled with vampire and samurai movies as a kid i thought the combo would be really cool the first fight scene was pretty cool i was excited for the rest of the movie then the movie took a serious nose divebr br i understand that this was a big hit in the east i guess because of the twins i dont see it though this movie aside from the first 10 minutes was absolutely horrible so many movies in this genre have the potential to be great and blow it terribly this is just another casualtybr br jacki chans role in this film doesnt make any sense at all whyyyyyyyy complete silliness he probably made a few bucks off it thoughbr br the only cool thing in this movie are the swords they use nice ideabr br i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone
