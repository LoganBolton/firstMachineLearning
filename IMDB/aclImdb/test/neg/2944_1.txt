to identify this movie as a vampire movie would be technically correct simply because it will suck the life right out of youbr br vampire effect is an insult to moviebuffs everywhere the plot is almost nonexistent the makeup is just plain awful and the acting is just not therebr br i have to wonder if jackie chan owed someone a huge favor to be convinced to appear in this filmbr br my wife picked up the movie at the rental store because it had a picture of jackie chan on the front as though he was playing the lead and thought that a good jc flick would be fun to watch this movie was interesting to watch in the same way that you cant help staring at the car wreck when you drive by you realize very quickly the movie isnt going to get any better but you keep watching wonder just how bad it will get
