the most famous thing about this movie is that this was the first time garbo talked in a motion picture aside from that milestone if you want to call it that this is a movie that doesnt go beyond creaky melodrama with garbo trying her best not to fall asleepbr br the plot involves greta garbo returning to her father after 15 years abroad her father who is a captain on a barge is happy to see her even though shes acting a bit cagey she soon falls in love with a grizzled seaman who also notices that something a barrier if you will is holding her backbr br anyways the two fellows dont particularly like each other and soon come to blows over garbo when she diffuses the situation by revealing her big secret which is no surprise to us if youve read the video box damn you mgm garbo is nothing but arms in this movie she acts and acts flailing her arms about and gets grating quickly the two male leads are alright probably the best performance comes from the classic silent actress marie dressler who plays the drunken captains even drunker girlfriend what a performance its too bad the tagline couldnt have read dressler talks
