mild spoiler in the second paragraphbr br anna christie was garbos lackluster 1st talkie she and dressler look like the only people who know what theyre doing in this movie the old guy who plays garbos dad george f marion in the film is soooo ahnoying all he does is stumble around drunkenly in a totally fake way and yell about dat old dahveel sea he blames garbos past his whole life and everything on the sea he comes across as stupid x 10 charles bickford is matt the rough n tumble sailor garbo falls in love with and hes fine in his role but nothing really outstandingbr br the best part is when garbo unleashes her terrible secret on bickford and her dad finally marion stops talking about the evil of the sea and beats his head and fists on the table in perfect time with bickford then soon he goes on a tirade about the seabr br i had to practically force myself to finish anna christie its too melodramatic in many parts and creaky there are many good early talkies but this is not one of them if you havent seen garbo before try something else before anna christie like camille or grand hotel
