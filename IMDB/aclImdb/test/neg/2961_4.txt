i have seen shallow grave years ago and that was one of those movies i kept in memory for a very long time it was intense from beginning to end and with plenty of sudden twists but all of these made sensebr br i cant tell the same about dead bodies above the title is a subtitle that claims it to be even better than shallow grave this is a big liebr br dead bodies looses strength and gets far less convincing during the moviebr br two supporting characters for example turn out to be a whole lot less innocent than they first appeared to be that could work as a surprise but it didnt surprise me i could see it coming minutes before and that is a big difference with shallow gravebr br another thing i have to mention is that characters in this movie often respond not very realistic they behave like that more often when the movie gets to its endbr br i would have found it far more interesting if some of the characters would have stayed completely innocent not knowing what is going on it would have been better for the contrast with for example tommy and his friend who have to carry a huge secret with thembr br but no for some stupid reason the makers of this movie decided that all characters should show their darkest sides it does not work in a movie like thisbr br the end felt much like an open end it left me with an unsatisfied feeling i expected a whole lot more of itbr br at first i would have given this movie six stars because it is not entirely a bad movie i liked watching it most of the timebr br but occasionally i saw some really poor acting and unrealistic scenes and because of the disappointing open end i stick to four stars this time and because it turned out to be a mistake that i have spend my time and money to it unlike shallow grave i will probably forget dead bodies very soon it is just not such a special moviebr br the makers could have done a far better job with this movie it is a shame that they did not
