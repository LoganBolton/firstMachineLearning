this was on tv last night i painfully forced my way through it and barely made it through first of all except for leroy hilary and possibly coco none of the other students we are supposed to care about have any discernible talent its like hspa had no standards just sign on the dotted line and youre in br br the story lines were grating and obvious doris was just impossibly awful the gay guy was such a thrown away clich√© funny how that school had only one gay guy right i liked the leroy character but calling your teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent leroy packing lisa looks like shed rather be anywhere else and since she wasnt any talent i wonder why they kept her br br i would have rated this one star awful but the music wasnt that bad and i did like the premise it just would have worked much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent
