fame did something odd it was not only a musical that was created originally for the screen most are based off of broadway musicals but it spawned a tv series and a broadway musical let me correct that sentence fame is not a musical musicals have song numbers in order to advance the plot or to show characters feelings the singing in this music is not used to do either in fact theres no use for it at all people just randomly sing to fit in with the plot and thats not the type of musical i knowbr br the socalled plot of fame has an onslaught of characters who are all introduced at oncelast time i saw that in a movie gosford park it had disastrous results who audition for and get into new york high school for the performing arts all of them are in for different reasonsie acting singing etc quoteunquote drama unfolds as these middleaged people pretending to be teenagers go through their four yearsbr br my largest complaint is that the high school is supposed to be selective after all its a free college and they cant let everyone in so how is it that some people who are really bad get into the college obviously so that drama could ensue between all of these different people and why is the person top billed not even in the movie until near the end for no reason at all except to make us feel uncomfortable theres many unsettling situations that these untalented people get into yet you cant feel bad for them because you dont know who they are these relationships occur between people whose names you dont know and these characters realize things about themselves throughout the course of the movie yet you dont realize that because you dont know what they were like in the first placebr br as for the singing it pops in randomly and is supposed to be humorous and does nothing when the title song is sung its played in the middle of a street and before you can say ferris bueller everyones in the middle of the street dancing wildly and offbeat to it the song itself is fine but the whole scene like the whole movie is unnecessary fame is an unpleasant movie to say the least i would say more but most of the movie has thankfully gone out of my head just dont see it youll be doing yourself a favorbr br my rating 210br br rated r for language
