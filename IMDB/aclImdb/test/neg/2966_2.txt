no matter what youve heard fame is not a good movie its not worth the investment of over two hours to watch stereotypically troubled teens dancing singing learning and staring at girls in the dressing roomsbr br every clich√© finds a cozy little home in this movie theres a gay teenager looking for acceptance that would have been great if it had been treated as anything more than a secondary plot point theres a ghetto kid who has too much attitude what was i surprised and guess what they all want to become big stars finding fame and fortune and theyd all be willing to crawl over their own mothers smoking corpses to get itbr br oddly enough this film is remembered for its music but in actuality the only moderately good song is hot lunch jam which is still too cheesy to be of any real quality the two most popular songs are nothing either fame is meaningless fluff drowned out by the sheer spectacle of a massive dancinginthestreets scene and i sing the body electric what in bubbas name does that even mean is just an incomprehensible jokebr br bad acting tasteless dialog and hack direction it is after all from the director of evita are only marginally helped by michael seresins appropriately ordinary camera work but cinematography alone cannot carry a movie especially one as uninspiring and pointless as this
