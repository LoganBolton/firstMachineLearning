there were very few good moments in this film only a couple of characters were fleshed out and not that well there were plot holes big enough to drive a truck through the pace creeped along like an old man there were many moments that the film never came back to like coco stripping what happened to her how about garcis sister is she better now what about leroy we learned absolutely nothing about him what about the electronic piano guy how about the rich girl that got an abortion what happened to her that was an interesting subplotbr br overall this is not a good movie and i recommend another musical that was in this film lets do the time warp again
