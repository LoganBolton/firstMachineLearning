i just have to say that this was the third worst movie i have ever seen right after the attack of the murder tomatos 3 and starship troopers 2 it wasnt just dialogs or the paper walls or even the guns shots which just automagically disappeared with no holes in the walls it was the horrible acting no wonder that i have never seen these actors before they all probably slept with the directors i think iam being nice to this movie now but that is only because iam to tired from screaming at the movie just saw it my advice is to buy as many dvds of this movie as you possibly can and burn it so no one ever can see this horrible waste of time money and film ever again
