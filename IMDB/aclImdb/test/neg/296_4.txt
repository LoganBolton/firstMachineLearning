ive been hearing a lot of this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in south east asia over the last three years  apparently its on the thresh hold of mutating into something very contagious and millions upon millions of people are going to be wiped out in a global pandemic  just thought id mention this in case you havent got round to writing your will yet br br id also thought id mention it since i was watching something called carriers tonight which wasnt about naval warfare but opens with a scene thats a cross between outbreak and an episode of the x files i saw many years ago  i thought id be watching something with added resonance after hearing the stories about the danger posed by bird flu but after the not unimpressive opening carriers descends into a cheap and cheerful tvm and like every other tvm youll see the lead characters are female  one of which is a ballsy authority figure while the other lead female is a mother of young children  it goes without saying theres a sick child subplot too br br what is irritating about the tvm format is that it overwhelms the potential of what could have been quite a good film if it was made for cinema  theres a fairly gory scene of someone coughing blood all over a nurses face and a very impressive jay walker getting run down stunt but these bits are quickly forgotten as the mood descends into family sentiment since this  and just about every other tvm ever made  was made for an essentially female audience
