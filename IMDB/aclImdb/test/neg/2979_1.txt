this feels like a featurelenght treatment of a comedyroutine that could have also been told in a tenminute short also technical credits are suppar the film really feels like a film school diploma projectbr br the cast is a mix of seasoned stage pros and talented newcomers but the problems is the superficial scrip their lines feel constructed exactly like cued tv show materialbr br the director fails to take his protagonists seriously therefore we are not touched by their problems and conflictsbr br the film has been cleverly marketed and offers a unique selling point but in the end the film disappoints on all levels
