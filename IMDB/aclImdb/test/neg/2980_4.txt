not finding the right words is everybodys problem in this vaudevilletype urban comedy they dont know what to say and they dont know how to say it which is why they embark on the potentially humiliating enterprise of prearranged speed dating unfortunately they all come across as cardboard characters rather than real people the story follows a conventional threeact structure getting to know the sizable cast in their sorry single lives the actual dating circuit and a final stretch of romantic fallout showcasing some of the newfound couples follies because its all so predictable id say that as a narrative shoppen is a failure as a comedy most of the time its too goofy to be really funny thumbs up to kathrin von steinburg she stands out from the soap opera crowd as the aloof independently wealthy miriam great makeup on her too verena wei√üert heavy eye shadow meets skintone lip gloss creating a brooding and bohemian yet girlish effect thumbs up also to stefan zinner as the bavarian love machine and tanja schleiff as the hot nutritionist they bypass the communication challenge by way of the timeless body language of copulation
