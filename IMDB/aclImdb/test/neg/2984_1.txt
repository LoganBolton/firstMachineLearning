just saw this movie yesterday night and i almost cried no it wasnt because it got me utterly petrified no it was absolutely horrendous sometimes you see movies that make you wonder what will become of the human race in the near future  this movie is one of those its as though the writer actors director et al just came together and copied and pasted scenes of their favorite horror flicks zipped it all together and said hey heres satans whip after seeing this movie i could not help but be tormented by the sight of people whom call themselves actors waltzing around like theyre some kind of talented artistic interpreters do not be fooled they suck dont bother wasting your time or money
