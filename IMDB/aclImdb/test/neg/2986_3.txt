this is a little slowmoving for a horror movie but the quality is better than you might expect for a directors only effort on imdb the camera work and lighting were both surprisingly good and the acting  although variable  is better than is often found in indie genre flicksbr br as the lead robert field is rather stiff which is especially unfortunate given that his character claude is the films narrator as well as the centre of its action however it was the entry of christopher brandon despain that i considered the turning point of this film  and not in a good way a twist is introduced in a clumsy fashion and slowmoving becomes drawn out and overly wordybr br on the up side pete barker is consistently entertaining as father william hes the easy standout in what is a fairly ordinary offering while the first half hour caught my interest i ended up feeling quite disappointed in the way things played out
