ive seen comments from turkish people which im not saying this movie is fantastic and accurately portrays turkish life all i have to say is turkey must be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world because in my opinion that is exactly what this movie was to me if i were turkish i think it would have had a greater impact but if youre not from turkey i would advise you not to waste two hours of your life on thisbr br distant seems to lag on forever many scenes are painstakingly long with little or no purpose i dont understand the directors objectives in even including many of the scenes it is pointed out that the director used his own car apartment and friends in making the moviewell guess what it shows it looks low budget the acting is poor if its a cultural thing then so be it i just dont understand the purpose of basing a movie on this story its unbelievably boring
