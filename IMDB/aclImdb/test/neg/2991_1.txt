dont get me wrong i enjoy arthouse movies lowbudget flicks character studies and foreign movies unfortunately i couldnt enjoy this one  glacial pacing complete lack of plot and characters that you cant dislike enough to hate but you cant tolerate enough to likebr br for me distant was like watching the cuttingroom floor footage of a reality show  all of the scenes which were deemed too uninteresting which would normally not make the final cut were the only scenes included a camera in my apartment with two of my friends ambling around for hours does not an interesting movie makebr br distant certainly makes the watcher feel that way  long stretches of no dialogue nearly 10 minutes before the first word is spoken from the credits can be made to work 2001 comes to mind but for me something else compelling needs to happen to draw me inbr br if youre the kind of watcher who can sit through a movie and be content with movie analysis perhaps it will work for you however if youre somebody who chooses to watch movies to relax expand your mind or be entertained you should probably look elsewhere
