this movie is about a depressed and emotionally constricted man has a distant relative move in with him in his apartment in istanbul as time passes their relationship becomes more and more strained until finally he begins yelling at his house guestwho is out of work and doesnt appear all that eager to find work thats most of the movie in fact the problem is that although emotionally constricted and depressed people are very withdrawn and noncommunicative they dont make for a very satisfying movie thats because most of the time he and his roomie just stare into space and say nothing i think all these flat moments could have been shortened to make a 30 minute moviei certainly wouldnt have minded
