i should live this film but i dont it won international awards it is foreign i usually like such films it is slow moving again something i like and it has no gratuitous sex or violence the problem is that it is boring we have two friends from the same village in turkey one successful the other not the unsuccessful one comes to istanbul to stay with the successful in an attempt to get a good job at sea both live lives that are unfulfilling pointless and pettybr br well it isnt the first time this kind of film has been made i didnt see anything new being added to this tired theme there are long takes that are just someone standing and looking at the sea or sitting in a coffee shop or watching tv i do understand that this kind of thing is there to show the emptiness of their loves while it does do that i got the idea in the first 15 min i dont need to be beaten over the head with it for the rest of the two hoursbr br the symbolism is also a bit heavy handed the plate of live minnow type fish with one off the plate and flopping around in its death throws symbols are best when they are not obvious but are there in the background creating a mood just slightly below the viewers awarenessbr br the film is so apathetic that it doesnt even rate a score of 1 so i gave it a 2 to rate a 1 takes a talent at being bad this film didnt have that much energy
