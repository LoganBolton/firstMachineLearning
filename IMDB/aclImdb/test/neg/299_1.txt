hoods doesnt deliver the goods this halfbaked mafia comedy boasts a stellar cast including joe mantegna kevin pollack joe pantoliano jennifer tilly and seymour cassel along with a number of faces familiar to those who watch crime movies but it is truly a misfire if there ever was one writer  director mark malone best known for writing dead of winter for bonnie  clyde director arthur penn has penned up a pedestrian potboiler that has an ailing but vengeful mob boss louie martinelli seymour cassel dispatching his son angelo joe mantegna of house of games to whack carmine dellarosa it seems that a rival mob firebombed one of pops warehouses in the opening scene and martinelli wants payback trouble is that nobody has a clue as to who carmine dellarosa is in any other mob comedy such a complication might be amusing but here is just plain flat angelo and a carload of wiseguys including his best pal rudy kevin pollack of deterrence spend half of the time trying to find out who carmine is neither rudy nor angelo want to perform the hit so they track down a crazy mob hitman charlie joe pantoliano of bad boys to do the dirty deed before they can convince charlie to make the hit they have to locate him and charlies slutty wife mary jennifer tilly of bound reveals that he is locked up in a mental hospital our misfit heroes cruise out to the mental hospital and break charlie out about half of the movie is over before they discover that carmine is a kid in short pants vincent berry who is bland and harmless indeed carmine has the only decent line in the movie as our brainless bunch of heroes wheel away from his house with him in the backseat to take care of business carmine warns them that they need to get him home in time or his father will kill him charlie tries to ice the urchin but he cannot instead he reconnects with his feelings and wants to go back to the mental hospital so he can report the good news to his doctor meanwhile after charlie decides not to shoot carmine the kid gets his paws on the pistol and pops off several aimless rounds angelo and he struggle over the automatic the pistol slips out of their collective hands and hits the ground goes off and blows a hole in rudys chest now keep in mind that rudy never wanted to shoot the kid in the first place and angelo and he argued over the wrongheadedness of the hit so rudy winds up on the ground with a fatal wound while angelo struggles to stop the bleeding talk about a dull death scene angelo is conflicted himself because his father ordered the hit and angelo fears that dad will do him in if he doesnt execute orders there is a flashback subplot about angelos father teaching him how to handle a gun that provides some insight into angelos reluctance to pack a gunbr br there is nothing remotely redeeming about this depressing comedy with a downer of an ending things gets worse and if you last through this 90 minute nonsense youll see what i mean the comedy is largely laughless good actors wallow in sketchy roles that arent even funny perhaps director malone was trying to do another comedy like the gang that couldnt shoot straight if he was he missed by a mile bigbreasted jennifer tilly shows cleavage and snarls through a couple of scenes with mantegna but she doesnt do much of anything else shes the stereotypical slut who doesnt even get naked a paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast otherwise this picture is pathetic from start to finish initially i had hoped that this might be a ransom of red chief knockoff where the kid drives the wiseguys nuts but no such luck here of course the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a kid but its not the kind of a surprise that makes you want to watch it up to its resolutionbr br i actually bought this movie on a canadian dvd labelsevilleand it contains only the most basic special features if you hate previews that give away the plot dont watch the trailer if you ever meet joe mantegna one of your first questions should be why he helped to produce this yawner it is neither hilarious nor dramatic there are no quotable lines and none of the characters stand out as either interesting or sympathetic the seville dvd presents the movie in full frame with no subtitles or closed captioning
