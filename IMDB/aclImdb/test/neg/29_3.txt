like singin in the rain cover girl has a trio of two guys and a girl in cover girl phil silvers genius is the comic relief he corresponds to donald oconnors funny man part in singin in the rain in cover girl gene kellys love interest is rita hayworth and in rain its debbie reynolds thats where the comparison endsbr br whereas singin in the rain is a classic american movie musical cover girl is mediocrity incarnate the story isnt very complicated rusty parker rita hayworth is a dancer in danny macguires lowrent nightclub in brooklyn rusty decides to enter a cover girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher john coudair who made an unsuccessful play for rustys grandmother years ago coudair introduces rusty to broadway producer noel wheaton who makes her into a star danny feels slighted when rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick genius at the last minute with rusty at the altar with noel she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to danny they live happily ever afterbr br gene kelly has the least developed part in the movie all we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with rusty coudair and wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward rusty and phil silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick the most interesting aspect of rita hayworths performance is the scene in which she gets drunk this foreshadows what happened to her in real life anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked hollywood pined away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with fullblown alzheimers during the last years of her lifebr br almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful gene kelly has only one really excellent dance number and thats the scene where he dances with his alter ego earlier the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of make em laugh from singin in the rainbr br the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal a couple of decades later raquel welch had the same problem both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities they wanted to be known as actresses and not pinup girls unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain
