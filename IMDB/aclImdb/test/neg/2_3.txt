it seems ever since 1982 about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be the next officer and a gentleman there has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claim and this movie is no differentbr br we get the usual ripped off scenes from oaag i want you dor the instructor gives the richard gere character his overdose of drills in hopes hell quit the gere character comes back for the girl the gere character realizes the instructor is great etc and this movie is as predictable as the sun rising in the east and is horribly miscast on top costner plays his usual wise teacher character the only character he can play and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here kutcher is terrible in the richard gere character just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above keanu reevesbr br the main problem with this oaag wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly onedimensional you never care for either in the least and when kutchers character finally turns around just like gere did in oaag you just go so what the movie leaves no plot point unturned and seems to never end as if to say oh wait we forgot to close out the girlfriend story or the what happens after he graduates story or the other six plot points in the movie whats more baffling is the great reviews i see here the general publics opinions never cease to amaze me
