northfork is what is wrong with indie films for all of their hardedged commentary and attacking big subjects studios wont this is the sacrifice we make for nearly two hours i was subjected to the torture and pain of a film that starts by wandering like a blind man in a new place and ends without covering any new ground and thankfully diesbr br there are parallel stories that detail a dying town and a dying boy two men dressed in black one of them james woods must coerce the remaining inhabitants of northfork to leave before a dam opens up and floods the town the other story has a boy returned to the priest nick nolte that gave him to the parents he is dying and is visited i guess by angels among them anthony edwards with bizarre spectacles and daryl hannah in a bizarre costume reminding me of the pirate shirt from seinfeldbr br though this is the plot it is not what the film is about the film is about nothing it does nothing says nothing goes nowhere and has nothing interesting to show perhaps by design more likely an aftereffect of the pretentious surreal david lynch wannabe  were an important artsy film cant you see  style of direction the entire movie is filtered through a gray bleak backdrop that i suppose fits a film about death instead it simply makes the film that much harder to watchbr br if you want to see a film about men in black see either men in black films neither too impressive but compared to northfork they are lifted to citizen kane status if you want to see a film about a boy dying watch lorenzos oil if you want to see a film that has the destruction of a town through water watch o brother where art thou if you want to watch a film better than northfork there are hundreds if you want to watch a film that is worse there are only a handful 0 out of
