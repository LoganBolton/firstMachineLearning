the frustrating thing about a movie like this with a true potential for greatness is that it almost enjoys being heavyhanded we speak of allegory of metaphorbut the truth is theres no getting around the fact that there is absolutely no plot or real characterbr br at a certain point we most know who the people areeven if we never understand where they are going the sheer pretentiousness wore me down every time i tried to grasp a truth in this filmbr br call it beautiful great and awesomei just call it cheating all style and no substance sure its a matter of tastebut i would never take a confusing modernist pastiche of symbols and splashes over the spiritual clarity of jean cocteau or renoir but if it works for you im all for it art is a personal thing i guess
