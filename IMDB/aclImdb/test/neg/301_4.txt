possible spoilersbr br ive read up on dahmer a little and saw the new dahmer film with the same name at an earlier time this movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings too little on dahmer himself the film called dahmer had the opposite problem it was too little about his crimes and too much about himselfbr br i did not find the acting to my satisfaction it had a certain amateur feel too it especially the probation officer it also seemed as if the dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the probation officer actor but i might be wrong about thatbr br what annoyed me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show the real deal about what he did anyway that is ok  but what i then dont understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while dahmer was out getting beer was not depicted being naked since that is also how it happened its not a big deal but it just eats away further on the movies quality that such details are left out what wasnt shown either or not even really hinted was dahmers sexual obsession with the dead again i dont mind they didnt show it but at least they could have mentioned it or built it in to the movie somehowbr br conclusion i think the really good dahmer film is still to be made a movie that incorporates not only dahmers crimes but also who he was and why he did what he did i think that 15 or 2 hours are just not enough to grasp the complexity of it all this movie was just a cutout excuse the pun of dahmers life and personality and does not give you any close to good insight into his life or personalitybr br 410
