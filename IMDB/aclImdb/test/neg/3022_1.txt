4 realz son my game iz mad tite yo i cant wait 2 get on dis show and roll up in da club n do it real 905 style wit mad models n bottles sonbr br no im just kidding this is a sad show created by and for the enjoyment of sad men men who are so neutered by modern existence that they channel their frustration into the clubs where they eke out fleeting selfvalidation preying on chicks in hopes of getting their little wieners touched to try and dull the sting of loneliness and make them feel even if just for one night as though their seat on the board of the sausage party of toronto is a little less permanent br br i read some comments on here saying that this show represents canadian tvs finally stepping up to stand on a par with american tv or somethingorother well thats not aiming short at all its like yes pat yourself on the back canada  youve finally cracked the elusive formula for such groundbreaking american content as studs change of heart elimidate and the fifth wheel see the real brainchild here is tacking meets candid camera onto the pitch genius and theres nothing that straddles that thin line between fratboy camaraderie and latent homosexuality like a group of grown men taping each other on hidden camera admiring each others game up in the club the manlove on display here is so palpable they should really consider rechristening it keys to the steam bathbr br on a side note how interesting that the folks who gave this show such glowing reviews seem to have registered an imdb account for the express purpose of doing so i guess im guilty of employing the same means to do the opposite here my personal favorite is the one enthusiastic reviewer that claims to hail from the united states who gushes that now its clear that the talent in canada has the ability to produce american quality television br br smooth br br but why even bother manufacturing online buzz you cant really get cancelled after all  youre on the comedy network in canada baby the viewing public will go on ignoring your show for years to come in all likelihood youll be just fine coasting comfortably along that proverbial plain of mediocrity with the majority of the comedy networks original programming
