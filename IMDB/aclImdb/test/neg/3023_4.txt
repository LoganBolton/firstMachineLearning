there were two things i hated about wasted  the directing and the script  i know im opening myself up to ridicule but stephen t kays direction is too much like a  like a  well like a mtv pop video  its shot  i think  on digital video against an intrusive soundtrack  often out of focus and often with rapid cross cutting  if youre not a teenager youll find many segments of wasted unwatchable due to the stylistic approach  as bad as the directing was it was the script that yanked my chain  the story is told through samantha  a poor little rich girl who spends much of the film talking through voice over  strange how the voice over never seems idiosyncratic enough to have come from the same character  telling us of the pressure of her exams  the pressure of home life  her social solitude and its all this that led her to take drugs  its for similar reasons like parental break up that her two male friends  i thought she was supposed to be lonely   to start taking drugs  oh poor little sammi in her nice house and her problems how my heart bled for you and your chums  not  what wasted doesnt mention is that no matter what someone is addicted to  be it drink  drugs  nicotine or chocolate that person has to work at becoming an addict  theyre not a victim of external forces  theyre commiting an act of free will  both traffic and trainspotting made this point very well  people become addicts because they want to  to portray them as victims in any way is wrong patronising and very possibly dangerousbr br by the way  if mtv are anti drugs will they stop playing videos from stars who freely admit taking drugs
