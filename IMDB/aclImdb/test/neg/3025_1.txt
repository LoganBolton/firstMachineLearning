good lordbr br im going to say right off the bat i only watched 20 minutes of this movie as i am a hardcore eraserhead fan the what you cant watch a wierd black and white movie with littletono dialogue defense does not apply i simply cant watch terrible weird black and white movies with littletono dialoguebr br this movie is what happens when you give an angsty gothchild with no talent and nothing to say a camera and budget and let himher put as much meaninglessly offensive imagery on screen as possible it was clear from the start that this film should have been 5 minutes long assuming it should exist at all shots that should last a few seconds drag on for minutes because the director has ijustlovethesoundofmyownvoice syndrome and refuses to cut to another shot until the entire piece of footage has been viewed from the moment the girl in the mask started masturbating the corpse of god the opening scene of the film joy i knew it was only a matter of time until i turned off the tape after at least 10 minutes of a different corpse being pulled around twitching on a rope by a gang of cloaked mysterymen i knew it was time to give up rarely do i give up on a movie i sat through the entirety of blair witch 2 book of shadows albeit not happily this did not deserve the 20 minutes i gave itbr br if youre an eraserhead fan do not let simpleminded comparisons to said film con you into renting this piece of amateur trash allow me to refer you to tetsuo the iron man for a watchable and enjoyable piece of incoherent black and white weirdness
