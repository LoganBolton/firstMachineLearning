this film really misses the mark on most fronts the accents are laughably weak the acting amateurish and the comedy weak at bestbr br theyve got a great idea it could have been particularly enjoyable but for the reasons mentioned abovebr br the writer seems to think by putting the word fck into every sentence itll make it funnier and the main character just seems to try a little too hard hes no brick top thats for surebr br next time at least get a cast that can keep the accent for the whole filmbr br its a crime to compare this to films like the business lock stock and snatch
