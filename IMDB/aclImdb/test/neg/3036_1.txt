sorry this movie was a bad made for tv movie are the rest of you on drugs when you watched it i thought the hairmakeup and characters were poor 2 dimensional types the story is doubtfulespecially since all of the main characters are deador nearly dead i think its not well acted eitherwhat was up with that hair on the main guy in the turtles it looked glued on badly and the sideburns looked like they were going to fall off at any moment it didnt feel like anything new was revealed in the story of the band and how the members met other bandsand people i laughed all the way through itfrank zappa looked stupidso did mama cass and so did the beatles they were made out to look stupid and ridiculous also the other band people like jim morrisondonovan also took a big hit at looking stupid too kind of terribleif this is how you remember these people its a poor history lesson on musicits fictional the way it was made
