unlike most reviewers here i hated this movie simply because the writerdirectors bloated ego was in the way of an otherwise potentially interesting topic too many film fans equate extreme selfindulgence to film genius but i dont buy into that cult of personality a film should be about its subject not its director unless its a woody allen film of course spoiler which is just as well save your time there is nothing brilliant about of showing you the footlong pornstars youknowwhat in the last frame thats actually called a tacky maneuver that screams filmschool hackism br br the poseur flick has achieved great film status based on its indulgence and pandering to the audience  which first and foremost is the writerdirector but the rest of the audience should look down on the surly brutal nature of the porn biz too the flick had an aloof angle to the porn industry looking down on each and every player it could bash no matter just love your writerdirector love those fourminute steadicam segments which are supposed to show the energy of the moment but somehow had all the verve of an off switch love the story no matter how dull it is about the geewhiz rise and sordid fall of a porn star but look down on it too of course while the subject has the potential to be fascinating  innocence money degradation beauty your worshipful writerdirector somehow managed to make it all look again dull partly because of its run time here is something your auteur hero didnt try giving the characters dimension or soul anything at all to give a hoot about aside from genius that paul is of course but im not buying i dont buy into indulgent hacks with astounding hype br br another overlong auteurist hack piece with fifty times more hype than quality i know some of you agree the rest will see likely see this indulgent flick again not my problem
