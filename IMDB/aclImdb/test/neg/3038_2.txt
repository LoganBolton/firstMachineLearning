the original wasc isnt by any means a must see movie in the genre in fact if it werent for its chilling first 25 minutes there wouldnt be any logical reason for watching it the remake takes those 25 minutes and turns them into a mediocre 85 minute teen horror flick br br now i dont have anything against pg13 horror movies but the tendency surrounding them is getting lame when you see the pg13 rating you expect a movie filled with false scares teen tv or music stars and a plot that has been used for several times dont even ask for gore or violence br br i know that its not correct to compare both the original wasc and the remake but i think that its necessary to do it because the whole idea of the new one is based on the beginning of the original the tension that is felt through the first movie is not present by any means in the remake not even with the amazing settings or great use of lightning no tension suspense thrillsnothing the movie goes too slow before it gets a little interesting and thats when the stranger appears the chasing sequence is probably the best part of the movie because at least theres a feeling of what will happen next but thats it the situations that set up for the climax are predictable boring and lack of suspense the original has merits for having suspense in the most important scenes and also for a chilling climax for the most important scene of the movie br br now i understand that this is a pg13 horror movie but if you pay respect to the original why change its most important situation the children are not supposed to survive after the ending i felt like this movie was pointless so the baby sitter was playing cat and mouse with a wackothats it then the sequence at the hospital was plain stupid and worst of all it means that a sequel may be on the way br br camila belle is the best thing about the movie she delivers a cute believable performance she needs to pick better projects although this role will gain for her thousands of teenager fans br br please dont watch this movie some people say that in order to support the horror genre we are supposed to support any movie that comes out i dont necessary agree if we ignore movies like wasc then the producers of horror movies will understand that we wont accept crap we want good horror movies not lame flicks filled with false scares br br watch the original when a stranger calls instead because its first 25 minutes are way better than the whole pointless remake
