when a stranger calls belongs to the group of this years remakes with movies like poseidon just over the horizon director simon west con air helms this updated version with plenty of relative unknown casts which signals either the death rate is high it isnt or that established stars are steering clear from a potential turkeybr br clocking in at a relatively short 87 minutes its primarily made up of two acts the first which takes a full one hour is the setup our heroine jill johnson camilla belle chalked up 800 minutes of talk time on her mobile phone do the math and as a lesson in responsibility her parents had confiscated her mobile and grounded her to pay off her debt she works part time as a babysitter and looking after the wealthy mandrakis kids is her first stintbr br the huge mandrakis mansion gets a full tour treatment as it is where all the action will take place plenty of rooms makes for good hiding an indoor pool sized aquariumpond to get wet in for the wet tshirt treatment and check this out  motion detector lights which you just know will contribute to the scares with the manipulation of lights and shadows naturally prank calls red herrings are aplenty which chalks up this acts runtime but most of them fall flat in the suspense departmentbr br theres a minor trend emerging with actors being the unseen providing and acting through their voice instead recent attempts include edward norton in kingdom of heaven and hugo weavings v for vendetta here lance henriksen does the honours for the anonymous nameless psychotic killer but it just falls flat why the script doesnt give him much dialogue most of the phone calls made were of the silent mindmasturbatory nature which i felt was a waste  they could have also casted some unknown instead and the job will still get donebr br the second act where the main action takes place is too little too late and the bogeyman well is purely a bogeyman those expecting blood and gore will be disappointed as basically its a one woman show to hold your attention in the first hour eye candies always succeed and this act will have her resolve everything in double quick time ala rachel mcadams in red eye dont expect any form of character development nor subplots that will engagebr br the ending tried to be too smart for its own good and came across as a cheap way to end the movie theres not much of goodness to highlight from this movie  no scares no thrills no enigmatic villain and plenty of security flaws especially with that door alarm  the only thing its good for is to provide a number for 4d
