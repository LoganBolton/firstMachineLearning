this is so overly clichéd youll want to switch it off after the first 45 minutes the beginning is very interesting with a fair going on and someone gets killed this movie would have been better set on this settingbr br so jill johnson is a depressed sprinter with boyfriend issues i dont see the point of adding her breakup with her boyfriend occurs in any of the events in the storybr br since jill has come home late her father sends her to babysit for the mandrakiss in their glamorous home in a deserted lake the kids are sleeping and the maid is cleaning another empty house to the side for their son whos at college okbr br after about half an hour of her stalking around the house by herself she gets a couple of hang ups ooh scary ones to which her friend comes to the rescue to come up with a couple of high school lines about love and whatever friend leaves and goes to her car to which then she drops her keys uhhhthen the music dumdumdum she fumbles to pick them up and gets into her car which of course doesnt start how clichéd is that soshe disappears d jill alone again uh most of this movie is with her by herself so theres not much dialog so more hangups she calls the police who say they cant help her but call back if she has any more problemsbr br so then she suspects that her boyfriend is calling or her boyfriends friends are calling they have been but only once like thats supposed to be scary much oh and did i mention her friend just now comes on caller id and some creepy man voice comes on she gets all freaked out and shytbr br yeah so skip that she sees the light in the house of the mandrakiss son go on so she runs through the woods with music as her companion and goes in blehehbr br ah its so boring i cant continue
