while babysitting at an isolated colorado house a teen girl is terrorized by an elusive murderer on the telephonebr br remake of the 1979 semiclassic horror film basically takes the opening 20 minutes of the original film and stretches it out to fit an 87 minute time span so its pretty needless to say that the plot of this remake is pretty thin theres little in the way of originality or interest in this movie theres a lot of camilla belle wondering around a dark house wondering whos calling her and encountering all kinds of false scares it all gets repetitious and routine after the first 30 minutes and never manages to muster up much in the way of suspense or chills it certainly never reaches the intensity of the original film especially since it wimpsout and changes one important plot point from the original i guess we have the pg13 rating to thank for thatbr br on the plus side theres an impressive set design and some dark atmosphere unfortunately theres not much going on around it to save this remake from being subpar belles performance is pretty mediocre toobr br its just another unimpressive remakebr br  12 out of
