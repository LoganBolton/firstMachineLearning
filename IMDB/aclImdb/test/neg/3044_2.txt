thats pretty much all i can say about this flat and uninspired remake of the 1979 carol kane vehicle camilla belle isnt much of an actress and she brings no energy and vitality to the role of jill johnson the babysitter harassed by an anonymous phone callerbr br but if youre looking for some great home architecture and interior design ideas this movie provides more inspiration than anything youll see on tlc or hgtv jill spends nearly 90 minutes wandering through the house of the rich doctor and wife for whom shes providing her sitting services searching for the origins of strange sounds and things that keep going bump in the night as she lurks around corners and peers down hallways we get to see a beautiful master bathroom with his and hers sinks that look like roman tubs a huge kitchen with incredible back lit glass shelving and the piece de resistance a selfcontained aviary and coy pond that feature a selfwatering systembr br because the movie isnt compelling enough to draw us into jills fear were distracted by the grandeur of the house which isnt something you should be doing when youre watching a thriller even as jill is pursued by the faceless maniac we cringe because shes breaking valuables and messing up the coy pond not because shes about to get murderedbr br the movie plods along as predictably as most teen slasher movies and the ending is anything but original by the time it was over i just wanted to find out where the heck that house was and if it was real never mind jill and the kids she was babysittingbr br 2 stars  both for the house
