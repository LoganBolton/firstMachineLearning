what should have been a routine babysitting gig at a secluded lake house turns into a night of terror as high school student jill johnson camilla belle receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker while trying to stay one step ahead of himbr br the first 20 minutes of the original film were pretty good but it was all downhill from there the remake takes those first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80 minute feature film thats a good idea because its eliminating everything that made the original bad however if they wanted this film to work more effectively then they should have hired a better lead actress better director writer etc theres no suspense everything can be figured out long before it happens and its a very dull film since not much happens at least there isnt much to sit through since its less than 90 minutesbr br if this premise were to work then the lead actress has to give a realistic performance camilla belle gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen and throughout the whole movie she seemed to be reading her lines you get a lead role in a hollywood film that will be viewed by millions of people and you give no effort at all why did they hire this girl sure shes pretty but she cant act at all yet i suppose this wont matter to the target audience who will most likely eat this film up the rest of the cast is bland and forgettable especially the woman who plays the maid rosa even the stranger was lame and his lines on the phone were not effective at allbr br this movie reminds me of last years disappointing horror film boogeyman that movie was a bunch of cheap scares and false alarms and when a stranger calls is pretty much the same jill enters a room because she hears a noise but its just a false alarm like a cat or the maid this type of scene happens over and over again until finally after about 50 minutes the stranger appears he has to be one of the lamest killers ever he carried no weapons and didnt seem to pose much of a threat the ending is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it doesnt really matter the film is directed by simon west and he is really bad at building up suspense he was using every clich√© he could think of and the results werent very good the house was amazing and ill give the film credit for that it was an isolated house so it was pretty creepy but thats about the only good thing this film has to offer in the end if youre not a teenage girl then you should skip the movie rating 210
