this starts out interestingly as theres a carnival right next to someones house with an oil rig right there too and some kind of storefront church across the street with a neon jesus saves sign all right in one tiny areanow thats pretty dazzling if improbableand then we go right into the movie which takes improbable to new levels of course this is a lame remake of the 1979 thriller starring carol kane as the babysitter jill johnsonnow jill is some chick that ran her cell phone minutes up so high her evil parents are punishing her by making her work it off probably something that the audience this movie targets can identify with jill is taken to this huge and fancy house on a lake in the middle of nowhere of course by her dad to babysit for the mandrakis family the children are already nestled all snug in their beds when jill arrives and the housekeeper is still there huh she couldnt babysit of course despite the remote location one of jills friends pops by one whom with which she apparently has issues as in boyfriend stealing or something anyway of course the alarm in the house goes off for no reason and then calls from someone start coming in calls from someone that wants to kill her of course jill calls the cops and since there hasnt been any actual threat on her life they blow her off but tell her to call back if theres anything else they can do for her check out the scene with jill calling her friends at the high school bonfirepep rally or whatever its supposed to be it looks like some kind of burning man festival  theres all kind of contrived scares in this including the cool cat chester who of course pops up here and there one of the tiredest horror movie clich√©s there is i will admit that i dozed off at some point during this and did i miss anything hard to tell or care really this is one of those films that makes me wonder how bad the remakes of amityville horror house of wax or the fog could have been anyway from reading online reviews it seems like the folks that were the most scared by this were 12 year old girls and i can only assume that from statements like it made me peepee my pants well one can only hope that this will put an end to hollywood remakes of films that werent exactly stellar to begin with but dont bet on it 2 out of 10 and im being overly generous
