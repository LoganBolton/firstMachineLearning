im starting to wonder if all these pg13 horror movies are just glorified screen tests for young and emerging talent get a firsttime screenwriter an inexperienced director a few tv actors looking for their bigscreen break and see what they can do when a stranger calls is a little better than most such recent offerings but is still completely bythebook riddled with plot holes and genre clich√©sbr br the story is unbelievably simplistic the slim 87 minute running time is heavily padded with inconsequential friends and a pointless cheating boyfriend the killer is devoid of even the token motivation of jason or michael or even the original movies killer and as a result is never particularly frightening the police behave in such an unbelievably ineffectual and lazy manner as to verge on professional misconduct simon west brings the same attractive banality to proceedings that he managed with lara croft but his style of directing is decidedly generic possessing no indicators of real talent or vision the performances are routine dark hallways replace genuine horror and the scares are of the tired catinthecloset varietybr br the cinematography and production design however are above average for this kind of film the house is beautifully designed all dark wood and glassy reflections and there are a few moments that are of visual interestbr br though lacking an ounce of dramatic originality it acts as a reasonably satisfying dark house thriller and maintains interest longer than most of its ilk
