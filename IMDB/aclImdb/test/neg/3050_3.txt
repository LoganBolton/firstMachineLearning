before stan laurel became the smaller half of the alltime greatest comedy team he laboured under contract to broncho billy anderson in a series of cheapies many of which were parodies of major hollywood features most of laurels parody films are only mildly funny and even less funny for modern audiences who havent seen the original movie which laurel is parodying fortunately mud and sand lampoons a movie which is still well known blood and sand starring rudolph valentino blood and sand was released only nine weeks before this parody giving you some idea of how quickly broncho billys movies were ground out edited and distributedbr br various sources including imdb state that stan laurels character in this film is named rhubarb vaselino with a final o ive screened a print of mud and sand with the original titles in hobo type font so i report that laurels role is actually cried rhubarb vaseline with an e but i agree that vaselino is funnier laurel copies the elaborate sideburns which valentino wore in blood and sand he shouldve made them longer and theres a parody of valentinos dressing scene from that movie which made female moviegoers swoon in 1922 a se√±orita named carmen in the original film is parodied here as caramel a girl id like to sink my teeth intobr br this movie like the original apparently takes place in spain yet theres a prohibition gag laurel uses a distinctive hattipping gesture here which could have become a trademark for him like hardys distinctive necktie twiddle but ive never spotted it in any other laurel film theres some amusing dialogue rhubarb vaseline tells the other matadors to save a bull for me when vaseline becomes a successful toreador a lackey tells him the bull is without sir  which is funny but i was disappointed that laurel didnt reply without whatbr br theres one funny moment here which almost certainly wasnt planned when vaseline shows up for the bullfighter auditions laurel swaggers into the bullring and  before you can say corrida querida  he tosses a bull over the fence where it lands with a thump near the other auditioners the bull is obviously a fake but the gag is funny anyway  and aye theres a title card with a joke about throwing the bull the serendipitous moment occurs when laurel repeats the gag and vaseline slings a second bull over the fence this one lands on its butt and balances upright for just an instant before toppling very funny if somebody planned that gag in this quickie comedy i salute the unknown gagsmith  and the tech man who rigged the bull to land in that position more likely it happened by luck and the director and editor were smart enough to keep it inbr br during the silent era whenever hollywood made a bigbudget feature film which was set anyplace where the people dont speak english it was a common cinematic device to show a piece of text or an inscription in the local lingo then dissolve to a shot of the same text in english i was surprised that this lowbudget comedy spent the money to copy that device here we see a noticeboard outside the corrida with a message in spanish then it dissolves to the same text in english unfortunately the photography in this cheapo movie is so dark that the effect is wastedbr br the actresses in this movie are attractive  including broncho billys wife leona anderson and stan laurels commonlaw wife mae dahlberg the latter briefly does a pretty dance mae had danced in stans vaudeville act i was surprised to spot charlie chaplins halfbrother wheeler dryden in a brief role since chaplin had nothing to do with this movie in mud and sand laurel gives a funny performance thats quite unlike his later familiar stanley character  but this film is much less funny than his brilliant work with oliver hardy my rating just 3 out of 10 trivia note twentythree years later in stan laurels very last american film  the bullfighters 1945  he again played a spanish bullfighter with his spanish voice postdubbed coincidentally that film used stock footage from blood and sand not valentinos movie but the tyrone power remake mud and sand is funnier than the bullfighters but not much
