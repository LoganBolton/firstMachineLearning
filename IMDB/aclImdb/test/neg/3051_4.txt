one of the many silent comedies stan laurel featured in before he teamed with oliver hardy mud and sand is a hohum hokum the story is badly disjointed  though this could be because of the modernday edit  and the humor itself is not at all inventivebr br potential plotlines are started and ignored for instance stans promise to make fillet de sole pay for what shes done to him never comes to fruition stans character doesnt seem very centered either but this is a common criticism of his work before he developed stanley of laurel  hardy fame so it might be that i was just expecting to see this shortcomingbr br i strongly believe that all the silent films should be preserved and viewed and im glad this one is still available its just not a great film
