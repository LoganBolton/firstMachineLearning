when i first saw this i thought bits of it were fairly scary but the horror is a little undermined by the fact that the dozy teenagers are so irritating that you dont really care what happens to them there are some genuinely good moments such as angelas speech about demons and the brieflyseen demon itself is effective but this really doesnt stand up to repeated viewing or close analysis its all pretty tacky and cheaplooking and often downright silly pornography and unfunny wisecracks all too often replacing horror the music is excellent however and the epilogue is certainly amusing but this film doesnt have much to recommend it just comes across as another jasontype stalkandslash fare
