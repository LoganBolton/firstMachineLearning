its difficult to decide whether this movie suffers from crap dialogue or if its just made to appear so by crap actors in any case it suffers from storywriting which is mediocre at bestbr br although made in the late 80s the first part of the movie plays like a 60s teenage screwball comedy barring the absence of any actual humour especially the part of the good girl which is as annoying a doris day figure as you could hopefear for including the slightly whiny opposition to anything fun her friends want to do the net effect is after a while you start to hope shell bite it so you dont have to listen to her voice anymorebr br some profanity and gratuitous nudity plus some really 80s style clothing is your only clue that this movie was made in the 80s oh and some pretty passable music toobr br storywise its pretty formulaic stuff a bunch of horny apart obviously  from miss nice girl teenagers decide to celebrate halloween night by throwing a party in a haunted house partying and fornication ensues along with an illadvised seance which kicks off the demonic possession spree which is the subject of the movie after this the only suspenseful part will be trying to guess in which order the characters will expire youre sure not to care whether or not they will the actors are so bad that becoming demonszombiesdinner actually improves their performance somewhat and the ridiculously clich√© dialogue is so annoying that you squirm in your seatbr br gorewise this flick aint nuthin special unless you think cheesy is kind of special for example the demon head which occasionally appears is so screamingly fake that you wonder if its a 5year old trickortreatingbr br this is not to say theres nothing enjoyable in the flick some of the music isnt half bad and the first of our insipid scooby gang to get possessed performs a marvelous and really sexy dance routine at one point before she turns nastybr br also and i dont know why towards the very end of the flick i actually managed to get somewhat involved the suspense lacking in most of the movie made a late appearance and i started to squirm out of unease instead of annoyance which is what a horror movie is supposed to dobr br concequently i cannot bring myself to give this movie a rockbottom rating since by some inexplicable miracle i dont rule out being possessed by demons i was actually a little creepedbr br dont pay money to see it though its hardly worth your time yet alone hard cash watch it on youtube while its there
