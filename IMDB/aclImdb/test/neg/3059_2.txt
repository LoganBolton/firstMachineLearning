by the time this movie came out in 1996 director mark lester had been making tight sharp little b action pictures for more than 20 years he was responsible for the great truck stop women from the 70s and several other little gems unfortunately hes also responsible for this dud its a shame to see the talentedand still smoking hottheresa russell wasted yet again but shes still the best actor in this picture eric roberts shows up for a while does his eric roberts thing then goes away a not altogether unwelcome occurrence in a picture with eric roberts in it frank stallone actually isnt bad which should give you an idea of how truly pathetic this picture is as has been mentioned by other reviewers the action sceneswhich is the reason a picture like this gets made in the first placeare almost completely illogical and unrealistic in addition to being somewhat inept other than some vintage clothes and a few old cars theres no feel whatever for the 1930s the era in which this film is set a bythenumbers script with irritating lapses in logic and little historical accuracythis isnt a documentary of course but the filmmakers could have at least tried for a little authenticityand performances that range from grade b to grade school relegate this cheap little quickie to the 400 am sunday slot on hbo which is just where i saw it
