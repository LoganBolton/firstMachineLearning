its too kind to call this a fictionalized account of the barker gang they got the names right but thats about itbr br russell is still hot ill grant you that but this is not the real ma barker who basically took care of the boys by cooking and assisting when they moved around the country not by planning or participating in the crimes i think it would have been far more interesting to present the real story of a middleaged woman caught up in the criminal activities of her children and their croniesbr br i also have to agree with those reviewers who found the shootout scenes to be totally unbelievable the barkerkarpis victims were a combination of the innocent and of the lawenforcement agents who pursued them but they definitely did not mow down halfadozen fbi agents every time they were cornered on the other hand as several recent books have related the fbi of that era emphasized the idea of agents coming only from legal or accounting backgrounds to the extent that many agents had very little law enforcement or firearms experience they were not the welltrained agents that we picture today br br but the worst sin of all is that the movie is basically a bore nobody changes nobody grows we know the end of the road is ahead we just dont know which shootout it will bebr br only for diehard russell fans
