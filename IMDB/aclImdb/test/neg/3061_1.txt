is this movie as bad as some claim in my opinion yes it is i wasnt going to comment noting that quite a few comments have already been made ranging from awful to not nearly so bad however i cant resistbr br what do you make of a movie that has on the dvd cover the phrase the real story of ma barker and her boys and the standard any similarity to actual persons disclaimer in the credits im not naive but in this case its a pretty relevant observation regarding this moviebr br several comments knock the performances they are pretty awful roberts russell milano and stallone have something like 315 movies and tv shows listed between them they can act or at least performbr br howeverthe dialog is not to my taste and quite unintentionally funny at times the story arcs didnt seem to be anything but the barest minimum required to string specific scenes of violence and melodrama togetherbr br direction and screen writing has to be faulted amyrillis giggles after seeing ma barkers violent temper and finishes with take the girl what ever you think of alyssas acting abilitiessome screenwriter wrote that line or reaction andor some director shot it and said ok thats good enough no need to retake that thats credible one footnote i did pick up my copy for 199 or 299 in a grocery story discount bin the running time is shown as 91 mins and i note that the running time is listed on imdb as 95 mins i dont know what 4 minutes im missing but i acknowledge that if those 4 minutes were of the right sort of person in the right sort of situation my rating might soar to 3 or 4 out of 10 as i saw it 1  10 is what i must vote
