recognizing the picture of the diner on the cover of the dvd made me realize that this was a local movie the word detroit in the title furthered my suspecions and i did some looking up of things and yes a local movie it wasbr br so i picked it up someone i knew actually knew some of the producersdirector dont remember which and said the producersdirectors got people to pay to be in this moviebr br brilliant what a great idea the movie makers get some capital to do the movie with thanks to their cast and crew then the investors cast crew others get some of the profits im imaginingbr br profitsbr br um anyways this film totally underwhelmed me the special effects were special as in special children who ride the small buses to school the acting was very amusing not intentionally however theres a great line where a guy says well this bone aint gonna smoke itself as a pickup line unfortunately that is the only fun part of the whole film the story well i sort of followed it about 35 of the way in then everything stopped making sense and as we were sitting there watching it it suddenly ended i mean as inno resolution of anythinglike they ran out of time sorry folks out of time goodnightbr br we sat there baffled and booing and threw in another film then about 20 minutes later a neighbor of mine showed upwith one of the guys from the movie we threw it back in and he the actor gave us a running commentary which was awesome because he totally ripped on the moviebr br what more could you ask forbr br the most absurd scene for me was a motorbike chase scene were it was so dark that it could have literally been a guy running past with a flashlight and not a motorbike at all that and the jaw droppingly in your face sudden ending is enough to make you howl in pain the zombies looked less like zombies than my coworkers do and i dont work at the morgue eitherbr br so i recommend seeing this if you can get someone from the movie to come over and give you a running commentary as to all the things that went on behind the scenes and make sure this person hates the movie because that just adds to the funbr br otherwise give this one a pass rent something like feeders if you want a jaw droppingly bad in a funny way movie
