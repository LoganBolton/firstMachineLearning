fat girls is among the worst films within the indie gay genrebr br the premise is promising an averagelooking gay teen is trapped in a repressive small tx town his only kindred spirits are the other village hs misfits the class fat girl a naïve immigrant from cuba and the sensitive drama teacher so far interesting in theory this plot line creates a decent setup for an appealing coming of age story with a builtin audiencethe thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across america and experienced this adolescent anxiety first hand peppered with a dose of selfdeprecating humorbr br unfortunately rather than a nuanced dramedy ash christian approaches his autobiographical subject matter with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor the result is a cast of unlikeable derivative twodimensional characters which the viewer cannot but help feel indifferent toward sabrina fink is a quasigoth bitter navelgazer she is such a prickly unsympathetic person there is little doubt as to the reason for her friendless condition the chemistry between her and rodney christian registers zero this may have been bad casting but is more likely due to a screenplay which is simply unsalvageable consequently one is left wondering when there is such a nonexistent bond what could possibly warrant their nearconstant companionship throughout the storybr br sabrinas newfound boyfriend rudy de jesus and rodneys mother judy theaker are among the most exaggerated of the clichéd stock characters ripped off from dozens of other films rudy is the horny undersexed immigrantnerd lifted directly from every raunchy adolescent comedy ever made within the realm of tv or film judy is the bornagain obsessed with jesus talk and big hair just when you thought the tammy faye thing had been done to death christian inserts a scene where judys mascara is running with her tears is there anyone in the civilized world that can possibly think this tired old stereotype gag is still funny after seeing it ad nauseum for 20 yearsbr br in addition to the failed attempts at sardonic humor there are many puzzling story inconsistencies rodney considers himself a fat ugly loser however he simultaneously manages to participate in casual and regular impromptu trysts with the ubiquitous school jockhunk ted miller although these liaisons are devoid of emotional fulfillment most gay teens filled with raging testosterone just like their hetero brethren would find this to be a rather enviable arrangement given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacybr br rodney finds an object for his affection in bobby bruening an exotic transplant from england against all believable odds the lad not only happens to land in this tiny tx hamlet but is conveniently openly gay to boot like sabrina bobby is an icy angry smart aleck and the viewer is left headscratching as to his magnetic appeal br br much to his delight rodney is invited by his new crush to the town gay bar where bobby claims to be the dj upon arrival the boyfriendtobe promptly leaves rodney solo and heads off to another area of the bar for a quick encounter with a rather handsome young man this is yet one more of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since rodneys feeling as an outcast are supposedly derived largely from his lonely existence in a parochial town as tiny as the town is they have openly gay students at the high school a secretly bisexual football captain lesbian moms a gay teacher and it has a gay bar downtown patronized by attractive men no less apparently the place is not so backwater after allbr br ten years earlier todd stephens edge of seventeen covered nearly the same material with a much more creative honest touching and humorous film
