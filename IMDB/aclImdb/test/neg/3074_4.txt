this tvm seems to have polarised opinions amongst the commentators on this page so perhaps i can settle everything by saying this is a very stupid not very well made television movie  how bad is it  its a teleplay that cant even decide what its name is because while everyone in america calls it linda its known in britain as lust for murder and its usually a bad sign when a movie has to change its name  and can i also point out that its not a tongue in cheek spoof as somebody else claimed br br i will be honest and say the plot is rather sound  linda and paul cowley meet another couple called the jeffries who they get on very well with  they get on so well that they go on holiday together  make up your own mind if theres some wife swapping going on  and paul sees his wife kill the jeffries  after that the plot takes a shock twist br br writing the above paragraph i have suddenly realised the large amount of potential the story had and i wont say anything to put you off the premise  its just that when the story continues after the events ive described things become more and more unlikely and bizarre  not only that but the production values are fairly unimpressive with the actor playing paul cowley doing a very wooden voice over that irritates while most of the scenes  exterior and interior  look like theyve been filmed on a foggy day
