years ago i caught a fairly well made tv movie entitled linda it was made in 1973 and starred stella stevens in the femme fatale title roll imagine my surprise when over ten years later i once again saw the same story unfold on late night tv however it was this 1993 version starring virginia madsen dont get me wrong i can handle remakes even obscure ones but this badly written and poorly filmed retread made me feel sorry for both madsen and costar richard thomas unlike the original the dialogue here is cliched making me wonder why did they bother to rewrite it second the camera work is very heavyhanded and the the film stock is poor at times i felt reminded of the student film competition at the beginning of christopher guests the big picture finally the cast looks either bored madsen or suffering thomas in fact the only one who seems like hes really enjoying the work is ted mcginley of course with his perfectly coifed hair and capped teeth hes really stretching himself from his previous work on the love boat bottom line to borrow a critique from opus the penguin in bloom countybr br this movie does for film what jonestown did for koolaidbr br thomkat
