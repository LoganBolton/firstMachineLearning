committed stars heather graham along with casey affleck and luke wilson its the story of joline who is determined to find her exhusband who is in the process of a midlife crisis br br committed was not at all what i expected it was lacking in comedy which was ultimately the genre it was beyond stupid and unrealistic casey affleck delivered a reasonable performance grahams recent roles have been lackluster and this is not an improvementbr br grahams most recent role was blessed which i also found misleading and didnt appeal to me at allbr br pros affleckbr br cons predictable unrealistic poor acting and not a comedy movie
