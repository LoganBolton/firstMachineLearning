i wanted to love this film so badlyi really did but it was a horrible disappointmentbr br i read jennifer egans novel in 1996 and was enthralled by the story in fact it remains one of my favorite books of all time mind you the book had much more depth than this movie in plot and emotional resonance it made you care about the characters it painted a complete picture of phoebe unlike the utterly poor characterization of the young girl in the filmbr br though beautiful and showing some promise in her burgeoning career jordana brewster was as flat and hollow in this performance as was the script and christopher eccleston wolf was just an awful choice for the role of wolf both physically and logistically what an awkward looking couple wolf should have been more of a dark brooding character and more physically alluring like he was in the book whats more the chemistry between the two actors was painfully forcedbr br cameron diaz however deserves utmost praise for her performance she took an impossibly mediocre script and gave her character life a real spirit she is simply gorgeous and her careful mannerisms make her very believable as a hippie its too bad her talent was squandered on this forgettable filmbr br in the booktomovie category this is a dreadful translation almost as bad as message in a bottle with kevin costner but dont get me started on that onebr br i am not usually so harsh in my critiques but i was so disappointed here because i really cared about the story and wanted to see it told right it did not deliverbr br
