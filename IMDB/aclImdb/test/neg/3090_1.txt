what a waste of time i expected better from cameron diaz i guess it wasnt really her fault for being in a terrible film the film does not capture the beauty of europeand wasnt successful in leading the audience into suspense or wonder weak attempt at storytelling and narrating  dialogue is dull and wasnt able to convey what i sometimes think simplicity is beauty no love energy electricity on screen too bad1
