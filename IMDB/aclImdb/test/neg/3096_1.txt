i am not afraid of bad movies i like bad movies i enjoy mocking them in the company of my friends were all quite good at it in fact that being said let me tell you how much i hated this moviebr br to begin with it was incomprehensible rob lowe attacks some people they capture him but he escapes in this big ol shoot out theres this singer whom we think died only she didnt unless maybe there are several of them who all act and look the same cue burt reynolds to come in and question the singer he looks like hes just wandered into this movie off of the walker texas ranger set and is darn confused then rob lowe dies only he doesnt and the worst thing is theres not enough dialogue or action that doesnt involve killing people or attempting to to even make fun of this movie and dont even get me started on the random chihuahua then there was the fact that it was supposed to be about the old power structure in easterneurope falling apart we didnt know where we were all the accents were apparently easterneuropean and what were burt reynolds and rob lowe doing there in the first placebr br i desperately wanted to tell the people at blockbuster what i thought of this movie and to get my money back but since id gotten it as a special only 99 i decided against it what i want to know however is how the director got the greenlight to make this darn movie and what the stars were thinking when they signed on
