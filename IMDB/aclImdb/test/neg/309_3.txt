i agree that this film is too pretentious and it is not easy to know where it is going i have been teaching literature and film for many years and i find this film to be one of the most over rated according to some of the previous reviews here br br however let me remind you that this is the same director who has lora di religione il sorriso di mia madre my mothers smile to his credit  a gem of a film br br was he trying to outdo fellinis 812 here the scene with the dogs which has also been pointed out is absurd and excessive Â– just one example others would take too much space and some reviewers have already noted them br br overall a most frustrating and annoying experience
