rita hayworth is just stunning at times and for me the only reason to watch this silly film despite the overdone 1940s lipstick rita was one of the alltime glamor women of hollywood in fact for a couple of years i cant imagine anyone that looked better except maybe elizabeth taylor in her primebr br anyway the costar of the show gene kelly does not play his normal likable at least the kind of guy we all know him from in singin in the rain here kellys danny mcguire pouts much of the time phil silvers who i loved on tv at sgt bilko is so stupid in here as genius you will just cringe listening to his dumb jokesand they are stupidbr br the visuals are good with great technicolor which almost looks terrific you get to see a lot of pretty women in here too not just hayworth unfortunately the story isnt all that much it centers around hayworth deciding about a career choice along the way we get the normal shabby treatment of marriage and we get an insultinglydumb ending all in all an unmemorable film except as a showcase for hayworths beauty
