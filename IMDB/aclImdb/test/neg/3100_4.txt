its been said that some directors make small budget pictures look like blockbusters albert pyun makes small budget pictures look like high school av project films this film was pretty much lacking in all departments practically every scene drags on excessively the experimental lighting and camera work is terrible rob lowe apparently equated being scruffy with acting and the poor drab europop numbers stop the movie to a dead halt on the plus side burt reynolds does a pretty good job with what hes given which isnt much mario van peebles is surprisingly decent and icet puts in another of a long recent string of bmovie gangsters not pyuns worst work urban menace but certainly not his best mean guns
