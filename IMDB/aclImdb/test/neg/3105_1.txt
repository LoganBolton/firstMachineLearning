im actually too drained to write this review  bad movies always do that to me  but i feel obligated as if its my civic duty to warn anyone who might be considering purchasing or viewing this godawful messofapicture please please just take my word this is one youll want to stay away from its so boring and dull so insipid and uninspired such a poor excuse to assemble any familiar talent burt reynolds wasted despite his best efforts icet is barely in the film and when he does appear on screen his performance is so restrained and muted that it becomes crystal clear that the director perhaps intimidated by ices intense stare didnt know what to do with him rob lowe as the title character has never displayed so little onscreen charisma mario van peebles should be ashamed of himself his performance is in the saddest sense possible a joke surely satan himself signed marios check for this film the plot is as weak halfbaked and annoying as all the music involved the utterly boring club song seems to continue on literally for the first third of the movie the films look will prompt one to seriously wonder if the director of photography was also forced like one of the films forgettable female characters to smoke crack from a pipe ducttaped to his mouth and if youre looking at least for stylized shootemuptype violence youll get none here this film i assure you i promise you has absolutely no redeeming qualities please i implore you avoid this flick dont put it in and get suckered into believing that its pace will pick up itll get better and evolve into a decent denouement it wont it dont it cant it sucks now you have been warned and i can now go to bed its 3am  please forgive any resulting errors this admonition might contain  knowing my conscience is clear because ive done my civic duty for my fellow man
