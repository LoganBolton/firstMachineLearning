yeah thats right if i were to ask my friends this question whats the worst movie you have ever seen they might reply something like armageddon can you drill the hole shriek plan nine from outer space the medallion scooby doo etc no  dont get offended by this by thinking you have seen something that might be in the same department of naturally produced human fertilizer that this movie is in if the worst movie you can think of is lets say so bad it really pisses you off then you know nothing my friendbr br crazy six i remember the day me and a buddy of mine went to the local video store to rent a movie both of us had already been through most of the movies in there and on the new moviesshelf we see it staring at us wow theres some good actors here man says something about mafia lets just get it and get out of here this was without doubt the worst movie mistake in my movie loving life it was also the worst mistake for everybody else movie lover or notbr br watching this movie is as fun as watching a glass of ice cold water or icetea until it reaches room temperature watching this movie will make you dream an eternal dream of death if death is just blackout light and nothing and then you realize you are just staring at your tvmonitor not staring you are actually paying as much attention that is humanly possible this is no jokebr br this movie is the perfection of making a bad movie its not the kind of bad you can watch point and laugh of its the kind of movie that is so bad you actually have no chance of ever get out of your memory unless perhaps you use electric shock therapy to clear out the brain   hey that might be something similar to how i remember me and my buddy felt after watching itbr br best regards from me to you albert pyunbr br joergen
