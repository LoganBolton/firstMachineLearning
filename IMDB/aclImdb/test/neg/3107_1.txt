do not rent this movie i ended up buying the previously viewed tape of this for 400 that was close to the price of a rental so thought i might as well buy it im tossing it out after i finish this review the movie which stars lowe is a music video with few lines of dialogue slow moving shots and poorly done editing i thought id be seeing a mindless action flick which is what i wanted to see i didnt even get that this movie is an exercise in slow moving shots no script closeups terrible edited and a poorly developed plot i cant believe that is actually ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters by the end of the movie we still dont even really know who they are believe the hype stay away
