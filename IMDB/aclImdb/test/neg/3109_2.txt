honestly i didnt really have high expectations for this movie but at the same time i was hopeful having it be directing by albert pyun  one of the more well known bmovie auteurs  didnt exactly raise my hopes i mean how many albert pyun flicks rank that highly yeah exactly  but still the movie advertised a decent cast rob lowe burt reynolds prereborn stardom icet and mario van peeblesbr br it all amounts to squat however as the movie is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the longer it went on it runs over 90 minutes but its telling a story that could have been told in 30 minutes flat i dont know what pyun was going for here i mean the movie drips artsylike style but its a blur at times and maybe im an idiot for expecting more from pyun this time around here he seemed to actually have a budget and a potentially great cast for the material but its all wasted crazy six isnt much of an action film its not much of anything reallybr br i guess whats the saddest here is the fact that i found the end credits the most entertaining part of the movie the music score is actually halfdecent with some smooth female vocals too but the rest is a complete waste and the less said the better avoid
