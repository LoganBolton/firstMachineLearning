the film made no sense to me whatsoever good actorssergiocastellittoaparticular favourite he was great in uomo dellestellethestarmakerbut that was made by giuseppe tornatore a great italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effortbut awful rambling script terrible editingand a director who seemed to have no idea of what he was trying to say and ended up saying exactly nothing apretentious load of rubbish but the sort of film that certain italianpseudointellectuals whom it was my misfortune to have known in the dim and distant past would have loved it and unfortunately italy has no monopoly on these they can be found everywhere and probably acclaim this as a great masterpiece i never thought much of bellochio as director i remember seeing his first film pugninella tascafists in the pocket or some such title in rome when it was first shown close on 50 years ago i was living thereat the time all the usual pseudos raved about it but it left me pretty cold i didnt think he was much of a director then and still dont age has certainly not improved him and this film must rank as one of his worst
