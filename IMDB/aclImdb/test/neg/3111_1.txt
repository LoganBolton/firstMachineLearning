i bought this movie for about 25 dollars at a local flea market i thought that with the cast present in this movie icet rob lowe  mario van peebles are all ok it would be pretty good boy was i wrong this movie annoyed the hell out of me almost every scene drags on too long the scene where rob lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever it was one of the worst scenes i have ever witnessed in a movie the rest is no picknick either my guess is when they finished the movie they only had 30 minutes of film so they made everything last 3x longerbr br conclusion the current 19 rating here on imdb is right on the money this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen go watch some paint dry for 15 hour instead of watching thisbr br if you want to see some better movies made by this director watch mean gunswith christopher lambert  icet or postmortem with charlie sheen instead
