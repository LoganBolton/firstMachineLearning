the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age 56 but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuves appeal the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a students imitation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration
