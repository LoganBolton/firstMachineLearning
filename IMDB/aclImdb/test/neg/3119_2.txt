im accustomed to being patient with films because ive generally found it usually pays off but a few works take tedium to new levels and enter the realm of provocationlast year at marienbad comes to mind well pola x aint no last year at marienbad i can count on one hand the number of films ive walked out on over the years pola x achieved membership in that august group in my defense i believe i made a valiant effort to stand my ground  hoping things would turn around however i finally threw in the towel just shy of the 90 minute mark  quite respectable under the circumstances pola x does not come anywhere near living up to the promise of caraxs earlier work after a 10 year hiatus that must have been bitter for him indeed melville is still spinning in his grave
