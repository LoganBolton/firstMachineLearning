pretentious claptrap updating herman melville  about a young mans vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother getting transferred to his longlost sister who has been raised by gypsies or something like that  not that anyone really cares to unravel its multilayered plot decked out with pornographic sex scenes pseudosymbolic imagery the siblings swimming in a river of blood and other bizarre touches a gypsy child repeatedly insults passersby in the street until she is anonymously beaten to death the deafening music of a rock group utilized in the demolition of old buildings considering the source material and the presence of catherine deneuve who at least gets to bathe in the nude i was expecting a lot more from this one apparently theres an even longer tv version of pola x out there
