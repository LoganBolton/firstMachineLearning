its difficult to express how bad this movie is even in the 1950s when intellectual searching for the meaning of life was fashionable and beatnik rejection of physical comforts clean clothes haircuts etc was a common reaction to the smug middleclass mores of both the usa and western europe this movie would have been a stinker the plot is a mishmash of several dei ex machina if thats the correct latin grammar the acting consists of deadpan stares broken by occasional hysterics by the male lead as well as the females the gratuitous view of catherine deneuves or somebodys breasts are worthy of a budweiser commercial the repeated cacaphonous orchestra rehearsal in the abandoned building is im sure heavy with meaning in the directors mind but to me is just one more stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie  im ranting because my time has been wasted watching this scam excuse for an art flic the scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot  but underneath his clothes this king has no substance
