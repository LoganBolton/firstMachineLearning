scenarist frederick foxs sometimes memorable dialogue and a study cast of oldpros cannot save this lukewarm western about whites pinned down in the desert by a band of bloodthirsty cheyenne indians other than his occasionally catchy dialogue you wont find any surprises in foxs screenplay about this runin between whites and indians the characters in dakota incident generate only minor interest certainly not enough to make them standout as much as some of foxs choice dialogue unfortunately good dialogue is foxs only contribution because this conventional little sagebrusher withers with a lackluster ending that contradicts its previous 80 minutes the ending is as contrived as they come and lacks credibility most of the characters are sympathetic but some just plain lack common sensebr br dale robertson is appropriately tough and leathery as outlaw john banner one of three bank robbers who has to shoot it out with his lowdown noaccount partners veteran western character actor john doucette rick largo fares the best of the badmen while skip homeier wasted in an inconsequential role as banners brother frank banner later dies from an indian arrow doucette tries to gun down banner at the outset of in the action but our lefthanded guntoting hero fakes his own death tracks down largo down later and slaps leather with him in a town called christian flats naturally largo bites the dust this time but banner makes an interesting discovery one of the passengers on a stagecoach from christian flats to laramie turns out to be none other than the bank teller from whom he stole the money not only is john carter john lund on a quest himself to find banner but also he wants to clear his own good name with the bank that has issued wanted posters for his arrest evidently the authorities have mistaken and enlarged carters role in the robbery carter is prepared to take banner to laramie and turn him over to the law but banner has other ideas about laramie banners ideas change when he crosses paths with amy clarke former twentieth century fox beauty linda darnell who wears a bright red dress and still packs quite a bosom as everybody else here has mentioned in their reviews republic studios truecolor brings out the red in everything from darnells fetching outfit to the blood spilled on the ground the problem with director lewis fosters handling of this runofthemill oater is that everything bogs down after the stagecoach loses a wheel and our heroes hole up in a dry wash to defend themselves against the cheyenne the good guys and the cheyenne eventually run out of ammunition but dakota incident never runs out of clich√©s ward bond has several interesting moments as a politically correct politician who defends the way of the redskin by the time that this 88 minute dustraiser concludes youll feel like youve been trapped in a gulch and menaced by marauding cheyenne yourself
