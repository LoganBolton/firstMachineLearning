great another foreign film that thinks its fellini on top of that we have to have more propaganda about murdering disabled peoplebr br i see no reason why we have to be inundated with these thinly disguised euthanasia commercialsbr br i found nothing redeeming about this film what can be redeeming about a man without the courage to carry on in spite of some adversity it does not take courage to commit suicide that is the action of a coward sharing this wish with his woman simply inflicts her with the same illness he has if this had been a film about a mans courage to go on in spite of his problems similar to the jill kinmont story that would have made it a great filmbr br if youre interested in seeing true courage check out the movies about jill kinmont the former skier who was disabled after a bad ski accident
