first i would like to admit that chokher bali was not my cup of tea this movie was evidently not targeted toward the masses its the type that critics would enjoy watching the hype and publicity were quite misleadingbr br i was expecting something very dramatic like devdas understanding that the story and timeperiod demand it i found the movie extremely slowpacedbr br im a diehard aishwarya fan and i regret to say that i thought she was miscast the role of chokher bali required an actress who can portray herself as subversive not innocent and naive everyone else gave a good performance tagores depiction of the human condition does come across the celluloid to give the movie an interesting theme
