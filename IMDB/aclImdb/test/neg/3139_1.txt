this film has to be one of the most boring films ever made the only thing i liked is using argentoesquire lighting in most of the scenes the music is awful and the pace is so slow that you can watch it at 2x the speed and even then it would be slow the story doesnt exist it doesnt even have any shocking scenesbr br it is classified on this site at least as a horror but its not its a sort of an art film exploring the dark side of the human nature if you are into that kind of thing and can stand the slow pace then watch it but id rather recommend you something japanese eg ichi the killer i think that the only reason this film was never in theaters is a fear of audience committing collective suicide caused by the huge amount of boredom generated by this movie these 80 minutes of its length wouldve been better spent watching the paint drybr br i gave it 110 simply because there is no 0 in the pull down menu
