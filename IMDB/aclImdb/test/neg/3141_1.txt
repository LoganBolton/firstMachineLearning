looking for something shocking okay fine the imagery is that thats about it this film attempts to make deep connections with the audience through various symbolism and just ends up being annoying i am not quite sure if the directors purpose was to truly portray some sort of deep message to his audience or if he just sought to shock the hell out of them with gore sex and violence i am thinking that it was probably the firstbut in the failed attemptit simply ended up to be a piece of artsy garbage with lots of blood some obnoxious characters and an over reliance on religious symbolism if youre looking for some independent film to critique for its attempted use of metaphorhave at it if you are looking for a gore flick that will make you queasy and uncomfortable here you go if you are looking for a film that will irritate you to no end because you realize that in the end the message was stupidthe movie was stupid and you will never get those minutes of your life backthis is surely the film for you
