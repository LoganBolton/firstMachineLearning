okay i agree with all the barney haters on this site i think barney and his friends are all ugly looking and obnoxious and the show is very lop sided and unrealisticbr br but the thing that ticked me off the most is how barney presented gays lesbians and bisexuals on his show when talking about same sex parents and relatives that wouldnt be so much of a problem if the creators of this show didnt use so many derogatory stereotypes of homosexuals i mean not all gay men wear mascara and love the colors purple and pink and not all lesbians are ugly and manly looking with a bosom that sags to their abdomen as a bisexual female i just think this is terrible for a childrens show if this were south park i wouldnt mind it because south park is for people who can distinguish fantasy from reality a lot of people who watch barney are little kids or handicapped people who cant usually distinguish fantasy from realitybr br and now that i think about it barney sort of comes off as an ugly gay stereotype himself lets see he doesnt have a girlfriend hes pinkish colored and wears clothes with sequins yes its true on it if you claim to be for the rights of gay and bisexual individuals then stop making a mockery out of them in front of people who dont know any better if barney went blackface and ate fried chicken and watermelon at the same time the show would be pulled off the air before you know itbr br i give this show a negative one out of five dont show your kids such hateful crap there are childrens shows out there that are so less insulting
