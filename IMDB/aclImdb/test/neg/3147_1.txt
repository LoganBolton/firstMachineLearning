i didnt watch this show that much when i was little and i think i only watched 1 episode which was about railroads i believe because i liked trains and still do even then i thought it was a baby show i mostly watched arthur the songs are pretty weird too and i dont think its that educational either they just sing some dumb nursery rhymes this is a dumb show any adults who like it are crazy if you want some good kids shows watch something like arthur mister rogers neighborhood or even better peewees playhouse i thought sesame street was boring when i was little but even that is better than barney trust me this show is pretty dumb there are other kids shows that are better than this one i can see many of the reviews here that a lot of people dont like this show now there are some mature people i hope they take this show off air soon
