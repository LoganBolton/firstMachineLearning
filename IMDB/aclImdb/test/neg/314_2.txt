jacko 1995 was a really bad movie we are talking snoozefest x 100 no entertainment value whatsoever no budget no gore zgrade actors etc etc this film was an awful addition to the horror movie industry and shouldnt have been made the only reason i purchased this movie was because i knew linnea quigley was in it and sure enough she does her obligatory nude shower scene which is lovely yesbr br but as for the film itself i fell asleep at the 40 minute stage and had no desire at all to finish it its just bigtime lame okbr br i love horror movies im an avid fan a massive fan i love low budget horrors i love it all but i hated this rubbish so i think that will tell you all you need to know about jackobr br i give this movie 210 the 2 is for the 2 minute linnea shower scene the movie itself is a total zero
