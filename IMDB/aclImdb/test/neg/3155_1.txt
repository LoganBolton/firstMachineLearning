barney and friendsthe dora the explorer of the 1990sbr br ok ill admit it as a kid barney was my ultimate hero i had my barney plush toy and i used to watch the same barney episodes over and over on videotape maybe cause it was so sugar coated and mindnumbingbr br however by the time i turned 7 i started to hate barney everyone at school would dis barney and i went along with it mainly because it was funny and its what little boys do but a few years later i discovered something else about barney that i will never forgetbr br a person known on the imdb as angelmeiru did an essay for school explaining the dangers of watching barney and he or she posted it in the message boards a lot of those dangers made sensebr br barney is a dinosaur who can magically come to life during a day at school he is supposedly educational or so sheryl leach barneys creator says but really all i can remember him teaching me is that magic can solve anything which is not truebr br to end off this comment id like to tell you a little story there was once a young boy who watched a particular episode of barney one day he was alone when a stranger lured him into his car and drove away with him i dont know the outcome but its safe to assume the child died but why was he abducted in the first place because he watched the barney and friends episode titled a stranger is a friend you havent met yet br br 010
