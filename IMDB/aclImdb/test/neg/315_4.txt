ok i could only find three reasons to consider this film worthwhile considering the extremely low budgetbr br first there was linnea quigley and rachel carter actually the two of them gave me four good reasons to watch and watch i didbr br the only other reason to watch is that a lot of was filmed right down the road now i didnt know this beforehand but i saw an orange county car tag and said wow this was shot in floridabr br i was impressed by the flashback to the past and the ancestors of the young kid but that was really it the killings by the pumpkin man were pretty lame with the exception of the bikerbr br if you want to see quigley and carter ok but return of the living dead will give greater thrills
