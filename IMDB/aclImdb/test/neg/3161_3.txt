this is a film with a lot of potential well done and acted with a rather week and inconsistent script a young woman with two children moves to her mothers cramped apartment because the husbands flat on top of the workshop where he cuts up stolen cars is aggravating their sons asthmahusband ends up in jail when an ex pats stolen car is traced to his shop ex pat ends up being kindgenerous and naive shmoeand rather cardboard and we learn next to nothing of him  but ends up with the girl who trades up despite being sexually satisfied only by her husband i expect this film to be successful in czech where it will be welcome due to its obvious premise  them expats may have money they may even get our women but theyre old soft and our women want to be satisfiedwe may be poor but   now if only could evzen keep marcela satisfied so she would not need to play with herself or if he already had an existing family in italy  but that would complicate things
