i usually dont consider turning a movie off unless its really bad homegrown is a movie i wish i hadnt even turned on the plot is interesting but the acting and writing are too low key i didnt care about the characters any movie that has drug use and gratuitous nudity as its highlights is not worthy of praise the characters spent their time getting high and believe me thats the only way to sit through this movie
