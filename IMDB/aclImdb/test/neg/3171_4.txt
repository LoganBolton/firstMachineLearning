i think homegrown is a bit of a misnomer for this movie  more like plantation grown  but it doesnt have quite the same ring to it my guide described it a comedy but the pathetic travails of these hapless buffoons is not my idea of a belly laugh more in the genre of the farcical thrillerdrama the characters developed well enough  an allstar cast made it ohso promising just a shame the plot was patently absurd ted danson provided a fine cameo as did jamie lee curtis in her walkon part jon bon jovi has this amazing ability to measure thc content in the front seat of his car i guess if you imbibe a few beforehand you should be able to sit through this one  not for the gun shy paranoid types though
