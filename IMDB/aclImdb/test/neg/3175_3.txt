for methis is not a good tv showanimated or otherwiseit is howeverannoying to the nth degreethere are a few reasons for thisin no particular orderfirstthe intro of one of the most pointlessand annoying characters everbatmitethis character serves no purpose for the showwhatsoevermaybe it is intended as comic reliefbut it doesnt work out that waynext upthe jokeri thought it was really ridiculous to have his character let loose with that ridiculous laugh after almost every sentencetalk about repetitivethis gets old really fastalso dont think the had the right actor to voice the characterit just doesnt sound at all like the joker should soundlastlythey made robin look like a complete dorkother than these problemsthe show isnt that badbut these are big enough problems to drastically lower the likability factorfor methe new adventures of batman is a 310at best
