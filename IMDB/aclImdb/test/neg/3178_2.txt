there is no esperanto in this moviebr br i watched this movie specifically because imdb lists esperanto as one of the languages used but imdb is mistaken about the languages used in this film there is absolutely no esperanto at all its almost all english with a couple of words of navajo do not watch this film if youre looking for esperanto movies other options instead are idiots delight with clark gable which has a bit of esperanto incubus is all esperanto although completely mispronounced and there are some esperanto street signs in charlie chaplins the great dictator there was supposed to be some spoken esperanto in gattaca as well but i never heard any br br aside from that the other reviewer is right this movie is a complete messbr br spend your time elsewhere
