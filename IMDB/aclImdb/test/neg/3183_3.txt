before i took a job as a reviewer i never went to films like this and thus remained blissfully unaware that at the soul of the hollywood film lies a deeply womanhating spirit that thrives on putting its knocking little knees on the silver screen for all to either empathize with or revile or is this just a particularly bad year an ugly trend br br here we have yet another seemingly sweet innocent beautiful woman turned lethal weapon the kind that cautions us that beneath every pair of batting eyes and nesting instincts lies a wildeyed beast guaranteed to make everyones life within 50 miles a living hellbr br this months specimen is jewel valentines liv tyler whose simple dreams include having her own little house a backyard fountain and a mondo home entertainment system unfortunately randy matt dillon in his first film in 3 years the dimbulb bartender she picks up at mccools one night intending to rob is less materially oriented the kind of guy who drinks beer out of a toilet plunger he prefers to hunker down in his dead mothers house with few creature comforts save his snowglobe collectionbr br in that same lowrent bar the devil in the red dress also bumps into randys cousin carl the highly amusing paul reiser a lawyer with an ego the size of st louis when things go south within hours enter the widowed detective with a heart of gold john goodman the result three men sustain big bad crushes on the leopardclad progeny of steven tyler and bebe buellcrushes that make them do things that common sense would normally contraindicate like get involved in the first placebr br multiple points of view and flashbacks patch together the frontpage news about how easy it is to fall victim to ones libido especially if youre male as each of these men relates his perspective to a confidant his desire to possess the jewel colors the truth of the situation about 70 minutes later things come together in a reasonably amusing way but its amusement from the same source that tells you that the stuff on the popcorn actually tastes like butterbr br mccools is the first film by norwegian commercial and musicvideo director harald zwart and his pedigree is clear during some of the fantasy segments including one about a car wash soap and a hose that you can probably extrapolate its also the debut project from the production company owned by michael douglas whos found his niche as a toupeed sleezeball in a bingo parlorbr br dillon and tyler are unlikely to win any gold statues for this one though given the onedimensionality of their overdone film noirtype characters you cant really fault them several minor roles drag out unexpected guestsreba mcentire plays carls psychiatrist and andrew dice clay doubles as both the hoodlum utah and his evenscarier brother finally an outlet for all that aggressionbr br this film unwittingly speaks volumes about the dynamics between men and womenor men and their mommies but ultimately youd probably find more lasting psychological truths in a bugs bunny episode i will say that its better funnier more sophisticated than other recent gems like tomcats but should we really have to choose what to see based on what ranks lowest on the misogynism scale
