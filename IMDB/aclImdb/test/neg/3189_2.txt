one night at mccools wants you to think it is a hip and clever black comedy it pushes its quirky characters and outrageous situations at the viewer like a crack dealer making overtime the premise is about a gold digging woman named jewel who dates men to get them to steal and sometimes murder so she can have all the worldly possesions she so desperately desires you know this wouldnt be a bad strategy if she chased after rich guys this film really wants one to believe that a foxy con artist would waste time dating bartenders and andrew dice clay please that major flaw in jewels scheme is really the only entertainment to found found in this stinker and thats unintentional watching it it is not hard to believe there could have been a good movie inside it somewhere one night at mccools just could not decide what direction it wanted to take so just sat in the middle of the road like a dead armadillo it tries to be sexy but no clothes are removed on camera and the few scenes of body head are dreadfully pedestrian there is one recurring scene where a hitman is asking the protaganist played by matt dillon about how the sex is with jewel it seems like matt doesnt know neither do the viewers why was he dating her anyway one night at mccools also wants to be funny sorry bizarre coincidences and misunderstandings didnt even work on threes company whats worse is that this movie really seemed like it was going for a dark atmosphere to accompany its comedy kind of like a sophomoric coen brothers film but its shallow script could not play subtlety nor could its lackluster dirction sledgehammer in any shocks what the audience is left with is a film that seems to busy trying to please everybody and just losing any appeal along the way
