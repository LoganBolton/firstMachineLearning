i dont usually watch hollywood dribble but i was dragged along with some friends to see this one which turned out to be amusing in places but totally devoid of any originality dont worry you wont have to think  tarantinolike storyline leaves enough overobvious hints for us to correctly predict where this ones going about fifteen minutes before every twist  i sat there worrying that the film was building up fairly nicely for a hollywood flick but that it would have nowhere to go at the climax and boy were my fears realised  ymca couldnt save this one but liv tyler almost did i suppose being male and in my twenties helped but she delivered a really good performance  obviously she didnt have to do much except look absolutely stunningly overthetop sexy but what she did she did well mccools is certainly not going to go down as one of hollywoods great successes or should i say shouldnt because the mainstream american film industry is not going anywhere at present and hasnt for a decade at least save the odd hit like american beauty titanic and saving private ryan and even those had major flaws but if youre a teen male do yourself a favour and see liv  she is one hot chick rating 510 see also anything by quentin tarantino any american teen film over the last decade anything with sex as its main selling point
