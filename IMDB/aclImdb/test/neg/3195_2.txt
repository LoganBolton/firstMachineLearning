wow i watched one night at mccools yesterday and all i can say is wowbr br here i go major spoilersbr br would you like a summary of the plot just to see how stupid and pointless this movie is i would never tell anybody to watch it unless i was out to inflict pain upon them anyway heres a glimpse or a huge chunk of the plotbr br randy works for a bar mccools he meets up with this woman named jewel who convinces him to surprisingly have sex with him her exboyfriend ends up trying to rob them and gets killed randy and his cousin and the detective at the scene of the crime all fall for jewel she being the mascot of stupidity uses every one of these guys to get what she wants involving a dvd player randy hires a hit man to kill her and eventually the detective is killed by the exboyfriends psycho brother and the hit man and jewel take offbr br seriously thats it i left hardly anything out except for a few more sex scenes and a nearlypornographic scene of liv tyler as jewel using a hose to flaunt her sexualitybr br what was the point of this movie to be honest i think it was so that the producers and directors could show off their male urges which i think is absolutely uncalled for and just plain stupid when i watch a movie i want a plot i want characters i dont care about sexy woman flaunting anything they might have something should happen in a movie for goodness sake this is as bad as fight clubbr br it gets even worse john goodman is the detective devoted to the higher being i myself wondered why goodman would play in something so outrageously pitiful as this but then i remembered that he was in o brother where art thou as well his reputation just went down a notchbr br liv tyler was an amazing actress in the lord of the rings series in this movie she is nothing more than an unintelligent slut who wants nothing but her way her reputation has gone down seven or eight notches to mebr br i am amazed simply amazed that people would work so hard to make something so stupid the music is absolutely crappy having ymca play while john goodmans character is being killed doesnt really fit the characters are totally unlikeable the plot is one of the most stupid ever conceived by man and to top it off it doesnt even fit into any genre the closest it gets to is pornographic comedy if it was even supposed to be funny which it wasntbr br i think im done ranting now but let me just assure you that nobody in their right mind would ever ever want to see this movie unless they lust for liv tyler as much as the characters do that is
