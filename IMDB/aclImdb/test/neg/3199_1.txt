quite possibly one of the greatest wastes of celluloid of the past 100 years not only does it suffer from a painfully and enormously predictable disjointed script but its clearly a carboncopy of alien ii within five minutes i had correctly predicted who would die and who wouldnt and in which order the special effects are laughable there is a scene where one crew member is mauled unconvincingly by two krites that look like a pair of teddybears and the sparse humor is misplaced and dire there are better things to do with a vcr remote than use it to watch this movie
