after 30 minutesmostly fast forwarding deleted it off my recorder the first critters movie was selfconsciously fun the conversation between the critters just before granny blows them away off the porch for example this film just limps along waiting for someone to shoot it and put it out of your miserybr br i cant imagine anyone who worked on this turkey being proud of itbr br one was fun four just was awful dont bother even if the alternative is watching reruns of a tbs 700 club fundraiser youll at least get some good laughs there and the alien makeup is more believablegrin
