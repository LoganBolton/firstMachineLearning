small spoilers i just bought the dvd of this movie yesterday i saw it with my friends and i couldnt believe what had happenedbr br in the first 3 movies the critters at least had a sense of humor especially the 3rd movie but not only did the critters barely ever make an appearance they werent funny they never made me laugh i must admit that the story did start off nicely after an hour had gone by i remembered that the critters movies were always very short so i thought to myself where the  are the critters they were barely in this movie if that didnt make me mad enough the boy named ethan was sitting on his bed after charlie had murdered the ship and he knew that the critters were still on board in the first movie the brown family was scared out of their minds but here ethan didnt even care it was as if the critters werent even a threatbr br now what im about to say next may ruin the ending but im going to say it anyways in the first movie at the end they had to face the giant critter for a final battle in the second one there was the great ball of critter in the third movie the critter with his fave burned did a spindash from sonic the hedgehog and was going to attack the little kid but at the end of the fourth one which is what made me the angriest the bald critter charges toward ethan and ethan kills it as if it were nothingbr br now something that i really dont understand was what happened to ug he was one of my favorite characters in the first two then after 50 years hes evil that was very disappointing not only that but wasnt he a faceless bounty hunter why was he still johnny steele plus he seemed to have a different personality he seemed much smarter and not as monotone like in the first twobr br being someone who actually enjoyed the first two critters movies and loved the third one i give critters 4 a 210
