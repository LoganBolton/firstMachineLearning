sending the critters to space does seem like an entertaining idea but was there really any need for a third film much less this fourth one a film with brad dourif cant be all bad can it well maybe in this case this cheap scifi effort stars returning lovable klutz charliethe reliable don keith opper who is about to eradicate the last two remaining eggs of the critters species when ughterrence manntells him that hes about to break some sort of transgalactic endangered species law so at ughs request charlie places the two eggs in special holders inside a space pod unfortunately for charlie the damn thing takes off for space and hes trapped inside the smoke under his feet places him into hibernation stasis and he awakes 53 years later inside a decrepitbr br space station as captain rick with fat cigar rude alcoholic malevolence and greedy to the core is blasting open the space pod trying to see what possible novelties are inside for possible sale or trade rick unbeknownest to him lets out the two critters who feast on his flesh you see rick and his crew found the space pod drifting and had intense dollar signs flashing in their eyes so they dock it ugh reports to themnow in a fine prominent position as counselorthat money can be made if they dock at a space station under the terracor organization once the crew dock they find that this station is in ruin with many corridors in bad condition but whats worse is the station computer angela angela is a real thorn in the side to the crew because she has been left unrepaired without proper maintenance for some time it takes some little tricks to get doors to open and close not to mention the elevators and computers brad dourif is al bert pretty much the impresario of computer functionsand is pretty much the real leader of the group for he is the most levelheaded and intelligent he seems to be a fatherfigure to ethanpaul witthornewho just wants to make it to earth to find his fatherthis story though doesnt necessarily reach its zenith bernieeric dareis primarily in the film to be a druggie victim for the critters to munch on in the film charlie after one critter enters ricks mouth and eats away at his throatyuk becomes the crews guide in understanding what they are fighting against the film has some elements i found rather confusingor for a better word ridiculousthe two critters grow in size quickly are somehow able to coordinate a ship for earth not to mention grow themselves to massive size in this laboratory in the space station the crew are able to tap into a log from a dr mccormickanne ramsay whose badge is found in a coat thrown to the side for which ethan discovers her access cardwhich shows signs that terracor was looking into creating a species to exterminate worlds and people knowing this bothers al bert who wishes to leave angela and her bleeding station for greener pastures things dont work out that way because wellmeaning charliethanks in part to al berts ancient colt 45kills a critter which had got on board but in firing several bullets hits major guidance systems in the ship so many repairs on in order but they halt them when ugh and his storm troopers dock at angela and prove they are not what charlie thought theyd be ugh is a changed man and charlie realizes that he is completely evil and his mission is to preserve the crites for purposes of a cruel naturerepresentation of corrupt corporate governmental types this betrayal is what changes charliehe has perhaps grown up a bita wee bitand now understands that some people just change for the worse charlie and ugh will come to a faceoff over those critterswill the crew be able to escape a space station which has set autodestruct this film really doesnt exploit the critters as much as the other three films i believe we can clearly see this as the true end to the franchise the first film was a hoota really entertaining romp but by the time this sequel cam around the critters just wore out their welcome the cast however do give the film a boost the critters do get to feed a bit but their plans of global domination is underdeveloped their role in the film isnt established to the greatest heights i said to myselfyou have this enormous space station with unfortunates trapped on board could you not take this idea and run with it sadly they dont
