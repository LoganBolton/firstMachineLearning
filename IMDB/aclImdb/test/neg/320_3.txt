if you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece this aint it if you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good then this may be for you there are so many unintentional laughs in this film that it could almost be considered a comedy lets start with the opening titles that say jacko and then add the word lantern as if the viewer wasnt able to figure out the movie was about a pumpkin by the giant pumpkin shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie after that the movie goes in about 20 different directions none of which make much sense jacko is everywhere hes in peoples houses in the woods and yet he doesnt ever seem to do much of anything he does make a few kills but the long buildup to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish jacko would take out his rage on you the viewer other than that the plot consists of poor acting gratuitous nudity and a ridiculous plot line the acting in this film is among the worst ive ever seen in my 35 plus years of moviewatching the boy who is the lead in the film the directors son has about as much emotion as a corpse and just about all of the other actorsactresses are just as bad for numerous reasons especially the bugeyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers but having said all this if you take this for what it is that is a steaming pile of dung then you will get a few laughs from this movie what i also found amusing is that the makers of the dvd saw fit to release a 10th anniversary version of this movie as if the original wasnt good enough and someone actually had the idea of making a behind the scenes mini film which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition im not sure whyill give this 3 smashed pumpkins out of 10
