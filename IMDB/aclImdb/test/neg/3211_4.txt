take the secret agent  james bond craze of the sixties mix in some concepts from sax rohmers female fu manchu femme fatale and stir in some absurdest twisted revisionism by director franco  you have the manhating lesbian sumuru or the 7 secrets of  better known as the girl from rio in the usa recalling that man from rio which has nothing to do with this yes this does take place in brazil we must give it that sumuru or sumitra as shes also referred to is like an evil version of modesty blaise played here by actress eaton with that familiar coy smile which most of us first became acquainted with in goldfinger there are numerous closeup shots of her staring off camera slowly opening her mouth probably while watching something unpleasant however she is doubled in her key lesbian scene she controls an entire army of female warriors colorfully costumed and rules a city called femina or something just outside rio de janeiro these concepts which previously appeared in the million eyes of sumuru sound terrific but despite some intriguing set design  visuals it follows the same campy atmosphere of for example the very dated some girls do which came out around the same time and which also featured a female army at first glance the sight of all these armed females usually lined up in a row catches ones interest but after 15 minutes or so you realize theres nothing else there beyond just setting up the visualbr br the plot follows what seems like a secret agent a male arriving in brazil with 10 million dollars he catches the attention of the local crime lord sanders hamming it up as an elderly bondtype villain who sends darksuited thugs in bowler hats to accost him this sets everything up for a 3way conflict between the agent the crime lord and the mysterious sumuru the crime lord wants sumurus secrets sumuru also keeps various prisoners in glass cages  maybe thats one of the secrets this sounds exciting but there are problems which go beyond just a slow pace there are many shots which could have used a lot of tightening one shot of an arriving airplane for example stays on the craft as it settles to a near stop as if this had never been captured on film before theres a similar approach to a typical sunset as if theres something unusual about it the fight scenes are very substandard as if the filmmakers had to use the first takes to add some production value theres a scene of the real rio carnival about midway through im guessing there were various budget problems especially evident in the climactic battle where fake sound effects and smoke cover up a lot of bogus action such as the lack of even reallooking guns  it calls to mind those times when kids use plastic guns and pretend bullets are being fired falling over unconvincingly there are touches of sadism such as torturing a character to get answers and female nudity an early depiction of such after some restrictions were lifted but mostly youll be rolling your eyes hero3 villains5 femme fatales5 henchmen4 fights3 stuntschases3 gadgets4 auto4 locations6 pace3 overall4
