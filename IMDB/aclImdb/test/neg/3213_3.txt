the clever marketeer is he is jess franco naturally also cashed in on the huge temporarily success of psychedelic spy movies like mario bavas ultimately sensational danger diabolik franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film as he could freely insert as much sleaze kitschy scenery and absurdly grotesque plot twists as he wanted to and he partially understood this very well as the girl from rio revolves on a manhating organization led by a funky dressed lesbo that plots to turn all men into obedient slaves unfortunately for them at least the diabolical plans conflict with the daily business of a feared crime syndicate boss played by george sanders all the right ingredients are wellpresented yet this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfying adventure movie the plot is rich on imagination but seemingly only on paper as the action is quite tame the film is also very colorfulbut not too bright and especially shocking was the total lack of vicious sex theres a bit of nudity sure but too few according to normal franco standards all the characters are sick in the head so the least i expected or hoped for were more perverted undertones or frenzied themes franco obviously had a bigger budget as usual to work with and i must say he spends that money well on more convincing set pieces and talented cast members particularly the veteran actor george sanders village of the damned psychomania is one of the best players ever to appear in a franco production too bad even he cant save the girl from rio from being a huge letdown a legendary eurosmut filmmaker like jess franco could and should have done more with this concept shame shame shame
