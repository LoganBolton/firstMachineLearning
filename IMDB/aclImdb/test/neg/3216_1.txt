a little while ago i stumbled upon this dvd while browsing netflix and with such an impressive cast decided to give it a gobr br never before have i seen a movie try to be a new version of an existing great movie scarface and failing so spectacularlybr br the main issue seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be in scarface tony montana was the selfproclaimed bad guy his spectacular rise and eventual downfall wasnt sad it was a great and the only logical ending to someone who lived such a lifebr br damian chapa as director writer and lead actor sees kilo as some sort of hero or at least a complicated guy however he doesnt want to do the grunt work of creating a realistic sympathetic character he was raised by a white mother except for the six months of his childhood where his father a gangster himself showed him his life for reasons never fully explained or even really mentioned he decides he wants to be a drug dealer and actually drives to the bad part of town approaches two dealers and says hey id like to buy some drugs he drops his fathers name and in apparently no time they are not only rich the two guys who are supplying him are acting subserviently to him for reasons again never explainedbr br chapa wants you to feel bad when his character is sentenced to prison when a police informant lies about him however since hes dealt large quantities of drugs before why should one feel sympathy for him going to jail for it this time the most obvious case of chapa wanting to be the good guy is in his prison execution of a white supremacistrapist played by gary busey in scarface tony montana kills someone in prison because he pretty much has to in order to elevate himself its done he moves on but in this case they hamhandedly have to make busey not only a rapistpedophile but also a white supremacist a little overkill dont you think i wont go into detail in this regard too much more but their desperate message of please like me im a complicated gangster fails on every level try as they might i didnt feel bad conflicted or sympathetic when his buddies are killed following a shootout his wife is also killed shortly after she called him out on being a lousy father and during an attempted escape when he decided itd be ok to ride right next to a car filled with gunmen while his wife is in the car and his eventual demisebr br suffice it to say his acting can be fairly summed up as lousy his only achievement bringing the term wooden to starry new heights busey should be credited for actually putting effort into his ridiculous role tiny lister did well stacy keach is playing his warden from prison break role robert wagner is coasting for a paycheck faye dunaway while a touch dramatic still turns in a performance better than this movie deserved brad dourif is in the film for about two minutes and does what he can and to give the film credit it does oneup scarface in one way  jennifer tilly now holds the title of most ridiculous attempt at a hispanic accent sorry robert loggia in short this movie had an interesting premise but a poor story arc unsympathetic characters and hitormiss performances id advise mr chapa to ease up on the forced sympathy next time  really we dont need to like your character we just need to be interested better luck next time
