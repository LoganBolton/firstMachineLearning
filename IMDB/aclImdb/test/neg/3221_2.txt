a friend of mine decided to rent this thing lucky it wasnt my money pretty much wasted my time though a story that could have been interesting is completely wasted by incredibly bad acting and horrible editingdirecting maybe it could become a classic because of all the weird overacting gary buseys character for example all the overacted characters were actually the only thing that made this movie a little interesting as they grabbed your attention for all the wrong reasons obviously where the movie in itself failed miserably in short a waste of time and moneybr br 210
