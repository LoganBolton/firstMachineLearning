well im a huge fan and follower of elizabeth berkley i bought this on dvd off of ebay for my boyfriends birthday we sat down to watch it and it was so boring i dont remember laughing once its only on for about an hour and half and it seemed to take forever to end elizabeth is great in this though maybe its just because im a big elizabeth berkley fan though if she wasnt in it i wouldnt have watched it but every time she came on my face lit up unfortunately even elizabeth couldnt save this film just the overall story and awful comedy makes this a film youd rather miss than waste an hour and a half of your life its a very forgetful film
