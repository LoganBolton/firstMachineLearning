this movie might be ok if not for all the language in it i think that the storyline itself isnt bad but i would be too embarrassed to let my wife or kids see the movie i know that kids will learn all the swear words along the way eventually thats true but parents should not assist them in the process by letting them see and hear the stuff in the guise of entertainmentbr br i used to quite like robert loggia he has a distinctive gritty quality with that rough voice of his but in the last few years all i have seen him do are roles with a lot of language in them if we had an award for overuse of the f word he would have to be a contender unfortunately i think hes now lost me as a fan when i see his name on movies in future i will be thinking twice about picking up that titlebr br look im no prude i use language sometimes too in extreme circumstances but when were watching a movie it is for the sake of e n t e r t a i n m e n t something which we hope will bring us some joy and escapism i do not want to be reminded of whats happening out on the streets in any big city these days and its a hassle to have to wonder whether or not a movie is alright for my family to watchbr br i like matt modine too but its a pity that he has associated himself with a picture which has let his image down like this he probably did an ok job in the movie but i turned off about 14 of the way through after having had my ears assaulted once too often by others in the cast why cant these actors just say no when these scripts ask them to carry on with this gutter language once enough actors especially the big names kick up a fuss about it the writers will stop putting it in the moviesbr br im sorry but i cannot recommend this picture its a pity too because i think it would probably have been alright if it had been made well enough for decent families to watch thank god i only wasted 200 on it
