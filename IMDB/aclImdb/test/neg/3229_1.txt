i hated the book a guy meets a smart dog gets a virgin girlfriend and all the while theyre being chased by a hitman and a ape beast thing both of whom want the dog dean koontz really cant write i read the book at my sisters recommendation i should have known better when i saw this mostly out of a morbid curiosity i actually found myself criticizing it because of the fact that it was untrue to the book even though this is a book that its impossible to make a good movie of i figured at least if theyre going to make a film adaptation of the worst book ive ever read the filmmakers might as well be accurate they turned the guy and his virgin love interest into a boy and his mother for some reason that bothered me most of all even though i seriously doubt keeping it a guy and his chick wouldnt have made it any better quite simply bad book bad movie dont see it
