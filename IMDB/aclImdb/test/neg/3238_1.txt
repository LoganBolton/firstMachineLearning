every time i think about this film i feel physically ill to read such a great book and later discover theres a film of it was a great feeling years later and imagine my joy at switching on the scifi channel and finding it starts in just 5mins up go the titles and then uggg if just a couple of things had changed ok everything is changed numerous characters are removed entirely new rubbish ones are added the main hero is shrunk and deaged by about 30 years and hilariously his girlfriendwife is now his mother even the dog is reduced to sublassie capabilities this is truly appalling cinema at its absolute worst i would quite happily remove my own toenails with pliers rather than sit through another horrific viewing and i urge anyone thinking of watching this  please dont if you own a copy burn it now right now and think how much better your life would have been had this celluloid insult never occurred
