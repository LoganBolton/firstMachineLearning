based on the excellent novel watchers by dean koontz is this extremely awful motion picture that probably shouldnt be viewed by anyone not since the running man have i seen a book butchered so far beyond recognition the difference however is that the running man film was still enjoyable as an amusing action film laden down a million catch phrases this film nope nothing remotely amusing in fact if you love the book as i do youll hate this bastardization even morebr br warningcontains spoilers rightio im basically going to tell you the story here almost in its entirety why because you dear reader do not also need to suffer through this abominationits okay for me because i enjoy watching crap because i like complaining about shtty things now on to the nasty this film revolves around a boy and his mother running away from the government and a mutantmonkeycreaturesoldier which escaped from a destroyed government genetics lab with a supersmart golden retriever which the hero calls furface groan trust me in the novel this story rocked ill get to that later anyway the hero is none other that dreamy boychild corey haim oh im not kidding our hero runs around crackly voice and all trying to convince his mom to help save this dog from the evil government which birthed him and made him genetically ultrasmart the monkeycreature retardedly referred to as an oxcom god help us is also a geneticstew of a creature built to be the ultimate fighter on battlefields of the future michael ironside total recall starship troopersalways plays a badass is also in this film and no i couldnt figure out how anyone convinced him this would be a good idea he plays a government agent with the nso hunting the dog and creature oh yeah heres some spoilerama hes also a creation from the government and the same lab and lo and behold spends most of the movie being a prick and killing peopleand all that killing is supposed to be done by the monkeysoldier instead of a rockin kickass creepy horror film we have a rectal hemorrhage of a teenybopper horror flick the dogs intelligence is discovered alltooconveniently and believed easier than we believe we can see clouds by looking outside breakdownbr br change from book to filmbr br lead character travis turned from man to boychildbr br mans love interest in book nora is now his motherand all her depth and character growth is completely gonebr br lem johnson black man is now white mr ironside this matters as the characters strength was built on his heritage in the bookbr br relationship between two authority figures completely ignored lem now kills the guy who was originally his best friendbr br one principle character in the book is now totally absent the immortal that hunted the heroesmaybe this is supposed to be ironside but then why is he someone elsebr br dog never receives deserving name of einstein in the moviebr br no part of the book took place in a high schoolat least nothing that had strong bearing on the plotbr br takes place over a matter of days rather months like the bookunrealistic pacingbr br corey haims girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters in the bookand they never met in the bookbr br character of lem johnson is no longer coolheaded instead hes a total asshole that bullies his way through peoplebr br hero travis was part of delta force military segment specializing in hunting terrorists instead his dad who is never seen in the film was part of that groupbr br perceived intelligence in the monster now totally absentbr br subplots involving soviets and the mob completely gutted out of the storybr br these are just the most obnoxious changes and the ones i could remember off hand and a day laterbr br the goodbr br eventually after 90odd

br the badbr br okay the writing for one is extremely awfulbr br the direction is so halfassed that anyone watching the film will feel superior to everyone involved in itbr br the acting is crappy and weak especially from corey haimbr br loose weak watered down storybr br the monster looks just pathetic that is when we are actually allowed to see the bloody thing its head is gigantically oversized the yellow eyes that were so much a part of the thing in the book are seen for no more than two seconds instead of a lean powerful fast intelligent killing machine we have some jackass in a pukeugly monkey suit forced upon usbr br absolutely no character developmentbr br even the violence and gore are done poorly for fck sakes this is supposed to be a horror film usually violence is at least done wellbr br the uglybr br the idea that dean koontz whored out his brilliant novel to become this filthy fcking piece of sht brings me dangerously close to vomiting all over myself and anyone near me there are movies worse than this headacheinducing as that idea may seem but so far only alien vs predator at least to me is a bigger travesty and more painful disappointment br br memorable scene
