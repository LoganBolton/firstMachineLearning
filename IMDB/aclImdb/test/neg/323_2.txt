ugh pretty awfulbr br linnea quigley gets top billing but her character doesnt have a big part who is her character supposed to be anyway the little boys aunt another user commented on her getting nude in a shower scene while there was a shower scene in the movie it was a head and shoulders shot perhaps there are some alternate versions of this moviebr br quigley does have a bigger part than john carradine cameron mitchell and brinke stevens though carradine shows up briefly in a monkish robe reciting vague dialog no other characters are in the scene with him though hes sort of composited in or else there are overtheshoulder shots unquestionably belonging to someone else theres also a really bad photo of him in a cameo locket it looks like a bad photocopy and a decent picture of him in a family bible he conjured up jacko originally or something like thatbr br cameron mitchell briefly shows up on a tv as a tv horror host brinke stevens is in the movie hes showing the coven in which she runs around a cemetery in a robe evidently theres more of the brinke footage as a bonus feature on the retromedia dvd double feature mark of the witchthe brides wore bloodbr br jacko whats it about darn if i know a little boy is told a story about a pumpkinheaded demon killer and he and some other kids are scared by a woman they think is a witch for some reason she follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for halloween put your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes etc the pumpkinheaded killer shows up several times to hold onto branches while he watches people or hold his scythe in front of the camera and pose with it for a while sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around holding things and actually kills peoplebr br there are also some flashbacks to a western or prairie family with the little boy playing the little boy in that family too ancestors of his i think i think they figure into jackos backstory but im not sure howbr br the little boy is ostensibly the main character but we dont really learn anything about him except that he wears glasses has nightmares and will fight bullies even if hell get beat up in the process more time should have been spent establishing his character i couldnt have cared less if he diedbr br not recommended not even for halloween
