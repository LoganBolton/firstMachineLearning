i usually give sequels the benefit of the doubt and go easy on them but thisis very poor the exact same as what happened in the first film happens here again the exact same only they wanted younger kids to be able see it this accounts for the repeated presence of bugs bunny but why they threw in one fck is beyond mebr br they didnt even bother to change jackie masons character from dangerfields let me explain in caddyshack rodney dangerfield played a boorish real estate owner who enrages the uptight members of bushwood country club in this movie jackie mason plays a boorish real estate owner who enrages the uptight members of bushwood country club a big effort they made to change the content of the script huh no i dont think so a very unfunny dan aykroyd shamefully copies bill murrays character he even goes after the gopher now more like a gremlin in much the same fashion as murray did br br there is not a laugh to be had a sample of the comedy in this film jackie mason is getting ready for a hot date with dyan cannon he is in the bathroom is his robe he moves to the door to get dressed in his bedroom whenthe door handle breaks off wow thats the best they can do eight years to think of a completely new sequel and thats all we get i could have pulled a better script out of my assbr br see it only if youre a diehard fan of the original its the only way youll find any kind of laughs in it everyone else steer clear
