this film should never have been made it stinks its awful its no good its bad its terrible starting to see a pattern here jackie mason is certainly no rodney dangerfield gone were ted knight and bill murray who along with dangerfield were essential to the first film it seems that the three of them the stars all knew a stinker of a script when they saw one the one who didnt have the good sense to bow out of this was chevy chase who stuck around but was extraneous to both films in my opinion this film is quite simply not funny nor does it have any other endearing qualities this thing relies heavily on antisemitism to work and it works to its detriment i hated this thing a waste of everybodys time
