have you heard the theory of cloning redundancy where a copy is poorer than the original caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of that they try to duplicate everything from the first movie now in a few cases this work robert stack is actually a little better than ted knight when they play essentially the same character i actually like randy quaid who is no more or less offensive than bill murray in the original but jackie mason is no rodney dangerfield and worse of all c2 demonstrated once and for all that dan ackroyd is one of the worst comedy actors of all time there is very little that i like him in and c2 nailed the coffin shut on his comedic career as far as im concerned he seems to feel the same sticking more to tuffy like driving miss daisy and hosting psifactor other than that its mostly been there done that for caddyshack 2 watch the original twice rather than each version once and youll get more for your rental money
