i have vague memories of this movie being funnybr br having seen it again either i have changed or i was thinking about a another film altogetherbr br it seems as if we are supposed to be sympathetic to jackie masons character however nothing in the movie actually engenders that emotion its notable that he is really the only person accorded tender dialogue with loved ones noone elses character is allowed to rise to the status of even vaguely humanbr br i dont even like golf but as the film went on i found myself really rooting for robart stack and the club guys really hoping they would repel mason and chevy chase
