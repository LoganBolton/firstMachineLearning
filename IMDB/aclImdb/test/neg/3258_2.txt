caddyshack ii is one of those pictures which makes you ask why as in why was it funded why was it made and why was it released into the public domainbr br to say the least its a bad film it serves little purpose but to underline how superior its prequel was by setting an almost identical set of characters against each other in a similar storyline as a new money land developer attempts to buy out the establishments golf course sanctuary br br right off the bat making the followup a whole 8 years after the original is somewhat bizarre i mean if your going to cash in on highly successful picture such as the first one then you have a window of a few years to do so but leaving it 8 years means that the formula is hardly fresh enough to simply do a follow up or poor imitation as this is so your sort of obliged to reward fans of the original by giving them at least reference to if not indeed actual contributions by the actors who made the first one so memorable but theres little if any of thisbr br instead we get cheap imitations okay the passing of ted knight in the interim years would have made it impossible to bring back the memorable judge smails but robert stacks inclusion as chandler young a fellow wasp elitist akin to the smails character is unimaginative and seriously lacking in the sort of anarchic frustration that made knights turn so watchable jackie masons jack hartounian is a feeble attempt at recreating the non stop wisecracks delivered by the al czervik rodney dangerfield character of the first while dangerfields role was endlessly quotable masons is completely forgettable br br bill murrays laughably ridiculous groundskeeper carl spackler and his war of attrition with the pesky local gofer is substituted for his ghostbusters costar dan ackroyds role as the militant capt tom everett whos high pitched voice just splits your sides with frustration as opposed to the intended laughterbr br randy quaid  brilliant as cousin ed in the national lampoons vacation series is quite the opposite here playing hartounians unstable lawyer the looks of disbelief shown by the actors looking on at quaids characters intended to be hilarious acts of inappropriate violence echo that of the audience your not laughing your just asking what the hell is he doingbr br chevy chase shows up all be it occasionally and wisely rather fleetingly considering the disaster thats perpetrating itself around himas club pro tye webb in the films only direct reference to the original not withstanding the golf course itself that is with his deeply tanned skin and loud hawaiian shirts chase looks like hes just got back from a lengthy summer vacation and needs a paycheck he distances himself from the events in the actual picture enough that he takes little of the blame and leaves with some all be it little credibility still intact br br jessica lundy as masons daughter kate takes over from the danny noonan role of the original as teenager struggling against class divides sounds ridiculous doesnt it at least in the first danny an irish catholic from a blue collar family and his laughable attempts to make inroads into the whiteanglosaxonprotestant dominated world of the golf club mover and shakers was played out to some memorable set pieces such as being dismissed by the resident lutheran bishop as well as being mocked by the offspring of the local yacht club lundys embarrassment of her fathers inability to fitin is hinted at being because of his jewish roots that aside it may also have to do with him being a classless moron but such intricacys are swept aside though i stopped caring long before they were resolved at the end of the day noonan was trying to get ahead in life miss hartounians biggest problem is getting the hob nobbers at the local golf club to like her multimillionaire father so that she can get a date with the clubs prodigal white kid or so i gathered br br anyway in summation its poorly written badly scripted with lame set pieces and wastes a lot of talent indeed kudos if you were able to sit through it to its conclusion it really is a penance there is that question mark though of why did so many of the original actors not return as opposed to being replaced by performers who on paper at least looked their equals maybe they just werent asked or perhaps i suspect they actually read the script stick to the original
