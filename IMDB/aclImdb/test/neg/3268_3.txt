caddyshack ii is nothing compared to the original caddyshack but there are legitimate reasons for it 1 rodney dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this film but he didnt like the script wanted to change it his request was denied so he didnt do the film 2 it was low budget bill murray had grown to superstar status ted knight passed away in 1986 and chevy chase the so called ace of the first movie although it was rodney all the waycouldntt be on more than 5 minutes because it would cost too much to pay him but you had dan aykroyd robert stack randy quaid and jackie mason all serviceable substitutes who none had their best performances
