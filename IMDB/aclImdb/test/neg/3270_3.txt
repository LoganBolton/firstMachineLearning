every time i watch this movie blood comes gushing out of my eyes yes you read that correctly ive watched this wretched foul thing more than oncebr br caddyshack 2 went wrong for so many reasons harold ramis dialing in a script and abandoning the direction duties rodney dangerfield wisely walking away from the project because they wouldnt allow him to tinker with the script bill murray showing excellent judgement and not being part of it and a puppet being pushed forward as the feature player of a cast who deserved much betterbr br i cant help but think of dyan cannon in this and wonder why shes perpetually laughing and smiling the only conclusion i can draw is that she is indeed the face of pure evil stay with me a moment she must have been watching as the film came together and revelled in the untold agony that it would inflict on countless soon to be extremely sorry movie goers who would have this film inflicted on them she may also have been extremely drunk thats what i need to be right now to wash the foul taste of this complete and utter failure out of my mind if im lucky itll be washed out foreverbr br i have seen this film several times i blame several of them on childhood and being a very dull and dimwitted boy who apparently had no aesthetic sensibility perhaps puppets are just funnier when youre a kid no the muppet show is funnier now  guess i was just dull caddyshack 2 is that rare kind of film that is so extraordinarily disappointing on so many levels that you convince yourself after the end credits that it couldnt have been as bad as all that it was it is it will only get worse with timebr br my reasons for going back to this film mercifully are becoming fewer randy quaid is limited in his role as jackie masons lawyer his opening scene isnt bad and brought out my only chuckle we see him a few more times but it becomes as tired as the rest of the movie and descends with unfortunate rapidity from incidentally amusing to vapid wasteland randy quaid acquits himself well and this film owes him big time because if there was reason to watch this film as anything other than a torture tactic he was itbr br maybe thats the trick of the movie it has enough potentially endearing qualities that people watch it are horrified at what theyve done to themselves but later because the pickings were so slim can remember only what did actually amuse them years later they unwittingly watch it again and the cycle repeatsbr br jackie mason takes a lot of the blame for this film but in fairness im not sure he deserves it hes really trying out there but it is impossible to not to notice that he spends the entire movie doing a rodney dangerfield impersonation thats who the movie was written for but im not sure even he could have saved it ultimately this fails miserably through terrible direction bad editing shall we count continuity errors and a rehashing of the same story with none of the wry humour or heart that made the first film endearingbr br dragged kicking and screaming up to a three out of ten instead of two by randy quaids bulldog determination it isnt even bad enough to laugh at ive definitely seen worse but trust your memory  this one is a dog if youve never seen it youve made excellent life choices and i salute your excellent judgement
