i saw this on sale  new  at my local store for 6 and said hey an action film with that guy from bloodsport and enter the dragon directed by the guy who did enter the dragon  and its cheap so i bought it oops this is possibly the worst film ive ever seen and ive seen some dooziesbr br you know how movies which are intentionally campy like evil dead ii and deadalive are awesome you know how movies that are supposed to be serious but turned out so awful that you have to laugh out loud and watch them again like lionheart an old van damme film or john carpenters vampires are pretty cool this film ironheart manages to be neither of those i dont know what the filmmakers were thinking but it looks as if this movie was made with no time to shoot no budget for anything and no script to speak of while im on the script note i should point out that bolo yeung has no lines in this movie  the only reason he gets first billing on the box is the fact that hes the only actor in the film that youll ever recognize unless youre a jackie chan fan in which case youll recognize the bad guy  and youll want to call him giancarlobr br whats also sad is that this film is from 92 by that time t2 judgment day had come out so you know that the era of 80s campiness was over but not quite after this youll think 80s chuck norris films highschool comedies and jasonfreddy sequels were works of sheer genius br br things to knowbr br 1 nobody in this film can act for beans the closest you get is richard norton looking appropriately rich and cocky and bolo yeung looking appropriately mean  and cocky everything else is dreadfulbr br 2 the martial arts scenes are forgettable  just many instances of white guys with lots of muscles taking off their shirts yelling running at britton lee getting kicked by britton lee getting punched by britton lee then falling down even the final showdown against bolo is disappointingly short and about as creative as the design of my running socks and equally stinkybr br 3 the rest of the action is pathetic too the guns look like they came from the toy department at kmart and indeed they fire with the sound of a capgun when someone gets shot they bounce around a little bit then lie still with splotches of brownishred liquid on their clothes britton lee apparently gets shot in the side but you dont see it at all then later that day you see the wound  ive had paper cuts that were worse than thatbr br 4 of course then the girl dresses the wound then they kiss then next thing you know theyre lying in bed talking after sex huh what believable development of the love interest as well as any kind of character development at all are overlooked completely in this film remember how bruce lees characters didnt need to have sex with anybody to be coolbr br 5 the car chase is by far the worst ive ever seen it looks like the director was sitting on the curb with a handheld camera as the two cars weaved down the road doing oh i dont know about 30 miles an hour dont try this at home kids these people are professionals hahbr br 6 really bad writing heres a scene for you lee is being followed so the girl follows the followers to warn lee but her car is too slow so by the time she catches up lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and theres a gunfight in progress lee has killed two bad guys but the third is shooting at lee when the girl almost runs lee over so the bad guy runs away huh then the girls car stalls and she cant start it she tells lee shes involved now and shes coming with him he points out to her that they cant leave her car there because the bad guys will trace it to her she somehow convinces him that he should decide how to deal with this problem  so he shoots the gas tank and blows up her car and remember later that same night they have sex huhbr br 7 if you look closely in more than half of the nightclub shots the dancers are very much out of sync with the music the dancers are also all way too coordinated with each other apparently in the 80s all people at dance clubs took dancing lessons there is a girl in the dj booth with a microphone but she never does anything except dance the bouncers tell people who are fighting to take it outside  without moving their lips in one scene the only bouncers lee and stevo pass by are just inside the entrance but with their backs to it also apparently if youre a major character in the film you can go straight to the head of the linebr br 8 lee notices the first time he is being followed but he doesnt notice the second time  even though its the same guy in the same car the girl however notices bad guys get followed twice but they never noticebr br 9 lee is worried the bad guys will trace the girls car back to her even though they have already seen him show up where she works twice the girl proceeds to leave her child at work in the care of a friend while she is off having sex with lee do not learn parenting from this filmbr br cant think of more gripes right now  you get the idea  ironheart is so bad it aint even funny its sad
