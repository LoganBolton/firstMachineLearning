if you havent seen the war at home let me tell you what youve been missing its a show about ethnic diversity and sexuality that could have only been edgy and funny in the 60s where america has grown in its acceptance of race sexual preference religion etc this show seems to argue with that progress its a backward step in americas evolutionbr br for example one of the ongoing jokes of the show is that the white daughter is dating a black kid from school this is obviously hilarious seeing as how you cant see that type of relationship at any mall in america ive lived in both small towns and big cities so dont give me some type of red state blue state excuse not only is this the joke but the father who is supposedly not racist finds this disturbing and asks his daughter repeatedly to break up with her boyfriend which opposes his he may sound like a racist but hes just dumb characterbr br if this isnt enough a second running joke is that one of the sons and soon to be metrosexual is ambiguous in his sexual orientation the audience learns over and over that he isnt gay but the father isnt convinced so he constantly avoids his son afraid perhaps that his son will hit on him as all gay men are nymphomaniac wild men who cant control their will the father always comes to some acceptance of his son once per show but usually goes on avoiding him in the following episodebr br the only way this show can cure itself in my eyes is if the continuous exposure to these unnatural occurrences in life open up the fathers eyes a little but that may be too much to ask  and besides with jokes like these im sure well have hilarity in episodes to come like  episode 13 father votes against women voters and episode 14 my muslim neighbor is a terroristbr br please drop this show fox were living in a different world from the one your execs grew up in
