i cringed when i heard the first canned laugh track in the first few seconds of the show but yet i gave it a chance you know when someone offers a line which is only slightly amusing and you hear an obviously fake laugh track explode in uproarious laughter that its a show aimed at morons who need to be told yes its funny go ahead and laughbr br ugh i couldnt stand this show as it revealed itself i cant speak for everyone  after all some people actually like that idiotic show stacked which makes me wish to vomit i can imagine those who like stacked might actually like this drivel too some people still get a kick out of the old pull my finger gag to me this show is just about as witty  and just about as originalbr br the themes were old and tired the jokes were lame and hackneyed the characters were ones weve seen everywhere before  and the worst of any you might imaginebr br so if you like things like burping words and neighbors who say pull my finger you might actually like this show otherwise pass it by its stupid  and not in a clever or original way this one is about as old and tired as any show has ever been at its premiere
