this show is just another bad comedy which will probably be cancelled after two seasons its not just that the jokes are sexistracisthomophobic theyre also not funny and clichéd in the first episode the father said something along the lines of  i wish women didnt go out and get jobs and have the same rights as men blah blah blah that really helps attitudes huh then he was making fun of his son saying he was weird what parent says their kid is weird so overall this show is boring unoriginal offencive clichéd and most of all not funny yeah american dads offencive but it does also make you laugh and is obviously taking the micky thats the difference
