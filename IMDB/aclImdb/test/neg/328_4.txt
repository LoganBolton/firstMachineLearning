i bought jacko a number of months ago at a blockbuster video sale and at the time i wasnt expecting anything outstanding from it upon watching it i realized i not only got less than i could have ever bargained for but a whole lot more as well it seems strange i know and it is but its perfectly fitting when you consider that the utter weirdness that is jackobr br the movie follows a young boy named shawn kelly somehow thru ancestral ties he is marked for death at the hands of a demented scythe wielding pumpkin man this pumpkin man was killed by shawns greatgrandfatherunclecousinetc and now that the villain has been resurrected shawns death is apparently crucial to his hellbred mission of vengeance anyway much horror ensues as jacko hacks his way thru various neighbors before battling shawn to the finishbr br im not so much here to discuss the plot as i am to determine who may find any worth in this movie i can honestly tell you that jacko is one of the most poorly made movies in the history of time the acting is deadpan except when it should be the script is apparently a 1st grade group project and the production budget must not have exceeded 150 some of the most laughable death scenes are carried out in this antithriller and theyre all the more humorous when you realize director steve latshaw actually seems serious in his moviemakingbr br and yet i heartily enjoyed the film i can call it a terrible horror movie yes but i can also say i had a great time watching it with my friends and have watched it several times since that fateful first viewing many people including some of my friends will find this movie intolerable and needlessly timeconsuming and thats understandable if youre like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that take themselves seriously youll find jacko an instant classic which is also understandablebr br thats why its so hard to rate this movie if i were rating jackos quality as a film i wouldnt give it anything in fact the studio would owe me stars yet if i were rating its on the basis of pure enjoyment id give it an 8 or a 9 ill give it a 4 so to be somewhere in the middle i recommend everyone go out rent this and form their own conclusion
