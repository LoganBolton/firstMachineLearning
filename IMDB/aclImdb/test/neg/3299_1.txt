i watched the first episode of the war at home because i thought it was worth replacing arrested development boy was i disappointed it should be clear to everyone that this show was blatantly rippedoff of grounded for life titus and marriedwith children since they are all similar in plot and overall mood the so called punch lines are all repetitious and formulaic even more those punch lines arent even funny at all to me theyre more along the lines as being crass and crude the main character dave gold acts like a white trash thug who thinks hes being funny and cool which hes not even hillary daves daughter said so in the episode gaza stripbr br in the episode dream crusher hillary wanted to be a singer but was actually pretty bad dave and vicky then gladly decided to crush her dreams by telling her she sucked after that she then wanted to be a child psychologist and planned on going to harvard after telling dave and vicky so and left the room the two of them began mindlessly mocking her also in the first episode dave said of hillarys black boyfriend does she actually think were gonna let her go out with this guy id rather drink my own urine that line has to the dumbest line in the history of television and dave is constantly making fun of larry his son when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks hes gay and is a geek also lets not forget that he also made fun of larrys fat girlfriend dave is the father hes supposed to stand up for his son no matter what the war at home is without a doubt the worst tv show for family that clearly explains why the show should be canceled since it spreads a racism and homophobic agenda its like the show wants to be funny for always putting in that stupid laugh track every time someone says something but the lines are all somewhat forced idiotic and pathetically juvenilebr br another reason why the shows horrible is the acting mike rappaport and kyle sullivan are terrible terrible actors rappaport has to always move his hands around when hes in front of the camera he not only does this on this show but he also did that during his time with boston public sullivan talks and acts like some kind of robot every time he acts he also did this in malcolm in the middlebr br so to wrap this whole thing up you all got your reasons of whats wrong with this show 1its unoriginal 2the acting sucks 3its not even funny 4all the jokes are the same 5has lousy script 6the characters are pitiful and unlikable 7the dads a ripoff of archie bunkerbr br fox needs to take this trash off the air because anythings better than this
