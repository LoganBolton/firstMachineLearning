this film seems well made and more efforts should be made to promote films by women that aside this film is also profoundly disturbing in that it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character that is profoundly disturbed if youve seen any of the promotional material you might think this is a poignant film about a relationship thats reached its end but none of that suggests how really disturbing the central premise isbr br a woman threatens suicide unless her soon to be ex agrees to relive here most treasured memories of their relationship when told how unfair to say the least that such a threat is tessa the purported protagonist suggests that lifes not fairbr br huh this character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover into staying and coaxes him into sexually oriented behavior which she initially denies as a motive all the while assuring him this isnt sexbr br reverse the genders have the leads played by tracey gold and brian austingreen and this could air in feature length on lifetime with a title like hostage to obsession there is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that would encompass tessas behavior in this filmbr br props to kristen thomson for playing a borderline psychotic manipulative ex to a t perhaps too well because there is no welladjusted person male or female who could watch this and not have shivers run up their spine
