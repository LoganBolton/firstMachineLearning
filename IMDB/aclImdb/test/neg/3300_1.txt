there are shows and films ive seen and subsequently read reviews of on imdbcom that ive disagreed with and been happy to accept that there has just been a difference of opinionbr br reading positive reviews of this filth merely puts me in mind of a sinister conspiracy involving tv network employees being ordered to browse the internet posting unconvincingly positive reviews for programmes they themselves are responsible forbr br how else would one explain a review opining that this show is sure to become a phenomenon a full year after its become clear its going to be nothing of the sortbr br i wont waste words describing this mess but suffice to say if you enjoy wives who emasculate their husbands husbands who emasculate their sons children who are disrespectful jackasses towards their parents and absolutely no other threads of behaviour or subtext to legitimise characters that are basically just unfunny oneliner spewing automatons then watch this showbr br i on the other hand have some seinfeld dvds to get throughbr br futurama  cancelled titus  cancelled arrested development  cancelled the war at home  renewedbr br no justice
