like many other people ive heard about more and i wanted to watch it due to the music that was composed by pink floyd i must say that i was truly disappointed not because of the music but the movie in itself its a boring insipid movie that lacks rhythm where does this disappointment come from according to me from different things first of all the movies subject the drug links up badly with the idle sunny atmosphere of the movie this one should have taken place in the sordid areas of paris and should have gave birth to a dark and helpless climatefor example moreover its supposed to tell a descent into hell but this descent is softened and barely sketched out barbet schroeder doesnt insist enough on the dramatic side of the story you could have wished a little more of madness cutting on another hand schroeder doesnt succeed in gaining the audiences emotion and adherence in front of the two main characters distress you watch carelessly their trials with drug whereas the two main actors theyre perfectly inexpressive and hardly evolve during the movie especially mimsy farmer at the end you only retain the beauty of the mediterraneans landscapes bathed in sunlight the film created a huge sensation when it was released in 1969 nowadays it br br seems dated the hippy culture is nothing less than a faraway memory
