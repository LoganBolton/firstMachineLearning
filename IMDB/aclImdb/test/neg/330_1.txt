man this movies sucked it appeared to have like seven different plots going on at once and they all made little to no sense the special effects costumes and all that stuff were beyond awful the acting was particullary bad everything seemed so forced especially the lines from the woman with the huge eyes and the little kid his noooooo as he gets burried is so unenthusiastic its laughable a good portion of this movie is rather funny anyway the one womans death where she shoves a knife into a toaster gets electrocuted and magically turns into the crapiest skeleton dummy in the world had my friends and i laughing for a good ten minutesbr br bottom line if youre into watching really horrible movies seek this one out if not run for your life
