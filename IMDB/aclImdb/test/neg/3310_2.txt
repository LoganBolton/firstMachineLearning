great music but aint these people pathetic a true period piece of the trippy sixties and it left me depressed the director paints the wrong side of the jetset life and it stings as a hornets nest if the culture of the time led people to do these things it appears to me that it was all a journey of no discovery only despair i tried really tried to like this film but these people arent anywhere on my page yes it would be nice to see the world go away for awhile but i always plan to come back drugs arent the cause of these characters downfalls its their lousy attitudes Â– these guys passionately drink their cup of poison they cheapen their lives and in the end cheapen the journey that is life has romance ever been so darkbr br cheers interesting scenery wonderful soundtrack by pink floydbr br caveats dated drugs depressing thoroughly unlikable characters they arent flower childrenbr br only for the curious since most packages swoon the pink floyd connection  rare floyd tracks many will have never heard before as fm aint what it was br br rating two stars
