ok well i guess it was worth my time sitting through this once but i wont be watching it again there are several things about this film that irritated mebr br first mani really hated the characters i had the same problem with sid and nancy i have a hard time rationalizing spending a fair chunk of time following characters who i really dont care about and cant relate to its not that the actors or the writing were technically bad it was that the characters were written in such a way that i just had contempt for them and as the movie went on i almost wanted to see the sky fall on them and this leads me to the second problem and a question which i think is at the heart of this movie was the intent to simply document this generation and these types of bohemians who were i guess wandering around europe in the 60s was the intent to criticize and lambaste them or was this film some kind of a warning my final assessment of the film that is to say in determining if there was anything salvageable here at all hinges on this questionbr br regardless these characters are really unlikeable and as a consequence its hard to really give a crap about the plot or what happens to them if this was some sort of statement on this generation then the film becomes a little more tolerable it is clear that schroeder is not some kind of geriatric establishment square so the way he proceeds here carries more weight than say the countless stupid aip films set in or concerning the 60s counterculturebr br at bare minimum this film has two things going for it  first the soundtrack obviously i like how cymbaline is used here and others have mentioned it too as it takes the forefront in the movie i am guessing that if you are a pink floyd fan and want to see it for that reason nothing you read here is likely to stop you from watching it anyway it wouldnt stop me either the curiosity of hearing pink floyd in a movie may be enough to just barely get you through thisbr br secondly there is some nice scenery ibiza looks like a nice place to visit maybe im just sick of looking at los angeles new york and chicago in films but european films which take the time to actually show us europe the beautiful or the ugly  mostly beautiful here are always welcomebr br but i really see no particular genius here no revolutionary camera work not even a moral tone message sensibility or plot that has anything new to say perhaps what was revolutionary about this was merely that it came from a guy like schroeder  a film critical of a mindset that at least in part made his movies marketable to that extent it is an honest film theres no glorification of the abject excesses of the 60s here which is perhaps something you might expect in fact the portrayal of the characters in this film closely mirrors the somewhat distorted in my opinion modern cultural memory of that generationbr br oh yeah bunch of yawn nudity and sex here nothing new if you watch these kinds of movies from this time period i guess it was considered novel or provocative or something at the time i dont find it offensive or titillating i doubt you will either rather it just extends the running time of an already tedious film in its own way this particular use of sexuality in movies of the time especially european ones has become a bit of a clich√© but i guess in hindsight you cant blame them they were just in that decade able to get away with it and i suppose im guessing here the very presence of this kind of graphic sexuality was a political or social statement in and of itself that being that sexuality was a part of life that this generation wasnt going to be all weird about like their parents werebr br should you watch it if youre a pink floyd fan surei guess its worth a watch in any case the valley is a better film i went into this movie expecting largely what i got if you dont normally watch these kinds of arty avant garde films and dont know what to expect this is bound to be annoying as hell this is a normal healthy reaction  br br if youre not a pink floyd fan im not sure why youd spend your time here i noticed one fellow who left a comment did enjoy this movie quite a lot so maybe im just missing something i dont need guys running in slow motion from fireballs special effects explosions or anything like that to enjoy a movie but i do need some kind of handle  i need to find something to like about a movie and generally i need to sympathize with some aspect of the characters plight barring that some novel filmmaking will work camerawork and so forth here theres just nothing to hold on to except for pink floyds magnificence which is just enough to make this tolerable at bare minimum if youre a pink floyd fan to begin with youll like the bit with cymbaline i promise
