specks of white and various shapes a beautiful nude random images that is what this little experimental short film isbr br its kind of interesting to think how in the early days of film such images could be transferred onto film but despite my love of a lot of surreal images and films and a fascination with the bizarre this film just didnt do it for mebr br im not sorry i watched it but if there is any underlying meaning in it i dont get it visually it is not that outstanding in my humble opinion as an example of dadaism i suppose it would fit in quite well since it seems to reject any semblance of logic or reason though i would have preferred that it do it in a more visually interesting waybr br but to each his own
