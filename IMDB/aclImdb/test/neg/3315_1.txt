i have never before voted 1 for a movie on the imdb but for this one i am sorry the scale doesnt go down to 10br br all i can say abou this movie is that i saw it in a sneak preview and it was my worst movie experience ever i dont mind the stupid jokes i can live with the silly story but when i see those dumbly grinning main characters with their pseudoforeign speech only germans will understand what i talk about i felt i kind of loathing i never thought i was capable of if they had left them out the thing may actually have been acceptablebr br theres not much more to be said about this one you may laugh once or twice because its so ridiculous but that doesnt make it any better it is definitely not funnybr br if you live outside of germany be happy and rejoice that this awful work will most likely never make it to your cinemasbr br if you do live in germany avoid this movie at all costs
