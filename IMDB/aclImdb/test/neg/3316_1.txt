this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen not only that it is a comedy which isnt funny but its also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effectsbr br the two heroes with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite a lot that they touched each others genitals all the time but the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal by referring to german history and to show sensitive aspects of the heroes which finds its climax in showing how erkan and stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their joyful lifestyle  but i hadnt expect anything better by director michael bully herbig who also made two not funny tvshows a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny sfcomedy movie but erkan and stefan had been just a little better in some of their standup programs for me the only good thing about the movie is alexandra neldel who is very beautiful to me
