even if i had not read anne rices queen of the damned from the vampire chronicles i probably would still have thought this movie was just awfulbr br it was tasteless plotless it made absolutely no sense at all i sat for a while pondering the plot disassociated from the book and the longer i thought of it the worse it was to associate it in any way with the prior chronicles film is ridiculous as it is ridiculously inconsistent with that movie let alone the book the bare few ideas taken from rices genius in the vampire chronicles were butchered and ridiculedbr br it is an absolute insult to anne rice fans everywhere and such a pathetic excuse for a legacy in being aaliyahs last film truly its an insult to aaliyah fans as wellbr br possibly the only compliment can be paid to the sound effects as well as some of the graphics good as they may be it is still not at all enough to make me regret the time spent watching this movie as a matter of fact i signed up for this membership for the sole reason of communicating to people bothering to look at this film 7 years after the release as it may be to not waste their time or expect much beyond disappointment
