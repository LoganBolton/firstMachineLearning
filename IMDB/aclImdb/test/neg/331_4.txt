i bought this out of curiosity how did john carradine who died in 1988 and cameron mitchell who died in 1994 make appearances in a film made in 1995 thanks to the miracle of unused film can footage thats probably been sitting on a shelf somewhere for ten years thats how you can tell because the film stock used to shoot their scenes doesnt match the film used for shooting jacko the curse of ed wood lives on the good thing for both carradine and mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie youd expect to find on both of their filmographies same goes for scream queens linnea quigley brinke stevens and dawn wildsmithbr br the setting is oakmoor crossing on halloween and some kind of curse is released when dumb beerguzzling teens disrupt a grave the result a hulking killer with a scythe and a big plastic pumpkin on his head he it goes after the wholesome kelly family for revenge and kills others who get in his way the father opens a haunted garage for the neighborhood kiddies the son ryan latshaw son of the director has one continuous perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and one hilariously badly acted dramatic scene lying in a grave at least hes a kid the mothers eyes about pop out of her head while she strains to read her dialogue there is also an annoying woman who shows up to explain things who seems to be trying to phonetically pronounce all of her dialoguebr br so what about the name actors you see stevens wildsmith and mitchell briefly on a tv screen theyre used to pad out the time linnea has a bigger role as a babysitter and she does exactly what she can with it her enthusiastic performance helps a little bit theres also one outofnowhere laugh when an ultraconservative couple who watch a rush limbaugh clone on tv bite it the woman slips on a rug and stabs a toaster with a knife shes electrocuted and the end result looks like a flamebroiled muppetbr br all and all pretty entertaining stuff i wasnt bored
