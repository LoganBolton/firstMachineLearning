this film was basically set up for failure by the studio one anne rice author of the book offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio two they tried to stuff 2 in depth novels in to a 2hour moviebr br i maintain the only way for these two books vampire lestat and queen of the damned to work in a live action form would be through a miniseries first off the the vampire lestat alone takes place from the 1700s to the 1980s and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character lestat the entire book vampire lestat sets up the events of the second part queen of the damned without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyedbr br lestat was not cruel and vicious to all he was not wanting to go along with akashas plans marius did not make lestat lestat did not love jesse or make her lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light marius was not after david nor the other way around every character was completely represented wrong basically same names different storybr br if they wanted to make a vampire movie fine even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels fine but dont piggie back into the theaters off the success of rices great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to lovebr br if you havent read the books you wont understand the film really if you have read the books you will be insulted that being said i am such a huge fan i had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it catch 22 must see it will hate it
