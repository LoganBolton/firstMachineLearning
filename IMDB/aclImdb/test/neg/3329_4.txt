some movies are just Â… unlucky these are the films that obviously thrived on a lot of goodwill and a handful of potentially great ideas but simply didnt have the budgetary means andor professional cast and crew members at their disposal to make it happen the strangeness definitely belongs in this category you really want to like it but even the most tolerant and undemanding 80s horror fanatics will have to admit the film barely reaches the level of mediocrity due to its atmosphere of cheapness clumsy stopmotion effects and impenetrably dark cinematography the strangeness has a fairly original plot and setting okay its similar to the boogens but i sincerely doubt that director david michael hillman intentionally ripped off a fellow insignificant 80s bmovie and the players deliver enthusiast performances even though theyre all miscast an assembly of amateur speleologists go on an expedition to explore the infamous gold spike mine many years ago several miners mysteriously died there and the place has abandoned ever since but theres supposed to be too much gold hidden there to remain closed forever shortly after they descended into the mine the group members one by one encounter the slimy ruler of the gold spike mine a lovecraftian monster with tentacles and an incredibly cheesy way of moving forward throughout most of its running time the strangeness is a boring and incompetent mess that is difficult to follow due to the complete lack of lighting the characters are uninteresting and the mine remains a mystery because the only lighting effects come from the helmets of the speleologists theres very little action or horror to experience in the first hour but director hillman cleverly grasps the viewers attention by showing bits and pieces of the monster at regular intervals as soon as you catch the first glimpse of the monsters tentacle youre doomed to keep watching till the very end the creature is realized with stopmotion effects which i usually adore and worship but here in this case they look extremely weak and pitiable the person responsible for the special effects should have paid more attention to the work of ray harryhousen the death sequences largely occur offscreen and theres very little suspense throughout the whole movie a horror flick with a setting like this should benefice from claustrophobic atmosphere and unidentifiable sound effects but the strangeness lacks all this the biggest trump of the film is unquestionably the beautiful appearance of blond actress terri berland she resembles a speleologist as much as i resemble mother theresa but she surely looks good in her tight white top and beige pants
