my boss at the time and showed it to us at a halloween party at our office he is the chris huntley that cowrote and acted in it he knows its bad we know its bad and we all agree that the monster looks way too much like a vagina to be coincidence maybe it was from a gynocological experiment gone wrongbr br it was a very low budget and the actors were all friends so what you have here is a case of hey gang lets put on a showbr br nobody got hurt and it was a first attempt nothing wrong with that it gave us all a good laugh and its a great film to watch with friends and make fun of
