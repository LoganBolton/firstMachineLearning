i wish depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success at least hed have wound up with somethingbr br the film struck me as pointless rambling and very stylish like some other recent french films not to knock it most recent american films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever we should be grateful i suppose for photography that evokes a european city in the midst of a windblown continental winter and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand whats upbr br but there can be too much of a good thing golubeva is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the freezing night carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such there are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood youll love it if youre vlad the impaler lots of people die catherine deneuve dies in a suicide by motorcycle i dont know why golubevas young girl dies too and i dont know why she dies either she gets slapped in the face falls to the pavement and diesbr br there is supposedly an explicit sex scene too ill have to take their word for it because although it is stylishly photographed it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness dont worry about the kiddies being shocked theyll probably be asleep by this time anywaybr br depardieu isnt a bad actor as we see him deteriorate from a carefully groomed handsome young man  well handsome except that his nose cant seem to get out of his way  to a limping murderous hairy physical wreck we feel sorry for the guy golubeva has a wan pretty face with enormous halflidded eyes and wide cheeks like a doll her next movie should be a remake of lewtons i walked with a zombie then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band i guess its a band as far as i could make out the band is made up of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars every viewer will find the resultant sound interesting but uncultivated listeners fond of easy listening might not enjoy it if you dont like the music theres a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with depardieus walking stickbr br i must say i found it barely worth sitting through and its a longie too at times it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing while a long long freight train rumbles slowly by sometimes stopping entirely i wish it had had a few jokes
