some guy named karl rhamarevich learns how to live on even after death through telekinesis hes interred in a mausoleum that same night julie meg tilly has to spend the night there to get into a group called the sisters and karls power is in full bloombr br silly movie i saw it in a theatre when i was 21 and was generally bored the pg rating should have tipped me offthis is a horror movie for kids one real stupid scene at the end has a corpse breaking through concrete to hit a young guy for starters corpses are put in head first making it impossible for the corpse to use his arms and theres no way anybody is going to break through concrete when youre noticing silly mistakes like that the movie is not doing its jobbr br it has two good scenestwo of the sisters are attacked by floating corpses crowding them in at one point one of the sisters punches a corpse in the stomachher hand goes in the body and she cant pull it out that scene has stayed with me every since and theres a cute little bit involving a corpse and a toothbrush at the end which had my audience laughing but the rest of the movie is a dim dull memory for kids onlyadults will be bored i give it a 3
