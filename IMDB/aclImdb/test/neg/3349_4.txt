i saw this on a cheap dvd release with the title the entity force since i enjoy cheesy 80s horror films i thought i was in for a real treat sadly the film is mostly boring and youre constantly waiting for something to happen it does eventually get somewhat interesting but this is in the last quarter of the film its a case of too little too late when the action does happen its not that great what we get are dead corpses floating along the ground and chasing after the girls in the mausoleum its not the absolute worst ive seen but you can do a lot better i would only recommend this to diehard collectors of cheesy 80s horror
