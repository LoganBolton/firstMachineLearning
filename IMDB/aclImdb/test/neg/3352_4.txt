i had never even heard of one dark night until someone mentioned it on a horror message board here recently and reading into it i gained interest due to meg tillys involvement and recognizing that it was an early gig for friday the 13th vijason lives director tom mcloughlin  unfortunately sad to say its nothing special the premise has a familiarity to ita college girl must survive the night in an old mausoleum until morning in order to join a sorority that girl is a young meg tilly as julie who wishes to prove to her loving caring boyfriend stevedavid mason danielsthat she can make his cruel conniving exgirlfriend carolsrobin evanssorority regardless of the tactics she pulls in order to see her fail along with carols gang is kittyleslie speights always with a toothbrush in her mouth and leslieelizabeth dailywho doesnt really wish to cause julie such trouble while leslie insists on leaving julie alone as she remains in the mausoleum carol and kitty plan to torment the poor girl meanwhile steve searches for her while julie carol and kitty encounter an evil they couldnt possibly imaginethe corpse of a recently diseased psychic vampire whose telekinesis was of a dangerously powerful degree will seek to drain them of their very lifeforce the only one who can help these girls is the dead mans daughter oliviamelissa newmanwho is equipped with the same psychic power he hasbr br i think what many will find exciting is the unusual evil that threatens the girls in the mausoleum its certainly different than what you normally see in the slashers that were out at this time like adam wests characterhe was the cynical husband of olivia who found the idea of her fathers power ridiculous i had a really hard time adjusting to the tacky plot and i personally never found anything within the film to get excited about the mausoleum to me never really was that spookyit doesnt really achieve the same kind of eerie quality phantasm captured and the corpses which are used to attack the girls are laughably unconvincingthere is one great scene where a corpses face melts away i have a soft spot for low budget films from this period of time but i just never really could find a reason to get involved when you have this unsatisfying undead corpse shooting electric bolts from its eyes causing other bodies to break free from their crypts to obey their master its just too silly to take seriously carol is your typical blond bitch wishing to punish a nice girl who is dating a former flame steve is your typical squeaky clean allamerican boyfriend handsome and tender who becomes the hero seeking to save his girl from whatever sinister forces are at play to make up for the small budget director mcloughlin tries every trick in the book to thrill the audience using a series of oogabooga effects such as corpses which pursue young girls chairs which shake and tremble doors that slam shut and objects levitating by themselves the film obviously has its fans and i am glad i had a chance to see it but i was a bit disappointed that one dark night wasnt the horror sleeper i hoped for adam west has a very small role as the concerned husband hoping his wife will snap out of her depressed state regarding a father who had nothing to do with her melissa newman is the troubled olivia recognizing that she must stop her father once and for all or else hed continue to prey on the living donald hotton is dockstader an associate of olivias fathers who informs her of what he was i wasnt particularly blown away by tillys performance hereshe was basically scared most of the time but shed get a chance to prove herself to a greater degree from this point onward this will undoubtedly be of some value to those who watched it back at that time for nostalgia purposes it might seduce fans of movies from this era
