when pam grier made coffy in 1973 it was an exciting though flawed film the plot was gritty and satisfyingeven if the acting was often amateurish it was so successful that american international pictures decided to rehash the formula the following year with foxy brownnot a bad film but certainly almost like coffy ii now only a year later the studio had apparently given up on creating anything new for ms grier as sheba baby was essentially the same plot from coffy and foxy brown yet again because the idea was so recycled and because the acting and acting are so tired and lowenergy its really scraping the bottom of the blaxploitation barrelbr br exactly like these other films sheba baby begins with some local black mobsters pressuring and eventually killing someone pam grier loves in the past it had been drug dealers and pimps now it was mobsters trying to run all the loan companies and pawn shops out of town so they can corner the market and like the other films pam is a onewoman hit squaddispensing justice and a good butt whoopin and like the other films there is a cat fight between pam and a white lady right in front of mr big and like the other films mr big is a white guy pulling all the strings and like the other films she is captured by mr big and like the other films he doesnt immediately kill her but gives her ample opportunity to escape here leaving a knife conveniently lying around and like the other films she eventually gets free and kills his jivebr br while this formula did seem interesting in 1973 by this film it was frankly a predictable bore even if you hadnt seen the other films it still was bad because the action was so slowthe punching and kicking seemed so slow and staged the same could be said for the gun play in one scene four guys with machine guns an ar15 and shotguns attack pam responds by opening fire with a 357 revolver and killing 3 of the 4 and getting the other to surrender even if shes a good shot she was rather slow and the guys just seemed to wait until she killed them plus even a world champion shooter or rambo couldnt have succeeded with such onesided oddsafter all these guys had very impressive weapons and they were already pointed at her when she cleverly whipped out her pistol and easily dispatched these professional hit men br br in addition to slow and lame action scenes compared to any other blaxpoitation film the movie has many logical gaps that show the writing was terrible but the studio just didnt care in one case her boyfriend williams knew about the yacht and nutronic at the end of the film but pam never told himhow did he know about this in another the cops approach a boat filled with hoods and the hood immediately open fire however the cops had no evidence anything was happening and the crooks began firing with little provocation and the crooks had 30 caliber machine guns and other amazingly powerful weapons but in many cases were killed by cops wielding snubnosed 38s br br the bottom line is that this is a great example of been theredone thata whole lot better i love blaxploitation films but this one is just too dopey and slow to merit watching except by very devoted fans of the genre
