below average blaxpoitation action  melodrama in which the lovely ms grier plays a private eye who comes to the aid of her father rudy challenger and his partner austin stoker of the original assault on precinct 13 whose loan business is being threatenedbr br ill be frank  i agree with the few other user comments for this movie sheba baby has a less than satisfying script direction that isnt particularly distinguished action scenes that are moderately entertaining at best and one of ms griers more nondescript supporting casts although theres an important supporting role for durville martin also a familiar name in blaxpoitation i get the feeling that this routine movie may have been put together quickly merely to cash in on her then enormous popularitybr br it sure was cool seeing stoker again although ms grier doesnt have as good a role  or dialog  as she has had in other films although she is doing what she does best and thats playing a sassy sexy sister on a mission of vengeancebr br nonstop soul  funk soundtrack is enjoyable at the very leastbr br mostly recommended to those who wish to see everything in the pam grier film repertoirebr br 410
