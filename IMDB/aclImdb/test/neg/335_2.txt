i went through great efforts to get this movie after reading the comments on this site i really dont have time to write reviews but i felt this was my duty as a scifi horror buff this is only the second review i have written the other was for dracula 3000 now to the point this movie sucked plain and simple i kept wondering if i was watching the same movie as those who wrote all those lovely comments i have seen movies with bad effects bad acting bad sound you name it and ive seen it but this really sucked i dont care how much it costs or didnt cost to make movies like this and dracula 3000 should be banned and the whole cast and crew arrested and jailed for time murder by the way did i mention that this movie sucked i mean really sucked the plot was non exist and the acting was weak it seems like the writer saw pitch black and got upset because he didnt think of a plot like that first so he decided to make his own ripped off version but instead the suck factor took over and possessed him dont watch this youll have more fun if you pull down your pants and sit on burning coals
