i remember when i first heard about jack frost i was in video ezy at miranda with my family on a monthly video hiring tradition it was at this time that i worked up the courage to venture over towards the horror section of the store browsing the various titles i finally came across jack frost the cover was enough to convince me that the film was beyond my viewing pleasures years later the film disappeared only to be replaced with the inevitable yet unnecessary sequel i once again ventured to the horror section and picked up the case only to come to one conclusion the film would be scary but not intentionallybr br jack frost 2 revenge of the killer mutant snowman quite a title follows off where its predecessor left it sheriff sam is seeking counseling after his ordeals and jack is now in the form of antifreeze to escape his past sam and his wife head to an island hotel where he is in the company of a wide variety of slasher film stereotypes including busty female models thick headed sports jocks and caribbean staff however jack is released from his liquid grave and is back to his icy methods he heads over to the island and proceeds to kill anyone that would prove to have an awesome death only sam can stop himbr br let me just say that this is a straighttovideo film so its bound to be bad but this is terrible even in the eyes of other over the top films the camera work is poor using a camera that would make a soap opera look majestic half the actors look like theyve come out of a porn shoot and the other half look like theyve come out of a retirement home but in actual fact theyve actually come out of an asylum there is an extensive use of special effects used in the film which tends to alternate between bland puppetry and cgi that can be bettered by an infant and the death scenes are mostly off screen showing us little of what has happened to the hapless yet deserving victims but the film is most memorable for its killer one liners such as theres something that needs a little christmas stuffing and i know pronounce you officially fing dead ultimately the whole purpose behind a film like this is to make a popcorn flick for those friday nights of boredom and even it fails at that to make a sequel to a film that was a poor slasher with a concept that a child would find unbelievable mustve taken some nerves of steel or a total frontal lobotomy to director michael cooney thanks for wasting my time to everyone else avoid like arsenic
