please if youre thinking about renting this movie dont if youre thinking of watching a couple of downloaded clips dont if i had my way nobody would even have to read this summarybr br the acting despite being one fo the high points of the movie was still pathetic the director was probaly a sadist the witty one liners were something youd expect from a room of highly paid antisocial 7 year olds that eat paintchips for breakfastbr br the problem with this movie is that it tries to be a movie like evil dead 2do not under any circumstances associate these 2 movies in that its so bad its funny but it also tries to be funny at the same time and fails so overwhelmingly to do so that your sense of humor is left too crippled to do anything but set off your gag reflex in an attmept to save itselfbr br i could go on for much much more detailing just how awful it really was but i think it would strip me of my will to live just to continue to think about it if you need me ill be off trying to boil myself so that i might feel clean again
