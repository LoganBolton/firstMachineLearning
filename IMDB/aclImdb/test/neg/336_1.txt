i pride myself in being able to sit through everything i think if ive paid the rental fee then im going to at least watch it i have found the exception to this rule the planet i dont know what the exchange rate is but reading through the other comments i can only guess that Â£8000 must be around 150 ill date myself but this movie reminds me of the old steve reeves movies of the 50s he was a bodybuilder turned actor he was in these really awful italian dubbed movies that starred reeves as hercules or some other muscle bound hero as a kid watching them you couldnt quite articulate why these movies stunk you just knew they did mike mitchell is the new steve reeves thats it thats what this really was a new telling of an old italian spaghetti sand and sandals movie and i kid you not where was reeves born glasgow montana this movie isnt so bad that its kind of fun to watch its just plain bad
