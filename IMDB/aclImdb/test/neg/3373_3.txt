may contain spoilersbr br clearly who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections i just cant see it any other way what really surprises me is no one used the name allen smithee and more surprising everyone involved didnt use this namebr br anyhow where to begin the bad dialogue the crummy costumes the sorry looking film stock the unintentional comedy the overthetop characters and more inconsistencies than george w bushs college career i dont know what was funnier the guy losing his arm because of a snowball or the slow motion scene where all the baby jack frosts were getting killed also one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film how do we know its him like theres another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs a great camp film but a very bad film overall
