this episode had potential the basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment but a phone that constantly rings is somewhat interesting and when she explores the noise there is genuine tension and fear but stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode hadbr br first of all the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction eg its funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind this door has serious damage to it that wasnt here a minute ago the door opened by itself without me touching it etc given these supernatural phenomena plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room wouldnt she take some precaution before entering it maybe she could investigate in the day time or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else or maybe she could turn on the lights also while in the haunted apartment she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide just unplug the phone the phone company doesnt need to be involved walk up to the phone and unplug it case closedbr br finally showing the phone scamper across the floor like its alive was just comical if the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card he couldve done it in a way that didnt look cartoony brave little toaster anyone
