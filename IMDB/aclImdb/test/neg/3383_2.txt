what an absolute joke of a movie the case for this film would have you believe it is duel meets jeepers creepers meets texas chainsaw massacre three good films in their own right and you would think using their blueprint mm couldnt go far wrong well thats what i thought and i was very very mistaken br br we follow two college students as they travel miles across the desert to reach a wedding they pick up a girl no she doesnt get her clothes off then they get chased by a leatherface ripoff in a monster truck whom they aptly name fkface aka monster manbr br the monster truck i will admit is a very cool vehicle but the less than suspenseful chase scenes ruin its potentialbr br so mm decides hes got a bit of a grudge against these guys and chases them for a bit they loose him for a while and stop at a bar full of amputees then they go to a motel where lead character adam sleeps with hitchhiker sarah though they both wear underwear then they are caught by mm taken to his home where they escape death and try to kill mm but fail hence the setup for the sequel apart from a minor twist thats itbr br if you can get past the first 2 minutes  where adams friend harley pops up from hiding in the back of adams car to try to scare him with no explanation as to how harley even got there how long ago or how adam even failed to realise  without thinking you hate it already then you may just enjoy this filmbr br monster man has very poor cinematography and direction which is immediately offputting this is the kind of movie that youll be able to pick up as one of those films in a box set of 20 horror movies that youve never heard ofbr br what is so irritating is blockbuster stock so many of these poor quality films that are shot on digital by some amateur film students and thats exactly what mm is though imdb states this particular director was born in 1961br br the acting throughout this film is atrocious the script which the writer obviously considered to be funny is irritating and childish you get the impression only one draft was written before they started shooting in fact the script is do dire a lot of the film seems improvised full of those boring unentertaining conversations that are only funny or important to the actual people involved imagine you filmed yourself and your buddies having a conversation sure points are funny  to you but mostly its trash thats what the script for mm is likebr br dont watch it for the gore either  its fairly minimal and there are much better gory films out there bad taste evil dead et al br br jeepers creepers 1  2 even with their cheesiness and plot holes are far superior to this film compare the intro of jeepers creepers to the intro of monster man and youll see what i mean
