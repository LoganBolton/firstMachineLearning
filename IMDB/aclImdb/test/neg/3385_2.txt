wow where do i begin after suffering through this wretched 100 rental thanks a lot family video i just had to make a few comments i did not bother to write down the names of the 3 actors in the film but hopefully you will know who i am talking aboutbr br a monster truck terrorizes the countryside and chases two collegeaged buddies to their doom they encounter a hot girl wearing slutty clothes i mean this just sounds fantastic in theory i was laughing hysterically at the dvd box while i walked it up to the girl behind the counter at the video storebr br acting the hot girl played by aimee whatever is visibly laughing through many scenes where she is supposed to be scared the other two major actors in the film the fat prankster and the vanilla straightguy are both terrible the fat guy thinks hes jack black hes not the other actor our hero overemotes and misses all his cues and comes across as some generic character you might see in a madefornickelodeon movie about skateboarding in the early 90s look i dont expect great performances in movies like these but at least the actors can make an effort to not be annoying you can be an incompetent actor but still be agreeable ie john wayne at least that aimee gal is attractivebr br script holy  who thought this dialogue was funny i wouldnt have the nerve to play this out in front of my grade school drama class much less pitch it as a film script unfathomably bad more on this laterbr br production ok this is the one place where the film definitely succeeds production quality is amazingly high the look of the film is very good apparently the only talented person who worked on the movie was the director of photographybr br ok here are my biggest gripes 1 the guy driving the car never drives faster than 25 miles an hourbr br 2 the guy driving the car is well out into the country before he realizes there is a fat man in a mask in his back seat he is supposedly meticulous about recording gas mileage and keeping his antique car in good condition but he does not notice a 300lb jack black impersonator in the back come onbr br 4 characters never change their clothes there are two hotel scenes presumably showers are available to our characters yet over the 3 days this movie takes place none of the characters bothers to change their clothesbr br 5 comedy lighthearted slapstick comedy does not mix with horror period you cant have our characters running away from a monster truck one second and the next second have them verbally jousting one another with some dopey lightcomedy music playing this kind of pacing virtually ruins any tension in the movie movies like evil dead 2 which mix comedy and horror understand that tension can be loosened yet never completely eliminated with humor monster man doesnt get itbr br im irritated that what could have been a very funny horror movie was ruined by a director who thought he was a lot more clever than he really was oh well
