heard some good remarks about this film as being very gory and frightning but its neither obviously the screenwriter wanted to do a scary horror film but at the same time inject some teenage comedy for the young target audience scares and comedy seldomly result in good films the same goes for monster manbr br not really funny nor scary or overly enjoyable on any other levelbr br aproaching 39 years of age ive seen my share of horror movies i have seen good ones and terrible ones but the crop of films released these days are so frighteningly mediocre it bores me to watch em the acceptance these days for bad films like this is what really annoys me lets face it they produced a lot of crap in the 70s 80s and 90s but they were regarded as such then as well today theyre regarded as good entertainment  bollocks
