last night i am sitting in my tv room beer in hand bowl of pretzels on the tv tray  i decide to put the movie monster man into my trusty vcr expecting a funfilled gory crash  bash cheesefest of a movie what do i get instead one of the most silly stupid unfrightening  predictable films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through and whats even worse all during the i use this next phrase loosely sex scene the girl keeps all her clothes on ill make this summary short  sweet mix dude wheres my car about a good 12 of the film with a very watered down hitcher add a redneck version of the antagonist from i madman as the primary villain  finally some incoherent black magic mumbo jumbo  youll kind of get a clue how rotten this movie is its also utterly predictable throughout the only notable factor to this buddy movie disguised as a horror film is that some of the moments between the 2 guys even though the hero is one major annoying geek  the other is a jack black clone are kind of funny just mediocre funny ielike most of snl skits other than that monster man is a monster mess 310 this one ill be handing out at halloween timejust hope after the person views it i dont get my house egged or worse
