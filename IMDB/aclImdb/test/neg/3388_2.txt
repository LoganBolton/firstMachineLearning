i would like to know who conned the producers of this movie to pay for its production  that persion is a genius of sorts this movie somehow held my attention for about two thirds of it until i realized that it was going nowhere fast i think the music managed to make it seem like something was going on but nothing really was it was not scary the dialog was poorly written the first 90 minutes should have been covered in about 15 minutes this would have been a moderately acceptable twilight zone or outer limits episodebr br at this point im just mad that i wasted all that time thats a couple hours that i will never get backbr br i hope these comments save someone from wasting their evening take a nap or hit the gym instead or if you want to be scared turn on a cable news channel
