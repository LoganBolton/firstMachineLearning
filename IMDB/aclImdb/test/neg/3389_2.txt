i completely disagree with the previous reviewer this movie has amusing moments but hardly a laugh riot unless you really think sipping from a septic tank and heads exploding in a vice are a laugh riot in fact the only reasons i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 are because a two of the actors are decent bthe soundtrack is above average with some tuneful pop songs thrown in for contrast and cthe monster truck is pretty terrifyingbr br other than that this is a movie with some intermittent creepy or interesting ideas which are overwhelmed by unrelenting crassness crudity and vileness the former best friend character is one of the most annoying ive ever seen and the small grace that the hitchhiker character had disappears in yet another contrived twist ending that makes little to no sense at allbr br a waste of the lead actor who shows some nervous charm and the aforementioned actress portraying the hitchhiking character
