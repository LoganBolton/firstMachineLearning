fans of horror comedy will like this one others might get quickly annoyed and shut it off its sort of a buddy film with overthetop violence and gore deliberately stereotyped characters and a lot of crazinessbr br it looks to have been made on a budget of about 100 by a bunch of fraternity guys after a big beer keg party theres a lead whos a frustrated nerd and his loudmouth prankpulling friend who mocks him about 30 times per second theres a cool monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles which is the highlight of the film whenever this thing and its gnarlymask wearing driver appear its a great scene theres a mysterious girl who randomly appears in their back seat and plenty of giant guys in overalls hanging out in red neck bars the nerds friend never shuts his yap and gets them in one mess after another their arguing got on my nerves but other aspects of the film make up for itbr br sight gags poking fun at several psycho tormenting and trying to croak somebody films are everywhere take your pick which one is riffed the most hills have eyes saw and jeepers creepers were some that i recognizedbr br its enjoyable insanity if youre in the right frame of mind sensorydulling brewskies with your friends can make viewing this more fun its a good bet thats the condition of the movie makers when they put this thing together
