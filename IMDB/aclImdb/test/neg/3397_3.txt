ive read through a lot of the comments here about how this movie sticks to the book i dont think any of them have actually read it edgar rice wrote about a dangerous african jungle and apes were killers and hunters we know differently now and this movie portrays apes in a more modern view ive never seen a tarzan movie that even comes close to edgars vision maybe one day hollywood with trust talented and respected authors to tell the story so if youve never read the book and enjoy a good story about feelings and a fluffy bunny view of wild animals maybe a good cry see the movie i hope john carter of mars gets more respect than tarzan has we miss ya edgar
