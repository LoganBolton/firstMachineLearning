i really didnt like this film it was boring and didnt interest me that much at all im more of an action girl and it had none i went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was left but was totally mislead dont get this movie unless you like the dessert and plenty of boredom i just really didnt like the movie it wasnt my style but it could be yours you would just have to watch the previews or something but its my recommendation if youre a girl dont get this movie this scandinavian production draws on some of the observational strategies of godfrey reggios koyaanisqatsi allowing us to reflect on patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and sweeping viewpoints this just isnt for me
