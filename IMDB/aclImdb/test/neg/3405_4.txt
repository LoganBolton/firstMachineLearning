i am very into waverly hills and first watched death tunnel the moviecouldnt have been much worse then i heard that the documentary was coming out and got excited thinking that since it was a documentary it would be more serious and not have the horrible special effectswrong the same guys did the documentary and ruined it with effects instead of producing it raw the way a documentary should bewaverly hills doesnt need help with goofy effects its fine just the way it is tours are 2000 per person and 10000 for 8 hour overnight investigation per person minimal group of 10 for overnight investigationtours must be set up ahead of time awesome place for the ghost hunter
