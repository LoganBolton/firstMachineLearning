even with its low budget this movie could have been worth watching if there was a story to tell here it started out pretty good and fairly engaging and believable the actors and characters were interesting although there wasnt much character development my favorite scene was when they were all eating their rations some seemed to hate it and some seemed to think it wasnt too bad the story starts out very airtight and then br br and then it dipped into a little horror which is usually a death sentence for most sci fi suddenly no scientific basis for any of the goings on no real believable end game for the villain no real explanation of whats going on generally if a movie has to use the f word for every other word it usually spirals down from there too i still get offended believe it or not i often wonder what inspires people to make bad sci fi isnt there a universe of fantastically good stories out there dont people feel like they are wasting their time and everyone elses when they put out stuff like this why do we get so much mediocre sci fi like this no female actorscharacters either none at all this had the makings to be another predator but alas fell far far short br br my final comment  poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real campfire what gives br br my advice for any low budget sci fi movie production companies out there make sure you got a good story before you start and edit out bad special effects  its better we see nothing than something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy
