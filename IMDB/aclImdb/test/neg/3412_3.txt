after watching the first movie in bcis new aztec mummy collection its difficult to believe how excited i was about the set and how upset i was when the release date was pushed back ive watched a lot of mexican horror in recent months some great  the curse of the crying woman some entertaining despite obvious flaws  night of the bloody apes and some cheesy  pick any santo movie one thing that all these movies have in common is that none can be called dull well thats not the case with the aztec mummy its been awhile since i last watched something so sleep inducing i wasnt hoping for or expecting a great movie but at least entertain me the aztec mummy takes every situation that could be interesting and sucks the life out of it through repeated scenes of people doing nothing and then extending those scenes for what fells like an eternity i guess thats what happens when you make an 80 minute movie with only 30 minutes of material padding extraordinaire for example for anyone who has seen the movie what purpose does the bat have other than to bring a masked wrestler type to the screen and to extend the runtime by 15 or so pointless minutes br br i can only hope that the other two movies in the collection are more entertaining than this one
