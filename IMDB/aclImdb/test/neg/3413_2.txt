ive just seen this film in a lovely airconditioned cinema here in bangkok and since the temperature outside is hovering somewhere around 37c with very high humidity my 100bt was not wastedbr br failing that i havent seen such a piece of extremely wellmade junk in a long time this is the kind of film that provides a test of taste as it were anyone who claims to like or love it goes immediately onto the same list of tasteless phonies who still go around talking about the superiority of british television at least the gormless old broad in the wheelchair was good for a few guffawsbr br pseudoprofundity and fat lips while characteristic of much french cinema really do not a good movie make id rather watch independence day 10 times in a row than sit through this stinker one more time
