if you want a horrible interpretation of macbeth then this is your answer filled with archaic shakespearic english language in a 21st century australian setting this film lives to disappoint and leave you scratching your head but that isnt allbr br not only is there sophomoric action sequences but there are plenty of scenes where the female body is displayed the witches played by actresses that resemble school girls more than witches put on a soft porn display with macbeth in a unremarkable display of affection welcome to stupidity and depravity  all at the same timebr br its a wonder why this project was greenlighted so much for modern cheesy movies d
