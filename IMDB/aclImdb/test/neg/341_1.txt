going to need to take a deep breath for this onebr br terrible special effects that tried to reach far beyond the limitations of the budget blatant and unashamed plagiarism of other scifi movies like pitch black terrible acting endless slow motion scenes of characters walking aimlessly across sand dunes meandering dialogue that does nothing to further the story characters wearing turtle neck sweaters on a desert planet with two suns a cargo ship staffed by a camouflagewearing crew of guntoting soldiers why exactly would you need forestcamouflage in space anyway some of the worst casting choices in the history of nobudget filmmaking  a steroid swollen captain who comes across more like a musclebeach jock than a trustworthy commander and a convict who looks and acts about as dangerous as a bunny rabbit 70 minutes in length 35 of which could have been trimmed out if the director had any concept of compression of time through editingbr br i wont go on suffice it to say that while some components of this awful movie can and should be forgiven due to its low budget the bad conception laughable plot holes and snoreinducing script are unforgivable on any budget the end result is a tedious dull waste of time sorry guys i hate to be so harsh on an amateur film but youve no excuse for turning out this kind of work
