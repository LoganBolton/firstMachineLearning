this movie illustrates like no other the state of the australian film industry and everything thats holding it backbr br awesome talent outstanding performances particularly by victoria hill but a let down in practically every other waybr br an adaptation of sorts it brought nothing new to macbeth no setting it in presentday australia is not enough and essentially completely failed to justify its existence apart from lets face it completely unnecessarily paying homage to the original work if theres one body of work that has been done and done and done and done its shakespeares so any adaptation if its not to be a selfindulgent and pointless exercise needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the workbr br and thats what this macbeth fails to do as it was done this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever its the same piece that we have seen countless too many times before except with guns and in different outfitsbr br apart from the fundamental blunder no other way to put it of keeping the original shakespearian dialogue one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end during which i completely tuned out even though i was looking at the screen i never thought i had a short attention span but there you gobr br i suppose the movie succeeds on its own very limited terms but as australia continues to produce worldclass acting talent its moviemakers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work withbr br a shame an absolute shame
