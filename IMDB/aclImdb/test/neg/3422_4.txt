the play macbeth was written by william shakespeare between the years of 1604 and 1606 ever since then many other versions of the play have been produced including remakes completed in 1948 1971 and 2006 akira kurosawa even directed a japanese version of macbeth in 1957 entitled kumonosu jô the play starts out with king duncan hearing about the success of two of his generals macbeth and banquo in a recent battle with the irish and the norwegians after a quick promotion from duncan macbeth instantly gets an uncanny feeling for lust greed and power and does everything in his power to gain access to the crown even if it includes murderbr br geoffrey wright tried creating his own version of the famous play in 2006 by setting it in the modern melbourne underworld just imagine a lowly macbeth slaying hundreds of soldiers with an ak47 and rapping his own rendition of low at the same time just kidding about the latter but one thing he does do is utter the traditional shakespeare and he keeps it going throughout the whole movie thats right shakespeare meets ghetto its all you could ever hope for not the newest macbeth is rough and violent enough to match up with any other modern day action film but it lacks decent acting the right lingo and a good technique of camera workbr br the modernized movie starts out with macbeth sam worthington who works as a hit mandrug dealer for duncan gary sweet a drug lord from melbourne australia after being promoted to the thane of glamis by duncan as the three witches had predicted aspiration starts to take over macbeth as he sets his eyes on the throne after promoting macbeth duncan invites himself over to macbeths house for a night of drugs and alcohol before the festivities begin lady macbeth victoria hall talks macbeth into killing duncan to take power over the throne after the bodyguards are drunk and everyones asleep macbeth sneaks into duncans room and stabs him to death after his murder macbeth takes all of duncans belongings including hid title and crown just as soon as he thinks hes got what he wanted he finds out that it will take more than bribery and running away to solve his problems br br one major flaw of the movie was the acting a once seemingly flamboyant and empowered macbeth suddenly turns into a sissy and he looks like a sad puppy dog throughout the entire film i dont really know if this was worthingtons or wrights fault but either way one of the two should have realized macbeth was a king not a knot on a log that took everything his wife had to say literally like i said earlier macbeth should have been rude arrogant and spiteful but when his character changes over to a drug lord he changes personalities as well i suppose on the other hand lady macbeth really knew how to nip it in the bud when it came to recognizing and personifying her character she didnt seem quite as spiteful as she was in the play or the 1971 version but she reminds macbeth that compared to murder anything else he could possibly do wouldnt quite match up br br another thing i found distasteful was all the nudity this fluke had to be wrights fault the witches didnt do a bit of acting unless you call parading around in your birthday suit acting at one point in the film i started to wonder if i was watching macbeth or unique positions vol 2 br br dont get me wrong when i say i find the shakespearean dialogue out of place its spoken flawlessly but when its spoken by an australian gangster its just really weird when macbeth starts to kill people off he first lets them know by talking to them in ye olde english macbeth contains plenty of action blood gore and nudity to last anyone a lifetime you forget all the positive facts though when you start to think to yourself okay what in the heck did he just say in that last sentence at some points in the movie i dont even think the actors themselves knew what they were saying the new ageness of the movie could have easily been pulled off it werent for the thous and the thees br br the camera work was just simply fair for me one thing i could not stand was the constant pacing back and forth between characters the camera technique used gave off that blair witch sort of vibe and made me throw up a little in my mouth matt reeves tried to attempt the same concept of camera work in clover field but it just doesnt work it makes me want to get out of my chair and look around for the little barf bags they have conveniently planted on every seat in the airplanes br br looking back on it all the gangsta macbeth holds one positive plenty of action other than that the movie contains nothing more than uninspired acting correct english usage and stomachturning camera work the soundtrack holds one or two of the same songs but each song is edited or remixed differently for every scene there is never a variation of interesting or captivating media used from now on out directors should leave the dangerous drug underworld to al pacino and robert deniro future renditions of macbeth should be created just as shakespeare intended the play to be 400 years ago i would recommend using medieval clothing ye olde english swords and shields and a soundtrack prepared by enya but either way the modern macbeth makes you yearn for some good ole folk music a camp fire and a bustier
