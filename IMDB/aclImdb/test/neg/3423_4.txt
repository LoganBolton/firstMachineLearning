macbeth is one of the most frequently told stories in cinema and has been translated many times in numerous theater and celluloid settings originally written by william shakespeare in the early 1600s macbeth tells the story of betrayal among royalty and one mans quest for power director geoffrey wright romper stomper tries his hand at updating macbeth by setting it in the contemporary melbourne underworld a film where the characters substitute swords for guns ala baz luhrmans romeo and juliet and royal vassals for gangsters macbeth is a gritty violent but critically flawed filmbr br macbeth sam worthingtonworks for king duncan gary sweet after being elevated to the thane of glamis by the king as was prophesied to macbeth by three witches macbeth starts setting his eyes on the throne one night the king comes to stay at macbeths house and lady macbeth victoria hill talks him into killing the king to assume power macbeth kills his master and then assumes his crown but success has its downside as macbeth soon finds out when he has to go to hideous lengths to protect his murderous secret br br ok first things first the films major fault is sam worthington his portrayal of macbeth is in a word boring i honestly didnt care about macbeth while watching the film i had more sympathy for victoria hills lady macbeth because she bothered to act at least worthington sits sullen and wood faced throughout the entire film i felt like he was doing his best impression of johnny deeps george jung character from blow but without the charisma i have never seen worthington in a film before so im not sure if it was his or the directors fault but either way the glue that should have tied everything together into one cohesive unit is weakbr br the dialog is good but when matched up to the geoffrey wrights australian gangster motif seems a bit out of place frentically paced action sequences mixed with long shaksperian musings creates pacing conflict within the film i understand that this is macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialog intact but hard fast action scenes following a three minute soliloquy tends to get annoying if not a bit pretentious br br the camerawork is highly stylized and for the most part it works well one thing that i found annoying was how the camera would slowly jostle back and forth almost constantly i dont mind shots like that its just overdone its passes beyond the realm of being cool and stylish and instead becomes irritating other than that the art direction and cinematography is fairly welldone br br for all of the good qualities macbeth possesses stylish direction shakespearian dialog a strong soundtrack supernatural nude witchesthe weird sisters and good helpings of brutal bloody violence all of these strengths are forgotten when one considers sam worthingtons uninspired portrayal of macbeth the role of macbeth was essential for tying everything together and in this respect geoffrey wright and sam worthington failed miserably making macbeth a forgettable foray into shakespeare
