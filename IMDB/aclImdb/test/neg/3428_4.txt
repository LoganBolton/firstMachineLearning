the story of farewell to the king is intriguing an american deserter i had the impression he and his 3 comrades were only trying to escape capture in the philippines as their desperate escape by raft to borneo is not your classic desertion but no sooner do they come ashore when they are discovered by the japanese noltes character a sergeant has only moments earlier walked down the beach alone and was not noticed and incredibly no one noticed his footprints in the sand which would have led the japanese right to him but anyway nolte is taken in by a tribe of headhunters and becomes their king after defeating another tribesman so hes out of the war then the british commandos show up and want the tribe to assist them in fighting the japanesebr br unfortunately noltes incessant hamming ruins an interesting story instead of acting like a former soldier thrust back into the war now with a tribe of warriors under his command nolte acts like he was raised by the tribe he speaks as if english is almost a foreign language rarely using contractions he makes sweeping gestures when he talks and acts like he is one with nature as if he was raised in the junglebr br there is plenty of action and many interesting scenes with the british interacting with nolte and the tribe but noltes character is never believable it always looks like hes overacting he needed to be a little more of an american soldier and a lot less of a tribesman as it is he comes across not as a regal king but as a lunatic who has forgotten who he really is but that is not the intent of the film as the script has him being admired and trusted by the british commandos there is never any suggestion that the british thought his behavior was strange he is simply viewed by the british as the defacto leader of the tribe thus it always seems that noltes character isnt fitting in with whats supposed to be happening in the filmbr br another actor might have done a great job with the role delivered his lines believably and made it an outstanding movie but nolte ruins the film by hamming up every scene and appearing to not understand what his character is supposed to bebr br what a waste
