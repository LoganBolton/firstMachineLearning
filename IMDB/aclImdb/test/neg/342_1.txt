i was excited about this movie after reading other reviews what a disappointment there are so many ways that this movie is bad the computer graphics were lacking to say the least i found the acting stiff and unbelievable watch the sand as the lost epods what an original nameare found where did all the tracks come from i immediately recognized portions similar to other movies ie alien pitch black come onone huge ship to transport one prisoner and what is with the prisoner does he speak can he speak i kept waiting for something to tie the bits of the story together but it never came if this movie was made on a low budget it shows the only part of the movie i liked was when it finally ended i dont mean that i liked the ending i didnt i just liked the fact that it was over a trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable in my opinion dont waste your time on this one
