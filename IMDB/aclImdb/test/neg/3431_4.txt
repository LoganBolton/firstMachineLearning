this very lowbudget film is fun if youre a john krasinski fan but is otherwise disappointing at least it was short so i didnt feel like i had wasted too much of my time johns scenes are funny enough but the attempted deep scenes with lacey chabert are pretty nauseating it starts off seeming like it could be a funny movie but some of the characters are just so outlandish while the others are far too serious that it just falls flat dont get me started on the ending it was totally implausible and didnt even fit with the rest of the movie i will say that i wasnt bored though which is why i rated it above a three fans of john krasinski will enjoy seeing him with a bandanna and stockings around his head and eating cheezits oh and make sure to check out johns deleted scenes theyre better than some that were actually included in the movie
