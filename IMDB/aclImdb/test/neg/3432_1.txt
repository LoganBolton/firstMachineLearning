i have to say krasinski is the only reason i even watched this film he is good however everything else about this film is so far below average that its not worth the time and effort spent viewing this filmbr br this film has loads of technicalaesthetic issues namely shot selections framing camera movements within monologue sequences extremely bad editing probably due to the total lack of fluidity in and between shots and overall terrible acting except for krasinskibr br it was far too theatrical in acting and presentation to develop any sort of suspenseful moment in this filmwhich is surprising because its all about a bank robbery which should be at least somewhat excitingbr br how does a film this bad get made and then released and then distributedbr br kind of reminds me of a c film students thesis project probably not even that good though
