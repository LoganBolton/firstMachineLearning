i found this movie to be okaybr br on paper this movie has everything a person may want romance comedy drama a bank robbery a unique cast great music and storytellingbr br in reality this movie ended up being mostly garbage and ill tell you whybr br a this is my biggest problem the editing this movie has by far the worst editing ive ever seen short of localcardealership commercials the editing couldve been done better by a deaf parkinsons patient tapping away at imovie with a a dead cat there are scenes where two characters are talking to each other and you can see their lips moving and the audiovideo isnt in sync because its clearly dubbed why was it dubbed i dont know its english dubbing english the voices were done in a studio elsewhere in certain scenes could they not find a boommic theyre not expensive jesus even i own one and i dont make filmsbr br b andrew keegans performance lacked it really didnt seem like he wanted to be a part of this project and his acting was the equivalent of a skit performed by dare for schoolchildren at least john krasinksi showed some enthusiasmbr br yes john krasinski is the only reason i rented this flick and its the only real reason worth watching hes did a good witty performance and he was the most threedimensional character dean edwards character was quite thin as was whatsherfacebr br final word if youre a fan of john krasinski this is worth your time if not dont even bother the editing
