 mild spoilers br br with the exception of the terminator and total recall i dont think arnies actionadventure movies are up to much  theyre better than his comedies for sure but thats hardly saying much  the problem i have with his all action blockbusters is that theyre overblown and lacking in any sort of morality br br morality  i mentioned in my review of terminator 2 the scene where good guy terminator blows the kneecaps off the swat team  are we to think that because the hero maims people doing their job instead of killing them we will admire him in someway  this is the problem with eraser  when james canns character is revealed as a traitor within the us marshal department arnies character john kruger goes on the run with a witness hes protecting but in several later sequences kruger kills a fairly large amount of marshals working with the villain  are we take it they were all traitors too  surely many of them were honest men who were trying to stop kruger because the bad guy told them kruger was the traitor  its a rather uneasy thought that kruger killed several people who were trying to genuinely up hold the law br br despite costing one hundred million dollars the special effects arent all that impressive  look at the scene where kruger lets go of the jet wing and scrambles to put on a parachute  its obvious as the action intercuts that its a stuntman whos doing the free fall sequence while arnie is in a studio in front of a blue screen  eraser is also a film that has unnecessary cgi featuring killer alligators  not only unnecessary cgi but unconvincing cgi too  theres also a few plot holes like in the opening scene involving a couple of witness protection people that the mob has caught up with  kruger opens a car trunk and pulls out a couple of bodies and starts a fire thereby throwing the mob of the scent  kruger is next seen rearranging the dental records via computer of the couple hes saved  it would be logical to do this but would all the couples dental records be kept on computer  most importantly of all are we to believe the us marshal department keep a freezer full of bodies for such events br br so theyre you go  a typical arnie thriller long on unlikely set pieces and short on intelligence and its interesting to note that eraser didnt make much of a profit at the box office as the production costs almost outweighed a potential audience figure  after eraser arnie didnt do much more business at the box office save for terminator 3  rise of the machines which was an event movie and itll be interesting to see if hell be remembered as a politician rather than a movie star
