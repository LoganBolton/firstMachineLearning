this show disturbs me it takes up slots on nick at nite that could be reserved for the fresh prince or george lopez even full house and roseanne theyre all better than home improvement first off the mother jill annoys me so much she is an oversensitive whiny baby and i really despise her brad is a fat toad and he is annoying too and the youngest brother i dont even know his name i dont notice him at all thats probably not the actors fault though its probably the writers tim is just a stupid ass although jill is definitely my least favorite i dont like any of them the only reason i gave this stupid show three stars is one star goes to randy as the middle child he is still a pesky little brother but an older brother and i like his fun character the other star goes to al as the chubby friend his character is likable other than randy and al this show sucks
