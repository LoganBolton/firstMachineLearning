ok look this show is the worst show on nick night i love so many shows on nicknight and i love them when this show came on to nicknight i was so annoyed its such a boring show and it is corny out of all the times ive watched i found one episode slightly funny this show has some of the most unfunny and stupid jokes ever this show sums up to terrible give props to fresh prince of belair and george lopez this show is boring and not the least bit clever this show should have been canceled much earlier i dont think it deserves to be played on nicknight alongside some great classic shows this show is lacking cleverness good jokes and style
