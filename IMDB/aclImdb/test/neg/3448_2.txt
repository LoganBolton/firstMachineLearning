two stars br br amanda plummer looking like a young version of her father christopher plummer in drag stars in this film along with robert forsterwho really should have put a little shoe black on top of that bald spotbr br ive never seen amanda plummer in a good film she always plays these slightly wacky characters in films that dont quite add up and she does so yet again in this onebr br firstly we have two young women sisters who dont resemble in the slightest who allow themselves to be picked up separately by questionable men along the roadwaysbr br amandas character sandra does at least have a good reason for allowing dr jake robert forsterto pick her up in the first place she has been run off the road seemingly by a maniac and her car is pretty much destroyedbr br warning  spoilers ahead br br however as we go along we realize dr jake is not playing with a full deck any more than amanda is he makes every decision based on the flip of a coinbr br when dr jake and amanda arrive at a motel who do we see but the maniacs car and what does amanda do but get inside his station wagon and start snooping around what her motive was for doing this is never clear considering the man is apparently dangerous and might try to kill her one would think the last thing she would do is place herself in such a precarious situationbr br not only does she snoop around but she finds some money and takes itbr br shortly after this we have several other things that dont add upbr br dr jake with amanda as his passenger runs out of gas and the two of them abandon his car and begin walking one would think crossing a desert he would have checked his gas gaugethis seems a very unlikely thing for him to allow to happen then later he is seen driving the same car when or how did he get the car back br br dr jake tells amanda he knows she has taken the money now how would he know that he didnt see her do it as far as i know and she didnt tell him she did itbr br then later we have a character named santini david thewlis the man who was driving the station wagon give the two of them a lift and ill be darned if he doesnt know amanda took the money as well how would he know that br br it loses credibility at an alarming rate the further we gobr br when alice amandas sister fairuza balkgets in the clutches of the killer and decides her fate on the toss of a coin  one would think she would be very very careful that the coin she swaps for a trick coin would definitely be the trick coin  but apparently it isntbr br its jarring things like this that destroy any credibility this movie may have had
