this movie is proof you cant just go to a redbox and read descriptions of films and pick one and give it a trybr br while ill give em great credit for having produced a film with halfwaydecent special effects on such a low budget and at least a halfway decent script and story line unfortunately it was only just that halfway decentbr br if you like movies where things arent all neatly wrapped up and dont mind lowbudget effects you might like this film honestly it wasnt really my cup of tea i shouldve just gone to bed rather than spend my time watchingbr br for a better sciencefiction movie produced on an even lower budget  have a look at primer
