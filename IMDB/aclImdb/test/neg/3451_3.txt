i managed to see this at what i think was the second screening in the world a few days after its opening at the dublin international film festival while i was attending another film two nights later at the same theater i saw brendan gleeson paul mercier and the rest of the cast  crew at another promotional screening of studsbr br i have to say that i was bitterly disappointed with the film i was by no means expecting a masterpiece but what was presented to me i believe lacked all the crucial elements of the genre it had set itself into before i continue two things i accept that some filmmakers like to subvert generic expectations here this is simply not the case secondly i know that it was based on a play which i havent read but have been informed that it isnt a shimmering piece of literature but this does not excuse the massive narrative problems that permeate the filmbr br my main problem with the film is the script forget that it was based on a play as a sports comedy it simply doesnt work the down and out team are trying to win a football cup few of the games are shown when they are it is very short and we are not given any satisfaction due to any of their sporting achievements having read so far you might assume that it is not a strict sports film but a psychological study of the relation between a charlatan of a manager and his hopeless team it certainly does not achieve this im not even sure if it was aiming to any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters is hackneyed and peripheral overall i found the script lacking in many respectsbr br i do think the performances and the music were good and technically the film was well made but aside from those points which should be expected from any irish film at this stage i left the theater feeling very disappointedbr br my judgment may seem harsh but i do think there is some hope for a strong national irish cinema in the near future and this simply does not back that argument as studs has become a recommended dublin cineworld film i was part of the audience at that screening most people would seem to be disagreeing with me so that means you should probably make your own judgment of the film
