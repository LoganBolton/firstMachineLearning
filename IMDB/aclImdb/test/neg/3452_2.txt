this is a poor film it certainly belongs in the how not to make a feature film category story direction acting and style are all flat as a pancake story consists of five  yes five  football matches spread out over the films duration each one more boringly filmed than the last as a dysfunctional amateur football team go from strength to strength thats it thats the plot its hard to know who this film is aimed at its too banal for football fans and theres nothing in it for teens nor grownups theres nothing in it for women either there isnt even a single female character its dreariness wears you down as the team play game after game after game after game after game the story such as it is dialogue and mannerisms seem lifted from a bygone ireland with all the actors spouting cod theatrical dublin accents it doesnt have to be seen to be believed avoid at all costs can someone give me back my 90 minutes high point the credits at the end low point too numerous to mention brendan gleeson is in this film
