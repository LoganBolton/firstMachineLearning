caution several spoilersbr br someday somewhere theres going to be a postapocalyptic movie made that doesnt stink unfortunately the postman is not that movie though i have to give it credit for tryingbr br kevin costner plays somebody credited only as the postman hes not actually a postman just a wanderer with a mule in the wasteland of a western america devastated by some unspecified catastrophe he trades with isolated villages by performing shakespeare suddenly a pack of bandits called the holnists the selfdeclared warlords of the west descend upon a village that costners visiting and their evil leader gen bethlehem will patton drafts costner after much misery and numerous efforts to break costners spirit he escapes thus ending a lengthy section of the movie that could have been told better in a threeminute flashbackbr br we now finally get to the major premise the escaped costner finds an abandoned mail truck and delivers the letters to the nearest town hoping to get some food under pretense of being a postman a number of the village people led by young ford larenz tate want to get in on this postman act which does not sit well with bethlehem and his bandits and costner finds himself the unwitting and unwilling leader of a band of postmen at war with the holnistsbr br the idea of the postmen versus the bad guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds the holnists depend for their livelihood on the fact that the villages they prey on are isolated from one another the holnists can destroy any one village but could not stand against all their victims united to unite the villages must communicate with one another and a working mail system would thus be a big step toward putting the holnists out of business so it really makes a lot of sense that bethlehem would get medieval on our heroic mail carriers unfortunately bethlehems eventual defeat is not the result of the villages uniting against him but instead your old standby cliche the oneonone brawl between him and costner nor is there even any real attempt by the communities to use the mail to work together to solve their problems all the mail seems to be the standard hi aunt debbie stuff played for maximum sentimental valuebr br the postman is one of the most predictable movies shot for shot that i have ever seen now i dont purposely try to ruin movies for myself by straining to figure out whats going to happen next but here were talking about the kind of predictability that requires no effort i just knew what was going to happen next whether or not i wanted to know after a lion is prominently showcased eating people a holnist bandit seeking the escaped costner ventures into the bushes after a noise and we are then shocked when the lion eats him a bunch of unoffending villagers are rounded up and shot by a firing squad and one of the villagers sings out some famous last words right before being shot to my immense lack of surprise a covered statue is unveiled to show exactly what everyone knew was going to be there costner bending to pick up a letter from a cutesy kid we saw earlier in the movie a man tells bethlehem that no sir you cant just take my wife bethlehem runs the unsuspecting sod through though he is the only person in the theater who is unsuspectingbr br but it is rank cloying sentimentality that really undoes the postman olivia williams playing costners lover abby is worst served she pours her heart into the material and gives her very best effort to make it sound natural and sincere she tries so hard its heartbreaking but nobody could ever have made the lines i have a gift for you postman    you give out hope like its candy in your pocket sound like anything but the syrupy pap that they are another example is the scene where a mounted costner thunders past a little boy ignoring his proffered letter only to turn around stare at him for what seems like five minutes and then thunder back to pick up the letter why didnt costner just pick it up the first time no real reason its just an artifice that tries and fails to give us a feeling of elation by dashing the kids hopes and then restoring thembr br schmaltz and predictability unite at the end as the statue of the postman is revealed i sat thinking please dont tell me theyre going to show the statue and then cut back to the scene with the cutesy kid surely that is too saccharine too obvious for even this movie then alas the music swelled and we did indeed cut back to the dreaded little boy smiling as his letter to his maiden aunt is whisked away and i held my head in my hands and thought somebody shoot me it felt like having thirty pounds of apple pie rammed down my throatbr br gen bethlehem is a more humanized villain than normal your standardissue postapocalyptic villain is the meanest toughest sob in the valley bethlehem is shown to be a little nothing of a man inside who tries to make himself feel important by beating up on others although some menace is thereby sacrificed bethlehem is credible in a way most villains arent unfortunately will patton overacts and although we are told early on that bethlehem utterly destroyed his last challenger in five seconds of handtohand combat bethlehems actual fighting skills shown at the end of the movie are absolutely ludicrousbr br the acting is otherwise pretty good costner has done better but his razzie was an overreaction as mentioned olivia williams is very impressive larenz tate as ford does a sincere and credible job james newton howards score is competent though short of the epic standards the movie was going for but its not enough to save this filmbr br rating 12 out of
