the depiction of ichabod cranes character was so terrifically unlikable my wife and i were hoping that the horseman or some other character would not only cut off cranes head but do it slowly and painfullybr br i mean this brent carver guy played it over the toplike he was on broadway and he was such a relentless jackass that we had no sympathy for him whatsoeverbr br i could go on with specific critiques of how this movie failed but i prefer to not devote the energybr br just skip it and go for the johnny depp version either that or rent the haunted pumpkin of sleepy hollow animated it is quite goodentertaining for kids and adultsbr br better yet read washington irvings original story
