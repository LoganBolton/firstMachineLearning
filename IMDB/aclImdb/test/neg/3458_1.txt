crap i accidentally watched this filmthinking that it was the swimming upstream that was released in 2003 i seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it shame on whoever gave this junk an award i thoroughly loathed this filmin fact i didnt see it through to the end after an hour i could no longer stand it i am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy scriptwhich tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such baad acting painful i rate it 1 star out of 10 an amateur could make a much much greater movie
