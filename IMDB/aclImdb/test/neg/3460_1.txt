let me preface this by going on record i am a huge george clooney fan and i love john krasinski in the office well i was and i didbr br this was the worlds worst hang nail and it took 113 minutes to rip it off the stupefying boredom was interrupted only by my frequent efforts to read my watch and estimate when it would be overbr br every funny scene was in the previews all three of them there was no real story no character development and the script was just plain bad ive had a colonoscopy that was more enjoyablebr br the title should have been superduper bad this movie is a lock for a razzie it should get a whole slough of razzies i want my money back
