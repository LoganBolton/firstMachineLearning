i thought this movie was going to be good it absolutely wasnt despite the oscarwinning lead actors i may have laughed once and i never heard anybody else in the theater laughing renee zellwegers pancake makeup was very unbecoming everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie running around in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off i think perhaps the movie mustve sounded good in development but something got lost in translation were the roaring 20s really like this i think not everything seems a tad artificial randy newmans score was annoying the film is in sepia tones just like every other movie that takes place in the 20s or 30s theres just not that much originality here
