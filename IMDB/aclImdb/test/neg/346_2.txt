i think that you can not imagine how these people really work before i came to the studios to watch the guys work there i actually thought quite the same as you do but since i saw and did the work the guys on that tvshow have to do i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long that really is no easy work and also the actors which in your eyes may be terribly bad are really great people and a lot of them really can act i dont think that the material given to them can really show that as i think this material isnt very good but they are truly good so i dont think that you before you havent seen these guys doing there work can judge over them and i shouldnt have judged over them as well before i met them but i did and am now terribly ashamed of it so please do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you havent seen them doing there job
