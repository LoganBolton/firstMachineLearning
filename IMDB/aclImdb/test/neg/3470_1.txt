sorry if i disappoint anyone about what i am about to say to this made for tv movie but i paid money for the movie and turned out this movie is disaster the directing is really awfully bad but after i looked up its information here i realized there might be reasons for the low quality of directing and producing maybe they dont have budget but anyway ang lees sense and sensibility had little money too but it turned out a hit the director in this movie did really bad job in telling the story and the movie couldnt even keep up a rational continuity in itself it keeps pulling me outta scenes maybe someone need to work hard on story line board the dubbed sound is also awfully bad my god normally i would appreciate every movie because behind it lie ideas and imaginations of an individual but this time i am just mad  i really wanna hit something hard just dont do the job if someone cant fulfill it to its best bad arts its not even art what is it really hurt people
