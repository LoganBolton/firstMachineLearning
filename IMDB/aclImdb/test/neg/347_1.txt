i watched this movie only because i was under the impression that i was going to be treated to a cheesy horror flick i mean look at the tag line theyre men turned inside out and worse theyre still alive does that not scream cheesy horror movie to you and the then theres the title itself screamers what a perfectly apt title for a horror movie i thought unfortunately i wasnt aware that the real title was properly translated the island of the fishmenbr br so about an hour into watching this i realized that this was not a cheesy horror movie at all it was a cheesy adventure story about slimy fishmen from atlantis men turned inside out no there was nothing of the sort i was grossly disappointedbr br damn you misleading taglines i want those 81 minutes of my life back
