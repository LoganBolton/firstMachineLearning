this movie is highly improbable read the other reviews to see whybr br i would say that most of the characters were plastic but they didnt even afford themselves that little luxury they just act like cardboard cutouts of course they had to get real surfers for the surfing contest roles so thats a crap shoot whether they can act at least occy didnt give a crap and just went with it but lance fuhgeddaboutitbr br the one character who rang true was portrayed by gerry lopez who didnt really act he was himself pretty much hes quite accustomed to stomping people  the only reason i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 was because i was laying out a newsletter on my laptop when it came on some cable channel late one night that saved me from having to pay full attention to this silly little time waster no way i would go out of my way to watch it
