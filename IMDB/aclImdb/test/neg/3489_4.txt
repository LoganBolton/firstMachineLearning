the plot of this film contains a few holes you could drive a massive truck through but i reckon that isnt always top priority in horror two elderly sisters in rural england keep their brother in the cellar since more than 30 years now he escaped and started a killing spree focusing on militaries that are homed nearby we only did we thought was best for him they keep on repeating and  strangely  all the army officers love these women and dont doubt their sincerity even though 5 of their men died i dont know whether to find the revelation near the end suspenseful  or tedious in a way this film reminded me about arsenic and old lace in that blackcomedy classic two halfinsane siblings mother their goofy younger brother as well yet they do the killing there the old ladies in the beast in the cellar are by no means less crazy though the horror in this early 70s film is very amateurish and cheap but there are a few neat attempts to build up the tension too many oldladies talk about the good ol days though and that rarely is something you seek in a horror film with such an appealing title flora robson who may be recognized by classic film buffs plays one of the sisters she gave image to the queen of england is the legendary errol flynn swashbuckler film the sea hawk
