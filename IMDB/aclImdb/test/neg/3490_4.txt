i remember viewing this movie when i was a kid i recall it terrified me immensely and it stayed with me all these years i spent a couple of years trying to find it onlinedidnt remember the title only the storyline after searching and searching i came across a vhs that was being sold on ebay i was excited and when it finally arrived i jammed it into the vcr and couldnt help but feel a bit nostalgic needless to say i was slightly disappointed this wasnt the movie i remember watching as a kid it was boring at times and i found beryl reids incessant whinning extremely annoying both performances by reid and flora robson were good overall but the movie wasnt scary i think any movie is worth viewing to form youre own opinion but sometimes well
