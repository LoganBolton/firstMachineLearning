through its 2hour running length crash charts the emotional anguish of its 10odd ensemble of characters when faced with the sometimes blatant and sometimes latent forms of racism underlying in american society that and the emotional anguish of one of its audiences sitting near the front and desperately trying to make sense of what movies have become these daysbr br the era we live in has become so complicated not only do we reject modernism even the not very enthusiastic flagwaving of postmodernism ideas is always being shot down by what postpostmodernism that aims to destroy all these ideas all in no part thanks to the great destructivist ideas of those great thinkers but i digress this has nothing much to do with the what the movie is about but rather what the movie isbr br sure it seems hard to earn a living in a hollywood that has to cater to a market that is so postpostpost everything that cynicism has become more than just a motto in life it has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think of whether we like it or not and so a new studio product is born indie films which once were energetic and idealistic in its defiant experimentalism now seem to be as equally adamant as hollywood films to sell to indie film markets an indie film must sell at sundance before becoming acclaimed and so nothing is simple anymore even what constitutes a good film becomes so murky whereas in the past filmmakers just wanted to entertain people and tell a good storyand in these seemingly simplistic attempts the greatest of films are bornefilmmakers nowadays have to make films that are good first and foremost films have to make people think have to be meaningful has to be provocative raise questions yadda yadda yadda what it all boils down to is a subversion of the hollywood movie system but this subversion seems strangely similar to the formulaic similarity of hollywood films the countless ways of differing to essentially be the same productbr br and i havent even begun on the film yet maybe ive become too picky on films i see these days maybe its because of my primary need to be entertained rather than say be probed when seeing a movie but hell this movie is one big load of crap and im repulsed by this movie not just because it follows the how to make a good movie good 101 guidebook to the tcharacters spout eloquent lines and are sooo witty like theyre gifted with the speech of god it raises issues about racism and life confronting racism in america it has touching moments where everyone discovers more about themselves and more about other people not to mention the fact that once you hear the ambientnew age soundtrack of women singing in high registers in foreign languages you know youre in for all of the above traitsbr br and something about the aforementioned pointabout it raising questions about immediatelycompelling issues like racismpisses me off big time like all postpostpostpostpost everything movies it doesnt contend with just having a message about this issue because oh our audiences are much to intelligent for that these days in this postpostpostpost world our audiences want us to make them think doesnt want us to put things so simplistically and then they will go into existentialist crap and say thats because life itself isnt simplistic ha ha ha what other common drill do we here then the audience need to think about issues rather than have them fed to them okay okay and okay so the film makes it a point to pound the audiences with these nonmessages and since theyre not exactly a message its so decidedly subtle and subtle means good right so were being hit again and again with this wellwritten subtlety with the eloquence of rhetorical prose and as if the irony is not steep enough we have ludicrous character the only character who seems to not take all these racism discussion bullshit seriously being converted into one of those irritatingly meaningful characters where he learns something in the end giving meaningful looks and pauses where audiences are supposed to learn something about themselves too um yeah how i wanted to see an incredibly racist film right after this manbr br to cut the long bullshit short i guess i wouldnt have taken issue with the film if it wasnt so bloated in its selfimportance the angst that forms the entire movie felt more like whiteboy whining than actual spike leeish anger its so tim robbins and sean penn the type that wants to wave flags about humanitarianism when the only thing they dont realize is the flag theyre waving is their holeridden underwear plus its become so trendy in the postpostpostpost world to be completely subtle about it nothing is simple any longer in its best efforts to actually be good provocative and ultimately human its become neither imho just another indie crap from an indie director that wants to make a name out of himself as a credible indiefilmmaker now at least hollywood is more simple and sincere in its manipulativeness
