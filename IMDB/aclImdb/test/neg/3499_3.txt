crash is overwrought overthought and overbaked a great example of how to make a pompous and selfimportant film with a message haggis tries too hard to make his point and overreaches in just about every category of the film it feels very much in love with its own sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a jackhammer to the skull sure race relations affect everyone and theres a great deal of ambiguity to the issue but the universe of crash operates to suggest that we are all victims to our own perceptions on race its a tiresome thread that repeats itself ad nauseum and wears out its welcome within the first 30 minutes i found the outcomes of the characters unsurprising and forced and the film took forever to sputter out and die the fact that this film is in the top 50 movies on imdb is a testament to the publics willingness to get suckered by hollywood malarkeybr br indeed if you want the real crash go check out the one by david cronenberg dark twisted and original this film plays as preachy tiresome and masochistic
