terrible writing highly contrived from a dogooder who knows absolutely nothing about race relations in la or the usa in the present day the gushing positive reviews are a mystery to me  but could only be provided by folks who think that someones good intentions should be applauded regardless of how shallow simpleminded and just totally unrealistic the results are if you want to see a film which deals realistically with modern day la race issues  the movie you need to see and probably already saw is pulp fiction theres more honesty and realism regarding race in any two minutes of that film than there are in the full 4 hours oh im sorry it just felt like 4 hours of this stinker br br if anyone ever needs proof that the path to hell is paved with good intentions  then this is the movie for you
