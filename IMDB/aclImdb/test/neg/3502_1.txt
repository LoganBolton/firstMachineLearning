what a disappointment the story line is so simple  the good guys sometimes do bad things and the bad guys sometimes do good things  dressed up into a racial setting to make it seem clever sophisticated and meaningful it isnt it lacks any subtletybr br everything that happens is telegraphed and then gone over again in case you missed the explanationbr br for a film like this to convince and move the audience it has to be represent the ambiguity of the characters and their motivation and actions not simply present it as a series of 180 degree changes in each characters actionsbr br half way through i really wanted to waste no more time on it but i thought i would stick with it in case it improved big mistake i should have stopped then  it simply got worse
