i agree with what so many others have said about the shallow and offensive nature of this films examination of racism it is baffling to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by its pretentiousness i want to comment on the matt dillon character as an example of whats most infuriating about this movie here we have a man who  contrasted with the films underlying message that were all a little racist  effectively rapes a woman in public cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately goading him to make a move that as he well knows will lead to his arrest or even death he does all this after pulling the couple over without any legal cause but because as we come to understand they are black and wealthy and he is a hurt little boy who is now the police and can therefore do as he pleases this behavior is not a little racist this behavior is evil it is disturbing to me that this extreme of racism is held up next to another characters behavior  spouting her paranoid stereotypes about gang violence  to illustrate that everybodys a little racist later were spoonfed some tripe about dillons poor old dad and how black folks drove him into the poor house is this supposed to explain or worse excuse this behavior and is dillons character meant to redeem himself by committing the utterly unmotivated and unbelievable laughably coincidental act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted the very night before please the fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of selfcongratulatory admiration for this film makes me feel sad about the shallowness of our understanding of racism and our apparent lack of commitment to condemning and ending it
