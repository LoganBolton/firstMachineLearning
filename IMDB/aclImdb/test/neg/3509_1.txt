i saw this movie partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at netflix and from it i leaned a valuable lesson not a lesson about ethnic diversity howeverthe lesson i learned is dont trust reviewsbr br yes racism sucks and people are complicated but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the ones who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they do see it the only reason that i can think of for the number of good reviews is that its being reviewed by people who arent used to thinking or whove seen their first thoughtprovoking movie and somehow think that haggis invented the concept in fact he basically made this film which should be called racism for dummies as emotionally wrenching as possible seemingly to give people who dont spend a lot of time thinking the impression that theyve discovered some fundamental truth thats never been covered in a film before zen and the art of motorcycle maintanence its not an afterschool special for the unthinking masses cut into bitesized overwrought hamfisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspectionbr br its as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme simply to make us happy that were such good people because we dont identify with the characters lets face it people nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes its well acted even if the dialog is atrocious and cleverly executed so much that you dont think to ask wheres the beef until you can tell the film is winding down the flaming car scene was well executed like much of the movie but went nowhere in the end br br the messages are very heavyhanded and from the behind the scenes blurb the producers were clearly watching a different movie because there is very little to laugh about in this movie even during the intended funny parts i have to stress that this is not entertainment more like a high school diversity lessoncall it the blood on the highway of racism they could even show this in high schools if it werent for the sidenude shot of jennifer espositobr br in this film everyones a jerk and everyone learns a lesson except for michael pena who gets the best role but the most predictable storylinebr br this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayonsbr br crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things
