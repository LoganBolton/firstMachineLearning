its exactly what the title tells youan island inhabited by fishmen shipwrecked doctor claudio cassinelli and crew land on the island theyre either picked off by the fishmen or roped into working for treasure hunting lunatic richard johnson cassinelli discovers that johnson who believes hes found the lost city of atlantis has been keeping disgraced scientist joseph cotten and his daughter barbara bach hostage for 15 years so the fishmen can uncover a treasure trove beneath the sea cotten of course is a complete madman bach and cassinelli have great chemistry this insanity was directed by sergio martino and is not surprisingly without merit its fast paced reasonably well acted and the fishmen look pretty convincing though its unlikely anyone could prove that these things dont look like actual fishmen theres an excellent music score by luciano michelini
