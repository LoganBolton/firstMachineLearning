hungary cant make any good movies fact this is a great example of thatbr br first of all the term plot does not exist in this movie its seriously weak even tho a lot of people would argue with me on that sure its about a taboo but thats about it there are endless possibilities which could have been really great if used but they nearly skipped everything i think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures which are the only decent things in this whole pile of awfulnessbr br the acting is just plain shitty there arent many lines so you would think that the actors have great facial expressions or mimicking abilities but no in fact 86 of the time they suck and thats when they dont say anything if they say even a single word youll start tilting your head saying thats damn unrealistic but than again this is partly the fault of the writing theres also no emotion in most of the dialogsbr br the editing is sometimes ok but most of the time illogical and just worsens the whole picture it could have given an emotional push yet it seems the editing in here is all about putting cuts after each otherbr br someone please explain it to me why critics say this movie is a masterpiece calling this an art isnt gonna make it better sorry mundruczo but you failed live with it even tho you probably wont care about my or any other guys opinion scarifying your child
