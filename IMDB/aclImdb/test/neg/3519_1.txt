i recently watched this movie because im a big kinski fan but oh my god dont get me wrong i love this guy but in this movie his whole acting is just simply a refusal to work but fortunately he isnt the only one to blame first of all the complete storyline is totally weak dealing with a gunmen looking for a murderer while kinski is stuck up in jail for a crime he did not commit thats all all the dialogs and characters are so bad its making you scream but maybe thats the fun of it all if you know the kinskibiography its obvious that kinski didnt care about those movies at all especially all his italowestern roles he just took the money and that was it again this whole movie is totally weird only for hardcorefans of the genre
