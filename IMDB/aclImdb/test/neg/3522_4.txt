this movie is so mild i tried not to expect anything greater from this film but still it was a big disappointment the basic idea of the story is interesting and potential this could have been so much better the characters are really simple no depth at all its a shame that previously talented performers tiina lymi and petteri summanen didnt make the already poor characters any better the director just dont get the watcher emotionally involved at all with this piece of crpbr br and the the chase sequence at the end of the movie thats hideousbr br why there had to be so stupid and old solution for that situationbr br its too much used element with even more terrible way of filming it oh no
