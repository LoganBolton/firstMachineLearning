ok lets see a handsome young stranger is new in town and walks around on the local boardwalk he meets a pretty girl meets up with the obnoxious leader of the local hip young vampires club is dared by them to follow them into this cave gets into a conflict over the pretty girl an epic fight ensuesbr br no its not lost boys although youd be hardpressed to tell the difference since i think even some of the carnival music is the same do you have to pay royalties for sampling a movie even the ending of this stinkbomb is ripped off from lost boys the makeup is below par even for a lowbudget thriller the characters are onedimensional and just exactly how many oh i had this horrible experience scenes of teen angst does one movie need the humor is flat and stupid and everything else is sadly predictable yawnbr br the only scary thing about this turkey is the promise threat of a sequel an idea that hopefully every distributor in the country will drive a stake through
