sighthe stupid government once again attempted to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier and of course the experiments went terribly wrong burdening us with a half manhalf mutant who pukes an awful lot and squeaks like a little girl whenever hes upset lance henriksen stars as the honest scientist who immediately quit the experiment upon hearing it was a military project but he returns bringing the whole family with him when he finds out his beloved guinea pig has gone on a killing spree mind ripper certainly is a watchable horror movie but its very unoriginal and features pretty much every lame cliché you can think off including the estranged fatherrebellious teenage son sub plotyawn the characters are like wooden puppets the dumbest things are being said and done and theres a completely pointless dreamsequencecoming from the monster theres a handful of interesting gory scenes to enjoy and some of the isolated desertlocations are effectively eerie lance henriksen is adequate as always even though this is yet another inferior production he stars and giovanni ribisi surely deserved a better motion picture to make his debut in for some reason this anonymous 90s thriller is also known as the hills have eyes part 3 is it because it handles about members of the same family being terrorized in the desert is it because wes craven was once again involved as a producer this time or maybe its because the monster gets bald near the end like the freaky michael berryman in the 1977 original who knowswho cares wes craven probably financed this project because his son cowrote the script and its always moving to discover that your offspring is equally untalented as you are not recommended
