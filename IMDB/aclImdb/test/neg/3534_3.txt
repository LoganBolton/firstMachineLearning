this is wes craven at his worst this is the very worst horror if you can call it horror you will ever watch esp from one of the masters of horror wes craven poor direction poor acting poor set poor atmosphere makes this the biggest pile of rubbish ever the bad guy is totally unconvincing you couldnt even feel sorry for the guy the gore and horror involved in the film is laughable its just plain rubbish the only good points i can think of is it stars natasha gregson wagner giovanni ribisi and lance henriksen but not even that cast could stop this from spiralling out of control and into one of the worst horrors ever if you still aint watch it yet dont bother youll only hate it
