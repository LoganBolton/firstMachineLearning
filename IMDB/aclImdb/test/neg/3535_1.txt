why a film maker with a track record like wes craven would want to lend his name to a tedious collection of cliches like this is anyones guess and if he did stump up any money for it  all of Â£50 judging by the looks  he should have been banging on the directors door for a refund the minute the film was released there are many alien ripoffs and this is one of the worst even the reliable lance henriksen saddled with a character dumb enough to allow his kids to wander around a dangerous government lab cant save it as a cure for insomnia this rates a 10 as a piece of quality film making  forget it
