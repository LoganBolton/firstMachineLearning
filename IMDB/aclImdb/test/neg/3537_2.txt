i really loved the millenium series starred by lance henriksen which is why i bought the film obviously at some level it was a mistake mutantmonster films are usually very bad and this film is no exceptionbr br the basic idea itself is not totally judged to fail well nevertheless this film would never have been a success even with a good director  actors but the way it turns out this is just a bclass movie the scenes that are supposed to be scary seem more funny to me and the critter is not credible at allbr br however watching this film with group of friends in restless mood makes this film shine as it is so unintentionally hilarious
