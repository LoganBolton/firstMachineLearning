think youve seen the worst movie in the world think again the person who designed the cover of this box should be accused of false advertising the cover makes it look like a good scary horror suspense thriller but no what we have instead is nightscream a movie that makes a sweeeoooowww noise every time a credit flashes across the screen the biggest name in the entire film is probably casper van dien who hardly has a partbr br i voted a one for this one only because i couldnt vote any lower if i could vote something like negative fivethousand trust me i would have so for now im going to give nightscream 12 out of 5 just because it ended
