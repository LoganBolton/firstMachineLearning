i remember flipping through channels on hbo and saw this this my friends is one of the worst tv movies ive ever seen there is no excitement in this filmbr br the story starts out with drew summerscandice cameron bure driving to a small town while in a trance she stays with a couple who coincidentally had a daughter named laura fairgate who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress even the townsfolk agree that they looked alike thing is laura was killed over a year ago her boyfriend went missing around the same time she was murdered making it look like he had killed herbr br while settling in this town for a while drew starts to have visions and nightmares these visions and nightmares might prove that the boyfriend of laura isnt the killer after all throughout the film you find out that ray ordwell srdenis arndt is the one that raped her frequently over a period of time and killed herbr br the movie is too long and very boring the film just drags on and on and on and on amazingly i saw another tv movie after this called cloned 1997 which was good but ill review that one laterbr br i give this movie 1 star out of 10 avoid this tv movie it is not worth your time this is the worst tv movie of 1997
