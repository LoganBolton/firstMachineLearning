tom cutler jackson is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene cleanerupper in his latest job he cleans a new crime scene and destroys evidence and isnt aware the crime hasnt been officially reported uh oh this cant be good br br you hear about cleaners all the time but usually when a mob or gangland hit is involved when bodies etc need to be removed and the area cleaned up this one is different in that tom cutler works with the police to clean up after the police have done their investigation of a crime scene hey someone has to do it you know the police wont the movie makes that quite clear and it is up to the family to get the area cleaned up br br this is almost a good thriller but a side plot involving toms daughter palmer makes this story somewhat awkward i guess they had to fill in some time oh they brought this side plot around to connect with the another side plot but it was still a reach and awkward seebr br this was almost a good thriller because there was a noticeable lack of tension suspense and the pace was somewhat draggy the music didnt help either as i noticed the music was more appropriate for watching people take a long journey you know journey music get it habr br the acting by all was excellent in this almost a good thriller br br violence yes sex no nudity no language no
