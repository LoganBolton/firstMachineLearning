i normally dont try and second guess a crime thriller but cleaner was just entirely too predictable samuel l jackson playing the character tom cutler along with his profession created an interesting twist in the beginning of the film however that was about it without even thinking i knew where the plot would be taken and within 30 minutes i had already figured out who the killer was rather then trusting myself and having seen several films that make a turnabout i watched to its completion what a disappointment i was right from the beginningbr br the casting of characters was a good as well as the acting from jackson and harrisexcept for eva mendes from the starting gate she didnt play a believable character in correlation to the script and this ruined the entire plot too soon maybe this was a directing mishap or just weakness in the story itself her role as ann norcut should have shown more emotion and distress for the situation that was building around her this wouldve made the buildup a bit more compelling and the ending more dramatic nevertheless cleaner is watchable not memorable ive seen episodes of csi that were more thrilling then this
