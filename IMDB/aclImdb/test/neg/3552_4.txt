a plot that is dumb beyond belief however that said it must be admitted the lead actors go at their roles as though it were shakespeare and that is as it should be it isnt their fault the writer seems to be in a comabr br hats off to what is really a very cunning performance by joanna kerns she proves that just because it isnt on the page doesnt mean a role cant be seized and dug into and she does so with gusto good for herbr br ditto to christine elise who is called upon to be little more than confused and weepy but goes way beyond what is asked of her by the scriptbr br and to grant show as well a graduate of daytime and prime time soaps ryans hope melrose place he is always versatile and underrated his primary drawback seems to be his impossibletoignore good looks he is a sturdy well grounded actor capable of much more than he is generally given the opportunity to dobr br the rest of the cast is basically window dressingbr br the direction is adequate and the script as i alluded to is fairly idioticbr br watch this one to enjoy three good actors in the leads taking delight in performing some much needed scenery chewing its fun
