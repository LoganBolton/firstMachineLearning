this is an excruciatingly boring slowmoving movie we can feel some sympathy for the socially and sexuallyinexperienced and awkward tomek but the motivations of magda are pretty hard to see and the ending at least for me was inscrutable br br maybe its about how we all need love but id get more out of a good busby berkeleybr br im told that comments have to be at least ten lines so ill add that in the background are some interesting shots of the relationship between polish citizens and government employees and institutions i wonder if its meant to portray this before or after the fall of the communist governmentbr br finally watch for the clever way the men from the gas company investigate whether or not there is a gas leak in magdas stove
