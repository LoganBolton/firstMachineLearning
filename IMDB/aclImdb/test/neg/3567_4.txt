would a different translation have made it chillier or scarier are the subtitles too compact to convey the nuances of the original language does it even matter you may have heard that great actors can make reading a phone book exciting well this is an opportunity to judge for yourself br br if this isnt about homosexuality murder dismemberment psychopaths insanity deviant psychology then it is about acting  acting helped along with lots of dialog so enjoy the acting or muse about how titillating the dialog actually isbr br for english speakers twelve angry men might be a better choice theres a bit more interaction and you can judge if the acting is consistent with the dialog you dont have to wonder if youre missing somethingbr br i would recommend andy warhols empire to those who like this film
