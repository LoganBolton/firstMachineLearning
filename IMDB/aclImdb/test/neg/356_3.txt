clifton webb is one of my favorites however mister scoutmaster is not one of his best his patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny the film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality in addition the viewer is presented with numerous hamhanded references to religious faith and us patriotism that come off as overreverent rather than genuine clifton webb does his best with a poor script edmund gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do the child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film his sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfroglike low voice unusual for someone of his age however once youve heard it youve heard it and you dont need to hear it again unfortunately he is in the majority of the films scenes i find this child so irritating that i fast forward whenever he shows up since he has a lot of scenes in this film this means that i fast forward through a lot of the film there were and are so many talented child actors its a pity this film doesnt have any of them in it still clifton webb in the traditional broadbrimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing
