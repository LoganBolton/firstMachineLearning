thats what i kept asking myself during the many fights screaming matches swearing and general mayhem that permeate the 84 minutes the comparisons also stand up when you think of the onedimensional characters who have so little depth that it is virtually impossible to care what happens to them they are just badly written cyphers for the director to hang his multicultural beliefs on a topic that has been done much better in other dramas both on tv and the cinemabr br i must confess im not really one for spotting bad performances during a film but it must be said that nichola burley as the heroines slutty best friend and wasim zakir as the nasty bullying brother were absolutely terrible i dont know what acting school they graduated from but if i was them id apply for a full refund post haste only samina awan in the lead role manages to impress in a cast of socalled british talent that well probably never hear from again at least thats the hope next time hire a different scoutbr br another intriguing thought is the hideously fashionable soundtrack featuring the likes of snow patrol ian brown and keane now im a bit of a music fan and im familiar with most of these artists output but i didnt recognise any of the tracks during this movie apart from the omnipresent run bsides anyone we get many many musical montages which telegraph how were suppose to feel these are accompanied by such startlingly original images as couples kissing by a swollen lake and canoodling in doorways this is a problem as none of the songs convey the mood efficiently and we realise the director lacks the ability to carry the emotional journey to the audience through storytelling and dialogue alonebr br the ending is presumably meant to be just desserts as everybody gets their comeuppance and there is at least one big shock in store but i remained resolutely unmoved because the script had given me noone to root for its not enough to tackle a hotbutton issue you have to actually give us a plot that hasnt already been done to death and individuals who are more than window dressing as it stands this film is a noble failure with only the promising lead actress and a few mildly diverting punchups to save it from the bin 410 must try harder
