good actors good director well acted well directed butwheres the movie did they have an script or just improvised it all at least it is a shortlength movie only 80 minutes including credits nothing seems to happen in this film nothing at all a couple of small time drug dealers caught in small time troubles but youll never get a clue of whats happening nor even what are they talking about in some sequences of the movie tons of fs and motherfs but nothing elsebr br for the people who love abel ferraras films such as the funeral r xmas is going to be a big disappointment as its been for me what was he thinking about did he really think that this was a good movie and if he didnt then why did he made it
