awful awful awful drab unimaginative predictable  and with all the usual suspects exactly the sort of film the irish film industry shouldnt be making and with the added bonus of a treaclecoated ending a sickening example of how talent  originality is bypassed in favour of an almost aggressive mediocrity yes  the children are sweet yes  it almost looks like its done professionally but this is film making by numbers a direct smash and grab on what the director obviously thinks is success  a film which patronises and despises the audience its quite amazing that working title would pour Â£3m into this rubbish but then they paid for love actually dont waste your money
