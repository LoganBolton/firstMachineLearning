egadsbr br i used to think keannu reeves was the worst actor in hollywood i not so sure anymore willy gives keannu some stiff competition with his im made of plaster performance in this moviebr br combine that with the fact that there is almost no plot and not a single likable character and its pretty hard to recommend this turkeybr br natasha tries her best but even julia roberts couldnt save this flick from obscuritybr br avoid it unless its really late and theres nothing else on oh heck in that case just read a book
