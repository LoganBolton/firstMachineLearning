weve seen a story like this before a wife in marital troubles played by nastassja kinski engages in sex with a stranger william baldwin and then wants to go back to her life with husband and girl when she returns home she finds out that her husband has finally found a job everything seems bright however kinski finds out that her husbands new boss is actually the stranger who still shows interest over her and seems to do anything to get what he wants what to do say nothingbr br i didnt really like the movie while it wasnt just bad it clearly lacked that something maybe it shouldve focused more on whats going inside kinskis head nothing to say about the actors themselves i guess baldwin was a good choice for the role of the obsessed boss but the characters seemed somewhat stereotypical acting the way you would see characters acting in your everyday tv films finally the ending totally ruined what could have been an interesting plotbr br in my opinion the movie tried to look cool it had a bit of shaky camerawork here and there some stills fast cuts and glamour but in the end i think it fits spelling productions much better same goes for the music otherwise it didnt look that badbr br some might like this but it definitely wasnt my cup of tea to be fair i dont usually watch much this type of thrillers this one felt too long even if it was just an hour and a half long i think it couldve worked better as an hour long episode in some tv series there was absolutely no need for some of the scenes especially the shower scenebr br my advice try before you buy
