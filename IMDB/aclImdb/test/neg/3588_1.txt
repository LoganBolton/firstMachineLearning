fc de kampioenens only reason for existence is its local popularity it has caused this sitcom to run for over 15 years and still countingbr br it deals about an amateur soccer team with the emphasis amateur every storyline deals with the same subject some misunderstanding that takes ridiculous and predictable proportions to get resolved in the endbr br the shows been running for over 15 years now and the production probably decided not to change a winning team which means that the show has had minor changes over the course of years besides a couple of actors getting replaced they nearly all left by themselves rather than being thrown of the show the humor hasnt changed a bit over the years and it was already outdated when it first aired in the first placebr br i guess you have to be flemish to get this and over 60 years old to enjoy such an old fashioned tv show as this
