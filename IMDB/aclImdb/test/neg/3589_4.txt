i know its a movie but when it comes to portray real life in any matter it should be as faithful as possible im sorry but el misterio galíndez isnt as accurate as it seems nor is the dominican republic depicted as it really is in fact it shocked me to see that the filming location for santo domingo was actually cuba and incredibly enough movies with cuban themes havana the lost city bitter sugar the godfather part ii were actually filmed in santo domingo so what happened here why did they shoot the movie in cuba instead of the dr the spanish dialogs with the cuban accent are horrible those are not dominicans on the historic level galíndez would have never been hanged he might as well been shot decapitated or died from the inhumane torture hed been receiving then thrown his body in the caribbean sea but trujillo would have never ordered death by strangulation his sick mind wouldnt have allowed itbr br acting isnt delivered as expected harvey keitel looks like hes just expecting a paycheck i prefer the leading actress in deep blue sea the rest of the cast would have been excellent in some cuban movie and the same goes for the selected shooting locationbr br i suggest la fiesta del chivo the feast of the goat from bestselling author mario vargas llosa directed by his cousin luis llosa its a bit more realistic with dominican history the trujillo character is very well portrayed and the galindez incident is treated very briefly in this movie
