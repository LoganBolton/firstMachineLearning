despite the fact that this was a madefortv movie and an obvious one at that ie cheap looking class warfare left me wishing i could get my money back and considering this lame production was partially funded through canadian dollars i might just be entitledbr br what made me sit through it in the first place was seeing actress lindsey mckeon who ive watched for the last couple years in her role as goodygoody mara lewis on the soapopera guiding light taking a turn at playing the bad girl for a change br br surprisingly she does quite well as kristen a spoiled richbtch who suddenly finds herself dirtpoor but with a conniving streak and a twist of fate that will possibly change her fortunes back around the twist of fate is provided in the character of richard robin dunne a sociallyradical outcast who discovers that he has just gone from having nothing to winning 23 million on a lottery ticket now put richard kristen her jockboyfriend jason wade carpenter and their camcorderobsessed mutual buddy graham dave mcgowan together for the weekend in a remote cabin cut off from the world by storms and just guess what unfoldsbr br the film suffers from congesting both the story and characterspersonas and motives too much everyone is pretty onedimensional and it doesnt take a rocketscientist to figure out that some things and some people are going to go very bad very quickly i dont think this is that original a plot and it doesnt go out of its way to make itself anything more the acting is ok mckeon is spoton as the manipulative female lead and dunne is very good perhaps a little too good at times but no one else is worth writing home about the only other real credit i can give the film is the one twist i didnt see coming towards the end not the very end though that one is so obvious it hurts regardless i sat through all of it and lived to tell the tale so i cant say it was a complete writeoff br br 410 a somethingtowatchwhennothingelseison type movie
