i have rated this movie a 110 and have done this in good nature this movie is not as it seems and i dont get the point of it take the first joke for instance theirs that sign at the beginning to start well that was ok but then they start having some guy talking about the hood and then he dies then theirs the other guys who talks then he dies after the other guy says people dont get to their birthday with out dieing and he gets a cake now then he dies br br the jokes are just stupid they aret that smart and i would have thought they would have been better from some one like the directors of scary moviebr br shawn wayans written by  marlon wayans written by  phil beauman written bybr br but it sucked and i hop next time they want to make another comedy they make some good jokes not lame ones
