when i heard they were making this i was quited happy considering the first film was pretty good if a little on the short sidebr br but then i remembered some of the disney sequel disasters i have previously watched im looking at you little mermaid 2br br anyway i watched it and unfortunately i was very disappointed the best thing about it is the animation is superb it really has that special polish that the proper disney films havebr br apart from that the rest is disappointing the storyline is seriously all over the place one moment its about something then completely changes to another storyline and then changes to another completely different storyline it reminded me of how the family guy movie was like 3 separate episodes turned into a filmbr br i laughed perhaps once at the most kronk was very funny in the original film but in this he just isnt funny at allbr br stay away from this film unless someone lends it to you for freebr br 410
