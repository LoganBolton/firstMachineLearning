ewww a disney sequel that is rubbish who would have thought it actually quite a lot judging by the comments here and they arent wrong i actually looked forward to seeing this awful film based on my liking of the original and therein lies disneys whole cashin mentality shovel out any old junk on the back of a success and people will go for it dont think they are that cynical ask yourself this thenhow many disney films have sequels and thenhow many of those sequels spawn a followup a significantly lower numberbr br kronks new groove is just another example of this the plot is laughably simplistic and drawn out even more annoying was the increased number of out of place items and scenes  an old folks home for example and god forbid an aztec version of the boy scouts worse yet kronks opposing chippamunk leader has a completely bewildering overthetop english accent for no reason whatsoever an accent that was after a very short while intensely grating on the nervesbr br there are a couple of good things the animation is very nice and the voice talent do well with the substandard dialogue they are given  especially warburton in the lead role but other than this there really is nothing to recommend it sure little kids may like it but there is little to amuse mum and dad whilst they sit through this tortuous maiming of the original conceptbr br avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal youd use in avoiding a pack of ravening maneating lions
