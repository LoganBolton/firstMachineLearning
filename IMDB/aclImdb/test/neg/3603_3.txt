another direct to video movie from disney that is essentially perfect for the kids the problem with kronks new groove i find is that everything that made the first movie a fun great ride is replaced with a more sad and sombre film in this movie kronk learns a great deal of lessons at many others expenses it takes away much time that could be spent at creating a more enjoyable filmbr br kronks new groove deals with two stories yzma returns for payback and one ms birdwell hopes to defeat kronks camp counseling championship this all leads up to kronk confronting his father and his disapproval over his sons direction in lifebr br from lord of the rings to michael jacksons thriller kronks new groove recycles every bit of time that it allows to entertain its viewers if you loved the original or are looking forward to the upcoming tv series about kuzco i recommend kronk to his loyal fans
