this might sound weird but i only got to see the first movie the emperors new groove yaddayadda a week ago and only because of one episode of the tv show i simply adore kuzcos character but kronk isnt that bad either anyway eventually i decided to watch the second film just so i wouldve seen it hoped it would be as good as the first one but im sorry to tell this but the more the humour got american the more i yawned i agreed with kuzco when he started crying seeing all the cheesy footagebr br still younger kids and probably veterans too will love this movie to bits if they like the old school moralising disney that is but i just had expectations that were an eensy teensy little bit hell of a lot higher than they shouldve been kronk is a lovely character being good hearted and dumb all at once but it were pacha and kuzco in drag that woke me up at the end of the movie ill ignore rudy for as far thats possiblebr br anyway great movie just not my style and as they say you always have to be true to your groove
