but of course i was wrongbr br now i never expected to like the first movie im not sure whats up with disneys marketing group but it seems that every trailer they make for an animated film ends up turning me off as too childish or silly or stupid and yet the movies themselves are usually anything but and no movie looked worse to me in the trailers than the emperors new groove which is why i was quite surprised to actually find myself quite enjoying that film when i finally broke down and saw it i entered with zero expectations and came out pleasantly entertainedbr br despite disneys track record with directtovideo sequels i had nonetheless hoped for a better experience with kronk here but in the end i was nothing but disappointed and unfortunately not exactly surprised that i felt that way theres almost no humor targeted towards adults the original songs are uninspired and sickly cute the animation while not bad still doesnt come close to emperor which was no lion king to start withbr br the main plot as such is astoundingly minor and is comprised mainly of a sequence of miniplot flashbacks  in fact the while thing felt more like a sequence of pilot episodes for a saturday morning cartoon series than a well conceived single entitybr br david spade gets about four lines throughout the entire movie and there isnt exactly a lot of john goodman either so overall were just left with far too much of patrick warburtons kronk  who was entertaining as a secondary character in the first movie but is completely inappropriate as the main lead herebr br although kids might find it somewhat fun the only thing kronks new groove managed to do for me is make me want to go back and watch the far superior original
