a group of tourists are stranded on snake island after an unfortunate accident with their boat they are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected it isnt called snake island because its just soooooo much fun to say  it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the large snake population which is just what happens with these poor dumb souls this is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off screen snake attacks and lousy performances from nobody actors the only somewhat entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene which aint anything couldnt see in a pg13 rated movie folks if you are into snake movies than check out sssssss but dont torture yourself with this crap
