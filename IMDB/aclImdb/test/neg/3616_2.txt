i really dont think its necessary that i write a review on a movie with a title as derisory as snake island but even in the abstract confines of its own genre this hit a new low so my anger must be known the only reason why i even bothered to watch this unbelievably bad movie is because i knew it was going to be bad it was really late at night i could not sleep and in the past really bad movies would drain the energy out of me and make me long for slumber it became very quickly very early on that this movie was going to be awful but it condescended below even those expectationsbr br the movie was directed and written by wayne crawford who also stars in the movie as a tourist guide on the african river who ends up having to strand his team on a remote island called snake island until another boat comes down to pick them up they hang out get drunk and then become subject to the onslaught of poisonous snakes who are on a mission to purge their island of human beingsbr br if your jaw dropped at the last sentence of my second paragraph dont bother to reread it you got it right the first time frankly i prefer my creature features when the creatures just attack the nonsensically dumb humans out of hunger not because they have some kind of a mission these arent mutant snakes theyre not giants like what you see in anaconda theyre just ordinary everyday african snakes like mambas and vipersonly they have the brains to form armies take up causes work together to trap people understand our language and even dance did your draw drop again well its going to drop further amount midway through this awful bmovie about the part where id already given up the human characters start drinking around a campfire and then all of a sudden they break down into some kind of an orgy and while they dance nude and such the snakes hunting them all of a sudden stop and start jamming along to it the combination of this scene and the scene where we discover that snakes some the most roguish creatures on the planet have formed an alliance against human beings for some oddball reason proved just too much for my poor brain and just when i though the filmmakers couldnt take it to an even lower level the snakes started to singbr br the people in the movie well lets just say that never before have i rooted for the creatures to kill everybody off so quickly i just could not stand it any longerbr br i really dont think i need to keep going on you get the picture if there is anything that makes snake island any different from its other rivals its that it does dare to try to be even dumber and thats not a complimentary achievement whyjust whyi continue to subject myself to these really bad movies i guess ill never really know but snake island hits a brand new low its a cheap trashy excuse for a motion picture that makes anaconda a brainless snake movie look as brilliant and sophisticated and thrilling as steven spielbergs jaws you have been warned
