dont waste your time one of those coollooking boxes that you pick up at blockbuster on a hunch but not even worth that you will not say its so bad its good just its bad the greatest american hero is a writer who rents a cabin on african island called snake island some other tourists are on the boat that drops him off but they are not staying on the island they just stop there to let off the writer then the boat is stranded there and in true hollywood originality the one and only radio on the island is busted so they start walking around and see a bunch of snakes like hundreds of them which really became annoying and you knew the plot would go nowhere its not like there ever was one main snake like a giant mutated snake or an extra poisonous king of all snakes instead there are just a bunch of hamandegger snakes of all kinds of breeds their only goal then was to escape the islandas opposed to having to conquer the enemy because there were so many snakes you knew they couldnt possibly try to kill them all and they didnt try ive seen a similar movie where a town was haunted by snakes and they lead all the snakes into a cave then blew it up at least then you get the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys and it was a normal ending in snake island by the way every single character was shocked to see snakes on the islandduhhhhh its named snake island for a reason there was no plan other than trying to get gas for the stupid boat oh they never do get gas by the way they just happen to find another boat on the island already gassed up
