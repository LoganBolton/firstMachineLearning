i usually like movies about animals or reptiles turning against the mean old humans who threaten their environment but i have to say snake island was a major letdownbr br the premise is interesting a group of people including a writer numbly played by william katt goes to an island called duh you guessed it snake island and quess what the island lives up to its name that is one thing i will give this movie there are snakes lots and lots of snakes of all sizes and kinds so that part of the movie in fairness lives up to its name but the writing acting and directing is soooooooo lame it is almost painful to sit throughbr br the characters are so unlikeable i was begging for the snakes to finish these horrible people off to put us all out of our misery there are a couple of scenes that are so surreal and ridiculous they have be seen to be believedsnakes gyrating to really horrible disco music while 2 women dance seminude together and a scene with a snake holding some inane dialogue with one of the actors its beyond absurd i think the writer was trying to be funny but this just came off like some weird lsd tripbr br i remember william katt years ago back when he starred in carrie what a hunk he wasnot that he was ever a major star but to be reduced to this garbage i feel for himbr br avoid this movie like the plague unless you are really into movies that feature lots and lots of snakes and really horrible humans
