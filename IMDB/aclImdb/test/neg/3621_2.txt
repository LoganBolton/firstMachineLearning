zoey 101 is basically about a girl named zoey who transfers into an all boys boarding school during the first year that they integrate girls into it that raw plot line is ill admit a pretty good idea although this show was meant for children a five year old could probably point out its fatal flaws first zoey is a clich√© character her being super popular super attractive super smart and theres nothing wrong with her no girl is like that it feels like the show was put the spotlight on jamie lynn spears and increase her fame dana who appeared at the beginning of the first season is just plain mean however in my opinion she was probably the most realistic character of them all which is sad seeing that dana is never nice nicole is too peppy and acts like a complete airhead but mysteriously gets straight as lola seems to be able to fool anything with her emmydeserving acting skills quinn is supposed to be super smart and although she is able to create the most unrealistic things she is also made out to be weird and she never gets any guys although she is both beautiful and smart while zoey lola and nicole get guys and theyre all beauty and no personality chase and michael are very similar and i even sometimes get them confused logan is unrealistically rich and hands out millions like theyre dollars nobodys that rich ive also noticed that every character on the show is mean to that stacy girl who does nothing but act nice to them thats not funny thats mean and it just influences young girls to act mean to totally nice people finally the school itself adds the frosting to the unreal cake by providing the students with 5star amenities such as a scenic location sushi bar hot lounge equipped with free soda machines pooljacuzzi movie theater and the allowance for boys and girls to freely go into the other sexs dorm rooms at most boarding schools if a boy were to go into a girls dorm or vice versa they would be expelledbr br in conclusion zoey 101 was poorly written and should have spent a few more years in the drafting process
