this is a childrens tv series about a marysue who is at the same time mean and bitchy i couldnt bring my self to sit through 3 episodes of zoey101 not to mention that jamie lynn spears cant act to save her life what message does this show bring to kids if youre not perfect like zoey youre unworthy rollseyesbr br its absurd how zoeys character is exactly the type of person who would be despised in real life yet she manages to become so popular then there is chase who is basically a lovesick puppy who worships the ground zoey walks on then there is the fact that all the other characters seem to have been dumbed down in order to stop them from outshining zoey im sorry but the characterization in this show  extremely unrealistic
