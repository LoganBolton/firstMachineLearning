i strongly dislike this show i mean like basically everyone at that school is perfect and rich and i doubt a boarding school would look as cool as that and why do they suddenly allow girls into the school isnt that just a little weird anyways jamie lynn spears cannot act she always has the same facial expression which really annoys me she is basically emotionless and all the guys seem to like herbr br and shouldnt chase tell her he likes her its not that hard really none of this show is real life and she isnt a girl like me because majority of the regular girls do not go to boarding school do not have designer clothes and do not live by the beachbr br fake fake fake
