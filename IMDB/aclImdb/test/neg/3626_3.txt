okay people i have to agree with almost everyone elses reviews here the characters are stupid theyre all stereotypical and yet have nice clothes and are always skinnybr br dont even get me started on jamie lynns role as zoey zoey is a pretty popular tan blonde young teen who everyone just loves she has a rebellious great personality that everyone agrees with no matter how dumb or extreme it is most annoying of all her voice is so darn bubbly and obnoxious omgbr br take for example the first episode the moment she steps onto the huge pca campus everyone seems to love her the boys want to ask her out the girls want to be her friend etc thinking shes all that the episode plays out with zoey always being the center of attention she is the socalled best player of the unofficial girls basketball team confident and has everyone pity her when she weakly gets hit in the face oh boohoobr br my favorite character by far is this whole series is a girl that appears much later into the show lauren or something who is the only person ever introduced in the show to hate zoeybr br and zoey doesnt even seem to be very loyal to her friends sometimes in one episodes she even calls her friend a freak without ever apologizing and doesnt show the least bit regret in doing sobr br zoey is always the bestbr br desiging professional tshirts and backpacks which become a big hitbr br coming up with very elaborate schemes by herself to teach a single person a lesson br br flawless grades br br taking the blame for stuff that wasnt even related to her just so everyone else could be happybr br coming up with a commercial that was so good it was put on tv the list goes on and onbr br ugh she has no acting talent shes always the perfect person she acts snotty and rebellious and preppy andugh cant stand herbr br not only that but everyone in the show always has great clothes even the nerd her wardrobe is better than mine and mine is pretty freaking decentbr br no one cares if everyone at pca loves you zoey and would do anything for you even if it meant giving their right armbr br but regardless of these cardboard characters the plots are creative not everyday things theyre interesting and amusing the humor is usually goodnatured and fun but the characters are so paper flat that its hard to enjoy itbr br this show would be really good if dan schnieder put a bit more time thinking of the type of characters he wanted because they are so typical so boring thats its lame and stupidbr br point no ones the least bit overweight everyone has stylish clothes zoey is the definition of marysue the story lines are wellthought out and the humor is laughable but again i want to emphasize that the characters taint the show watch the show if you must but dont say i didnt warn you if your eyes start to bleed
