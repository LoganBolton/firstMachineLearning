this television show is stereotypical and farfetched in many of its aspectsbr br first of all the setting all of the characters attend pca this unbelievable boarding school with painted stylish dorms the campus seems to have no reasonable rules  for instance the boys are often seen in the girls dormitories and vice versa but this may be simply because the dorm adviser a silly character that basically bores the viewer instead of amusing them as i assume her purpose is supposed to be sits around and does nothing i have friends in boarding schools and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this showbr br next the characters i was so disappointed to discover that nickelodeon wasnt creative at all with the personalities in this show they all represent on characteristic which is exaggerated to the extreme zoey is supposedly perfect in everything she does looks grades sports guys judgment creativity etc michael is the jock logan is the arrogant jerk who basically does nothing aside from aggravate all the characters as well as us poor viewers nicole is the preppy idiot who knows nothing but somehow maintains straightas dana was the tough girl quinn is the unrealistic smart kid whom they consistently make fun of chase is the guy who is afraid of confessing his true feelings which really aggravates me as the show continues and that new girl lola or something is just another clone of nicolebr br the main two characters that aggravate me the most are zoey and quinn first of all i just do not understand zoeys character she was obviously created to be the perfect character as i said above but she seems to be the most flawed out of all of them in most of the episodes she creates a problem then has to fix it whats frustrating is that we are supposed to love her and think she is amazing when they havent even created a very realistic character to begin withbr br quinn on the other hand bothers me because she is exaggerated to the point at which her character is absolutely insulting the impression i get from nick concerning her character is that geeks and nerds are people to laugh at to criticize to mock in the spring break episode they did a year ago they introduced two more nerds who the characters had to make cool i found this highly offensive and stereotypical what kind of message is nick sending to these kids is it dont do well in school dont get good grades dont study hard youll end up being a geek and we will mock your profession in future television series because that is definitely the message i get from these poorly constructed characters and it is an awful message through and throughbr br all i can do is hope that nick one day realizes that by putting down the intelligent folks in our world they are not doing anyone any good
