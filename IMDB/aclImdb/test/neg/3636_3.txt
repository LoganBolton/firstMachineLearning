the only time i ever actually laugh while watching this show is when im making fun of it jamie lynn spears only got the acting job because of her big sister and i dont think anyone could argue with me on that there is no expression in her face ever even when she smiles  just watch the show and youll see what i mean now lets talk about the show zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows ive ever seen as a lot of people have already said zoey brooks is absolutely perfect everyone loves her shes a straight a student and all the boys think that shes hot pca is a boarding school full of rich kids that gives all their students flatscreen tvs and laptop computers serving kids sushi from the sushi bar in one of the newest episodes zoey is completely clueless and thinks that chase is not in love with her and acts as if she doesnt even want chase to love her then when she barges into chases dorm room to prove her friends wrong she finds chase kissing this girl named rebecca zoey of course freaks out probably because she likes the attention from chase anyway only watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on television is zoey 101 you can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is
