this show makes meand many others hate their lives lets face it zoey is perfect shes bland pretty gets good grades everyone goes to her for advice shes popular she goes to an amazing school with amazing rooms reasons why i gave this show a 3 1 the acting is horriblesometimes i just want to hurt the people who put these untalented actressesespecially victoria justice on television 2 the characters are unbelievable and mismatched you have your typical popular girl a peppy shallow stupid stereotypical girl who is portrayed by a horrible actress then you have a typical jock guy who is somewhat normal and actually nicethen the stereotyped smart girl who is a freak and obviously does not fit in with the perfect popular friends of hers then a stuck up rich pretty boy that would be happier gazing into a mirror all day then the wanna be actress who is played by another stinky actress and last a normal nerd person guy 3 the plot is boring and lame 4 i hate how spoiled these characters are cant they just be normal 5 everything ends up perfect for them and we all are reminded of how much our lives stink
