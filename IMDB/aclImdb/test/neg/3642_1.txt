when i first watched zoey101 with my sister we thought it was a piece of garbage no one is that rich and lives at a dorm off the pacific coast in the show zoey is a mega popular rich girl that everyone always go to her for advice zoey is always the one with the good idea and everyone agrees with her no matter how stupid her idea is she is always perfect at everything including her perfect figure and she is such a dietetic freak she talks about carbs like she knows what they are when she sees that her friends are eating chocolate she confiscates it and another thing that ticks me off is that she is always chewing a piece of spearmint every time you look at her and everyone wants something do with her for example in one episode that logan guy bid 4000 to have her and her friends cheer for everything he does in his pathetic life and her friend nicole is an overly perky freak that screams a lotand lola dresses like a hoochie houdini lady 80s called they want there bushy hair backmight as well shave off the hair chase this show sends a bad message to kids everywhere to make them think that if they dont have the latest ipods and designer clothes they will hate themselves br br this show is a big thumbs down br br we hate you jamie lynn br br best wishes ryan and kara l
