a feminist tract in which if you the viewer believe that i wild animals are seldom tamed by singing but instead attack kill and eat the line that grizzlies never attack unless provoked was a hoot  unless provoked means that it sees flesh ii homosexuality is both immoral per se  and its acceptance almost always associated throughout history with signs of a societys dissolution and decay iii few women are bisexual in this one virtually every woman is presented as having no preference for men or women iv divorce is far worse than infidelity v land is there for human beings to use develop and enjoy vi it is as incumbent upon a mother of an adult son to keep in touch as it is upon the son vii a mother raising her son alone is an unfortunate and real tragedy for the child viii the idolization of a parent for worthwhile ideals is a good and healthy thing ix adults continue to bear a responsibility for their sexual behavior no matter their age and the duty to engage in this most intimate and giving of acts only within the most intimate and openly sacrificial of relationships marriage  believe me you are not going to like this film essentially its a howard stern sort of fellow who is brought down by a jane fonda sort of woman think the electric horseman its ugly stuff because the values the ideals of the screenplay are all so harmfulbr br i share the other objections about the odd things in the writing a why would this man lose every girlfriend he has  because he refuses to reveal that his mothers death and funeral caused him to be unable to keep dates with them its a mystery why he just keeps saying it was personal when faced with angry and disappointed women huh br br b theres an enormous inconsistency ie the screenwriter wants to have it both ways by telling us that the protagonists mother loved the father with everything she had  and then later were told that there was only one great love in her life  her lesbian girlfriendbr br c the underlying legal assumptions are nonsense were never told that the executor has any right to live at the property  merely that she shall determine the timing of the sole heirs title and right to occupy the property yet somehow the film makes it appear that the executor is the rightful occupant  which is crazy try to think of any executor of any will who uses the decedents property before the wills bequests are fulfilled  it doesnt happenbr br d the assumption throughout this film is that women are equally drawn to men and women  its just absurd thus were told i that penelope ann millers character is dating other men near the end of the film  after having been with the decedent for five years  and before that in a fulfilling relationship with the protagonist ii that the protagonists housekeeper after being devoted throughout her adult life to her kind husband  is now dating another woman iii that one girlfriend upset with the protagonist would now therefore like to try a womanbr br iv that a male transsexual is eager to date the protagonist v that mary kay places character naturally looked at other women in college and they looked back she says with an idiotic triumphal flip of the headbr br this is all just ridiculousbr br i agree with others about the sound of the dvd i had to keep it at maximum volume and repeatedly rewind to understand names phrasesbr br this is a film by someone who really despises traditional heroics by any man hates the notion that a man is needed to raise a child loathes the idea that there is any necessary connection between marriage and sex the film is out to preach  and that kind of propaganda of false messages doesnt sit well
