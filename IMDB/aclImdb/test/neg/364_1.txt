first of all let me start by saying that i have been a devoted follower of c thomas howells career ever since the outsiders and the hitcher he was an up and coming star in the 1980s  with hits such as soul man also the future was bright for this young actor and he had the potential to go on from there and really assert himself in hollywood put it this way  tom cruise had a bit part in the outsiders while howell had the lead look at cruise today  but picking material like this drivel will only denigrate howells career even more  if that was possible why does he pick stuff like this a small part in a major movie would be of more benefit to him than this rubbishbr br essentially the story here takes place in a postapocalyptic world where everybody lives underground where chaos reigns howell is a shepherd  protecting the flock of various religious leaders by killing off any undesirables hes a hitman in other wordsbr br the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic toobr br i hate writing bad reviews about films  especially those in which i really like the star  but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this moviebr br in short  this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell come on c  give yourself some credit and wrestle yourself away from these nonhit wonders and try to knuckle down and get a good part  however smallbr br 110  and only because there is no setting for 010
