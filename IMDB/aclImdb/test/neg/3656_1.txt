from reading the back of the box my first thought was that this is probably a knock off of saw 2 i couldnt be further from the truth it seemed to me like they gave somebody with downsyndrom a camera phone and 1000 and told them to make a movie the plot didnt exist and neither did the acting it was almost as if i was watching a silent film about grass growing it didnt surprise me at all to find out later that the entire film was improvised by the end of this film i had lost the will to live and i may have gotten aids just from viewing this piece of cinematic crap it was about 70 minutes that i could have spent doing something that was less painful like jumping off of a building
