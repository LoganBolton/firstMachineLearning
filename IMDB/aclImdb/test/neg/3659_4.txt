maybe i saw a cleaned up version but other than a few flashes of breasts im not sure what over the top nudity these other commenters are referring tobr br all in all not as bad as i was expecting by the previous comments although the end leaves you wondering  wtf it was dark but not so much that you couldnt make out the scenes and i think it just added to the creepiness and the terror of the situationbr br film quality could have been better but the acting was pretty decentbr br all in all a decently creepy and yes brutal movie with a disappointing ending
