if you enjoy sitting in the dark both literally and figuratively for ninety minutes then this is the movie for youbr br a waste of actors resources and audience time ultimately a waste of space dont be tempted by the resume there is nothing of any further substance beyond it the film lacks all of the basics that you might expect from the genre plot character development denouement the cast may perhaps take heart from the knowledge that in this instance their efforts will be entirely forgettable and given time their careers may perhaps improvebr br absolute tripe
