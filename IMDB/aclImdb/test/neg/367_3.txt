i am so disappointed after waiting for 3 years for repeatsthe dvd of the original masterpiece series darkplace i couldnt wait for this series the first episode just ended and i am appalled everything that was great about darkplace has been erased here pretty much worst introduction canned laughter this takes the original point of it away and just renders it nearly unwatchable one joke about garths eyes fertilizing the audience was good the rest i can hardly remember it feels like a poor quality knowing me knowing you i hope this improves as the series goes on otherwise i shall be seriously disappointed back to darkplacebr br you are the most compassionate man i ever known and i know god
