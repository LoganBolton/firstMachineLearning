i suffered the watching of this movie at sitges festival last month if there would be a possibility of unfilm a movie to avoid its existence this should be the first in the list maría lidón isnt a director she is just a dumb woman that pretends that holding a camera with the hand and shout action makes her a professional film maker what a mistake the movie itself is pointless and a total waste of good actors that could be doing something better in another project val kilmer does nothing but place his face in front of the camera his character dont have specific weight in the movie the same thing can tell about joss ackland vincent gallo or joaquim de almeida its a shame the way rade serbedzijas character has been written warning spoilersbr br he spends most of the time alone in the tunnels talking with himself in the way now im doing this now im low of bats ill search in my bag now im turning left now im turning right only to bring the audience a clear idea about his actions its simply nonsense and proves the lack of talent of the director end of spoilersbr br the usual joke about this piece of garbage among the audience was that the title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it zero
