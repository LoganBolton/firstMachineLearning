i like 50s scifi movies a lot i like the really good ones such as the day the earth stood still when worlds collide invasion of the body snatchers and many others and sometimes the really bad ones because they can be really funny and great to watch with friends such as plan 9 from outer space however when a scifi movie is bad but not bad enough to be fun it really should be avoided this movie is just such a film the posters make it appear as some sort of sexy shebeast is attacking mankind whereas the real plot is a lot less interesting a woman is married to a womanizer she is contaminated and begins to grow to a huge size and decides to track down this worm and kick his tail and thats about it also many of the special effects really stinkespecially the gigantic papier mache hand that comes into the room to grab the wicked hubby
