a woman as rich as she is insecure has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdowns helped no doubt by a smoothtalking gigolo husband who openly cheats on her naturally nobody believes her when she claims to have been accosted by a giant man who stepped out of a giant satellite much to the delight of her husband this could be the incident which finally puts her away for good br br from the very opening scenes with its ludicrous news broadcast and ridiculous satellite encounter youll probably be convinced that the only redeeming value of this movie is that it is so bad that it is funny although not too far off the mark this is most definitely not truebr br unlike most movies of this genre this is not really a scifi or a horror film but actually a serious drama which intelligently incorporates a scifi scenario into the plot its not a good or even mediocre drama but it will exceed your expectations if you werent expecting any legitimate drama at all the acting is surprisingly good for such a low budget effort and most importantly it is well edited and excellently paced it is never boring and manages to generate more than a little interest in seeing what will come next nevertheless this is still a movie strictly for those who cant pass up the chance to see a 1950s film with a title like attack of the 50 foot woman
