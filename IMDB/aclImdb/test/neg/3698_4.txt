this is the kind of movie that begs to be shown on tv at 3 or 4 in the morning if at allbr br no doubt the filmmakers responsible for attack of the 50 foot woman thought they were making a pertinent statement about women and philandering and the dangers of the demon rum all wrapped up in a scifi allegory br br or maybe it was a tax writeoffbr br either way attack proves best for the viewer under the following circumstances a extreme intoxication b seen on a doublebill with any of those jacqueline suzanne movies maybe once is not enough or c just a night when you feel insecure and the world around you is a little too perfect pop in attack and youll feel great guaranteedbr br its good for a laugh at the expense of the hokey script the rubbery special fx and that foureyed sheriff and i think the last line should be engraved in a monument somewhere in washington dc  its just that memorablebr br four stars for attack of the 50 foot woman buy a copy mail it to gloria steinem  shell love you for it
