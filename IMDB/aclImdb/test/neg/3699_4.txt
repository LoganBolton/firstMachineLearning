this is a fair movie good for oneoff viewing the plot itself is fairly well worked for a picture of this kind which is a pleasent surprise as is the acting which although a little hammy is better than normal for these types of flickbr br the special effects are hilarious  a translucent giant and a blatantly polystyrenepapier mache hand wobbling unconvincingly on a bit of wirebr br definitely to watch once for kitsch entertainment valuebr br 510
