i know that trey parker and matt stone really hate celebrities and spoof them in every single episode of south park if not showing them then mentioning them and they love to mock and joke and make fun of themselves too but i felt this mockumentary went too farbr br for one thing the most common running theme in the documentary is that theyre episodes are meaningless pieces of crap they put out just for the money obviously thats completely untrue if you even bother to watch any episode and the constant you know i learned something todays said at the end of almost every episode by the main characters the creators are also depicted as pompous arrogant asses who only care about money including a supposedtobefunnybutisnt scene involving isaac hayes delivering lines for chef over the phone and trey parker yelling and screaming at him for sucking and hanging up i guess its supposed to be funny but the pretension in it just really made it cringebr br the way they interview employees working for trey and matt shows the duo as tyrants who push their employees to the limit all just for money in the end completely untrue obviously and all a joke but its just not funny its disturbing even though its just a joke
