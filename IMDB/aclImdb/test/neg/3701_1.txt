i know a lot of people like this show and i apologise to people who think this show is awesome but it is the worst show ever created sure im sure i would be a big fan of this show if jeremy clarkson wasnt on it i mean i think that testing out cars and doing things like seeing whether a car can beat a aeroplane is awesome but jeremy clarkson is just pathetic here are the reasons i hate this man  he thinks its cool to trick speed cameras that measure your average speed by taking measuring your distance and time by driving 200mph down the road and then resting for two hours  he clearly thinks that he is better than richard hammond and james may  hes got my best friend saying pathetic things  he screams at kids just for taking a picture of him im sorry top gear but jeremy clarkson is a freak
