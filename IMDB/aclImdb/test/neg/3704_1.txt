this movie is the very worst that i have ever seen you might think that you have seen some bad movies in your time but if you havent seen this one you dont know how terrible a movie can be but wait theres worse news the studio will soon rerelease this masterpiece im being ironic for all to see the only things worse than the plot of this movie are the effects the acting the direction and the production bill rebane the poor mans ed wood not that there is a rich mans ed wood i like ed woods movies though manages to keep things moving at a snails pace throughout this film it opens with the capture of a baby bigfoot a littlefoot sorry couldnt help it by a pair of unlikable hunters who are killed by the parent this causes the entire town where the hunters lived to go on a bigfoot hunting jihad this is pretty much it for the plot nothing even remotely interesting happens and we the viewers are never able to care about any of the characters if one is interested in the films of rebane i would recommend almost any other over this however as i said it will soon be rereleased by troma in order to bore a new generation of filmgoers
