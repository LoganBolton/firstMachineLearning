zero stars out of br br endless descent has absolutely no redeeming values whether its the ridiculously bad acting the laughably awful special effects the incompetent direction the stupid script or the gratingly annoying musical score its the kind of pitiful production that makes me wonder how a movie like this could even have the slightest consideration for being greenlighted by a studio in the first placebr br i dont think im going to delve into the plot other than to say its about a bunch of people who are trapped under the water and have to kill a lot of fakelooking creaturesbr br let me go more into detail as to what is so awful about this flick first of all the acting is simply horrendous jack scalia is ten times worse than sylvester stallone a feat that is hard enough to accomplish as it is the supporting performances arent really any better and what is with actor luis lorenzo the guy who plays the cook francisco he has a highpitched voice and an accent that sounds appropriate for a comedy not a scifi horror filmbr br the special effects are even worse the creatures range from weirdlooking eels to giant starfish and mostquitoes the effects look like something you would see in a muppet movie and i dont believe i need to delve further in this issuebr br director jp simon has slight cult status because of all the terrible films hes made im sure some will enjoy endless descent in an ed wood type of way but i dont even think its that good everything he does is shoddy especially the camerawork the man cannot direct a movie thats all there is to itbr br this was the last of four films that took place underwater and it sure does make leviathan and deep star six both bad films in their own right start to look masterful in comparison either way just stick with the abyss
