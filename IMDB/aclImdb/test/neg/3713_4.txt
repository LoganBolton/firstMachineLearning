i love juan piquersimón hes my absolute favorite badmovie director and throughout his whole career he incompetently tried to cash in on simply every successful contemporary trend in the horror and fantasy genres after the big hit that was superman jp made his own and hilarious supersonic man he picked in on the violent slashermovie madness with the insane pieces and he really overtrumped himself with the return of et the unofficial and downright laughable sequel to spielbergs sfblockbuster the rift is obviously inspired by the series of profitable underwater monster movies like the abyss and deepstar six from start to finish you can amuse yourself by spotting all the stolen ideas and shameless ripoffs of these and other classics when a completely new and fancy type of submarine vanishes near the deep dannekin rift a second mission with uboat designer wick hayes on board is sent out to investigate what really happened to siren one in the dark depths of the ocean the rescue mission discovers an underwater cavern where the government secretly experiments with mutant seacreatures the monsters are quite aggressive but theres also the danger of a government enemy among the crew members the rift is a forgettable film but it nevertheless has some ingenious  though very dodgy  monster models fans of blood and gore wont complain neither as the beastly attacks are quite gruesome and merciless the acting is very wooden although many of the cast names can definitely do better its advisable that you simply enjoy the clichés and gory effects in the the rift because if you start contemplating about the screenplay youll find that it makes absolutely no sense
