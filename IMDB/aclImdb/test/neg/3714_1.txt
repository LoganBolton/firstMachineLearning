on this site ive often lambasted the americans for not knowing how to write comedy but while theyve never produced anything of the quality of fawlty towers blackadder or the fall and rise of reginald perrin they have also never to my knowledge made anything as bad as this the nadir of british comedybr br on my richter scale of comic awfulness it rates only behind the truly execrable are you being served as the worst comedy show in the english language with bad acting annoying characters and humour that id grown out of before i left primary school unfortunately it was part of a large crop of shows back then along with dads army it aint half hot mum and allo allo that relied on ridiculous situations and familiar catchphrases to keep audiences amusedbr br michael crawford proved later on that hes a talented performer but personally id rather be sentenced to a month of watching rhoda than endure a single episode of this drivel which makes me ashamed to be british
