til there was you is one of the worst films weve ever seen it fails in every respect jeanne tripplehorn was better as an actress in waterworld in comparison this film is dungworld when a character stumbles once or even twice in the course of a film one can understand it but jeannes character falls trips stumbles so often that she might have a bit of jerry lewis in her in her defence each prat fall was probably blocked choreographed and rehearsed and rehearsed although this is bad enough for a film the actors dylan mcdermott and jeanne tripplehorn seem to spend most of the plot going out for a smoke or trying to find a place to smoke if the film was a diatribe on having no place to smoke ok  but it isntbr br however long this film runs it is too long by 10 minutes past the running timebr br oh jeanne tripplehorn almost acts in a public forum meeting you almost see her break life into the character oh its almost as convincing as her scene yelling at michael douglas in basic instincthmm on second thought not reallybr br this is a film to avoid at all costs unless you need a cigarette and are trapped in nicotine addicts anonymous or forced to watch outtakes of hooper burt reynolds and even then toss a coin or go to sleep
