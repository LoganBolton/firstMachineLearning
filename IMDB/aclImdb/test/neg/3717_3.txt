the film has weird annoying characters strange unexplainable slapstick and an insurmountable amount of dialogue about smoking the movie has a contrived plot of a bitchy emptyheaded womans jeanne tripplehorn search for love although who would ever like jeannes character personality or reading of the dialogue i really cannot say except that she likes to smokebr br sarah jessica parker gives an interesting character performance who likes to smoke dylan mcdermott does his best to look pretty and soulful as he smokes and hey what is jennifer aniston doing there oh shes not really in it enough for anyone to care about her but she likes to smokebr br this is a waste of anyones time i dont even know how i was able to sit through as much of the movie as i did i cant even believe i spent the time to write this except to warn others of its banality anyone need a cigarette
