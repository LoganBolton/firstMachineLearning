as other reviewers have noted this movie is a cross between ie stolen from stories we have seen before specifically this looks like clint eastwood in high plains drifter inserted into mad max remove clints cigar and replace with a cigarette remove his horse and give him a hightech motorcycle and voil√† an updated drifter in this movie the hero is even more blatantly a savior than high plains drifter now our hero has long brown hair suffers a wound to his left side and his entry into town is preceded by a plea for salvation by the surviving townspeoplea pretty transparent reference to a second coming i watched the movie on a hot humid morning sleep was impossible and upon arising at 430 am there was nothing else on tv so the movie served its purpose while unoriginal with characters that are almost comic caricatures the movie is still somewhat entertainingat least at 430 in the morning
