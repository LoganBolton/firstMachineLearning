although i do not recommend this film neither do i recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie though i have not given away the ending or most of the plot twists this movie would be best viewed without any prior information its hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film donnie darko as there are many to deal with richard kelly in his first feature film seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage latenight stoner diatribes selfrighteous justifications and inoffensive banal philosophy to inspire twenty teenangst dramas then mashed them into a single two hour package with a scifi twist the result is deeply distressing for all the wrong reasons the film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning to make them sympathize with onedimensional characters and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot full of unreconciled loose ends by hiding it under a veneer of cgi effects and neosurrealism the main character donnie darko is a young man committed to therapy misunderstood by his friends and rendered hostile and disaffected by his suburban life we are meant to feel that he is more intelligent than his schoolmates although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make for example when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory about the smurfs and donnie counters with a theory of his own his friend complains about donnie acting all smart donnies speech however is no smarter than that of his friend just angrier the only clear evidence of his intelligence is his principals description of his standardized test scores as intimidating but given the directors slant against simple categorization of human elements as shown in the fearlove sequence this is a poor substitute for character development donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems which are not addressed directly in this film in fact the entire issue of the drugs is understated and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost the ambiguity of donnies strange destiny the possibility that all of this may be a product of his imagination is pushed into the background making the film 100 percent science fiction this would not be a bad thing in itself except that the science behind the fiction is very shaky the explanations of time travel are weak at best sounding like detached uninformed rambling we get the idea that the films writer once read a book about time travel or a few chapters and cant quite remember how it worked but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film the scientific portion as a result depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved at one point a teacher discussing time travel states that if he continues to speak on the subject hed be fired apparently no further explanation is needed donnies dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions the justification for these actions is a tricky business he damages his school but its okay because his school doesnt treat him like a person his punishment of a creepy selfesteem advocate somewhat similar to tom cruises character in magnolia results in the mans public humiliation but should the audience believe that donnie is some sort of avenging angel striking out against ignorance and debauchery he himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact aside from these flaws the film is riddled with flat uninteresting generalizations of humanity the story is set in 1988 just before the bushdukakis election and the director touches on this point during the film the focus however extends exactly this far donnies gruff blue collar father is voting for bush while his freespirited rebellious daughter plans to vote for dukakis there is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement here simply a statement of the obvious the former are not necessary to make a good film but the latter should be left out likewise donnies heartfelt speech about not being able to lump all human emotions into the bland categories of fear and love this doesnt ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless mr kelly gives homage to several symbols of 80s pop culture in his film et stephen king the smurfs back to the future at its heart this film feels like the directors homage to himself a collection of his own experiences interests personal heroes and adversaries affirmations and disenchantments roughly stitched together by untrained hands entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions seemingly because the director likes the songs characters who have little to no bearing on the plot including the archetypal bully fat girl and rightwing idiot teacher are given unnecessary focus because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow the awkward mess that is donnie darko leaves us wondering if mr kelly has enough ideas left in his head to make another film or if he has wasted all his creativity in one pointless cluttered meandering effortbr br my rating 110
