i dont remember too much about this movie except that there was a distinctly gratuitous destruction of luminaires lamps almost every fight scene included the unnecessary and wanton destruction of useful light fixtures even if outfitted with cheesy 70sstyle cylindrical shades to keep with the time setting of the story on one occasion raucous lamp destruction takes place in a domestic fight scene between the brothers in both the living and dining rooms of their mothers house with fixtures in both rooms being taken out yet the most malicious destruction occurs moments later in a bookies office and includes but is not limited to the toppling of a fixture with a ceramic horsehead base which is consequently disintegrated and the severe denting of a cylindrical shade as a guy falls back into it during another fisticuffs fight later that lamp is toppled as well when the guy is shot incurring further damage to the plasticcoated shadebr br while this movie encourages a particularly wasteful attitude toward lamps one should keep in mind that lamps regardless of their cheap construction or gauche topheavy appearance are still valuable for the illumination that they provide however if you ever feel the need to vicariously smash a lamp i would highly recommend this movie
