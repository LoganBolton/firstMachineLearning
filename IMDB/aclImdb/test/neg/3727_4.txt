ok if i was in the rental store and someone asked me if the movie was worth the three bucks for the rental id have to say no the plot was implausible ive come to the conclusion that keanu reeves can not act he can at times be painful to watch though my wife thinks hes cute dan aykroyd who is usually great was even a little disappointing as the crooked cop on the plus side the plot because it is farfetched is unpredictable cameron diaz was good
