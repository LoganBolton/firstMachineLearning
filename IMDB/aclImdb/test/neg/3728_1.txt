this was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever sat through and thats saying alot because ive seen my share of horrible moviesbr br but i have never seen a movie in which every single character portrayed was an unintelligent loser seriously there was not one respectable character in the entire script how fitting that the plot was equally lame lacking any intelligence whatsoeverbr br i cant believe that keanu reeves and cameron diaz would even consent to participating in such stupidity and while i havent seen all of their other movies ive always enjoyed their performances until now its not that the acting was bad just the entire story line was moronic
