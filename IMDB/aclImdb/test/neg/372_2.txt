i made it about 8 minutes into steel frontier before i turned it off then glutton for punishment that i am i watched some more the next day today i had to iron a pile of clothes so i decided to finish the movie and that was its own punishment heres what i dont understand robert rodriguez and shane carruth each spent 7000 on their debut features and created two remarkable movies yet here we have two directors with arguably way more money and they churn out a huge steaming pile of crap let me see if i can figure out the logic its road warrior but its like a future western well get the cheapest actors we can find well have my mentally challenged cousin write the script and well spend the budget on a bunch of explosions we cant losebr br seriously i dont think even the mst3k guys could improve this but if you insist on watching it i recommend getting very drunk first
