during a lifetime of seeing and enjoying thousands of films feeling minnesota is absolutely the worst major film with alist stars that i have ever seen bar none this movie totally fails on every level its poorly photographed and edited theres uninspired acting the kind where the actors appear bored out of their minds just collecting paychecks perhaps and worst of all the sludgy script appears to have been written under the influence of some unpleasant substance found only in sewers i cant even begin to comprehend how the writerdirector could ever have found anyone to finance this project let alone attract any of the stars that it did i truly wish i could get back the time that i wasted watching this piece of garbage if possible i would have given this film a grade of zero better yet a negative number
