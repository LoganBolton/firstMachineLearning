i love johns work as a singer but the movie was dull and no worth the time to view br br i thought he did an ok job at acting his part when he says your having an affair with the ol man to his costar i kinda chuckled at his facial movements or lack thereof br br i would suggest the movie if you like johns music but not as a saturday night video br br if you love his music then the video has a little music from him in it but not much br br so so at best
