i just finished watching dog watch i thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few implausibilities the acting wasnt too bad and the plot wasnt bad but as the saying goes the devil was in the detailsbr br some examplesbr br 1 the bleedthrough on charlie falons sam elliott bandage was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his knuckles that were bleedingbr br 2 would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very welllighted area this seemed very silly to mebr br i am not unusually picky about a movie but in my humble opinion this one is definitely not recommended by me
