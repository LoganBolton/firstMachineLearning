i honestly fail to understand why people love this show so much a friend of mine watches this and since i like scifi i tried to watch along since the plot of the show sounded promising but in truth it really is a very boring show the only thing that will keep you awake during this show are the video gamelike cgieffects and the complete overuse of muppets note that i call it muppets because they actually really look like muppets not like the aliens they should bebr br speaking of which the muppets and makeup effects are horribly overused in this show you have this guy who could be best described as a aliendwarfhybrid you have a pale girl who looks like a cheesy vampgirl youve got a floating pottymouth frogalien it just feels very unnecessary and furthermore even to the point that you feel distracted from the whole storyline about a lost astronautbr br every episode is also too much of a standalone the creators of this show directed this in such a way that every episode almost feels like a whole other show at least up until the point that you see the maincharactersmuppets again that is the whole plot about the maincharacter getting back to earth is way to much pushed to the background at points the acting is also quite badbr br conclusion if you want good scifi just look somewhere else this isnt even real scifi to begin with in my opinion since the show is more aimed at fantasyelements with all the puppetry and weird dreams going on and if you just want to see muppets then i suggest you watch the muppet show and feel glad that this abomination of a show has come to a endbr br by the way doesnt anyone have dejavus with the concept of a living spaceship ohyeah thats right doctor who started that concept almost about 30 years ago this show is like a collection of scifi leftovers scripts and events that were abandoned for a good reason only to be picked up by this horrible show
