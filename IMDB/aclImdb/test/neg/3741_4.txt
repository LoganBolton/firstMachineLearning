much praise has been lavished upon farscape but i dont think its that good it certainly has a distinctive look but it lacks just about everything else story purpose direction excitement you name it im a big scifi fan and i make it a point to watch all the scifi shows i can ive almost finished the four seasons of farscape and at this point im not very satisfied the show does have a few good things  most notably claudia black whos sadly missing from the first few episodes of season four  but they are very few and very far between as a whole the show is marred by a lot of very silly stuff such as fantasy elements rather than sf ditto and many many episodes esp in season four are unspeakably messy and very poorly structured and one just feels that it isnt going anywhere its mostly just nondirectional adventures with thin longrunning plot lines which develop painstakingly slowly well sometimes its a little bit tighter but it only lasts for a very few episodes at a timebr br effectswise there are a few impressive things here and there esp out in space occasionally but the show seems stuck in the same style of effects which frankly gets old fast outlandish and unconvincing puppet aliens mar the show a great deal and ive come to prefer by far the episodes where regular humanlooking characters are the focusbr br i think the peacekeepers are by far the most stylish and intriguing and interesting figures on the show they succeed in being a convincingly alien culture despite their allhuman appearance there are a few really cool episodes with them esp in the first season iirc where crichton masquerades as a peacekeeper captain and invades and eventually destroys one of their secret bases such episodes can reach a rating of 8 out of 10 but i cannot award the show as a whole more than a 4 ratingbr br aside from the peacekeepers which themselves are somewhat too singlemindedly totalitarian and militaristic to be really nuanced the show simply doesnt offer anything important or significant that you need to know or want to see otoh it does contain a few good ideas and is not a total lossbr br this is just my opinion of course but as a seasoned scifi fan i think it counts for something and may be of help to others there arent a lot of good scifi shows out there but star trek any series and especially the new battlestar galactica are definitely better than farscape but if youre a huge fan of mediocre scifi shows you may well like farscape toobr br my rating 4 out of 10
