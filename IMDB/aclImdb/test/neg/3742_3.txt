this film had a couple of funny partsbut for the most part made me want to go ahead and change dvds and watch malibus insteadwhich i had in my own collection at least i would know there was something funny coming up and give me something to look forward tobr br i was disappointed in this very low budget film and i do not judge a movie by its budgetit just lacked originality and was too predictable i would not rent or even watch this film again and i am usually a repeat offender of film the actors were forgettable the story was half thought out and it left me with an insatiable urge to get my laugh oni ended up watching jamie kennedys white boy gone gangsta to have the comedy itch scratched
