theres potential in there with tell noone a curious and intriguing plot and a french take on a very american story but for me the opportunities were not exercised herebr br although i liked aspects of this film there were three prominent failings which pulled it right down to four out of tenbr br firstly its a silly clich√©d murder mystery a particularly contrived murder she wrote or bergerac being french doesnt eliminate this problem  its just silly and in french at the same time its full of implausible coincidencesbr br secondly the transition from the us to france seems to have failed chronically this french doctor hanging out on the streets of a french city with his new homies and their blingin suvs and then theres the car chasesbr br but thirdly and mostly its just too darn long to me a film needs a good reason to be significantly over 90 minutes and over two hours takes some serious justification this once didnt have it
