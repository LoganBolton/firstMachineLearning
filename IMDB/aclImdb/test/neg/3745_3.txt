its unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by prior biases ie anger at the gay characters thinking french thrillers are bad etc i will admit that im unfamiliar with the novel but as a film after about 45 minutes i was rolling my eyes hopefully i can explain in writing my complaints eloquently enough before i get sick of spending anymore time on this film over the 2 hours of its running length2 hours that felt like 3 dont get me wrong i can sit through hour and a half silent films 3 hour epics i dont have a short attention span nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate a subtle and slowly building film here goes my grocery list of complaints first off the ending yes it had a scoobydooesquire character explains everything at the end now i actually think for this movie this was necessary the film had so many plottwists emotional revelations new facts surfacing and being discovered one reviewer said it well yes it is a very logical story but without the very essential back story their childhood stories the relationship amongst the 3 parents the relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son of the big man it just doesnt feel right i felt cheated  i wont throw in too many spoilers here i could name specific revelations that i thought were unnecessary but according to the reviews on here theres a lot of people who seem to really love this so i dont want to give anything away i personally cant stand soap operas the complexity and twists and turns for me snuffed out any impact the final revelations could possibly deliver by the end i seriously didnt care there werent any gaping plot holes necessarily this seems like it could make a great book in writing it is perfectly logical but if im supposed to believe this is reality something doesnt sit right with the pieces that have been haphazardly inserted too often i felt crucial characters we were never able to get to know were thrown in to further complicate the plot increase the emotion and develop the mystery the acting i had no complaints about the directing eh not bad but the plot and especially its development severely lacking sorry to those that felt this was a perfect thriller but i couldnt get into it i gave this a 3 simply because i dont want to seem completely unfair and it did have moments of slight intrigue and excitement br br major spoiler and i have to mention it but when the father is making his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldnt fit in another twist your father didnt die in a hunting accident i almost died when was the father at all developed or even really mentioned much in the back story are you serious like the already complex plot involving characters from all the families and their relationship to one another wasnt enough does the protagonist need another emotional whallop more than he has already been fed sorry i had to throw in such a spoiler but that just bothered me as much as ive ever been bothered in any film
