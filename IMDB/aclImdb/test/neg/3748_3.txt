first off if you want to make a good film dont cram all your exposition into the last 10 minutes the viewer is expected to be bewildered for nearly two hours only to have margos father explain everything to alex very late in the film to make matters worse the scriptwriter decided it wasnt enough to have the basic mystery solved but adds in a completely unnecessary murder that we knew nothing about involving alexs fatherbr br theres some serious motivation issues with characters also margos fathers choices dont seem to make sense once the film is over why didnt he just kill philippes father and be done with it instead a complicated plot to obscure the truth is concocted but one which ensures that everyone will be in physical jeopardy for years including the completely innocent photographer who gets murdered by philippes fathers thugs although alex is a doctor whom one would think is relatively bright he chooses to flee the police during which he not only endangers his own life but those whom he involves in a nasty pileup on the freeway why was margos friend so keen on keeping her promise to margo once all the crap hits the fan for alex and are we to think that margos father would rather kill himself rather than go to prison what about his wife did he consider her wishes those are some of the main problemsbr br then there are some nasty details like why was her father there the night of her faked death how did he get a hold of the junkies body on such short notice and get it back quickly in order to bury it with the other two alexs friend bruno seems overeager to be part of the mayhem in which he and his friends have to kill for alex notwithstanding the perceived debt he owes alex for saving his sons life what good would the photos of margo do they dont implicate philippe at all and why would margo have the safety deposit box key handy that night for her wouldbe abductors to take did i miss some other things probably minor irritations of mine include the fact that although alex is a doctor he smokes like a fiend which makes his marathon run away from the police even that more impressive also when he is riding in the convertible with his lawyer neither of them is wearing a seat belt how bright could they be
