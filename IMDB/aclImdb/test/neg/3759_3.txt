i completely understand the historical significance of rocketship xm but that doesnt make it a good movie to begin with the plot or what there is of it is dull and lifeless five astronauts blast off for the moon  they get knocked off course and end up on mars huh  cavemenlooking martians throw rocks at them  they return to earth and meet a fiery death  the end believe it or not but this pithy plot description makes it sound much more interesting than it really is to make matters worse john emerys character dr karl eckstrom feels it necessary to give long drawn out speeches on everything from the nature of man to the dangers of nuclear weapons its just a thrillaminute sarcasm intendedbr br looking back at rocketship xm almost 60 years later i would call the portrayal of women funny if it werent all so sad and misguided there are a number of examples i could cite but theres one exchange of dialogue just after takeoff between the male chauvinist pilot floyd played by the irritating plastichaired lloyd bridges and dr lisa van horn the only female crewmember and the constant object of floyds often creepy attention that illustrates the films attitudes toward women quite nicely br br  floyd ive been wondering how did a girl like you get mixed up in a thing like this in the first place br br  dr van horn i suppose you think that women should only cook and sew and bear children br br  floyd isnt that enough br br i think floyd should have stayed behind with the cavemen
