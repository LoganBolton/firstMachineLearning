to call rocketship xm a science fiction classic is due more to its release date 1950 its savvy ability to capitalize on the publicity for destination moon and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as sea hunts mike nelson rockfords dad and wyatt earpbr br the movie itself is bad enough to be good fodder for mst3k and is best viewed with commentary from joel and the robots this is the type of movie best suited to added riffing from the mst3k characters something preachy slowpaced poorly scripted and full of painfully bad acting while unintentionally funny stuff like plan 9 from outer space dont lend themselves to satirical commentary because the movie constantly upstages the hosts really bad and dull movies like rocketship xm are ideal so add some stars to the rating if you are watching the mst3k versionbr br the basic story has the crew taking an unplanned right turn at the moon and ending up on mars what they find on that planet are the remnants of a humanlike civilization devastated by an atomic war only one martian is shown in closeup a normal looking woman who is blind or at least has no pupils in her eyes the men look like the goons in the old popeye cartoons they scamper agilely around the cliffs and throw boulders at the crew with amazing accuracyespecially if they are supposed to be blind of course none of this is ever explained as doing so would require some sign of logical analysis from the writers of the screenplaybr br the scenes on mars are presented in something called sepia color to distinguish them from the rest of the bw movie if this has you thinking wizard of oz you will be disappointed because it is just black and white stuff with a slight brown tint added to the print in postproductionbr br in keeping with the moronic sexism of the movie the icy female scientist screws up her fuel calculationsboth coming and going her failure to measure up to the men causes her feminine side to surface and she and mike nelson coo sweetly to each other as they face their doom insert sound of gagging herebr br the real stars of the movie are the reporters at the command center so much so that mst3k was inspired to specially salute these unheralded heroes the intrepid squad of newsies are featured for the first 10 minutes of the movie then take stations about 12 inches behind the technicians and monitoring equipment in the command center later they are called upon to ask the moronic questions needed by the mission director to expound on the movies already too obvious messagebr br the dvd has an extremely low audio level is not captioned and is accompanied by a trailer although you will be thankful that it is only 77 minutes it is still about 60 minutes too long as any 30 minute episode of the twilight zone has several times more content than this entire moviebr br then again what do i know im only a child
