i bought rocketship xm on dvd in a twopack with destination moon now i see why the distributors did that no one who had ever seen this movie would buy it on its ownbr br i cannot fathom what school system turned out the reviewer who claimed that rxm is great in its predictions of how space travel would take place launch straight up and then do a 90degree right turn and circle faster and faster until you reach escape velocity i dont think i recall that from the apollo program never mind that the astronauts should be weightless once they shut off the engines gravity changes directions every time they pass through the hatch to the engine room going to the moon but missed it no problem its just a hopskipandajump with a helping hand from divine providence and youll be at mars and ok if you want to put life on mars given the state of planetary knowledge in 1950 it was a forgivable convention for the sake of the storytelling but can you make them look at least a little alien these martians looked like extras from the cast of 10000 bc i can accept some scientific mistakes but this wouldnt pass muster with an aboveaverage secondgraderbr br and thats aside from the screaming plot holes 12 minutes before launch as youre reminded of constantly by the nagging pa voice saying x minus so many minutes the astronauts are giving a press conference i guess the time crunch is why dr eckstrom didnt change out of his coat and tie before launching into space and how handy that even though they were planning to go to the moon and had pressure suits for that they brought hiking gear and rifles just in case they ended up at mars theyre lucky they landed anywhere since apparently the method they had developed for landing was to have dre look out the window and tell the pilot lloyd bridges to tweak down the throttles every now and then note to the designers of the xm2 how about giving the pilot a window seat br br ditto the previous comments on the casual sexism that had eyecandy dr lisa osa massen doom them all by repeatedly screwing up her fuel calculations but hey that was the early 50s she was there to fill her sweater not a useful functionbr br rocketship xm is notable for being one of the first of the first films to say ohmigod were all going to blow ourselves up with these here abombs but one can note that about it without wasting 77 minutes watching such dreck by the way that message might have had a bit more impact had there been some money in the budget for actual sets of the martian city ruins rather than just matte paintingsbr br i can appreciate good bad scifi for the unique way the future used to look and for the inherent if condescending humor you can find when when we look back on the naivety of audiences 60 years ago but this film must have been insulting even then rocketship xm isnt even suitable for an mst3kstyle lampooning sometimes bad is just badbr br anybody want to buy a dvd used only once i swear
