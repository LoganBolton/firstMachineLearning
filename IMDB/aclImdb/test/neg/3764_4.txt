wow this was a real stinker this early scifi flick has nothing going for it than pure camp theres so much scientific mambojumbo in the dialog its laughable the female character played by osa massen is just a plot device for the male characters to serve sexist remarks during the entire length of the film watch this one with your girlfriend i guarantee it will make her blood boilthe only good thing is the musical score which expertly build the moods of the film the specialeffects are rather crude but not bad considering the vintage of the movie with some good bstars in the lead rolesthe acting isnt too bad but the lines they are given must have given them quite a challenge the challenge of not laughing their heads off
