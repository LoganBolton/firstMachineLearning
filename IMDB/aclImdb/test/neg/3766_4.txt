i first saw this when it came out in the theater though only 13 at the time i was an avid reader of hard science science fiction stories the technical gaffes of the film are burned into my memorybr br some of the following may have significant spoilersbr br even as a youngster i knew the premise is silly the rocket takes off for a lunar mission in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew though loose objects float as in zero gravity and because of that the cabin the area with the controls whatever they called it was gyrostabalized to maintain the correct orientation so that when they landed why didnt they land standing on their heads and where at least in nearearth space the rocket engines had to be running continually  with propellant combusting away without an oxidizer when the engines quit the rocket stopped dead in space and couldnt start going until a phd chemist determined it needed at a little oxidizer this time the rocket recalled it had momentum and the next thing our heroes know theyre near mars even a 13yearold nerd knew such a minimumenergy trip would take over 200 daysbr br they land find the air was breathable though at the time scientific data revealed that the pressure even if the atmosphere were pure oxygen would be too low to do any good they decide to camp outside the ship and even build a campfire they come armed even though they were supposedly going to the moon where firearms wouldnt be neededbr br they get a sight of a collapsed civilization encounter stray martians who look just like people develop an anti nuclear war philosophy and those who survive try to get back to the home planet and die in the attempt by crashing on the earth to do that would require such a long orbital period theyd have died of starvation long before approaching their destinationbr br the film it preceded destination moon used real science most effectively even though their rescue with the oxygen tank forgot about the moment arm from the tanks center of gravity to the output nozzle this film showed woeful ignorance of even the most basic science only the most technologically illiterate should think of it as a science fiction film its on a par with the old flash gordon serials where their rocketships took off from their bellies and climbed in spirals and whose engines were always onbr br the story on this one i considered banal and i can recommend this only as a film to be shown to students for them to pick out technical gaffes
