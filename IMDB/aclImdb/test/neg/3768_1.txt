there is a phrase by the experimental filmmaker nathaniel dorsky who says some films are structured like a camera mounted on the head of a dog who goes down an alley sniffing everything along the waybr br thats how this movie is the structure is kurosawa started out as a baby then he became a kid then a young man then a movie director then he started making masterpieces then he grew old the end the word masterpiece is used a lot in this film to describe kurosawas output without explaining what makes his films so goodgreat just because the offscreen narrator reading a script says that a film is a masterpiece are we supposed to kiss his rearend and accept that a certain movie is one of the great works of art of the 20th century and one more point the voice of paul scofield is used as the voice of kurosawa when excerpts from the directors memoirs are being read off screen he brings pearshaped shakespearean tones to the textbut why him if you were making a documentary about billie holiday would you use dame judi densch as her voice
