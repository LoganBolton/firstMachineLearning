this is the greatest example i can think of to prove the theory that when hollywood runs out of good ideas they make an awful sequel and ruin the first one now dont get me wrong i absolutely love the first beastmaster i even liked the third one pretty good but this movie is atrocious i am a huge fantasysword  sorcery movie fan and i hated to see such a terrible sequel made to such a classic as the first beastmaster so why do i hate this movie so much well where do i begin first of all the whole idea of the movie is ridiculous dar and his evil older brother arklonwho was nowhere mentioned in the first moviehuh cross over into our world via a handy dimensional timeportal gate ya see earth just happens to be on the same parallel interdimentional plane as dars world whereas with the first movie youre led to think the movie just takes place in the past but with this one youre shown its a completely whole other world altogetherthats just one of the many things i hated about this sequel it didnt work with masters of the universe and it sure doesnt work here either movies like this should take place and stay in their own timeline and their usual surroundings for christs sake whats next hercules in new yorker uhbad example moving onbr br arklons after a device called a neutron detonator to use as a threat against his enemies to rule his own kingdom so its up to dar his ferretshis eagleand his tigernot a spraypainted one this time to go off and save the worldbut along the way they have the help of a young cool and hip senators daughter who gets caught up in this whole mess and she shows dar around la takes him for a joyride in her bmw and helps get him out of tight situations here and there how convenient right and speaking of convenient i found it awfully convenient and easy for arklon to sneak into a highly guarded military base and get away with a stolen highly destructive nuclear weaponeven with half the us army and lapd after himwaaaaay to easy even for an evil barbarian sorcerer from another world there are sooo many plot holes in this i dont know where to begin like why did arklon go to the la zoo for at the end of the movie he absolutely has no reason whatsoever to go there and wouldnt that be like the last place youd lure your greatest enemy who just so happens to have the handy ability to control animalsbr br and dont you just love these kinds of movies where the police are portrayed as total idiots and even with half a dozen cops firing at one guy they still dont manage to hit him the police in this movie belong in the police academy series they are about as useful in this movie as reading glasses are for the blind even the title of the movie makes no sense beastmaster 2  through the portal of timethey never actually went through a time portal because the movie isnt set in the future of dars world its set in a parallel world along ours in the astral plane so they never actually go through time only a dimensional world along theirs so no actual timetravel is involved at all this movie tries to come off as funny and it doesnot because of the humor but because its just so badand thats putting it mildly the acting dialogue plot characters and ending are all so cheesy its hilarious what more can i expect from the guy that brought us return of the swampthinganother bad sequel sorely missed here is don coscarellis wonderful directing and serious feel of the first one avoid this stinking piece of garbage like the bubonic plague and stick which the first one and maybe the third one if theres nothing better on tv
