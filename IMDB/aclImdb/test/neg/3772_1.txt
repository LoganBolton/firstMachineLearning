this movie is an incredibly selfindulgent character piece that assumes that the mere impression of a story is as good as an actual story it was utterly painful to watch and had i not been suckered in to buy the dvd because of john travolta and the positive buzz i would not have finished watching itbr br this film lacks anything resembling an interesting premise and seems to rely on weighty and frankly heavyhanded characterization there is one altercation scene between purslane and bobby long in which a tv is destroyed that when played out is incredibly flaccid and illtimedbr br i found myself caring less and less about the characters as i watched it it was probably very fun filmschoolwise to make it but it is just awfully boring to watch a indulgent and pretentious film school project you should not waste money on
