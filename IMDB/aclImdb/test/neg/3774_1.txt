i attended a screening of this film travolta came to do a q  a after the film ended it was a small screening room in tribeca out of courtesy to him i did not walk out which i wanted to do this is filmmaking at its worst to start the script was poorly written the writer writes in one voice the dialogue was stilted and clich√©d how this writerdirector got scarlet johansen john travolta and lions gate entertainment to back her on this is the only brilliant thing she accomplished in this fiascobr br i do in fact recommend this film to all aspiring screenwriters directors and filmmakers because when you are told that you are wasting your time and it will be impossible for you to reach your goals heyjust look at this crap and say to yourselfif they can make this then anythings poosiblebr br ps travolta did a great qa thoughhe was at ease spoke freely and was a down to earth nice guy the directorwriter stood on the sidelines when john tried to engage her in the conversation she stood back like a piece of wood and never joined in i looked at her and i thoughthow was this person able to successfully pitch to agents studio execs top talent when she cant open her mouth at a screening of her own film the conclusion from a few of us in attendance was that she must have strong family connections in the businessbr br after you watch this you should follow it with guy ritchies zero star masterpiece swept away with the most unintentionally funny and worst performance by wife madonna shes so bad and looks so bad in this film i figure this was her his way of getting back at her for all the abuse he takes from her at home
