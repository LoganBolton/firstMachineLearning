in the past 5 years i have rented some bad moviescompletely on purpose see i aspire to be a movie reviewer and as we all know there are horrible movies released every year anyway about 3 months ago i rented this one i watched it all the way throughand cried profusely this is one of those movies that is so freakin bad it makes you want to puke it actually put a sick feeling in my stomach ive seen lots of bad movies mystery science theater 3000 anyone but this one takes the cake the plot was hard to follow the lighting horrible and the sounds almost inaudible if there was a negative rating on the scale here this movie would be at 11 for me this may seem odd but i highly recommend it its something you have to see for yourselfbut dont say i didnt warn you i dont think this review could get any more precise so im done nowbr br
