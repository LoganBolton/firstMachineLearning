ive heard that this move was put together by a bunch of highschool students as a highschool art or theatre project its not too bad unless you lived near milpitas in the seventies or knew someone involved in the making of the movie this is pretty awful most of the actors are clearly not actors but locals who volunteered bob wilkins the original host of creature features on ktvu in oakland appears but only for about a minute some of the monster effects are done with stop motion animation and some with a man in a monster suit and each works okay on its own but there is no continuity between the two watching without dialog youd assume that the movie had 2 monsters i guess the most unsupportable aspect is that even the main characters who i assume are the kids behind the movie cannot even pretend to act these kids must have been involved in theater in some way to want to do this project but they display zero believable emotion in front of the camera
