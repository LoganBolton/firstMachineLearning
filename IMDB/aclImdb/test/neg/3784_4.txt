if corky st claire in waiting for guffman had directed the citizens of blaine in a horror movie with comic undertones the result would have been very much like the milpitas monsterbr br to be generous this was the longest hour and twenty minute movie ive ever seen to call the pace glacial is to be kindbr br almost nobody associated with this project ever made another movie with the exception of ben burtt who did the really admirable considering the budget special effects he went on to do sound for movies like munich and several other big budget projects the narration is by veteran voiceover actor paul frees who probably donated his effortsbr br when youre watching the opening titles and see the milpitas unified school district listed as one of the producers you know youre going on a long strange tripbr br pollution at the down dump in milpitas california becomes so toxic that it creates a monster remember that this is 1975 and ecology was a hot topic just a few years previously moviegoers had been treated to godzilla vs the smog monsterbr br so far so good the monster is a winged creature at least fifty feet tall and has the capacity to tear the town apart instead it steals garbage cansbr br central to the premise is the idea that this monster can prowl a small city and leave eight foot long footprints behind but not be noticed by anyone theres a nicely conceived scene where it walks through the middle of a carnival at night but somehow nobody noticesbr br the only person who sees the monster until the final scenes is george the town drunk all through the movie i hoped hoped hoped that george would be torn to shreds on camera but this didnt happen drat in fact nobody gets killed george supposedly sacrifices himself to save priscilla hes tied to a helicopter to lure the creature george smells worse than garbage and the monster is attracted to the scentbr br the nominal leads are a group of high school students theres pretty priscilla and her nondescript boyfriend and some bad boys who surprise surprise whip themselves into shape to help defeat the monster in the final scenesbr br the monster is involved in four main set pieces he attacks a browningferris garbage truck and leaves it beside an elevated highway but nobody notices he walks through the carnival again unnoticed he tears up a building nice miniature work and nobody sees him but george then he attacks the high school during a dance and grabs priscilla and carries her off just like a certain very tall ape has done several times most recently this past winterbr br there are plot ideas that come out of nowhere and are dropped local citizens picket at city hall because they want their garbage cans back an elaborate secret weapon for tracking monsters is flown in by private jet examined and forgottenbr br so why did i watch the whole thing because these people were having so darned much fun i had the idea that the firemen were firemen the businessmen were being filmed in their own offices priscilla may well live in that suburban tract house and scenes of people in their yards may well have been in their own yardsbr br they may not be great actors but they are real people nobody is stunningly good looking in fact id estimate that four out of five of the adults on screen wear glasses since this is the mid seventies we see some really bad clothes and some of the men have awesomely bad facial hair one dignitary being interviewed before a meeting at ciry hall has such a loud tie and sportcoat that you think hes on his way to play marcellus in the music manbr br and that got the movie two extra stars zero for the story two points for the sometimes decent special effects and two points for the fact that people in the community actually got together and did this they can actually say theyve performed in a movie despite lots of stage experience and working behind the scenes in live television i cant say that and im happy for thembr br remember those great old movies with mickey rooney and judy garland at some point somebody would say lets put on a show aunt edna has all those old clothes in the attic and we can use uncle neds barn then theyd do neighborhood shows with sets and costumes that would cost well into seven figures if duplicated todaybr br thats the spirit that the good people of milpitas had for this project and bless them for that
