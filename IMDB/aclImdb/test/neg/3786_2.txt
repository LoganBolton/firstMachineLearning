the most impressive thing about anemic cinema is its title an anagram which is very nearly also a palindrome unfortunately it only works in american english since in britain anaemic is spelt differentlybr br ive always found the dilettante man ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious and ive never understood why his work attracts so much attention apart from his rayographs which he invented by accident and which are merely directcontact photo prints his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn but surely this had to happen eventually and theres no real reason why ray deserves the credit the critical reaction to man ray reminds me of the story about the emperors new clothesbr br back in the early 1960s the second season of the twilight zone opened each episode with a shot of revolving concentric circles in black and white theres an image in anemic cinema which is so similar i wonder if twilight zone borrowed it from this film the main difference is that the revolving image here is a black and white spiral indeed if ever there was any movie that deserves to be described as a spiral this one is it throughout anemic cinema were treated to shots of a revolving disc containing words in french moving in a spiral the effect is vertiginous and the texts  about incest and eskimos  are nearly dada in their meaninglessness i did laugh at one clever sexual punbr br the emperor is naked folks and this movie just barely rates 2 points out of 10 au suivant
