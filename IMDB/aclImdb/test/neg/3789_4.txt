this opens with the company credits informing us its by world international network  i knew id seen this company credit before but couldnt remember where  but knew it was at the start of a really bad movie id seen so i seriously thought about changing channels  only thing was id seen every film on the other channels which is one of the problems of being an imdb reviewer  what the hell i thought it wont really matter if wanted is good or bad because ill still be able to review it for this sitebr br as i expected wanted wasnt all that good  its a plot id seen so many times  too many times  before involving a fugitive on the run  a bit like the incredible hulk tv series without the shirt ripping  jimmy crosses the mob in an entirely contrived way and goes on the run and in an entirely contrived manner finds himself working at a catholic reform school  have you noticed an oft used description in the last sentence   entirely contrived  is the answer  let me repeat for the hard of thinking that this is an entirely contrived film where everything relies on coincidence  another problem i had was the reform school run by the church  its far too compassionate and kind  im led to believe these type of establishments make alcatraz look like a country club  im saying this is a fact but when the head priest looks like the spitting image of donald rumsfeld you do feel theres a large amount of sugar coating going on br br to be honest despite the ridiculous plot twists etc wanted isnt really a bad thriller though its a terribly good one either  i never really had the urge to switch it off no matter how contrived it became which is an under hand compliment to the movie
