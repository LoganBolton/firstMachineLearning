this is a movie with an excellent concept for a story but that got sidetracked but a large number of clich√©d subplots hackneyed and unrealistic portrayed characterizations and performances and some frankly implausible and highly coincidental and not to mention convenient as plot points to move the story to its inexorable finishbr br the lack of anything that marked the lead as actually gay other than some coincidental references to crow bar or that hes gay was troubling it wouldnt have hurt to actually show him do something even if it was just meet a friend for drinksbr br its worth checking out and has its merits there isnt much even now a few years after the movie was released in the way of movies that feature both a lead that is gay or a significant gay plot line and that is also about africanamericans for that its worth checking out i wouldnt look too hard for it and i wouldnt waste my time looking for it to own this is a rental and not a premium rental at that
