i too had waited a long time to see this film as far as i know it has never been released in australia so in the end i found a copy on the net and ordered it through there weeks after my order confirmation it finally arrived and i was extremely excited to finally be sitting in front of my tv ready to watch a film that sounded so interesting and controversial and filmed in an area of the world where so many good movies are what a disappointment within the first few minutes i realised id ordered a b grader but was still full of expectation i convinced my son 18 to watch it with me as i love sharing when i find a movie of value with good underlying statements andor story lines about half way through he got up and said he couldnt stand watching it any longer it was so predictable and amateurish i agreed but watched to the end the acting was atrocious even for b grade standards the stereotyping also predictable and i feel for the good folks of lake arthur louisianna who mustve cringed after seeing the film depicting them in such a way no doubt some racial prejudices still exist in many parts of the world not just the states but really in this day and age i doubt theyd get away with all the ridiculous alibis presented in this i had to double check the date the film was made as their attempts at gimmicky filming of the more gruesome scenes was something id expect from a high school students first attempt at making a film indy like id like to see this film put into the hands of experienced scriptwriters and film makers its an old tale but one that could still pack a punch if dealt with professionally so disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations the soundtrack was probably the only thing i enjoyed
