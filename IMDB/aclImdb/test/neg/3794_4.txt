i went to see this 3 nights ago here in cork ireland it was the world premiere of it in the tiny cinema in the triskel arts centre as part of the cork film festivalbr br i found strange fruit to be an excellent movie it is a bit rough around the edges but for a lowbudget movie that is to be expected in general the acting particularly from the main lead kent faulcon is wonderful the cinematography and direction excellent and the script hugely entertaining and thoughtprovoking with some nice setups and witty dialoguebr br the ending was a bit sudden with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end  but perhaps thats what the filmmakers were going for it certainly did make the movie more unsettling i did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will as in reallife sometimes these things are never settled this was a good choice to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it upbr br taut and suspenseful throughout strange fruit is a hugely ambitious debut and i have high hopes for what the writerdirector kyle schickner will unleash next he  and his colleagues  are a talent worth watchingbr br i hope strange fruit gets a wider release soon as more people deserve to see this movie an aboveaverage thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in americas deep southbr br highly recommended 710
