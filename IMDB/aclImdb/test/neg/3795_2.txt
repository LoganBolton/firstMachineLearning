i was totally disgusted with this unnecessary sequel to the poseidon adventure a movie which i have given a great comment aboutbr br this film is unbelievable from the word go i agree why were no other rescues boats around and helicopters the one that rescued the original survivors had just flown over the boat that michael caine  sally field are on that was the only rescue crew hard to believebr br the acting is generally poor and the show looks cheap i really hated the waste of talent from some good actorsbr br dont watch this film unless you must catch sally  michael as loversbr br gord
