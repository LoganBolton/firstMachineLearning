the first 20 minutes were a little fun because i dont think ive seen a film this bad before acting script effects  etc the rest of the running time seemed to drag forever with every cliche in dialog used to no effect these people seemed to not really like horror movies or how to make them or any other movie theres no adult language a bit of brief nudity and no gore except fake blood smeared over no open wounds etc it would have been rated pg in the early eighties and pg13 nowadays im not sure how it got an r rating or if it really did i saw the american international release titled hospital of terror ive seen 100 horror films in the past 12 months and this is probably the worst film ive ever seen heres an example of how bad it is theres one scene where something green comes through the door im not sure what its supposed to be but what it is on screen is some kids green crayon scribblings im not exaggerating superimposed over the film semimoving inside the door then its supposed to do something to nurse sherri to possess her i suppose i could not believe they had the lack of pride to show this embarrassment
