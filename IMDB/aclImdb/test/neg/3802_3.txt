maybe here in sydney we are all poop side down and as a result we get to lap up floaters like this seekuel in classy theaters released here in 1980 this hilarious alltar drama was greeted with howls of delight at the session i attended in fact the audience were so into the ludicrous antics on screen it played like a rocky horror session within 5 minutes we all knew it was a real disaster the tug boat scene where you can see the buckets of water tossed in from offset after that it was every patron for himself and the cinema rang with advice cheering for bad acting and oowaah reactions the gunfight in the hold among the crates is especially idiotic and allows drunken viewers with friends in altered states also watching to contribute appropriately i call these films with michael caine his holiday house films as i always reckon he agrees to do them because he has seen a house he likes and doesnt want to spend his savings like jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it was called
