stodgy drama starring pat obrien as a washedup reporter who turns up at his exbosss house to ask for money to fund his sons operation only to find him dead on the floor since obrien knows the identity of the culprit he offers to take the rap in return for the money he needs a decent premise is wasted on a film that pretends it has surprises twists and turns even though it really doesnt performances are rotten across the board the movie dresses itself up as a hardboiled american noir but the mix of dodgy accents doesnt work and the story is hardly gripping and it contains possibly the least attractive screen kiss of all time
