this movie is one of the worse examples of hype people who read imdb comments might be tempted to view this total waste of time as i was by false taglines like  a throwback to 80s horror and whatnot this movie sucks from the acting to the directing to the story horrible all across the board and i really like good horror films i am not at all a snob this sucked for reference i loved the grudge 1 and 2 black sheep planet terror texas chaisaw massacre the beginning the others the ring jason x slither planet terror and really hated the ring 2 texas chainsaw massacreremakewolf creek the hills have eyesremakehostel 1 and 2 and this movie gore doesnt trump fun or originality
