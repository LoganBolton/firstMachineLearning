harry knowles has a quote right on the front cover of the dvd statingthe next icon of horror really i have heard a lot of hype surrounding this one but wasnt totally convinced however i am a die hard horror fan and will give just about any horror movie a chance no matter the budget or the rating cause ya never know where your gonna find the next gem not herenot hatchet hatchet is poorly conceivedpoorly acted and un funny just because you have the actors who played freddy jason and candyman and a buffy chic topless with tons of gore does not make you an expert on horrorsorry i dont even want to describe the plot because it is so idiotic honestly my money is on rob zombie there is a man who knows old school horror forget this trash
