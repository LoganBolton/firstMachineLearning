like the blair witch project before it hatchet has garnered its own fair share of publicity from the bottomonup as an avid reader of fangoria magazine the fullpage ads are hard to miss even after its middling theatrical run the film is bound to subsist solely on the hype surrounding it and will probably turn into a cult item at some point with a myspace url and a mighty if puzzlingly subjective promise of preserving socalled old school american horror hatchet will draw a lot of curiosity seekers with its dvd release where that claim is emblazoned on the disc itself perhaps it was the largeprint blurb from aint it cool news on the ads that caused me to approach the film with some trepidation it seems that harry knowles and his minions will approve of any film for vip passes and free food but hatchet makes me question what writerdirector adam greens idea of old school american horror really is based on the evidence here it means the insipid late80s ripoffs of friday the 13th and deliverance the characters are obnoxious stereotypes black chris tucker type survivalist chick topless bimbos requisite old couple asian tour guide whose interactions are marred by painful tryingtobehip dialogues and mostly obvious stabs at humor not quite as bad as cabin fever but still the script has too much padding the rustling bush scene for example and hatchet winds up as typical as any postmodern slasher of the last decade with its only distinguishing trait an expertlycalculated hype machine ill give it some faint praise for the goreif you can wade through the padding in between kills the red vino is definitely a thing of wonder and the only real reason to watch this
