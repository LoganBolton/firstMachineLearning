let me just give you guys some advice if your going to watch this movie just to see a bunch of unlikable characters get slaughtered in a dozen different ways then you are going to love this movie because everyone dies a horrible death beyond the gore however there is not much elsebr br where should i start the characters do not appeal to the audience as there are no back stories for any of them there for i didnt feel connected to any of them in fact i didnt like any of them and i was so sick of them that by the end of the movie i was rooting for the disfigured creep to kill them allwhich he did by the waybr br bad acting i mean i didnt get it take the asian tour guide for example first he spoke perfect english then after their little tour boat thing sunk he somehow got an accent out of the blue then later on went to speaking normal englishbr br one of the worst endings for a horrorif you can call it thatafter the monsterhuman mutant thing kills almost everyone he is killed by the last two remaining idiots or so they thought the monsterhuman thing is finally killed when the beauty and the geek stick a pole through its heartnickit was hard to telland presumably it died right in front of themwithin arms reach but later on it comes back and kills themwtf i mean why didnt it just kill them when he was right next to them arghhhh i mean it was just way too retardedit was like the writer didnt know where he wanted the story to goor he was a few minutes short of 80 min so he added some more retarded twists to the movie so people can get 80min worth of crap instead of 75minbr br what i didnt get was why didnt they just kill the damned thing while it was unconscious instead they just walked away from it like idiots and left it so it could come back and kill them the only reason i gave it a 4 was because of the gore which was actually the only thing that i watched this movie to the end for that and to watch them all get killedno im serious
