its important to check your expectations when you see hatchet the buzz that has been generated on this site far surpasses the real impact of the movie what may help someone about to see the movie is to realize that it is not supposed to be scary it is pure camp and an attempt at fun it is not funny just campy dont expect something like shaun of the dead nor something like friday the 13th part ii through infinitybr br hatchet does possess passable actors the cinematography is straight ed wood creature effects and makeup are silly  probably on purpose gore and blood is something between romero and dead alive hatchet is a movie of betweenness its between shaun of the dead and leslie vernon its between campy and comedy theres a difference its between ultra violent and violent comic bookbr br instead of capturing the essence of american horror or whatever other silly jargon that has been used to describe the movie it tries to capture something between seminal american horror like friday the 13th and new horror like shaun it thankfully stays away from torture horrorbr br in the end hatchet is between a bad movie and a decent moviebr br i think it is happening more and more that people involved in movies are flocking to sites like imdb to rate and comment on the movies that they are involved with at very least there is campaigning going on for people associated with the associates to leave positive feedback and ratings there is no other reason for this movie to have stared out in the high 7s with 600 votes and quickly fall after wide release this movie is on just better than the horrorfest releases and should not be so bloated
