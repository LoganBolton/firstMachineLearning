this is one of the worst films ive seen for years the storyline has potential that is never realized the actors are a poor choice but considering the screen writing their talent isnt wasted i really wanted everyone dead as quickly as possible so i could get out and watch something else unfortunately i did stay to the end and had a laugh at the murmurs of people moaning about how crappy this is there wasnt booing after all this is england just gentle moans about how crap that was then i look on imdb and see 288 people have given it 10 out of 10 i really just cannot see how those people are able to give that score they must be a pr company working with the distributor theres a hilarious set problem towards the end of the film when in the graveyard and the hick attacks look out for the dodgy scenery that rocks when touched supposed to be a brick wall  the blood effects are waaaay ott  the film feels like everyone is making a spoof horror except the director
