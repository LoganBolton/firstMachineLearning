i read the recent comments and couldnt wait to see the movie however after sitting through 80 minutes of predictable suprises that didnt even make me jump and unrealistic villain i was left hugely disappointed i thought cartoons were the only movies that were still only 80 minutes long i thought this might be because of the edits to make it r rated but the original only contained ten more minutes of kill bill type blood when blood sprays out like hoses reality loses appeal add in the killer whos supposed to be a ghost but can rip someones head off from the jaw ala king kong with the trex lives through everything and has an ending similar to that of the sopranos finale and you quite possibly have the most overhyped movie in the last year after watching the movie i felt like i had seen countless movies with the same plot and method and also felt largely unsatisfied i dunno what everyone else saw in it but if you want a good horror movie this weekend see halloween its definitely worth the 10 when it comes to hatchet lets hope the next one is based on the book
