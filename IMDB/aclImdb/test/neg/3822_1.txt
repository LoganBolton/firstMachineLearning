any horror film that casts robert englund freddie kruger then kills him in the opening 5 minutes before the opening credits have even run should be instantly viewed with nothing but suspicionbr br tony todd candyman as a swamp tour guide his james earl jones voice impression is hysterical by the way i dont know or care if he was trying to be funny but i was laughing at it sadly his role was all of 5 minutes long as well more reasons for suspicion and quite rightly sobr br mercedes mcnab aka harmony from buffy  angel i had to look her up to see what i remembered her from but she gets seminaked marcus the token black guy not another teen movie is filling a comedy role that really isnt required in a horror movie unless its intended as a spoofbr br joel murray bill murrays brother  pete from dharma  greg plays shapiro the guy shooting the gonzo video with the 2 cute girls as they take a spooky swap ghost tour the 2 lead male characters meet up with some other folks and get run aground on rocks and have to leave the boat so their now all isolated in the swamp at night in the rainbr br once the real story of victor crowley has been told his makeup looked like sloth from the goonies we have established he is dead well you arent coming back from being hit in the skull by an axe once the old guy is attacked despite pulling her gun and having a very clear shot it takes marybeth more than 30 seconds to actually start firing at a guy who is hacking an old man apart with a hatchet is she stupid thats 29 second too long in terms of plot there really isnt one i dont class undead psycho as a plot sorry and the pacing is really bad as well you have a killing some running away some light relief then some slow dialogue before beginning the cycle againbr br after an extremely long scene investigating a wobbly bush with a raccoon in it victor appears again with some sort of power tool and kills the dark haired porno girl he also manages to slice the tour guide in half with a shovel once misty is left on her own to keep lookout for ben i felt it was pretty obvious she was going to be the next to die i was right but you dont get to see itbr br film makers rain will not extinguish burning gasoline ok idiots obviously after the 2 near misses in the cemetery marcus was next to die and ben was hurt in the foot with the spike but they managed to find a boat after impaling victor on the spikebr br shes pulled into the water by something unseen hes trying to save her then shes suddenly pulled into the boat by victor and is screaming and the movie abruptly endsbr br yeah just like that no clue if ben was dead he seemed to be missing an arm and no clue if marybeth was going to survive and what happened with victorbr br its an awful ending and no doubt my verbal attack at the film makers got the last review deleted so much for free speech eh
