some of the reviewers of this film were extremely generous with praise i personally was disappointed because due to those reviews i was optimistic as the opening credits began to rollbr br the alltoo familiar story line goes like this deformed boy and his father live out in louisiana swamp local boys ridicule and torment him local boys start gruesomes oh sorry i mean victor crowleys cabin on fire with him in it dad attempts to rescue his son formerly known as eddie munster meets the elephant man but accidentally puts a hatchet through the kids head instead victor becomes a murderous ghost who hunts down unfortunates who enter his domain oooo scarybr br one thing i appreciated about hatchet was that it never took itself seriously and some of the gags even made me laugh the thing is ive grown tired of the hollywoodpolished bhorror slapsticks i like to laugh and i enjoy a good scare but this film didnt deliver a solid dose of either as for crowley being the next michael jason or freddy pumpkinhead has a better chance
