this film was the one of the first of the 70s womeninprison film genre this movie was incredibly violent with lots of sadistic torture being inflicted on the inmates the film takes place in the phillipines which looks like a horribly ugly country no doubt the producers used this factor to their advantage to emphasize the gruesome situation that the prisoners were inbr br blaxploitation movie queen pam grier has the starring role in this movie she plays blossom a renegade who gets thrown in the vile womens prison on trumpedup charges her boyfriend played by sid haig tries to rescue blossom he and blossom are part of a political guerrilla faction and blossoms incarceration was orchestrated by the corrupt phillipino governmentbr br pam grier and sid haig standout amongst the otherwise lackluster cast the film itself put way too much emphasis on violence perpetrated against the prisoners their captors just used them solely as objects of their sadism this got boring real fast this movie couldve used more interesting plotlines and subtlety this is not one of roger cormans better pictures the many womeninprison films that followed this one were much better all around id recommend the big bird cage only to pam grier fans
