i attended the premier last night the movie started out with a bang perhaps due to prepremier excitement the audience laughed for about 15 minutes then most of us spent the rest of the time fighting off sleep this movie can not be compared to spinal tap or any of guests work unless you want to say sons of provo is a wannabe gone awfully wrong it just fell flat it died it was painful the story went nowhere the jokes were bland even if you were a mormon and could get all of the inside jokes it felt like a waste of time there were two redeeming qualities kirbys acting was spot on and the songs were very clever for an lds audience only so my recommendations avoid the movie and if you are mormon buy the music cd
