this movie was very disappointing and except for a few moments wasnt fly at all more than anything it was just flippin stupid the music was frickin bad and the plot played out like a byu bowl game  very predictable avoiding embarrassment by scoring a late game flurry of touchdowns a rally that falls short and leads to a loss in essence the halfchildish  halfnaive will the movies fetcher and his religiously confused brother danny well just call him a democrat treat kirby the movies sweet spirit the 3rd member of their hapless mormon boy band like crap until the man and father figure of the film the stage manager jill has a talk with will and straightens him out believably wills personality changes 180 degrees and hes instantly the mature and selfaware leader of the band this would be a cute perhaps funny 10 minute roadshow gig but the fact that the movie is 93 minutes long really sucks the life out of you if you watch it to the end my advise  take the money youd normally spend to rent this show and either burn it in your fireplace or flush it down the toilet  more entertainment with much less time commitment if you want to watch a better movie of the same genre get saints and soldiers  not a comedy but an infinitely better show actually kirby has more funny stuff in saints than he does in sop
