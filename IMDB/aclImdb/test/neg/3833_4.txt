i just cant imagine any possible reasons why madsen and hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script they got blackmailed maybe or are they that badly out of money the main problem with the movie is that its boring the conversations between madsens and hoppers character are pointless just like the bored chatting between two buddies while drinking beer on a saturday night you never feel for any of the characters although madsens psycho killer is very likeable comparing to the other characters hopper always was a good actor and madsen does a fine job as the serial killer otherwise the acting is almost laughable there are about three scenes in the whole movie where something is actually happening each of them last about three minutes although the talking and thinking about murder and the nature of murderers scenes would have been interesting if they were scenes in a book the whole concept wouldve been interesting for a novel but a movie just cant bare with a story with that much inner thinking and so little action
