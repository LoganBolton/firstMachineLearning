the worst movie ive ever seen i still dont understand what dennis hopper and michael madsen intend to do in maybe they had bills to pay the best and cult part happens during a flashback which brings us during wwii when a nazi officer hide his jewish wife thats the beginning of a typical serial killer life it seems to be directed during the beginning of the 80s but then appears a new beattle amazing this movie was directed in 2001 im quite sure that it took less than two weeks to do that movie i heard that dennis hoppers wife asked for divorce after she saw that picture and michael madsens mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to be the man under the yellow baseball hat pathetic
