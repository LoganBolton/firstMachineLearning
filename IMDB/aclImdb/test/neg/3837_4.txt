hopper has never been worse as if he felt as this movie is worthy of only a grade b performance and he delivers a rather good one outside of madsen and hopper the acting is horrid youve seen better at your local high school the sound and at times the editing and camera shots are low end of bmovies the scene with the peeping tom is of movies greatest gratuitous nudity scenes ive ever seen it doesnt even come close to fitting in the movie the script was probably a great 10page outline but when it comes out to a fulllength movie there are more holes in it then the dead bodies madsen left behind i do have to say hopper dressed in a nice suit driving the hummer had me laughing out loud but i dont think that was the intent yes there is a little style and hopper can always draw my interest however the interesting plot concept never pays off and you are left wondering why you wasted your time watching this
