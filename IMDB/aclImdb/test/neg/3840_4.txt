like most everyone who views this movie i did it for the stars michael madsen and dennis hopper the two are extremely underrated and sadly because of that have to headline a lot of crap in this film hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a blackmailer and is offered help from the mysterious madsenbr br the film actually isnt as terrible as it could have been ive seen both in much worse both independently and working together lapd horrible film the direction was pretty poor and the script needed a few rewrites but both give the best performance possible with the material offered also the ending is pretty strong so you can tell the story had potential but when a glowing review of a film is it could have been much worse it doesnt say much for the film itselfbr br all in all this is one that can easily be skipped if neither of these actors draw you in but if youre a fan of either or both give it a watch they both give strong performances that outshine the obvious flaws of the film trust me there are much worse options out there
