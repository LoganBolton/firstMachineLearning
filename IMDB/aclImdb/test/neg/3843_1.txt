i actually joined this site simply to write in about this movie i was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels i made it about an hour through before i simply had enough curious to see what the general movieopinionated public thought of this movie i looked it up on this site i was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great i needed to have my say and here it is this movie is absolute garbage it was a chore to sit through the jokes were uninspired rehashes from other better shows and movies and leguizamos manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below that actually may be a stretch even for that age im all for slapstick ridiculousness but there isnt even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness i have an idea lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed now thats funny ha habr br movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality the marx brothers a night at the opera monty pythons the meaning of life south park bigger longer and uncutand the list goes on dont lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crapbr br by the way i can only assume that the reason that david bar katz the other writer did very little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted im actually impressed that leguizamo was able to recover after this mess
