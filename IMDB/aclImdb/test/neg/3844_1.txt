obviously the comments above that fawn over the movie were made by someone whos on the crew i dont recall ever seeing a movie thats more insulting to the talented actors or the audience watching in my 30 years of watching movies this is the only one i have ever walked out of bad humor bad jokes bad gags bad editing bad plot etc br br note to producer its never funny to hunt humans based on race great that you tried to be politically correct by incorporating all races but youre still hunting humans based on race and thats sickening
