dr lucio fulci lucio fulci is a director of gory horror movies who is starting to feel the effect of having filmed too many bloody scenes he visits his local psychiatrist to see if he is losing his marbles this proves to be a bad idea since the shrink is actually a crazy murderer responsible for a spate of grisly killings seizing the opportunity to make fulci his fall guy the loopy nut doctor hypnotises the horror hack into thinking that he is responsible for the recent series of murdersbr br on the surface cat in the brain appears to be a fantastically gory treat from spaghettisplatter god lucio fulci chock full of chainsaw dismemberment axe attacks and various other bloody killings the film certainly spills enough claret for even the most hardened gorehounds but when one looks closer it turns out that many of the gruesome scenes are lifted from earlier movies mostly fulcis own masterpieces remove these from the equation and one is left with a nifty basic plot idea that is totally wasted some welcome nudity and dreadful performances from fulci himself and david l thompson as the psycho shrinkbr br as the film progresses it develops into an incomprehensible mess with the borrowed gore footage inserted randomly with no attempt at working it convincingly into the story if youve seen fulcis touch of death and ghosts of sodom or mario bianchis the murder secret then youve already seen the best bits of cat in the brain beforebr br after much bloodletting the film wraps itself up rather quickly leaving the viewer feeling bewildered and somewhat cheated watch the film if youre a fulci completist but i would suggest seeking out the films from which the good bits were taken
