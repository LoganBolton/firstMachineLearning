only watched this to see joe morton in an early role and honestly wished i hadnt bothered he can and has since done much better than this crap cannot understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity funny but each to his own it is an absolute mess and not funny in the least no wait one line only was funny where mr kent joe and his family are having dinner with this nut job as hes been invited for dinner lord alone knows why pest to mr kent you know what its like dog youve been there mrs kent not lately joes expression was funny but thats it one line does not make a great comedy and this tat is so far away from being funny it should be consigned to the nearest trash cart its only good enough for that joe morton  glad to see you dont appear in rubbish like this anymore you are far superior and a great great actor
