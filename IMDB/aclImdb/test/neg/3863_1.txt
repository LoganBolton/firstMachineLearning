film noire is a genre that requires a certain level of tact cleverness intellect and imagery this movie has none of that though they really tried hard with the imagerybr br its the kind of movie that your cousin marky the dump truck driver whos always talking about how hes going to make it big in the movies someday would makebr br the dialogue is wooden and lifeless the visuals while obviously expensive to make are the work of a director who has tried to be clever and failed miserably due to a severe lack in cerebral ability the acting ranged from subpar to just plain bad the story might have been salvaged by a real writer and director but i suspect that such people would not have touched it with a barge polebr br about 14 of the way through i noticed striking similarities with the scene in sim0ne where viktor desperate to be rid of his actress makes the worlds worst movie i figured id check imdb to see if a similar effect has occurred in this movie and to my surprise it has id almost be tempted to give a 2 out of 10 just because its exposed the pretentious groupies but i wont its that bad
