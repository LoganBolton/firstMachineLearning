the seven collaborations between director joseph von sternberg and star marlene dietrich were so distinct in look and tone and so different from anything else going on at the time they almost seem to constitute a subgenre of their own like any genre they have their outright masterpieces as well as their absolute turkeys time to send blonde venus back to the farmbr br after the seedily seductive hits the blue angel morocco and shanghai express in which miss dietrich established her screen image as cabaretsingercumprostitute someone at paramount decided it was time for marlene to play a mother there is nothing wrong with that in itself as an actress she was up to the part its just that nothing else about the format has changed its like the blue angel plus a kid fair enough the story of a woman who drags her child along on her sleazy escapades is a sound premise for a tragic drama but thats not the way this is played dietrichs journey is played as some kind of adventure using her wits and accomplices to stay ahead of the law this is not some cheeky example of precode libertarianism  it is just bizarrely distastefulbr br although we may be able to accept marlene is a doting mommy there is absolutely no way we can buy sternberg as a director of warmth and poignancy in spite of this being one of the handful of pictures for which he also took a writing credit sternberg simply fails to get the storyarc the films emotional payoff is supposed to be the eventual reunion of the family but even at the beginning this is not established as something worth getting back to as usual sternbergs interiors are dressed and shot to look like either brothels or insane asylums the faradays home is actually quite a creepy dingy environment and its a wonder little johnny wasnt wetting the bed and asking to sleep with the light onbr br but as anyone familiar with them will know the point of a dietrichsternberg picture is to make dietrich look fabulous and in this respect at least blonde venus is a success marlene is introduced emerging from a forest pool in a bright shimmering closeup and even when she is reduced to rags the camera still loves her the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast whom sternberg tended to view as mobile pieces of scenery the normally likable herbert marshall is here reduced to a moody grouch lurking in the shadows even the suave and lively cary grant becomes just a boring background blob and does not seem nearly interesting enough for dietrich to run off withbr br the only standout moments in blonde venus are marlenes song and dance routines especially the renowned hot voodoo number where she parodies her own surreal stage persona by emerging from a gorilla outfit but even these feel like they have been cutandpasted from a different film sternbergs fans may hail it as another masterpiece as they are wont to do but for the average punter it is a massive disappointment audiences of the time did not lap it up as they had her earlier hits and this heralded the beginning of the end for marlenes heyday a year later there would be a new queen at paramount  mae west
