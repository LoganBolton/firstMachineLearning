you know  ive been in some towns where the girls werent all that pretty in fact ive been in some towns where theyre downright ugly but its the first time ive been in a town where there are no girls at all i am sure the fans of great classic remember this phrase that belongs to vin one of the truly magnificent seven from the first moviebr br now id want to rephrase him here you know  ive seen some movies where the plot isnt all that good in fact ive seen some movies where the plot is terrible but thats first time in my life that i saw the film where there isnt any plot at allbr br ok maybe my above statement is little bit over the top but honestly how one can call the plot a crap that is going on in this movie the bad guy oh dont ask me to give you his name because i dont remember and his not even somehow close to calvera whos name and character is unforgettable is trying to build the church in the name of his late sons that were killed in some battle and this bad guy is kidnapping poor villagers to force them to build the churchbr br first of all how big must be church to have to force hundreds of villagers to build it is it some egyptian pyramid or something but ok lets stop here about the plot and absolutely forgettable character of a bad guy and lets say few words about the seven itselfbr br yul brynners good old chris always calm always silent talking less but talking wise is gone unfortunately oh no hes as calm as he was but now hes calmness are so fake that you just dont buy it imagine he meets a good old friend chico who he must rescue after so many years and there is just a few hi hello and not even handshake as far as i remember honestly it looks more like meeting of two strangers in some internet chat rather then meeting of chris and chico that makes new chris more look like robocop or terminator rather then our beloved wise quickgunbr br i wont stop here talking about other characters there simply arent any imagine if strong actor like yul brynner is so much fake forgettable then what will be other characters look likebr br there still are some attempts to give us a background story for each one of them for example one is women favorite guy second is a man with dark past whos wife was raped and killed by indians and he since then is killing everyone and everything that is moving but non of these characters are making any sense or non of them can take your heartbr br i remember i was a little child and when oreilly charles bronsons character died in the first movie i was crying here i just didnt care about each one of them even if whole of them with all the crew of the film would die it seems i wouldnt care morebr br so please go and see this movie i recommend it because you wont have the other chance to see something worse then it
