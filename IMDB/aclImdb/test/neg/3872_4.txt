b kennedy tried to make a sequel by exaggerating and amplifyinga gargantuan leftist western not as leftist as the g kennedy sequel that came after this onebr br this is the ugliest film of the two sequelsvery ugly looking it is slapdash b kennedy made it amplifyingbut without having the genius for that hundreds of peons hundreds of mexican compadres hundreds of women a desert barren landscapes a stormthe largest scalebr br everything in this clumsy sequel likable only in a weird way is phonybr br the movie itself is very ugly looking brynner who made the best part in the first film doesnt look good at all in this onebr br rey plays a priest he will be a political leader quintero in the next sequel of the franchise br br it is true that when you have that many characters you may not need a very interesting storyline sometimes eg brynner meets mcqueen then they pick other compadres or b spencer meets coburn etc its fun to see where and how theyll meet the rest of the crew etc but you need at least these several characters unfortunately burt kennedys installment is not very good at that br br return of the seven 1966 begins with a bullfighting vin and chris meet there they decide to rescue the third survivor of the original magnificentschico who belongs to a huge group of 300 peons abducted by the mexican bandits we find out the name of chicos appealing wifeits petra chris must constitute again a small armyand here we have a dirty dozen treatchris chooses his men from the convicts another member of the commando is a womanizer who will take good care of the wives left without husbands the sexual humor is especially displeasing and distasteful in this film it strives to seem smart and spicy it is simply boorish and dumb and grossbr br the choosing of the members of the small army was one of the greatest joys in the mcqueen film unfortunately in the first sequel there is the most unmemorable of the three crews assembled under the magnificent sevens namebr br robert fuller makes a lousy vinoates is the smiley womanizerbr br in this mockgargantuan attempt a mexican revolutionary leader has a gargantuan planhe kidnaps 300 peons and uses them to build a village and a church in the memory of his lost sons useless to say that this insane mexican revolutionist doesnt equal wallachs part in the first film b kennedy bets exclusively on camp and overthetop stuff ugly landscapes a thunderstorm gargantuan lightning a desert a huge battle between the emancipated peons and the revolutionary vaqueros of course return of the seven 1966 completely abandoned the good sense of the mcqueen filmbr br what is particularly shocking is that this sequel came quite quickly after the original filmyet everything changed meantime in the way of making westernsbr br both the sequels look weird
