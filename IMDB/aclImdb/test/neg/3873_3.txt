the original title always struck me as a rather overblown definition for a bunch of guntoting saddletramps still their screen presence was at least underscored by a topquality group of actors to support yul brynner most were movie stars in their own rightbr br however this first sequel was a pale imitation with a group now composed of largely b and c list players who were more mediocre than magnificent it was a similar setup brynners chris had to recruit yet another team of guntoting saddletramps to sort out the mexican peasants problems again another tyrant was giving them griefbr br with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer the budget was evidently very limited this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic it was also more than half an hour shorter than john sturges original yet we still had a reprise of the agonising and moralising that made even the first a little turgid at times however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up filmiing was less expansive it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the originalbr br generally it just lacked imagination the first movie had been a smashhit and this pedestrian sequel was evidently put together as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to cynically cashin on former success and it shows theres very much a made for tv feel about itbr br not recommended
