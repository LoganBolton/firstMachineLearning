this movie had potential the script was not bad and it presented an interesting dark atmosphere with themes of suicide patricide regrets andas chris says10 years of going nowhere its a sharp contrast to the original mag7 which was bright humorous and even the bad guy was lovablebr br its a very interesting change of tone and if they had developed the characters more maybe i wouldve liked itbr br but instead they waste far too much time on gratuitous and ridiculous battle scenes poorly edited together at one point you see a horse fall and 5 seconds later you see the same scene again but not many people would notice that since there are already 2 dozen horse trips im not exaggerating and by then weve already dozed offbr br which leads me to the title of my review this film was extensively cut due to animal cruelty so chances are if you decide to watch it youll get the watered down kiddie version theres a bullfight where the matador stabs the bull and suddenly as the crowd erupts cheering theres no bull just the matador in an empty arena like wow maybe the bull was a jedi i dunno more likely the scene was cutbr br later theres a cockfight scene where in the original version one of the birds gets horribly mauled before a crowd of cheering mexicans this was cut but we still see enough to get pretty annoyedbr br but by far the worst scenes are the horse throws one after the other you see horses legs get yanked sending thousands of pounds of horse onto its head in one scene a horse gets thrown and then while its squirming on the ground in paralytic convulsions an explosive goes off right under its neckbr br this film was made in 1966 when hollywood was just starting to regulate animal brutality on film this is probably one of the last flicks where you can see it happen so if that sort of stuff it floats yer boat check it out  youll get a mild thrill but if not youll either be irritated or flat out bored
