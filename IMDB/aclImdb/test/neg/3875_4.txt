return of the seven has a few good action scenes and elmer bernsteins score is as rousing as ever nevertheless its a boring film because it simply fails to involve us emotionally mcqueens absence makes a really bad impression and the fact that his character here is played by a different littleknown actor is odd  in a bad way the characters are not developed so we dont connect with them  and we hardly care when some of them die this sequel is a passable but poor imitation of the original
