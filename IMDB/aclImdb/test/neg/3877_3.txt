i dont mind sequels sometimes theyre better than the original however many times the originals are best left aloneespecially when you cant duplicate the cast one of the big reasons the magnificent seven was such a hit was the very popular castbr br this is hardly the magnificent seven when only yul brynner returns as one of the members of that famous group in the magnificent seven with six of the seven guys absent and replaced by much lesserknown actors this loses its appeal in a hurry in other words except for brynner these guys have no charisma this is a like a championship sports team fielding all substitutes except onebr br brynner is good once again fun to watch fun to hear with that distinctive deep voice of his but the story not just the rest of the crew is lame this movie should never have been made in the original we cared about the seven in here we couldnt care less
