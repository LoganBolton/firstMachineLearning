if youre a sane person and you have seen films before then you cannot tolerate this piece of idiocity for more than 20 minutes and if you do stay there longer then it wont be because youd expect akshay or paresh not govinda please but because you value your money too much and you want at least a short nap on the plush seating in the multiplex in return of the money they robbed you off its hard to believe that the director who gave us a cult film like herapheri can fall to such levels alright hes repetitive but now hes coming out of all third rate storied and expects us to laugh because hes brought in paresh rawal and akshay kumarno sir this aint going to work now especially with this stupid script of yourseven comedy films can have meaningful scripts lage raho munnabhai anyonebr br govinda doesnt have much to do so cant commentakshay kumar was boring paresh rawal cracked some of the worst joke possiblelara dutta had real scope for acting in this one but she fails miserablythe only high point of the film possibly is tanushrees actingbut shes there only for the first 10 minutesbr br i dont think this film is worth any more space probably not even this much so final warning dont watch it
