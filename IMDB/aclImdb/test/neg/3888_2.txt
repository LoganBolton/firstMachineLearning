i was shocked to read all these wonderful comments about this movie because i hated it i stuck it out to the end but it was painful especially having to listen to that voice of the child as socact1 remarked even though the girl claimed to be from chicago she didnt have a chicago accent it sounded more like she was trying to imitate a ny accentbut failed at that as well i was so confused that i was waiting for the punchline of all the wonderful actors who could have played that child why did they select this one and why force her to talk like that it wasnt even just the accent it was the script the monologue created for her the reason i even selected this movie was that the plot idea appealed to me this era in history the type of characters that are poor and uneducated the setting and the love triangle as far as im concerned it could have and should have been much better i was just soooo relieved to read that at least one other person felt the same way that i did about this movie
