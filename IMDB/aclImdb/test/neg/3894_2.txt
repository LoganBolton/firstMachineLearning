i have seen this movie twice once a few years ago in college and again this past weekend although i absolutely despised it the first time i decided to give it another chance terrence malick is clearly a wellrespected director and it seems that the imdb viewers at least think very highly of the film but unfortunately it seems my tastes havent changed at allbr br where to start for one thing linda manzs narration is horrific her voice is so irritating with that horrendous new york accent please dont try and convince me that chicagoans talk that way  they dont she herself admitted to just sitting down and talking about random things which does not make her a talented actress shes not even acting i came on imdb expecting to see her ripped apart since her performance is just so utterly laughable but people actually seemed to like it shes simply unappealing in every way  i kept hoping malick would just kill her offbr br the other actors were fine but certainly nothing special adams was probably the strongest in the cast but she also had the only decent part except the old guy  he was pretty goodbr br speaking of acting how could shepards character be so ridiculously stupid he bought the brother and sister act becauseuh why would he buy that bill and abby took every single opportunity to be touchyfeely as though they didnt realize that their lives depended on acting in a very platonic way it was just completely unbelievable and finally after a considerable amount of time the farmer suddenly realizes that oh my god theyre together then he goes after bill with a gun but instead seems to trip into bills hand and ends up with a mortal stab woundbr br speaking of which the fate of the characters was similarly stupid and dare i say lazy of course bill has to die  could it be more boring than getting shot in a pond by a pack of cops abby goes on with her happy life getting on a train and feeling really content about the way things worked out and the irksome narrator randomly finds her deadbeat friend and they wander off into the sunset but its okay because malick never gave me any reason to care about the characters anywaybr br as for the plot this film drags along endlessly with no real plot twists or development i cant believe its only 94 minutes long  i could have sworn i was sitting in my seat for a solid 3 hours the sudden locust disaster was like throwing the bible in my face im totally fine with metaphors and allusions but this was completely over the top clearly the message was dont marry for money or bad things will happen to you very originalbr br i understand that days of heaven like all of terrence malicks films is meant to be a piece of art and i will certainly agree that the cinematography is simply stunning and the magic hour shots add a unique aura to the film but i need more than nice pictures to enjoy a film and this one just didnt do it for me
