i will admit i didnt pay full attention to everything going on in this film but to be honest i dont think it would have mattered basically local councillor sidney fiddler sid james persuades the incompetent mayor frederick bumble kenneth connor of firecombe to hold a beauty contest to improve the towns image they face opposition from womens liberationist augusta prodworthy june whitfield trying to sabotage the contest but they do have publicity agent peter potter bernard bresslaw and palace hotel owner connie philpotts joan sims soon enough the young beautiful wannabe models show up including hope springs barbara windsor paula perkins valerie leon dawn brakes goldfingers margaret nolan debra sally geeson and ida downs eastenders wendy richard when the girls have cat fights it does draw away regular residents but after quite a while of some plodding not that funny innuendos and william jack douglas having overactive twitches it does finally reach the competition and its just afterwards i couldnt be bothered also starring patsy rowlands as mildred bumble peter butterworth as admiral joan hickson as mrs dukes david lodge as police inspector angela grant as miss bangor arnold ridley as councillor pratt robin askwith as larry patricia franklin as rosemary jimmy logan as cecil gaybody and dads armys bill pertwee as fire brigade chief charles hawtrey had obviously quit the carry ons but wheres kenneth williams i suppose seeing babs and young beautiful looking pauline fowler in bikinis but for comedy value this fails miserably and the overuse of the swanny whistle just gets on your nerves pretty poor
