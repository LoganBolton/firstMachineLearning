i only came here to check terror hospital for an alternate title so id know what not to pick up not only do i get the original title but i come to find terror hospital is one of seven more aliasesthis one is a real clunker movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reasons mostly unintended consequences of the feature on every level of production that result in at least a mild form of entertainment mostly amusement this has none of that instead the viewer is witness to redundantly unnecessary and waytooconvenientforthesituation exposition and drawn out scenes of characters warily moving from room to room and all this is half of the film forget trying to figure out where anybody is or who they are during darkened or nighttime scenes too you probably wont care anyway there is also a random car chase sequence that seems quite dull when compared to some of the old drivers ed movies i slep er i mean sat through and watched way back in high school really were talking about mysticism possession and a killer on the loose here  not a bad recipe for trash cinema unfortunately theres nothing here to make it even good trash when joined to the aforementioned the bad acting and notsospecial effects are just that  bad acting and notsospecial effects this ones just trash pure and simple leave it on the rack at the pawn shop or in that box at the yard sale theres a reason its there
