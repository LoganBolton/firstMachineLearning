when i started watching this i instantly noticed that i couldnt understand what anyone was saying i turned up the volume with background noises now booming out i could hear the voices just what are the actors saying is the movie not dubbed are they speaking spanish after some confusion i realize that it was english at least i think so the amazing jess franco has placed the microphones too far away from the actors as a result we cannot completely hear what they are saying hes done this before but maybe this is mr francos intention by not knowing what people are saying we are thrown into some mystery about what is going on and are left with more visual clues maybe its just me but i would have liked to know what was going on how about a few hints the basic premise i refuse to call it a plot concerns a young american exotic dancer named paula played by amber newman who has a boyfriend who gets her invited to a small island owned by some sleazy rich people it is somewhere off the coast of spain for this visit a large cash payment is promised to paula which the boyfriend gets he then escapes from the island only to return later why pay close attention to the scene where the boyfriend opens paulas us passport though his hand tried to cover it up you can see the actress real name amber newman printed below the photo on the bottom of the passport anyway back to the story there are some other sleazy rich beautiful characters visiting the island all with ambiguous motives we witness sadistic games are they real or fake and unappealing dining scenes but the food must be good as a phony french chef prepared it there is a young woman servant who runs around naked and never speaks is she really mute and do we care of course all the women are mostly naked throughout this film oh well we can at least be thankful that the 50 and overweight men remain clothed in addition to the abysmal sound quality what i have always marveled at about jess franco is his amazing ability to film beautiful naked women in such a way that leaves the viewer completely turned off this film is no exception Â– i needed fresh air after watching it br br in conclusion i am happy to report that regardless of what mr franco can dream up i am still attracted to women
