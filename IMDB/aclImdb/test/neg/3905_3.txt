hypothetical situations abound onetime director harry ralston gives us the ultimate postapocalyptic glimpse with the world dead left in the streets in the stores and throughout the landscape sans in the middle of a forgotten desert one lone survivor attempting to rekindle his sanity takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert all alone he hopes for more but with nobody around he is left with white underwear and a passion for a local indian tribe  until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human coexistence alan a man of the book is left on earth after an unknown disaster thinking he is alone he begins living life his way  until jeri ryan appears like she would in any dream out of the woods disheveled and unhappy to find the final man alive to be  well  like alan anyway they try to coexist fail get drunk and before creating the ultimate dystopia they run into redneck raphael played by newcomer  dan montgomery jr bonds are torn confusion sets in a couple becomes a third wheel and the battle between physically inept nerd vs brainless jock even with nobody left on the planet it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arisebr br using a variable film technique ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled the quiet earth which i will be viewing next oddly which he never gives any credit towards with a borrowed story i guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it his punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while ralston tries to find his stride borrowing yet again from other film directors techniques to attempt to find his own he opens the film interestingly enough but fails to answer any direct answers sure the final days have arrived but could there be a concise answer as to how or better yet why these select few survived a spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film the juxtaposition would have been like shawn of the dead but instead left us feeling like we were watching a madefortv program listening to the audio commentary i have respect for ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made and his passion nearly sells the film but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasnt as happy with his overall final product there were mistakes ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out while this does make for decent independent filmmaking it sometimes feels cheap and in ralstons case it was the latterbr br i must admit david arnotts portrayal of alan hooked me he played that wimpy school nerd adult role very well he was funny to both watch and listen to and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer he was a key player in keeping the film together alas i cannot say the same for the rest this was dan montgomerys first film and it was obvious  i mean  really really obvious there were scenes in which i thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance but alas it wasnt the case then there was jeri ryan she pulled into her character near the end of the film which to me was the culmination of the entire piece of art she goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end confused again she fell into her character by the end giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured even as the commentary progressed all that she contributed was a laugh giggle or ohhh look at that color moment while her beauty may sell tickets one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful this was her first film so can i be too harsh br br overall this film felt like it was missing something i though the idea was strong  the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the earth the evil of human nature still exists jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs maybe because it is consumed by zinc and we as a race will always want what we cannot have ralston is not a surprising director his techniques are flawed and preused but he does know how to make a lowbudget comedy i think our idea of funny is different so that is why i couldnt find myself laughing at many of the bits he found hysterical his actors provided the level of acting needed for this film which was lower than average his film was loose meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled ie anything with wings survived which overall harmed the intensity of the film this was a comedy but it could have been much darker and much much funnier for those thinking that roger avery was a huge element to this film as we learn from their commentary all he was there for was money  the was in essence the bank for the last man dont get your hopes up for any classic avery momentsbr br dont expect more from ralston  and that is how i will end itbr br grade  out of
