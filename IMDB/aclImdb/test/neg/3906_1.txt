i saw this movie in part because of some positive comments here on imdb after wishing i had those 90 minutes of my life back i feel its my duty to get on here myself and sayplease dont bother watching this moviebr br i cant argue with the actors efforts  they did what they could given the material but that material is dreadful the pace was deadly  slow meandering and you saw everything coming about an hour away and then it took forever to happen the dialogue was boring pointless not funny at all the characters were all completely unsympathetic and the cinematography was in my opinion very low quality  the cliché of character uses home video machine was used to very bad effectbr br yes jeri ryan is a cool person dont let that sucker you into wasting your time on this film
