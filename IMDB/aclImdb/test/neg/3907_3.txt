how do stories this bad get made thats not a question it is a statementbr br here are my problems with the filmbr br 1 much of the story development was predictable and boring my emotions ran pretty much in a flat line throughout there wasnt really much to draw the viewer into the filmbr br 2 the characters were decidedly uncharismatic one was a loon another was confusing and the third was pretty damned boring there was absolutely zero reason to be drawn to these people even though i knew it wouldnt happen i kept hoping that they would run into someone else someone more interestingbr br 3 the physical environment was uncomfortable for me a trailer in the desert the desert is a place that most people would prefer not to visit how is it that these three people end up in the desertbr br 4 and in the same desert did the writer really expect me to believe that the last three people on earth would manage to find each other within the span of a few weeks out in that desertbr br 5 was it really necessary for ms ryan to be in two scenes that required a swimsuit hey she looks great but it was pretty gratuitousbr br okay so if i thought it was so bad why did i give it a 3 i am trying to be as objective as possible even though i found alan annoying i have to say that david arnott did a very credible job of portraying a neurotic nerd the character reminded me of a few of albert brooks more annoying roles jeri ryan tried to do something with sarah but it just wasnt written very well okay so she was supposed to be a confused dysfunctional woman but why what did it add to the story her mood swings left me feeling like i was being jerked hard one way and then another and then anotherbr br i dont often walk out on films but this one had me contemplating it several times stiff predictable boring proceed at your own riskbr br my 2 cents
