the best scene of the people across the lake is the genuinely creepy nightly openingscene featuring a house a murder  a lake after that its pretty much downhill from there on as far as the horror is concerned a family mom dad sister  younger brother is fed up with the mildly dangerous environment of suburbia and decides to go and live near the titular lake from then on the film features too much lame happy familyrelated doodoo near the lake with occasionally some corpses popping up here and there the couple of scenes where they discover the bodies are pretty convincing in terms of creepiness but they are in shrill contrast with the rest of the goingson featuring just everydaylife stuff of the family settling in the truth to the matters the mystery as to whos doing the killing is learned too soon leaving only the family unknowing and the viewer yawning during the unexciting finale featuring a discovery in a basement and running around the house like if this madefortv thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror film its not really badly made the content  story is just not interesting enough the only highlight in the cast is barry corbin though his performancecharacter is just a bit too goofy to be taken serious blond cutie tammy lauren the daughter might be a recognisable face for avid horror junkies too as she also starred in wishmaster 1997 and madefortv outings like i saw what you did 1988  the stepford children 1987 she hasnt got much to do in this film though skippable but watchable if anything
