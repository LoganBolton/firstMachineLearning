oh dear ohdearohdearohdearbr br i love science fiction but this er movie just puts space flicks to shame every sci fi film ive seen over the last year has been disappointing to some degree and im now seriously reconsidering what genre of movies i actually like in future maybe ill watch romance flicks from now on br br spoilers alert and thats not saying muchbr br this flick is so insipidly dumb it rivals battlefield earth and baby geniuses in sheer badness the special effects are obviously fake the big mac truck looked stoopid with its roller coaster seat restraints the killer robots looked like a more idiotic version of the power rangers a huge fat guy is sucked out of a port hole window butt first and space truck school wtfbr br mr hopper can do better than this what really stunk were the two goodlooking young things who accompany him and run around in nothing but their underpants  for an entire two thirds of the flick the obligatory sex scene snicker between our young heroes was so poorly performed i nearly choked on my tonsils laughing at the tv screenbr br the only character worth mentioning is the pirate ship captaincyborgmad scientist he oozed the word grotesque and was predictably sleazy but i believe he couldve been much more menacing he does and says things which are quite funny all the best scenes involve him so for the captain i give this movie an extra pointbr br but this flick is so bad itll make you want to hurl abuse at the tv or maybe throw your tv out the window it may even kill off a few brain cells and put you into a catatonic statebr br conclusion i like the way the captain struggles to walk around on his peg leg when its obviously a fake peg leg i wouldve given it 0 out of 10 but since he cracks me up with his stoopid antics this flick gets 110
