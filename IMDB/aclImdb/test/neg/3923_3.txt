it is said that there are some people out there who actually admire monograms movies well  and why not monogram studios lived on a kind of cost plus basis cost plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust muscatel every once in a while sure theyre cheap but lets face it theyre coarse fast philistine vulgar but exhilarating they have no pretensions at all theyre designed to divert the audience for an hour or so at the bottom of a double bill so what if john wayne gallops through the wild west along a road lined with telephone poles this isnt art its entertainmentbr br take this movie flight to mars at the beginning when were first meeting the characters a man might introduce his female companion abruptly avoiding any tedious subtlety professor this is my fiancée and assistant who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman she loves me but is growing impatient with me because im always wrapped up in my scientific work perhaps you could steal her from me marry her give her the babies and the picketfenced home she yearns for if necessary i will die on this journey to see her dreams realized also she likes it a little rough it saves a lot of writing and shooting time doesnt it thats what people mean when they say a narrative is fast this one was shot in five days why should we have to hint about these things i mean what the hell is this a cheap sci fi movie or henry james actually this is a particularly wellfunded example of a monogram movie its in color for one thing cinecolor to be exact you can tell its not any other color youd recognize and look at the cast the female lead is dismissible as is usual with monogram but the male leads are definitely up there on the b list cameron mitchell as the reporter yet to hit his stride as a male lead which come to think of it he never really did and arthur franz as the pipesmoking head scientist the pride of perth amboy new jersey and  for science fiction fans  how about this pair of aces both morris ankrum and john litel theres not really much point in describing the plot in detail the five crew members crash land on mars where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution was isomorphic with ours right down to their having five digits and willowy babes in short skirts and they picked up english from listening to our broadcasts american broadcasts that is judging from their speech theyre led by a sinister cabal who try to hijack the space ship build many imitations of it and colonize earth they do not succeedbr br the special effects arent very special the men walk around a couple of spare sets wearing black costumes with stylized lightning bolts emblazoned on their chests and scarlet capes billowing behind them their names consist exclusively of english phonemes  alzar terris ikron the lissome martian who falls for arthur franz is named alita with an indoeuropean diminutive appendage and she already knows what kissing isbr br overall i found it as snappy as it was intended to be but dull too the story is that of any buck rogers 1930s serial once the earthlings and the martians meet and its established that they have a common language and that the martians have a sinister agenda thats it in two hours even an indifferent screenwriter could turn this into a story of nazi spies in world war ii the plot is done by the numbers the dialog has no sparkle the acting is pedestrianbr br however dedicated aficionados of monogram productions should enjoy it after all jeanluc goddard the contrarian french egghead dedicated a bout de soufflé to monogram so they cant have been all that bad
