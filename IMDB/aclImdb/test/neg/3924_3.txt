theres nothing particularly unique or interesting about this run of the mill low budget scifi flick regardless of its pedigreed origin the film is loosely based on a novel by leo tolstoy the plot and overall themes of this film are in no way remarkable or original the science is weak at best and unfortunately the film fails to even involve compelling action sequencesbr br the plot begins with a manned space flight to mars and though the main plot doesnt really get rolling until the ship lands most of the most interesting scenes occur en route unfortunately as soon as our interplanetary travelers touchdown their previously interesting interpersonal relationships speculations about cosmology and the meaning of life and everything interesting about the film all give way to an only remotely coherent plot concerning martian revolutionaries environmental problems and not very convincing webs of deceitbr br there is nothing very remarkable about the production quality of the film either its passable and most of the acting is though slow ok cameron mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a likable character i guess the best quality of this film from my perspective is its fashion sense the martians have very nice outfits if this film had a point it might have been much more interesting oh well
