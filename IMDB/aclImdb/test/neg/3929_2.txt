yes pigeon and coburn are great and its interesting to watch them although coburn seems rather restrained and dull here its enjoyable to view seattle victoria and salt lake city of 1970s and the period cars and clothing thats all the good in this boring film the dialog is incredibly bad as is most of the acting ray and sandys motivations seem forced and unlikely ive seen this training to be a pickpocket routine several times before theres a long build up leading to nothing better to catch an episode of streets of san francisco or one of the many great crimecaper movies to name a few there are bedtime story remade as dirty rotten scoundrels the lavender hill mob the grifters paper moon the sting and best of all house of games
