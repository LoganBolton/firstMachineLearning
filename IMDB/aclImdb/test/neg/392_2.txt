now i loved lethal weapon and kiss kiss bang bang but i cannot believe shane black wrote this pileor that david morse and john c mcginley are in it i screened it for a film festival awful everyone was laughing its preachy and heavy handednot to mention stupid also its surprising how little la looks like cambodia the entire idea of time traveling through posttraumatic stress disorder is kinda dumb imagine born on the fourth of july mixed with the butterfly effect 2 i used to sequel as the example to really show how bad this movie is but directed by michael bays 2nd unit director that bad the 2 stars are purely based on the production value
