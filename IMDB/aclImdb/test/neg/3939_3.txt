seriously if you want to see a clich√© horror movie you have to see this one i guess it contains all the  scary parts where nothing happens   the nerd type who actually isnt killed  boy and girl coming together and surviving facing an old childfear etc i can go on i wanted to see this movie cause i tought the mix of a video game and a movie would work out guess i was wrong which makes the movie more bearable it is only 1hour17min so if you are bored it might be a good idea although i rather stay bored why absolutely not see it frankie munitz aka malcolm is just irritating as the nerdtype i could smack the guy and it is so sad he didnt die earlier and in the end he even comes back see something else
