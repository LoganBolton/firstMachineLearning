honestly i was a big fan on stay alive trailer when it got released even some months before i kept on telling my friend how this movie has a great story plot  and perhaps a good one anyway  this movie is somewhat below my expectationsbr br the plot has a great potential but how the story unfolds along with the acting  directing and bad cgi  this film is a disaster the ghost doesnt make any sense and including the killings  its all just too hurried creating a sense of unrealistic in the audiences mindbr br this film could be scary for some audiences  but fear in a sense of shock due to the sound effect etc rather than enduring fear due to certain valid factors in the moviebr br you should reconsider watching this movie
