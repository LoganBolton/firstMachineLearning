i could tell this would be a bad one from the trailer but the lure of the dvd box got me to rent it anyway boy was i rightbr br also for some reason the dvd version is very fuzzy and unclear at times in terms of video quality it appears as if they shot the whole movie with a 20 year old camcorder it looks so bad i really did not like the plot and after watching the movie i was very let down i will not tell any spoilers but let it be said that the end was so bad that i laughed it has been done so many times beforebr br the whole story seems like something that came out of a middle schoolers english paper if i had to peg one movie as the worst horror movie ive ever seen this one may just be it i cant believe they actually released this film it really isnt worth the rent or a penny of anyones money unless you want a good laugh at the movies expense
