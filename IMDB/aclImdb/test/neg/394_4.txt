really average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see thisbr br the acting was average maybe a bit above average the camera usage was average actually below average the picture was so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurry the plot was a good one but moved at such a slow pace and wasnt put to good usebr br this couldve been so much more if it didnt go at a snail pace and we saw more into the characters backgroundsbr br all we see are flashbacks here and there of alice and how her home life is so bad her mother is a working class woman trying to make end meet for her and her daughter we see a flashback of her of when she was in high school and her friend says to her tell your mom to make some better food and everybody says its your mom yeah thats embarrassing but why would you run away from it br br i could definitely see if her mom was a drunk or somebody was abusing her but nothing was wrongwith her home except she was embarrassed by it how immature br br were not even given a glimpse of what the couples lives have been like except that theyve been prostituting for awhile and the woman forgot her name gave her baby up when it was 9 months old this really couldve been so much more it couldve had alice who was abused by her drunk mom go down to florida with her friend but then becomes a prostitute or something along the lines of that other then the real plot of this movie that is alice a girl with a home life of probably 90 of americas population working class runaways to florida but then gets sidetracked by turning into a prostitutebr br i dont see why it won an award at sundance it mustve been up against some really weak competition to have won that one award br br also to me alices bostonnew england accent seemed forced it didnt seem genuine i should know i was born and raised in boston but now live in georgia br br 410 not really worth your time in my opinion
