bad bad movie when i saw the synopsis i was expecting something like ring only with video game instead of tape nothing of the sorts happened ill admit idea is interesting and could be turned into a good movie but this is not itbr br first of all choosing real life person countess bathory is stupid move that adds absolutely nothing to the story anybody even vaguely familiar with her story would begin to wonder why and how did this hungarian noblewoman end up in this movie choosing a generic vengeful spirit would be much much betterbr br then there is whole youdieinreallifeasyoudieinthegame concept as i said before interesting ringlike story but instead of developing it into good story line it sort of just flows along with no explanation given why did this game became such as it is why it was created and so on waste of good ideabr br and finally this movie doesnt even have gory of funny parts that can if not save at least make crappy horror movies watchable death scenes are too quick and acting is too wooden to be funnybr br avoid if possible
