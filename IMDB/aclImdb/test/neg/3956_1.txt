i havent laughed so much in a theater in years the only problem is that it was not the intent of the movie to make my throat raw from laughterbr br this movie is absolutely overflowing with bad cgi absolutely terrible duologue absolutely terrible acting and enough geek references to make the whole thing come off as nothing but complete cheesebr br as a gamer and a geektype girl myself i did recognize all of the obvious game references in this movie as well as the geek stuff that was just thrown into the background as eye candy the steamboy poster the tshirts from thinkgeekcom and jlistcom and that didnt redeem the movie at allbr br the only thing that might have been good at all were the ghost children type characters that were purposefully badly done in cgi to make it look like they were from a game and who were obviously stolen from japanese horror moviesbr br to be honest it was hilariously bad and something id expect from a midnight showing of a madefortv b grade scifi channel movie dont expect more than that and youll have a great time just dont get a soda or youll spit it everywhere when you get great lines like why did you bring that game into our lives why
