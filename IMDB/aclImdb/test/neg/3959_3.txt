the word honor should be erased from the vocabularies of all nations it aggravates male dumbness and is responsible for the death of millions of innocent people anybody who does not agree should not care to continue reading this commentbr br as can be expected with these screenwriters yakuza is an engaging crime thriller with quite a lot of respect for the ethnical background against which it is acted out friends of gore and violence will not be disappointed either but especially towards the end violence becomes somewhat pointless redundant and downright silly contrary to other reviewers i found robert mitchums performance not very good this is an actor who definitely did not improve with age he looks like a tired janitor it does not go too well with the part and his air of detachment which made him such an impressive screen presence in earlier years comes through as either confusion or lack of interest ken takakura and richard jordan are very good as man of honor and young intelligent feeling thug respectivelybr br the best way to stand this movie is seeing it as a tragic comedy things are set in motion by the mitchum characters asking the takakura character a favor based on wrong assumptions the error quickly becomes evident but the sense of honor demands they must not back off so they start sneaking around shooting in all directions wielding swords and wrecking their friends arty apartment although the guy pleads with them Â„stop it please all through the corresponding fight bodies start piling up and the story ends with mitchums character making his point if you give him your little finger i will give you mine well its the least he can do cant he so he pulls out a knife takes a resigned breath and starts sawing off said extremity outside the frame luckily it was a moment which probably should have been solemn it just made me laughbr br the use of locations is very good in this movie i particularly liked the scenes filmed in and around the international conference hall on lake takaragaike an interesting futuristic building by architect sachio otani the kyoto protocol was signed there to me the presentation of architecture seems better here than in sydney pollacks more recent documentary sketches of frank o gehry which is about architecture and nothing else
