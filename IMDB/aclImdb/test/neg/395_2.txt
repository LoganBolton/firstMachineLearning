this is one of those movies i watched and wondered why did i watch it what did i find so interesting about it being a truck driver myself i didnt find it very realistic no ive never used a lot lizard nor have i ever seen nor heard about one traveling around the country in a brand new seventy thousand dollar rv eitherbr br same thing about a pimp whom has never sampled the lady in question until the end of the movie and well he still really didnt and only getting 50 bucks a cut when the prostitute gets 20000 well 15000 after his cut yeahbr br i still laugh at the lot lizard comment ivey made thems lot lizards theyll screw anything with 20 bucks and some are men dressed as woman or something equally as weird meaning were better then them as we may still be prostitutes but we get paid betterbr br other then that its just a story of a young woman whom wanted something more from life then a dead end job while living at home shes 18 remember and embarrassed by her mother basically doing the same thing dead end job at least she had a roof over her head and a job she turned five tricks on the road i wonder if the 75000 she made was worth it id guess not
