this adorable dog called various names during the film is seemingly loved by the whole townbut hes alone he is friends with two children cindy and paul played astonishingly bad but their father wont let them have a dog then benji meets tiffanyanother adorable dog they instantly fall in love and it leads to a hysterical montage of the two of them frolicking in the grass drinking from a fountainin slow motion no less also benji lives in the cleanest abandoned house ive ever seen then the two kids are kidnapped by the most inept unfunniest kidnappers ive ever seen andwouldnt you know itthey hide the brats in the exact house benji lives in br br wow was this bad a huge hit for some reason in 1974 which led to many sequels which i will not see the film is just terribly acted with humor so unfunny and badly done that you just stare at the tv in amazement the film also has a song that is played nonstop during the movieso much that you want to scream it was inexplicably nominated for best song at the oscarsit didnt win yeahthe dogs are adorable and much better than the human actorsbut i need more than cute dogs to keep me interestedbr br you might think im being a little hard on a kids film but i saw it with my 5 year old nephew within 20 minutes he was bored silly and basically stopped watching i kept watching in hope that it would get betterit didnt really lousybut very patient kids or dog lovers might like itbr br note to parents its g rated but a dog is viciously kicked a few times you dont see ityou just hear it and the dog survives but this might bother real young kids
