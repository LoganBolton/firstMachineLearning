for those of you who have a few kind words for this film i suspect you didnt see it when it was released as parts the clonus horror br br it was a dreadfully boring movie it missed the mark in at least three ways it wasnt good enough to be scary it wasnt bad enough to be funny although mst3k took care of that and even in 1979 the plot was unoriginalbr br earlier contenders are the resurrection of zachary wheeler 1971 its the same idea clones as spare parts the movie is entertaining and it had a fine cast another is sleeper 1973 yes the woody allen movie remember the flattened nose and clones 1973 the last two plots arent as similar to clonus as the first one but they predate clonusbr br they are also several fiction books from decades earlier that deal with the idea although often the word clone isnt used
