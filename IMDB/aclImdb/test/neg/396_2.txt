kazuo komizu who hasnt made one decent film directed this notorious shocker and should be ashamed that it was a hit upon its japanese releasebr br yes it does feature scenes of rape gore and dismemberment but so what it has the style of a bad american porn film shot and badly photographed by ed powers dirty debutantes and is incredibly slowbr br it seems to have earned its notoriety based on its roster of antisocial actsbr br there is a huge difference between this and horror that is well producedbr br just because someone likes their cinema a little wet does not mean theyll accept crap like this on the contrary that kind of fan myself for example tolerates even less crap than the average punter out there because hes seen so much and has become overly discerning its a shame production companies dont realize thatbr br one reviewer here zombiekilla81 commented that the films near obsession with gang rape is one of the factors that killed it i disagree the subject matter is never the issue the issue is how that subject matter is treated in entrails of a beautiful woman it is treated so unimaginatively that it is boringbr br personally i like graphic depictions of psychopathic behavior with an intriguing context if the material is well directed freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing this nikkatsu horrorpink hybrid is woeful
