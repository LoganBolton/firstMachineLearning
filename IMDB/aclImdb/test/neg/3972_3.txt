ill say this firstthe film wouldve been a 70s scifi classic if it had been executed a lot betterbr br that said lets examine the plotit starts with peter graves or is that clarence oveur running for president then cuts to a goofy college campuslike environ full of authoritarians in goofy trucker caps and headsets and retarded athletes who all act like theyre perpetually age 8 it then shows one guy apparently going to america having a party then taken to a medical lab where he is drugged wrapped in a plastic bag and then prepared as if the doctors were bagging vegetables for steamers packsokay actually hes being put on ice so the doctors can extract the organs they needbr br it then cuts to another dopey man thinking the place hes living in is a bit strange after a beer can of all plot devices possible he finds in a river makes him look suspicious damn those beer cans he and some equally stupid love interest of his feel they need to get to the bottom of it all so he makes her stay behind as he escapes through what is basically a large college administration building with some evidence he discovers on the way about cloningand how hes a part of itbr br he escapes his controllers after being shot some and an old reporter guy helps him find his fatherthe man he was cloned from it just so happens hes a clone of the brother of peter graves after debate about what to do with him and his evidence he goes back to the facility to find his girlfriend who has been lobotomized in the meantime to be even more stupid harmless and ready to host a talk show according to the sol crew he is captured and put into cold storage just like his nazibuild retard friend from the beginning of the filmbr br meanwhile a confrontation at graves brothers house results in several deaths including graves the reporter guy and his wife are killed in the middle of an exciting conversation by a bomb it seems the conspirators have won to some extentbr br then peter graves turns out to be able to survive being run through with a metal poker by the miracle of cloned parts and giving another vote for me speech just as reporters confront him about the cloning thingbr br definitely mst3k fodder but on the low end of the spectrum as far as overall badness goes
