the movie was actually not that bad especially plotwise but the doughy and hairy actor they chose for the leading role was a little chintzy in the acting department i would have chosen someone else the idea of going to america was very ingenious and the main character questioning everything that hed ever known made him somewhat likable but not very much so when theres a pasty blob for a leading actorbr br the storyline was interesting it brings about the question of how the subject of cloning will be handled in the future certainly cloning wouldnt be allowed for the purposes in the movie but its still a valid argument even for today clones are still people rightbr br the movie wasnt particularly special but it still is a lot better than some of the cheese released during the 70s let us not forget the giant spider invasion i give it a 4 since it didnt totally stink but the mst3k version makes this movie a 10 i still like dr super mario youll like this movie but it wont be your favorite
