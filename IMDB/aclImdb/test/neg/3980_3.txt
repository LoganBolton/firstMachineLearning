like most other people i saw this movie on mystery science theater 3000 although it received some welldeserved barbs its one of the better films to be featured on that showbr br the premise is better than even your average hollywood blockbuster these days it poses some interesting moral dilemmas although the score is sometimes obtrusive it also provides a few lovely moments when richard is walking by the river watching the movie you can see where a lot of plot developments probably looked very good on paper richards discomfort in modern society is an interesting problem to ponder and the ending probably would have been a nice 70sstyle mindfuck if the preceding affairs hadnt been so goofybr br unfortunately the movie is visibly cheap making the flaws all the more obvious the clone farm is very obviously a college campus and a beer can serves as a major plot point lena and richard have zero chemistry  we are supposed to believe this is a meeting of kindred minds but there doesnt seem to be a brain cell between them the cranky old couple schtick also gets real old real fast there are also some mistakes that can be blamed on bad directorial choices such as the decision to hold a climactic conversation out of reach of any audio equipment whatsoeverbr br in all a noble effort but is nonetheless best viewed on mst3k
