youre in the navy now is painfully bad very likely the worst movie gary cooper ever made its supposedly based on a true story but the incident which inspired this film doesnt seem to have enough plot to sustain a featurelength scriptbr br i saw this movie on local television while i was housesitting for my motherinlaw in long island new york there was a raging blizzard outside and i was literally snowbound if id been able to get out the door i definitely would have stopped watching this moviebr br there are some interesting names in the supporting cast notably charles bronson under his original name lee marvin harvey lembeck jack webb and jack warden forget it everybody stinks in this movie even the usually reliable millard mitchell is awful lee marvin and jack warden are onscreen so briefly theres no point in your watching for thembr br gary cooper plays an obscure naval officer who is assigned to command a ship which is powered by a new experimental steam turbine basically the whole ship is a giant teakettle cooper realises that the assignment is not a prestigious one if it were it would have gone to a better officerbr br cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles but he simply had no ability for comedy he made several bad comedies and this one is his worst jane greer has always bored me and she bored me more than usual here this ship went down with all hands and sank without a trace have i mentioned that this movie stinks ill rate youre in the navy now one point out of 10 toot toot
