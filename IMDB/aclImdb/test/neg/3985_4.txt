i saw this film shortly after watching moonlight  valentino with elizabeth perkins gwyneth platrow whoopi goldberg and kathleen turner there are a lot of similarities between the two films they both have great casts and good acting they both have stock characters of sisters who are very different an offensive stepmother a woman friendconfidant an emotionally unavailable father a dead mother and a surprise lover both films have the characters experience lifechanging realizations and both films suffer from a kind of love conquers all sentimentality they both add a little titillation with cameron diaz in black underwear and a partial back shot of gwyneth paltrow nakedbr br both films seem contrived as if the writers of the works the films are based on did market research and said ok theres a market for stories about relationships between women so im going to write about two sisters with an offensive stepmotherÂ… in other words instead of the drama emerging from the truth of the relationship the relationship is invented to fit the dramatic situation it seems forced the characters dont seem real the relationships are unbelievablebr br the resolution of the tensions between the characters is simplistic with simple apologies completely whisking away years of acrimony leaving everyone feeling warm and fuzzy ever after its just not real romantic fantasybr br the characters in in her shoes are a little more overblown than moonlight  valentino especially the stepmother part sydelle feller is so evil that it is difficult to believe that the father would stay with her or even marry her in the first placebr br if you liked moonlight  valentino you will probably like in her shoes as well enjoyable performances in both in fact the actors bring depth to their parts that goes way beyond the contrived sentimentality of the scripts
