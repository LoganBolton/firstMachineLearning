poor shirley maclaine tries hard to lend some gravitas to this mawkish gaginducing feelgood movie but shes trampled by the runaway sentimentality of a film thats not the least bit grounded in realitybr br this was directed by curtis hanson did he have a lobotomy since we last heard from him hanson can do effective drama sprinkled with comedy as evidenced by wonder boys so i dont know what happened to him here this is the kind of movie that doesnt want to accept that life is messy and fussy and that neat tidy endings however implausible they might be might make for a nice closing shot but come across as utterly phony if the people watching the film have been through anything remotely like what the characters in the film go throughbr br my wife and i made a game of calling out the plot points before they occurred  eg the old mans going to teach her to read and then drop dead bingo this is one of those movies where the characters give little speeches summarizing their emotional problems making you wonder why they still have emotional problems if theyre that aware of whats causing them toni collette a fine actress by the way and one of my favorites if not given a lot to work with here gives a speech early on about why she buys so many shoes and never wears them spelling out in flashing neon the films awkward connecting motif at that moment i knew what i was in for and the film was a downward spiral from therebr br grade c
