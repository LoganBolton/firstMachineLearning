for a country that has produced some of the worlds finest dramatists and has such a rich musical heritage it has always been a source of bewilderment to me why so much of irelands homegrown cinema has been so appalling perhaps because by its very nature those talented in the field of irish cinema have been quick to abandon their native shore for careers in britain or america colin farrell is a recent case in point and that the really successful irish directors that have continued to work in ireland and with irish subjects have made their films with international money and an eye on the international market i am thinking particularly of jim sheridan and neil jordan who alternate between films with an irish setting and projects filmed abroadbr br middletown however is very much an irish film even if two of its principal actors are english its certainly wellmade of its kind and might have bucked the trend that irish films arent really very good paddy breathnachs i went down written by the brilliant young playwright conor mcpherson is a crucial exception unfortunately this tale of fundamentalism set in a fictitious irish town presumably in the north of ireland judging by the accents midulster biblebelt if you ask me and presumably in the recent past the fifties the sixties is so overthetop that it really is quite ridiculousbr br nothing in the film rings true and you cant help feeling its writer daragh carville has been strongly influenced by flannery oconnor and that the whole thing might have made more sense had it been set in the american biblebelt and not in ireland where even the most extreme protestant fundamentalist was never quite as loony as this its all meant be to be grim in a grand guignol kind of way and it certainly is though i was more prone to giggles than frissons at the right reverand matthew macfaydens antics he has the ulster accent off pat and there is nothing wrong with his acting or indeed that of daniel mays as his brother gerard mcsorley as his father or eva birthistle as mays wife but the script is so appallingly derivative that good acting can do nothing to save the film so rather than a step up the ladder for irish cinema middletown is im afraid just another nail in its coffin
