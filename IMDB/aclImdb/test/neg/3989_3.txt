the film is visually stunning from the dusty interior of the church with the lighted stove through the drizzly street and the rundown garage to the blaze that is the climax of the film it also has a wonderful sense of time both 1950s the films opening and 1960s all of the performances are topclass especially mathew macfadyen as the psychotic preacher and gerard mcsorley as the father who finds his own intolerance terrifyingly magnified by his son what a pity then that the story is so ridiculous for a start in concentrating on the relationship between gabriel mcfadyen and his family it utterly fails to show how he has managed to hold so much influence on the community in the church we see five or six of the main characters at the front and another two or three at the back but the rest of the congregation might as well be mannequins they show no sign of hearing him heeding him or dissenting from him at the cockfight nobody says yea or nay when he disrupts the proceedings but neither does anybody applaud or condemn when caroline throws a pint over him a situation that results in a stone thrown through the pub window is mysteriously resolved by the onset of labour pains secondly middletown which isnt actually a town but a tiny village seems to lack some essential services such as police and fire service murder can only be dealt with by a family member with a crowbar residents watch an inferno that threatens to engulf the whole town as though they were at the cinema for that matter everyday things such as telephones and newspapers are conspicuously absent the rural community is strangely devoid of farm animals or wheatfields and most puzzling of all for a typical north of ireland setting there is only one christian community  not even a couple of anglicans to season the mix even if youre willing to suspend disbelief the story itself is pretty threadbare a pale imitation of an aj cronin melodrama and the music well its beautiful for the first two minutes but when the same four chords are repeated nonstop for 90 minutes it gets more than a little irritating my advice watch this with the sound off
