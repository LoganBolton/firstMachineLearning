once again the posters lied to mebr br the marketing of this flick was deeply at odds with the content explosive when i read the synopsis for this movie i was expecting to see a townful of grotesques every manjack of them bloodshot and bloated by alcohol peppered by heroin needles and bent double with chronic masturbation into such a den of vice would come the cleanshaven hero shining gabriel instead the movie was the complete opposite of what i was led to expectbr br the first few minutes of the film showed us that middletown is a simple little place full of poor people doing the best they can whether fiddling a little to make ends meet drinking to forget the pain or watching cockfighting chickens not penises to while away the boredom in other words the townspeople were desperately ordinarybr br the only deliberate grotesque in the piece was gabriel the brainwashed presbyterian preacher played by macfadyen whose face is built in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury if i were kind i would suggest that the paisleyite rantings of the preacher were a witty comment designed to make us despise gabriel and his faith unfortunately brian kirk is so inept a filmmaker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie leaving the audience to fret their way through eightyplus minutes of dark hackneyed tedium my only respite from this waste of celluloid was a game of guess the accent broken up with rounds of spot the location are we surprised that gaybo ends up stealing his brothers child and suffocating his father of course not hes a biblebashing preacher and therefore psychotic all the townspeople stand around looking shocked at the end of the movie but i suspect that theyve just realised what a turkey theyve put their names tobr br the northern ireland film and television commission have a budget to spend but there are better projects than this feeble enterprise the only kind thing i can say in favour of this movie is that it has managed to replace superman returns as the worst film of 2006 one hell of an achievementbr br v120061114 v220080107
