in the same way lamberto bava was a substandard facsimilie of his father mario who was an extremely overrated director anyway michele soavi is a substandard director in the dario argento mold the church has at least one thing to recommend itthe incredibly detailed art directionbut absolutely nothing else the film is longwinded filled with onedimensional characters and almost put me to sleep several times theres a fine line between art and pretentious crap and while the church isnt completely worthless youd be better off watching something elsebr br 310
