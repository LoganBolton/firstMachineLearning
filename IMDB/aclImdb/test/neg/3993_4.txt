i had always eyed italian horror maestro dario argentos efforts as producer with a certain suspicion and these were only confirmed after my fairly recent viewing of lamberto bavas terrible demons 1985 the fact that this was supposed to be its third installment did not sound promising at all but i decided to give the film a rental regardless now that were in full halloween swing i checked out the theatrical trailer on the anchor bay dvd prior to viewing the main feature  the undeniably striking visuals had me intrigued to be sure but then the film proper which makes no more sense than whats presented in that frenzied twominute montage and in retrospect can be seen to have wisely compiled most of its highlights proved a definite letdownbr br opening promisingly enough with a medieval prologue straight out of alexander nevsky 1938 it goes downhill fast because it relies too much on surreal imagery at the expense of narrative consequently several characters randomly take centerstage throughout  with the insufferable male lead succumbing to the dark forces early on the sinisterlooking bishop feodor chaliapin resulting a mere red herring the mysterious black priest gradually assuming heroic qualities the leading lady is for whatever reason preyed upon by a goatshaped demon culminating in a sexual rite conducted in front of the other cultists lifted alltooobviously from rosemarys baby 1968 and a reasonably impressive 13year old asia argento as the rebellious but likable sacristans daughter who emerges as the only survivor by the end incidentally the older argento also cowrote the films story and screenplay along with director soavi and under a pseudonym after they apparently fell out with dario in the early stages of production original helmer lamberto bava and prolific genre scribe dardano sacchetti whom i met at the 61st venice film festival in 2004br br the extremely muddled second half of the film then sees a group of people  including the inevitable teenagers but also a doddering english couple whose constant bickering is given an amusingly nasty punchline  similarly shut inside a building in the grip of evil spirits the church being the burial ground of a satanic cultnot that this horror outing is likely to dispel memories of luis bunuels sublimely surreal the exterminating angel 1962 you see in the end the film is all the more disappointing though sergio stivalettis gruesome effects at least are notable given that i had thoroughly enjoyed the only other soavi title id watched  cemetery man 1994 which i own via the r2 se dvd that said id still like to catch his debut feature  stage fright 1987  and the directors followup effort to the church entitled the sect 1991
