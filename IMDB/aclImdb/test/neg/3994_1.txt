let me get this straight the church has a safety lockdown mechanism to keep the spirits from leaving but the ultimate solution is bringing it to the ground lofl maybe im missing the plot maybe this guy is from the ed wood school of filmmaking or something this movie is about as useless as the church itself hey maybe thats the point that whole rosemarys babyesq segment was hilarity i can go to my corner halloween costume shop and get better drag than that the entire film needs to be remade properly there were so many things that were played down so many things that could have made me jump out of my seat and through the ceiling im not sure if the fault lies with the writing or editing but what i saw should not have this high of a rating
