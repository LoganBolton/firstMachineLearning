master of italian horror dario argento is called a lot of bad things by nonfans and is deserving of absolutely none of the backlash in fact every time i hear something bad about argento i think theyre really talking about michele soavi he just doesnt get the same amount of attention because his films were never as successful in theaters in fact his best film  1994s cemetery man  was probably his least successful or just didnt get the attention he felt it deserved because after that he left film and went into directing television hes never gone back so people really dont know how inferior his other films are because by the time theyve seen them theyre already fans of the italian horror aesthetic which means you have to accept the fact that they make almost zero sense and are usually very unattractive films this is where the church stands out from the pack because visually its so cheap and ancientlooking you can smell the dust but it has its charms too though they are few the camerawork is truly arresting and the music score is hugely elaborate and grandbr br since argento is the reasons people have seen soavis work all i dont know anyone who caught the church before argentos suspiria and deep red soavi is a bit of a hack sort of like an italian mick garris the utmost example of a director preferring style over substance the flaws of the church are constant and plenty the film opens with a somewhat interesting prologue showing knights on white horses charging through a peasant village akin to those you see in any robin hood adaptation in some longago century these scenes are intense enough energetic and get quickly to the point then we cut to the present where the films style takes over yeah the movie is okay to look at and for about 35 or so minutes in the present 1980s whereveritaly the movie is just interesting enough to get us to the slowly revealing horror elements so now we know the purpose of the film is the build up of its horror and its a decent build up for the most part but as the movie approaches the halfway point we realize the movies driving by and nothing is happeningbr br the plot is very simple i think two people working in a church one as a cataloger of books and the other as a restorer of the buildings wall artwork discover a scroll  scripture that the man thinks will lead them to some kind of buried treasure or priceless artifact that he can sell and get rich off of so he follows his map only to uncover a force underneath the church that has him hallucinate while hes slowly becoming a demon who will make everyone else hallucinate so while he is doing his demonwork someone he passed the force onto kills himself in a manner that traps everyone in the church while the demon contagen spreads onto everyone leaving a black preacher and the little girl who sneaks out of the church every night to go clubbing as the only 2 people who can stop the plague from spreading beyond the church walls that probably sounds actionpacked and soavis style is far more lethargic than argento but never before have i seen an attempted surrealist film this agonizingly boring i kid you not absolutely nothing happens in the entire film ive seen expressionistic or impressionistic im no film school supergrad films before but most of them actually show things happening john carpenters halloween for onebr br it follows pretty closely in the footsteps of lamberto bavas demons films since argento coproduced were shown to a location where a bunch of people gather one turns into a demon all the others are isolated that person infects everyone except a couple survivors then the demons either get out infecting the world or the survivors get out when the demons die this film puts all those same elements in place except unlike argentos work nothing happens okay a few things do happen but only one bizarre sequence has the panache of lambertos much more fun demons films a random womans neck is impaled by a demon using a section of fence he rips out of the floor whats bizarre about that you wonder it happens in front of about two dozen people what do they do nothing she dies her head trickles blood in closeup but all those people dont even notice though it happens in plain view and no less than 8 feet away from them maybe 4 people notice the demon running up to stab anyone he can as he runs toward her so they duck out of the way shes killed and in the shot after she dies everyone is just sitting around being quiet while a boy plays a saxophone i kid you not thats what happens thats more than logically incoherent its plain stupidbr br the scene is suggesting that the woman just sort of disappears and no one saw her death they all just up and forget about it and this 15second thing is absolutely the only event that takes place in the movie im not saying its the only violence gore or murder we see its not its just the only thing we can tell is happening for example in one scene a beautiful woman sees herself in a mirror looking old and ugly she starts clawing the skin on her face off but when she reappears minutes later no scratches people are devoured by fish and their faces are squashed by subway cars but later they turn up as totally unharmed members of a possessed cult in a scene that commits the ultimate horror heresy copying a famous scene from roman polanskis 1968 masterpiece rosemarys baby the greatest horror film ever made shot for shot even if argento did that i would be furious
