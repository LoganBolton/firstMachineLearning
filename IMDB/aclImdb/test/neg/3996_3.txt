i was initially interested in this film after reading a synopsis and seeing a few striking screenshots and the promise was there for a gripping horror film of the dario argento style admittedly i must say that argentos films have occasionally been rather incoherent and some feel like a handful of visually impacting set pieces loosely strung together with a vague connecting plotbr br since argento is credited as writer for this i have to say im not really surprised even his masterpiece suspiria when examined exhibits the same tendency to string along sometimes unrelated scenes purely for the aesthetic impact however suspiria also had the benefit of a singular main character and clear antagonists as well as scenes that contributed ultimately to the eventual resolutionbr br the church on the other hand has none of these things it has no main character no protagonist whatsoever it furthermore has no real plot to speak of and no crescendo no climax no denouement and no resolution it is a completely hollow incoherent work that views as if argento sat down and thought hey that would make an interesting scene visuallylets do it the film is a series of these scenesbr br initially it might be interesting and soavis direction is excellent i must say soavi cannot be faulted for the material as it is made as compelling as possible however such good direction calls attention to the horrible failings of the script and there is absolutely no sense in it the attempt at a central unifying plot is nothing more than plagiarism of carpenters film prince of darkness events happen solely because the script wishes them to and reactions to those events are completely implausible the narrative flow is irreparably damaged after a point simply because there is no ability to suspend disbelief its too ludicrous added to this are numerous factual errors that are so glaringly showcased that it becomes embarrassingbr br if it had been more overtly artistic and edited down into a different work it might have been chilling or tense if it had been fleshedout into an actual cohesive narrative it might have been gripping but it was none of these the best it managed was confusing and at times infuriating plots are introduced but never followed characters are forgotten about and altered arbitrarily no logic is ever applied to any situation it might have been scary or interesting but to elicit that sort of feeling takes more effort on the part of a screenwritermuch morebr br all in all the church is not worth viewing for anyone but total enthusiasts of italian horror that is more style than substance this is argentos style at its worst and it is a strong justification for the usual criticism
