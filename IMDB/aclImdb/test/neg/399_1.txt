i was entertained to see that some of the reviews here were topped with spoilers the joke in my family is that the only part of this movie that isnt given away on the back of the box is given away in the title perhaps i am just a dense american 17yearold who wouldnt know art if it bit me in the leg but i prefer movies that have at least some words this movie makes the second half of 2001 a space odyssey down right chatty this movie is just so slow it isnt even art it is merely boring we follow this creepy guy who is following this boy around venice the end was incomprehensible until i read the end of book a movie shouldnt make you refer back to the book it should be able to stand alone this movie has no way to stand it doesnt even have the bones of a plot to lean on
