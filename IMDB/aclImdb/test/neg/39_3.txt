this is a hard film to rate while it truly deserves its 3 or perhaps even a two for an al adamson film its exceptionaland practically adamsons very best thats because unlike many adamson films there are times when nurse sherri almost looks competent but being an adamson film you know that sooner or later that crappiness must rear its ugly head br br the film begins with some bizarre cult leader of a huge congregation six trying to resurrect a dead guy who looks like hes made of blue cheese however in the process the cult dude has a heart attack and it taken to the hospital he apparently dies but it also seems like many of these hospital scenes are missing and a few of them appear much later in the film in other words when you see the film he appears to have possibly recoveredonly to hear later that hed died because the guy is the bff of satan however his evil soul cant die and he comes back to both haunt one of his henchmen and to possess nurse sherribr br now sherri is obviously a very disturbed ladydemonic possession or not at times she acts like a zombie and at others shes violently homicidal so i askwhy didnt her boyfriend a doctor think this was perhaps problematic in other words after trying to kill a patient he neither gets an exorcist nor commits her to the booby hatch oh and speaking of boobiesthis movie is not the breastfilled sex romp its title and posters would indicate while there are a few bare breasts here and there they are irrelevant to the plot and only seen very briefly 12 second or so in all but one scene so if you are a perv this movie is not for youthough a few places in the film such as the nurse undressing for a patient make it look like the film might have at one time been designed as a porn flickbr br if you are a bad movie fan however there is enough to whet your appetite some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to deliver lines that arent zombielikeand i am not even talking about sherri especially noticeable is one of the very final scenesi have never seen and heard some stilted acting and dialog in my lifeand this includes ed woods films there are also a few more cheap touches such as the bad animation of the green stuff the doctor finding a murdered nurse yet continuing to investigate in a house where walls are covered in blood id get a copbetter yet an army of copsbr br so despite these problems why do i think its good for an adamson film well the story isnt all bad and he was able to build tension very well many false alarms early on made my heart race a bit also the car crash while irrelevant came off pretty well and was practically bigbudget for adamsonbr br overall not a good film and one most people would be bored watching however fans of adamson or inept films will like itit does deliver some entertainment in a cheesy manner that will provide a few laughs
