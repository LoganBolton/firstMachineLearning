i know that many people willhave automatically given this film a rating of 1 just because it doesnt have the huge budget and topoftheline special effects that they are used to i however knew what i was getting myself into when i popped this into the vcrbr br i dont think we get much more lowbudget that this unless we are filming a family reunion the lighting is awful sound quality is at times incomprehensible and the acting is ultrabad by almost all involved but this is still a fun movie and the plot is interesting enough it centers around a fellow named tom russo asbestos felt who has been down on his luck with his job he is very protective of his wife and does not allow her to work putting even more pressure on himself as he begins working more hours we see him slowly transcend into madness and obsession and he becomes suspicious that his wife cheating on him and begins to brutally murder the various men most repair guys that he feels are responsible br br i must say that the gore effects are extremely cheap but fit with the overall tone of the film the brutal ways that tom russo comes up with to murder these men gives us an idea of just has mad he has become the pacing of the film is also very good and there is rarely a boring moment the ending really doesnt follow the rest of the plot of the film as it seems to want to go from a psychoslasher film to a dawn of the dead wannabe but it is entertaining nonetheless and i must give tim ritter credit for wanting to use an unconventional ending br br i can honestly say that i enjoyed this film but it is by no means a good film if that makes sense its budget is its main stumbling block and the consequences are almost too much to overlook i do not recommend this to people who are totally spoiled by the bigbudget movies and who cant have an openmind to ultralow budget films you simply wont enjoy it for others and fans of gorei say give it a shot you will find at least something redeeming in it br br my grade d
