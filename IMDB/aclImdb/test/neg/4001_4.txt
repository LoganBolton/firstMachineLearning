ordinarily i love these stranger within thrillers some good examples are fatal attraction single white female and audition done well they can be a lot of fun and worth an hour or two of solid shocks and scares of course the opposite can be true done poorly they can be tedious and stupid the hand that rocks the cradle is one of the latterbr br the bartels claire annabella sciorra and michael matt mccoy are welcoming another member to their family but busy claire is persuaded by michael to hire a nanny one day a woman named peyton flanders rebecca demornay shows up and because she seems perfect the bartels hire her of course once she shows up their idyllic life is slowly unravelingbr br this film suffers from a plethora of problems but the biggest one is the handling of the villain peyton is never believable part of this has to do with how shes written and how shes acted the things that she does that are supposed to put us on edge are so contrived that theyre laughable de mornay doesnt help much she portrays peyton as two different people while its true shes supposed to be the perfect nanny while hiding her psychotic tendencies de mornays performance creates a divide between the two facets of her characterbr br the other actors are good however annabella sciorrra is terrific as the asthmatic claire sciorra is very natural in the role but unfortunately the script lets her down matt mccoy is almost invisible however julianne moore is delightful as claires friend marlene moore is a firecracker but unfortunately shes only on screen for a total of five minutesbr br curtis hanson is a good director but you wouldnt know it from watching this dud the film has a few decent shocks but its poorly paced and the climax while generating some tension is actually kind of laughable that being said hes working with a script that at best could charitably be called patheticbr br trust me when it comes to nannies stick with fran drescher this one should have gone to the directtovideo bin
