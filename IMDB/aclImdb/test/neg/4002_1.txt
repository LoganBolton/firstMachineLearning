piece of junk wouldve given it a 0 if i could have animation is good but not quite good enough storyline is absolutely the most ridiculous ive ever come across and thats saying a lot this movie tried so hard to be interesting but failed miserably its almost as if the writer started one story then got another idea and attempted to mesh the two together dont waste your time on this believe me youll be as ticked off with yourself as i was the only actor of any note in this was james woods and his part was peripheral at best im all for doing stuff that is edgy that pushes the envelopes but this simply didnt cut it
