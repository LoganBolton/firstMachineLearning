i watched this last night on sundance altman must be the most hit or miss director of note ever this show despite its star power is utterly noncompelling and its political insightswhich i as a proud liberal in no way disagree withare shallow and clunky and seem ripped from the headlines of usa today despite the fact its coming out of the mouth of someone as esteemed as mario cuomo the drama as such is not very dramatic and the comedy is not funny the only points of interest really are seeing how new yorkers live their lives and the loyalty of a cast and crew to reassemble a show that keeps insisting has some cult following from 1988 sometimes it seems like altmans sole contribution to cinema has been the art of having all your actors talk at once the effect of which is one feels depressingly like theyre a stranger at a wedding
