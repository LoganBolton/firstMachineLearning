altman is very proud of the fact that people in his movies talk over each other because he says people do that in life well people also cough burp go off on tangents etc the point is that just because people actually do something doesnt make it compelling cinema thats one issuebr br the bigger issue is that this just isnt a very clever or direct or hitting or relevant satire in 1988 or 2004 garry trudeau is still living in the 1960s and thinks everyone except a small core of republican elected officials is a 60sstyle hippie liberal i mean the guy still trots out zonker in his strip  a character that is a complete anachronism yet trudeau still employs him as if he is representative of a large stripe of american youthbr br dont get me wrong i am a conservative but im not saying that this is bad because its got a liberal bent it could take a liberal tack and be funny and relevant but its not it is mainly a vanity piece with a bunch of prominent celebrity liberals including the odious repellent ron reagan jr at times it feels unscripted and the rest of the time it has a snarky air of selfimportance and arent we ohsoclevernessbr br someone said that this show insists it has a cult following i think its cult status is more wishedfor than actual im certain there are two or three people out there who taped all the original episodes in 1988 and still have them but if that is the standard then every show ever aired is a cult classic to some degree if tanner didnt have the names altman and trudeau attached it would be another forgotten hbo production from the 1980s instead its presented as hardhitting incisive political commentary from guys who are at the top of their game the reality however is about as far from that as possible pat paulsens presidential satire is more relevant than tanner ever was and hes been dead for a decade
