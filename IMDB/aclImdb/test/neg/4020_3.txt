this movie earns its 3 for lousy writing poor technical merit and continuity problems some people have given this movie a 10and perhaps that is okay if you are simply scoring it for its fun factor however technically this is an inept movie serial from start to finishproduced by 3rdrate writers actors and crew that really was true of nearly all the serials because they were meant as lowbrow entertainment particularly aimed at the kids and theres nothing wrong with that but high art it aint spy smasher earns a lower than average score compared to other serials because it is of even lower quality and has major continuity problemseven for a serial it was common for a serial to have a cliff hangerie a moment at the end of the episode that looked as if the good guy dies but miraculously survives when the next episode began but in this film its much hokier and ridiculous you would literally see the hero die in the last episode but in the next they reshot the scene and showed he actually didnt die even though they clearly showed him buy the farm in the last one again and again in spy smasher he seems to die but in the next episode they show it from a different angle and he somehow avoided deatheven if he fell 1500 feet into a river fell into a buzz saw or whateverbr br watch this movie not for its quality but either for a good laugh or to learn what it was like to go to the movies on saturday mornings decades ago
