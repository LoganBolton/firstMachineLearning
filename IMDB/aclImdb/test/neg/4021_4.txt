ive seen about a half dozen of the low budget poverty row b westerns that ken maynard made in the 1930s and i am consistently amazed at how poor an actor he was how did he ever get to be a leading cowboy actor they say that he could ride pretty well back in the silents but he doesnt do anything particularly impressive in these later sound films still maybe he got the leads because he was big and could ridebr br phantom rancher isnt as bad as some of the other ken maynard films ive seen but it still isnt much some of the other characters refer to him a couple of times as a young fella where it appears to me that hes just as old as the other older actorsbr br and if thats not silly enough theres a rather significant script problem in this film at one point one of the characters makes a remark about how the phantom had prevented the poisoning of a well something that hadnt happened yet just a couple of minutes later we then see that particular scene no it wasnt a flashback at first i thought perhaps that when treeline films was doing the dvd transfer they might have reversed two of the reels but in those days film reels contained approximately 11 minutes of film and the whole reversal only took about 3 or 4 minutes tops everything else was in a logical order so it looks like that was a genuine continuity problem in the original film maybe thats one reason why colony pictures didnt last very long
