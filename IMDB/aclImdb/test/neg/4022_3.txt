what was this a zucker brothers movie i dont mind a little humor in my holmes im a big fan of billy wilders the private life of sh but this version of the sign of four feels like a grandguignolesque episode of murder she wrote right from the opening credits that are of the worst possible kind a montage of scenes from the movie as directed by mel brooks ian richardson is a fine actor and certainly looks the part hes a dead ringer to those drawings from the strand but his interpretation of the character is all wrong and overly humorous from the silly smile he frequently sports i thought the drug holmes was into was cocaine not weed to his expressions of comical stiffness in the carnival sequences not to mention that when he disguises himself as an old man he is so over the top that despite the fine makeup we instantly recognize him david healy is an unmemorable but given the circumstances acceptable watson and is not too much of a buffoon at least not more than the rest of characters cherie lunghi excalibur plays mary morstan in an exaggerated ingenue fashion straight out of a 1930s vaudevillebr br storywise there are some pointless additions like giving tonga vampire teeth an appetite for raw meat and a carnival pit as a place to live turning him into a reject from island of dr moreau and we are even denied the pleasure of discovering the mystery alongside holmes as we are well informed of everything way before holmes finds out and this is full of tired clich√©s not only we get the infamous catchphrase elementary my dear watson which as any sherlockian will know conan doyle never ever wrote but we are exposed to such blatant commonplaces as having hindi music pop out of nowhere when holmes goes to see a white guy in hindi clothesbr br bottom line in britain in the eighties two rival tv companies attempted to create a longrunning series of sherlock holmes adaptations and produced initial tvmovies as potential pilots one of them starred ian richardson the other starred jeremy brett thankfully the one that got its way through multiple episodes was the good onebr br 310 travesty
