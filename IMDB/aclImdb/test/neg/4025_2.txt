i rented this dvd because im a big science fiction fan but this thing i wont call it a film because it was obviously shot very quickly on video seemed like they made it up as they went along im still not sure what it was about theres these guys dressed up in some weird sm outfits and i guess theyre from another planet anyway not much makes sense in this low low low budget film if it was their first film id cut them some slack but i think its like their 5th film and its really really badbr br very bad acting not one good actor is this movie this director must have been out of his mind to even work on a horrible film like this dont waste your time or money on this dvd please people dont it is not even worth the 99 cents i paid to rent the dvd in fact im going to tell them the dvd was messed up to get my money back i dont believe in giving anything at all a bad review but i must here my advice to anyone involved in this sinking shipplease find another profession to get into how could you make a rotten movie like this i would give this negative stars if possible its that terrible
