thats what me and my friends kept asking each other throughout this entire flick we couldnt believe how stupid it was i think somebody shot this on their camcorder at home and snuck it into the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anybody would ever pick it up well i guess the joke is on usbr br i guess i should have come to this website first and read all of the reviews it has gotten every single one says this movie is horrible stupid and on and on and boy are they right although it did provide some pretty good laughs me and my friends were pretty drunk because it is so stupid we just cant believe somebody was dumb enough to make such a crappy movie i swear this had to be made in the 70s before they had good technology for movies and stuff because every scene looks really crappy but when i looked on here it said it was made in 2001 what it sure doesnt look like a movie that would be made today but i guess thats what you get when you use a camcorder and shoot home movies using strobe lights and really fake looking lasers and use real life people from your home town instead of actors or even aspiring actors btwsome of those chicks or were they drag queens we couldnt tell were so fugly even my drunk horny college buddies wouldnt touch them with a 50foot polebr br so theres absolutely no appeal to this movie at all bad acting bad writing bad directing bad special effects bad bad bad dont waste your time or money on this one youll be completely disappointed
