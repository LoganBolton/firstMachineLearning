this whole movie is just so terrible it is a complete mess the story is just so stupid i cant believe somebody actually sat down and wrote about this and thought it would make a good movie the acting is quite possibly the very worst out of any bmovie ever made ive seen a lot of scifi type bmovies before and some of them are actually pretty good some of them howeverlike from venusshould never have been madebr br some movie makers think that just because they put something together and somehow got it on the shelves of a movie store that they have accomplished somethingthat it is good and should be watched by people this is not always true and it is definitely not true of from venus this film loses on all accounts horrible acting stupid plot very weak special effects ugliest costumes ever nonrealistic dialogue bad direction etc you can just tell this film only took about 20 to make and i may be giving it too much credit there i urge you to stay away from this train wreck of a film for your own good
