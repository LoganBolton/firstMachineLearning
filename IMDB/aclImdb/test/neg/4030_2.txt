oh my god it just doesnt get any worse than this i always love silly little scifi bmovies that are so stupid they are funny and i thought that this would be one of those but this was just so stupid i found it absolutely deplorable that it was allowed to be released what were these people thinking they are obviously not real filmmakers and i really hope that they have gone back to their day jobs after realizing that this is the best they could do the acting and the notso special effects were nowhere near the standard of even the lowest budget bmovies and what is with the men dressed up as women could they not find any women that wanted to appear in this crappy thing no probably notbr br i would give this a 0 if possible it does not even deserve a 1 for awful do not waste your time and especially not your money on this horrible loser of a nonfilm
