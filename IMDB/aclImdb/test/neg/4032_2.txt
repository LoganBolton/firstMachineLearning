i can tell by the other comments that nobody could ever actually enjoy this trifling piece of crap thats the same way i feltbr br the whole time i was watching it i was horrified that anyone could make a movie this stupid what is the world coming to i guess it is my fault for sitting through the entire movie ugh but it was like a bad car wreck i couldnt look awaybr br if you are a kid under 8 years of age you might like this movie otherwise stay away from it at all costs its the stupidest movie ive ever seenbr br everythings stupidthe story script and especially the acting everything while watching the movie youll either turn the tv off and think how can a movie be so sadly stupid or keep on watching from curiosity to see if things can get more stupid than this they cantbr br these movie makers if you can call them that need to seriously go back to their day jobs not one of them has an ounce of talent and i highly doubt you can make a living churning out such horrible useless garbage that no one in their right minds would ever want to seebr br just drawn out bs dont waste your time
