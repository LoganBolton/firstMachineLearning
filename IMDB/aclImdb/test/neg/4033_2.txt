watching this movie really surprised me i have never found myself to stop watching a movie in its entirety because 3 dollars to rent a movie is a good amount of money and darn it i should at least watch the whole thing and get my moneys worth i made it through about 30 minutes of this absolutely crappy movie when i thought to myself i am now a little more dumber after watching this movie i cant believe that the director and actors in this movie actually had that low of respect for themselves to allow this to be released br br theres nothing i can say that hasnt been said by the other reviewers but even in the worst of films there are usually one or two decent performancesnot in this piece of pathetic garbage ive seen better acting in high school plays every and i mean every actor is bad beyond belief and whats truly amazing is the uniformity of the badnessgosh it must have been the director where did they get these peoplebr br this is possibly one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen although entertaining in places due to its laughable script and even weaker acting and i use that term very loosely it is unfortunate that this film was not consigned to b movie hell for all eternity what could have been a good idea has been ruined by an ultra low budget poor sound and effects and actors who probably earned their wings in childrens television and poor childrens television at that br br please stay away from this movie not even worth a minute of your time
