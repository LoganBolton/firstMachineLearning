this is one of those movies that you watch because its bad such a movie that you watch just to see its shitty craftsmanship supposedly a horror i cannot imagine how anyone can be afraid of a claymation bug especially one that is translucent in nature where you can see the actors legs behind itbr br even with no budget a little bit of attention to detail and even an attempt at making this movie believable would have sucked the fun right out of it as they would have had to replace all of the actors and the entire story with it if i had nothing to make fun of while it was playing i would have stopped it after 10 minutes and put on some quality show like spunge bob square pants har har harbr br i strongly recommend that brett piper get with quintin terrantino and really pump out some fecesbr br
