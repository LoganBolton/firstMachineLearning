this is just the same old crap that is spewed from amateur idiots who have no clue how to make a moviegee maybe thats why it is a straighttovideo wannabe moviebr br i guess it is my fault for actually spending money to see it one of the worst decisions i have ever made what a waste i usually like b movies some of them are actually quite goodbut this is just too ridiculous and stupid to even be funnybr br the losers that made this junk deserve to be put out of business for wasting everyones time and money making a movie that obviously doesnt even deserve to be on film these socalled movie makers have absolutely no talentbr br stupid plot horrible acting especially the drag queenswhat sicko would actually find that sexy lame writing if there even was a scriptseems like the kinda bull someone just made up on the spotbr br what is stunning about this movie is its utter lack of anything welldone at allbr br how much attention to detail would it take to insure that every frame of a film would be so far below any reasonable standards i dont think it would be possible to make such a bad movie intentionally and it is inconceivable that sheer bad luck could produce such consistently awful resultsbr br anyway avoid this stink bomb at all costs
