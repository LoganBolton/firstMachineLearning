words cannot express how poor this film isbr br there is no plot the acting is appalling basically the whole film is a jokebr br with a running time of 97 minutes its about 96 minutes too longbr br it might have been ok as a short sketch on a comedy show but the premise is way too flimsy to work for that amount of time without boredom kicking inbr br avoid this one go rent a good movie instead
