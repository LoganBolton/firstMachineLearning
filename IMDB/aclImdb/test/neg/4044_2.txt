to have to actually own up to making such a horrible movie actually im more embarrassed that i sat through the whole thing it looks like an old 80s scifi movie complete with superfake looking special effects queer imagery and very cheesy dialogue maybe thats the way they wanted it to look maybe they think its cool to do movies in 80s fashion like it will come back in style who knowsbr br if you think the promised eyecandy will save the film youre in for a disappointmentthe socalled babes are manish and downright ugly they cant act at all i dont understand why they couldnt at least get good looking chicks if they want babes with no talent but i guess when youre making a film this stupid you dont get very good choices hot chicks arent just lining up to do this kind of pitiful crap
