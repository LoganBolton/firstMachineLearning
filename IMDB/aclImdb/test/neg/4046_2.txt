this movie was just so utterly horrible that i couldnt get through the entire thing without turning it off it was just that bad when i was watching it i kept thinking it looked like some really cheap film made back in the 60s or something with those terrible looking special effects but then i realized that this was just made in 2001 br br the dialog and the acting were really very horrible and the plot was almost nonexistent i didnt think anyone would go back to making films that look so cheap and old im not sure if they did that on purpose or if they really didnt have any budget for this movie at all it really looks like it was shot on someones camcorder at a local persons house or something maybe they thought they were being retro or something but it just comes off looking really cheesybr br i really dont know how anyone could ever actually enjoy watching thisbr br 0 out of 5 s
