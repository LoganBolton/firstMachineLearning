this has got to be one of the weakest plots in a movie i have ever seenbr br however that is not all that this movie is lacking this movie has the worst acting writing directing special effects you name itits the worst everbr br i highly advise you to spend your time on worthwhile movies and not waste your time on this garbagebr br i do agree with an earlier post that the women were definitely men dressed up in drag and that did give me a laugh i keep trying to figure out if they were being obvious about it or if they were actually trying to be sexy womenbr br anyway there is not much else in this movie that is worth watchingbr br to sum it up horrible acting horrible script horrible idea for a movie an hour and a half of my life i want back right now
