when i first saw this i thought it was a joke all i could think was you get the 8mm camera ill get my little brothers monster toys well make a movie why would anyone in a modern time like 2001 make a scifi movie like this it looks like it was made in the early 80s with actors that are as wooden as a cigar store indian a script that was written by the directors 4yearold son a camera that was stolen from a burning pawn shop povertyrow special effects and to top it off a director that thought making this crap would make them famous the end result wasnt spectacular complete with scrappy dialogue and continuity from venus must have been fun to make and im sure everyone involved had a blast with their silly little moviebr br a 2 out of 10 for a valiant hopeless effortbr br
