in spite of its highminded ambitions zurlinis film must be seen as a failure its one thing to create a world which draws the viewer into feeling the tedium and angst experienced by the protagonist which i think is what zurlini was attempting its another thing entirely to make a film that is itself tedious and meaninglessly episodic despite beautiful cinematography at a haunting location  and a wonderful score  the film never lures the audience in too much is unintentionally funny the phony sound of dripping water in dragos quarters for example or the silentmovie mugging by some of the actors or simply confusing why exactly does drago want to leave the fort the first time for the film to succeed as a coherent work
