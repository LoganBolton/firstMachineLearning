skip all the subjective this is a great film reviews and read the imdb trailer or the back the kino videobox which includes both versions of this flick which ill paraphrase to the tune of scifi score by george antheil the camera goes on a sleepwalk through bmovie hell all photographed by will thompson who did plan 9 from outer space  maniac you dont know whether to laugh at the film or with it so if you like selfproduced b or cgrade noirwannabe actors and effects with pretensions of surrealism this could be for you otherwise get a copy of screamplay a modern lowbudget expressionist masterpiece
