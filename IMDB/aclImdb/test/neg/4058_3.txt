air bud 2 golden receiver is a very bad rehearse in making a sequel in the course of a single year the first film was cute cuddly and charming the idea of a dog playing on a basketball team is quite far fetched but he defiantly pulled off enough stunts to save the concept even the human story had some explanation to it joshs father was killed in a plane crash so he is sad and the audience becomes emotionally involved as wellbr br now for the poorly made sequel it is terrible this is the worst kind of bad sequel the kind that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad ones the kind that changes the main plot piece in one way this time the k9 plays football instead of basketball no madder how much time is spent in mind over matter benefit of a doubt walk into with an open mind of an attitude you have with a film like this there is no positive thinking when it comes to down right bad film makingbr br the sequel stars kevin zegers as josh who is in eight grade he lives with his mother and little sister in a seattle suburb in the first film the human story involved him losing his father in a plane accident which the audience can relate to most people know what it feels like to lose a close loved one br br in this movie the emotional plot is a bit more complicated joshs mother is dating once again he and buddy his dog who can play basketball dont like this at all why if i were in his shoes i would love to have an extra parent in my life especially one this nice the mans name is patrick sullivan and joshs mother jackie met him became he is a local veterinarian for buddybr br the animal story is too simple josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school football team the timber wolves the team itself looks like something from americas funniest home videos the can even catch a ball without tripping or plummeting into each other so when bud shows up one day he proves he can play as a receiver for them and is no doubt the teams best playerbr br buddys extremely cute in his football costume oh he is enough to melt the heart the dog is the best in this movie as well too bad there wasnt enough stunts done by him to draw attention away from the fact that no one ever asks any questions about a dog playing off a school football teambr br there is a very bad subplot about russian circus workers that like stealing amazing animals of course they try to catch buddy but their dim minds are ruled over by the animals and end up doing what looks like a home alone scenario to thembr br air bud 2 golden receiver is much more goofy than the first too the russian kidnappers add a bunch of lamebrain slapstick that i have to admit made me laugh at the stupidity of it all there are way too many sequences that detail a screwball nature and too few scenes that depict the true reason why people will see this movieto see a dog play footballbr br the performances were also quite the embarrassment i liked gregory harrison and robert costanzos presentations but the overall acting grade would be equivalent to a d kevin zegers and cynthia stevenson were absolutely patheticbr br there were a few hilarious moments near the end by a couple of football announcers but that isnt even worth mentioning will children enjoy this movie perhaps but even they will grow weary when the heart felt discussions become too long and deep they will most certainly complain that the dog didnt get enough screen time in and loath over the fast changing script and protest against the boring performances and argue that this movie is trash in comparison the origami al air bud as i didbr br i suppose that they will think the dog is adorable
