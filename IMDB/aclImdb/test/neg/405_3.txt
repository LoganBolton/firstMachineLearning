36100 this is not to be confused with the decent arachnophobia this film is a very low budget and cheap ripoff of that movie this one is so bad it actually does have some entertainment value on that level there are numerous unintended i think laugh out loud scenes i wasnt expecting much from the film and it was actually worse than i had imagined it would bebr br its a clich√© ridden and predictable direct to video mess fortunately it doesnt take itself too seriously the acting as expected is not quite oscar caliber the special effects are poor worse than i would have thought they would be poorly edited and the score is intrusive
