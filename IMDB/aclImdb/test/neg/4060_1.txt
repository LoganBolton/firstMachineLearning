warning some spoilers included though it is a documentarybr br i bought this documentary because i like the work of the directors da pennebaker and chris hegedus which includes moon over broadway startupcom and the war room all terrific documentaries i would highly recommend watching this ultimately boring and uninsightful account from depeche modes 1988 tour i realized they had nothing to work with when they went to edit this film together the band members were certainly less than forthcoming oncamera hence undoubtedly the contest to add fans on a oneweek bus trip was added to liven things up a bit really now i mean cmon who thought a concert film of a synthpop band with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea granted i like depeche modes music and martin gore writes good melodies but seeing them in concert never seemed like it would be interesting and this movie is proof positive unless you are a huge fan of depeche mode stay away from this documentaryits a complete waste of time
