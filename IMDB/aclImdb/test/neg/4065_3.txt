i have seen three other movies that are worse than this one plan 9 from outerspace side hackers and the dreaded blair witch project there are so many technical errors in this movie that regardless of a decent plot the movie just isnt believablebr br lets start with an amtrak train with no skirts or handrails between cars the killer walks up behind his victim as she moves from car to car and just pushes her off the trainbr br in one scene a killer sneaks into a womans apartment he wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her so what does he do he turns up her stereo if i heard my stereo suddenly get louder id be concerned he kills the women by throwing an electric hair curler into the tub i was amazed to see that an electric hair curler with a five foot cord could be tossed ten feet and remain plugged in plus the apartment looked modern enough to have ground fault outlets in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocutedbr br the boeing 747 is one of the most well known commercial airliners on the planet so this part really amazed me first the cockpit was not even close to a real 747 and second it wasnt on the top deck of the plane i watched in utter amazement as the pilot and copilot where was the flight engineer walked right past the spiral staircase and headed forward towards the nose of the airplanebr br i was also amazed that bullets wouldnt penetrate an aluminum serving cart good thing for our hero or bathroom doors but would penetrate the ceiling causing a fuel leak that exited through a small hole in the fuselage huh watching three guys lengthen a runway by 100 yards in less than a week was pretty amazing as wellbr br i didnt check was this a movie of the week or something it was terrible
