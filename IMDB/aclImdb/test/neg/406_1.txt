i picked this up because having spent time in the albany region of new york i knew a couple of people in the movie and i happened upon it by chance the attempts at comedy are lame the compulsory girlongirl scene is sickening the plot is nonexistent the acting is among the worst ive ever seen and dont even get me started on special effects i realize this is a very low budget film made by a small independent company but if youre going to do a scifi horror flick with giant bugs dont make the giant bugs completely unbelievable people want to see giant bugs thats half the fun right there and if youre going to make the giant bugs completely unbelievable at least get the actors to make some sort of tongueincheek allusion to that fact you idiots these arent them youve captured their stunt doubles be prepared to waste two hours of your life that youll never be able to get back
