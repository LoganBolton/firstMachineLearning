aghhhhhh what a disappointment a perfectly good hunk like antonio sabato jr and nothing but embarrassing drivel coming out of his mouth i cringed at 95 of the dialog it would have been better to have made the character a mute how antonio sabato and michael pare could speak those lines without losing control of some bodily function is beyond me if michale pares character prefaced or ended just one more sentence with the word men i think i would have thrown the iron through the tv set i love to multitask  especially to get through bad movies must have been a lean year for both of them to sign up for this movie washing cars for a living would probably look pretty good to them by now and the bad guyif he was so bad why didnt he just shoot all those rich college kids instead of promising toilet breaks even the title was a misnomer a crash landing means the plane actually crashes and doesnt just land without even a token fire or anyone being injured instead of landing safely the plane should have crashed and burned just like the scriptbr br this movie is a stinker
