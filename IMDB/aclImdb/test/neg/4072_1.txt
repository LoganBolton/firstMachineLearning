this movie is so bad its worth seeing this movie will have viewers lapsing in and out of a coma within the first 10 minutes it all started when a bunch of writers came up with the idea of a jetliner being hijacked and a passenger who can fly a small plane has to land the beast however they know its been done before many times so to make it different lets do it very badly major masters has his name pirated from 80s movie to live and die in la from character played by willem dafoe that saved 10 minutes in writing and production time the plane is supposed to be a boieng 747 that plane has a unique silhouette even in the dark with its characteristic forward hump on the top just ask the late ronald reagan who lamented this point when them ruskies shot down kal 007 in the eighties yet when the plane takes off its clearly not a 747 looks more like a 767 this well researched film also forgets to include the engineers seat in the cockpit and replaces it with two comfy rumble seats no need for a flight engineer on this complex plane heroine is played by perpetually pouting gloria lynn berg after tying up the hijacker despite several busloads of people on this jumbo jet nobody bothers to watch this guy who almost killed all of them hes just forced to amuse himselfbr br the crippled plane leaking fuel from all the hijacking shenanigans wont make it back to hawaii so masters will try to land at an air force base located on an island only the runways 300 feet too short four army guys with little bobcats the kind you rent to take all day moving a load of horse manure to the back of your barn are gonna clear a 200 foot wide and 300 foot long swath through the jungle in 20 minutes no need for a bulldozer here where can you find guys like this these guys could make a highway between los angeles and las vegas in 3 hours equipped only with tablespoons a compass and a duckbr br after that hellish obstacle is fixed masters will try to land the plane as heroine pouts away hijacker giggles to himself and unsupervised gets free to make more trouble he is finally subdued in a most retarded manner that i cant tell you but can you say moby dickbr br there are so many retarded scenes in this movie the wounded captain is parked prone on the bar on the plane while masters who supposedly can barely fly puts the plane into 60 degree banks and 20000 feet per minute drops the pilot should be french kissing the ceiling during these challenging stunts but doesnt budge an inch br br i think that if they had picked different actors to play the parts this moving could have been way better if we need a pouting heroine in the movie why not pick better known actress bernadette peters who seems to be perpetually pouting as well besides she can sing and the busty well aging peters could feature some gratuitous cleavage shots now with the singing angle this could be a hijacking lets land the plane movie musical cast luciano pavarotti as the pilot they can sing a duet in the cockpit prior to the hijacking and theres no way that tubby tenor would fly up to the ceiling as masters works his magic on that big bird in keeping with the musical theme masters could then be played by andrei bocelli that peters can sing with as he lands the plane not only is he totally blind but only knows a couple of words of english now thats a plot think of the edge of your seat conversation between masters bocelli and the air traffic controllerbr br atc sir please throttle back to 180 flaps set to 25 degrees maintain 230 headingbr br bocelli whatbr br atc sir arm spoilers now confirm brake pressure at 250 psi maintain descent at 500 fpmbr br bocelli whatbr br the hijacker could have been played by the late great rodney dangerfield who can spew a plethora of his one liners as he sits tied up and unguarded i get no respect my wife is into group sex yeah she screwed me in front of the judge and jury get the ideabr br missed opportunities the movie has your standard crying and moaning passengers that are never developed woody allen could have been at the back offering one of his neurotic monologues she said i was great in bed i told her i practice myself a lot now this is a moviebr br also according to similar movie executive decision where lazy eyed steven segal is mercifully killed at the start giving that movie a chance 747s have massive attics up top the plane was introduced in 1969 so who knows what has accumulated in almost 40 years up there my uncle has old clothes a sled magazines and all sorts of stuff in his wouldnt it have been cool if masters opened the trap door and saw a teary eyed chevy chase in a womans housecoat watching old super 8 movies of his childhood just a recommendationbr br so give it a chance and as u lapse in and out of consciousness imagine how great this movie could have been if i had my hand in it
