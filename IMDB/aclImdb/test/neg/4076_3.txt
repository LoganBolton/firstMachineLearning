if youre not a fan of the 80s and you need to be a particularly strong fan or of one of the two leads theres nothing about this film to recommendbr br the story as others have said is dull almost an afterthought to the basic notion of the characters and the idea of making a slightly manic comedy i watched it to about an hour hoping it would turn a corner a twist would occur or it would somehow kick into gear but no its not unwatchable its just dull it goes by it goes by with bits of running around madly lingering shots of feet at strange angles bits of shouting madly but i didnt get a real feel of energy or manic fun it just came across as forced needless to say also there was nothing to laugh at particularly a bit of mild amusement here or there but nothing morebr br dont be fooled by the mention of feminism by the way all it means in this case is that almost all the principal cast is female if anything its actually cloying two female leads fine excellent the drug dealer is female okay their landlord is a landlady alright their friends are female okay the only other person we particularly see who lives in the same building oh female i wasnt on the lookout for that but after a while it felt like a conscious decision had been made to have the film cast that way and it felt again a bit forced and cloyingbr br on the plusside if you are a fan of 80s fashions and culture there is plenty to see and if youre a fan of helen slater shes fun and enjoyable to watch theres also some screentime for carol kane which is great but not enoughbr br overall 310 if youre a huge fan of the 80s helen slater and carol kane you could maybe stretch it to a 5 because of them although theres still the fact its a comedy which isnt funny which hinders it substantially if youre not a fan of those things you might as well make it 0 because theres nothing much else to enjoy here
