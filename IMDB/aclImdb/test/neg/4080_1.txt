was this supposed to be funny this is one of those films that just doesnt work the first one bruce almighty with jim carey had some very funny moments this one had nonebr br steve carrell who was brilliant in bruce almighty fails to deliver here his performance is very ordinary and he cant carry it off like carey didbr br the one good thing about this is i only paid 195 to rent it its a movie for childrenvery young children who have only seen about 4 films or so in their short livesbr br its interesting to note that where jim carey stars in a film and they make a sequel without him that its usually a huge turkey anyone remember son of mask imdb worst 100 films of all time avoid this one movie lovers
