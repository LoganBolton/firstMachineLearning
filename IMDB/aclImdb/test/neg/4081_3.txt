evan almighty continues the mainstream bruce almighty franchise this time with newsman turned freshman congressman from buffalo evan baxter steve carell at its center a wholly innocuous and not even really selfdoubting man god morgan freeman decides to enforce some sort of quest upon baxter in order to illustrate the importance of reciprocal kindness so that baxter can change the world aka pay it forwardbr br think of evan almighty as a wholesome derivative of distinguished gentlemen baxter is not a con but his colleague congressman long john goodman wants his unquestioned support on a bill that essentially is harmful to the environment and wellmeaning baxter knowing the importance of networking and visibility is willing to support him br br in addition with the new job comes more responsibility and baxter is in a sense vilified for not spending enough time with his family br br so god decides to give evan baxter some guidance by forcing him to become the modern day noah his orders build an ark except while it may be mildly humorous to see baxters transformation to the weirdo with a beardo there doesnt seem to be much point to this whole thing which becomes abundantly clearer when the climax of the film fizzles spoilers if none of the population is killed by the flood then what was the point of summoning the animals or at least the ones that obviously werent from suburban virginia or more importantly if all baxter had to realize was that longs projects faltered in their quality then why did he have to build an arkbr br so although a comedy like this neednt be a hysterical laughriot it was certainly one made far less enjoyable as it was crammed with far too many homilies and not all from morgan freeman and action that seemed intended for a film of more epic events
