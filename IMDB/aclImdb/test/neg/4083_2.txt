oh mr carell how far youve fallen after a glowing moment in little miss sunshine steve carells choice of films is beginning to contrast starkly with what has come since although the 40 year old virgin was entertaining it was dwarfed by his sunshine character hoping to find something thatd get me to spew popcorn from my nose i decided to rent evan almighty and see what possible guffaws might await me here not muchbr br given the trite and clich√©d script the entire film felt forced and unemotional poking a bit of fun at flagging family values and the current us administrations take on the environment evan almighty also tries to put a profound biblical moment into humorous terms but fails miserablybr br nearly every person on earth knows the story of noah and the ark gods wrath was sent down with 30 days and nights of rain which flooded the entire planet while noah his family and two of each of his creatures on earth rode out the wetness in relative comfort via the gopher wood ark it was a huge moment in human history if you believe the biblical textbr br so why would god appear to one man and ask him to build an ark that would only carry the worlds animals for a few minutes after a dam break the simple answer is that he never would too much emphasis was given to us government policy and not enough on world events making evan almighty a terribly myopic and americentric film although designed as a comedy it really never reaches anything approaching belly laughs maybe a few grunts and a smile but little elsebr br john goodman cars pulls in another forced performance as the despicable congressman chuck long whos only goals are to create development opportunities on protected national land holdings even the strong presence of morgan freeman 10 items of less as god cant help mop up this soaking wet disasterofafilmbr br the only funny moments are between carell and the animals especially as evan learns what animal magnetism is really like birds literally flock to him sheep herd around him lions take pride in being near him please forgive the punsbr br the special effects were fun to watch but were brief with good reason the flood was interesting in that the ark was obviously guided by his hand and shoved in just the right directionbr br but other than that youre in for little more than an insult to common sense and intellect
