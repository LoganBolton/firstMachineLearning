this certainly isnt a comedy  i dont know what it was marketed that way as a serious movie it lacks any sort of substance unless youre fresh out of sunday school or needing your noah fix youll find yourself bored to tearsbr br the supporting cast took away from what little of the movie was left lauren graham plays an empty housewife with no real depth his children dont really add anything to the movie they seem to be around solely to brood about their absent father at the beginning jonah hill plays a creepy internet addict that doesnt come off as humorous br br i found the original to be a decent movie disappointed that this one didnt really go anywhere
