the only redeeming feature of this movie is steve carell like john wayne ive never seen steve carell stretch too far as an actor but it doesnt matter he always plays his one role perfectlybr br as marty feldman once said comedy must have internal consistency you can have 4 men on stage sitting in garbage cans and thats fine but if you bring a fifth man on stage who isnt in a garbage can you must then explain to the audience why he is not also in a garbage canbr br why doesnt evan accept his role as a messenger of god why when he does accept it is he so profoundly embarrassed by it why isnt anyone more impressed with the way that animals follow evan around they are explained away by the unthinking doubters as trained animals possibly from a circus theres a terrible flood at the end and most everyone we see hops on the ark and is saved but surely thousands of people would have been killed by the flood there is no postdisaster emotional atmosphere at the end instead most of congress has finally seen the light and is about to prosecute the lone incorrigibly bad congressman for profiteeringbr br i gotta admit i also liked the fish in the aquarium reacting to the presence of evan
