this movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general it was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message but the message was a cliché hopeless mess to begin with this movie falls on shameless environmental point even making a selfrighteous point of destroying an suv and promoting animal planetbr br in sitting through this i couldnt help but notice that steve carell got no more than a single truly funny line the only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to wanda sykes her character gets frequent cringeworthy lines where they absolutely do not fitbr br far from the brilliance of bruce almighty evan almighty blows its whole recordbreaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot the movie spends the first half building up to the construction of evans ark but by the end we learn that the ark was completely meaningless and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages the movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark flood and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than god yes god was trying to influence politics
