the biggest problem with this film is that its nothing like bruce allmighty the first film played upon every daydreamers fantasy of being able to control ones surroundings as one sees fit evans experience though is entirely different he has none of the control that jim carrey fools around with and instead the story centers around the power of belief now this would have been fine since the first film was preaching the same message the problem is that the sequel does its preaching at the expense of the comic relief and to add insult to injury it also throws in politics into the plot you get the distinct feeling that there is a clear message with this film and its main objective is not to make you laugh to sum things up this movie is failed mixture of eddie murhphys the distinguished gentleman and charlton hestons the ten commandments im not sure if steve carrell is at fault here you get a sense that its his character that limits his abilities as a comedian the former news anchor evan baxter is not supposed to be funny hes basically an antagonist made into a protagonist which in this case only adds to the confusion of what this movies message is supposed to be about
