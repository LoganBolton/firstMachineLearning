this was a flick doomed from its conception the very idea of it was lame  take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie i wasnt the least bit interested then came the trailer not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer its like a 3minute cliffs notes version of the flick so obviously i wasnt gonna pay to see it but once it hit dvd i thought sure ill watch it for free maybe steve carell can save itbr br nopebr br im still baffled as to why he signed on for this he must have owed someone a favor the jokes were all so flat and obvious and the director obviously asked him to go for very broad comedy style like the original bruce almightys jim carrey but its just not funny the studio obviously tried to cash in on the success of 40yearold virgin complete with several of carells past costars a reference to the flick on a theater marquee and another musical closing credits sequence but even the talented carrell cant save this his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted wanda sykes isnt wasted shes just a waste in anything she does and her horrible oneliners and reactions just make you wish people would stop giving her workbr br the story itself is just predictable and lazy it pounds you over the head with obvious foreshadowing like evans disregard for the environment drives a gasguzzling humvee opts to use wood from endangered trees for his house hates animals and by the end its just overthetop preachy on both faith and the environmentbr br why the movie was made at all is puzzling enough but i really dont understand how it reportedly became the most expensive comedy ever the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen maybe the rental of the live animals on set cost a fortune who knows but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure but hey it wasnt the worst film of the year by far theres still plenty of worse duds like norbit and death proof
