well for this abomination of a film i wasnt expecting anything good i find steve carell annoying and bruce almighty was pretty good but there is absolutely no reason for it to have a sequel somehow this film was even lower than my expectations even when i didnt have any br br does anyone remember the disney movie noah with tony danza well lets just say that evan almighty completely ripped it off in way too many ways for the movie to remain justifiable actually evan almighty was had the exact same plot outline as noah with the exception of a few technicalities it was nothing but a carbon copy of a farsuperior movie that was actually funny br br another thing did anyone get sick of wanda sykes stupid unfunny redundant oneliners that were literally in every single scene it was completely ridiculous and just dragged the movie down more and more br br despite the fact that i basically had already seen the film ten years earliernoah evan almighty has to be the most predictable movie ive ever seen i figured out the entire movie from beginning to end within the first five minutes and eventually realized that it was ripping off noah left and right br br in conclusion if youre a little bit unsure of whether or not you want to see evan almighty and are already sick of jonah hill playing the same role in every single movie hes in liked bruce almighty and dont want to see a predictable dry unfunny movie with steve carell trying to act like jim carrey then please dont see this piece of garbage
