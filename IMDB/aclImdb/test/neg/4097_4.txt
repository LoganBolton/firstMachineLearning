one hundred and seventy five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to spend on even the biggest summer blockbuster not even michael bay had a budget that big for transformers so exactly how universal pictures spent that much cash making evan almighty is a mystery they certainly didnt spend it on the script for one thing as the film is not so much a classic comedy as it is christian flag waving and bar one or two quiet chuckles youre most likely to spend the duration wondering where the budget went or why steve carrell felt the need to slum it in a decidedly average movie at the exact moment when his star profile has begun to risebr br a sequel to the jim carrey comedy bruce almighty this film sees former supporting character evan baxter carrell moving up the ladder into the main player slot the story opens with him leaving the news desk to become a public official and moving to washington with his wife and three generic sons slightly weird primary school moppet spirited middle schooler and sulky teenager evans bid to change the world through politics however gets a spanner in the works when god morgan freeman appears and asks him to build an arkbr br in other words its an updating of the old genesis story with evan fighting off cynicism and naysayers to build the immense boat unfortunately while the premise is reasonably promising it sadly does not provide many laughs theres a bit of fun to be had in the early going where evans straightlaced mp tries to juggle the demands of public service with the unwelcome packs of animals that follow him around and a beard that resists all attempts to shave it but as soon as he accepts his divine mission the film takes a nosedivebr br from this point on it turns into a message movie evan begins preaching with alarming regularity and morgan freeman keeps turning up to offer kind wisdom while gently prodding his chosen in the right direction without evans resistance though the only trace of comedy left comes in the form of a few rubbish animalfeces jokes and john michael higgins role as evans exasperated righthand man higgins may show the same rich comic potential that he did previously in arrested development but his enthusiasm cannot save the sinking vessel especially seeing as carrell has all but placed his formidable improv skills on the backburnerbr br in some respects its slightly similar to the passion of the christ but unlike mel gibsons movie which encouraged everyone to believe in god through blood letting and guilt tripping evan almighty tries a more gentle approach the movie simply tells us that we should have faith in god because he has faith in us unfortunately this movie is just as likely to make you laugh as the passion is carrell is on autopilot the jokes dont exist and wanda sykes makes a bid to become the most annoying person on the planet it might be sweet but somebody just tossed 175 000 000 overboard
