although i enjoy steve carrells work evan the almighty like so many other overdone films turned out to be a lot worse than i hoped it would bebr br this turned out to be a cheesy family movie the kind that employ famous comedian to improve their image but ultimately fail to deliverbr br the usual carells dorky humour is almost absent from the movie and though he did make me chuckle a few times there was nothing hilarious about him in evan the almightybr br his 3 kids although were probably somehow important for a biblical character were really quite useless in the movie and terrible actors even his wife was somewhat of a third leg for such a simple storylinebr br spending so much money on making a comedy was a huge mistake although carells career might profit from this movie theres no real reason to go see itbr br if only there was a little less of his family a little more of carell molly shannon and maybe some other snl cast it could have actually been a lot more entertainingbr br 410 for a few chuckles here and there
