i bought this on vhs as terror hospital and when i got home i checked imdb and was like omg its the legendary nurse sherri so heres another one from al adamson who had clearly learned some minuscule amount about filmmaking since the blood of draculas castle days where that earlier effort is a more or less totally sclerotic lump this one mixes it up a little adding a definite element of variety and surprise amid the incompetence sure half of the movie is a blind postop football player shooting the breeze with his stacked nurse but at any moment we might be cutting away to the cackling disembodied head of the satanist mastermind or nurse sherri running a farmer through with a pitchfork or a wee bit of abstract studentfilm quick cutting to go with the pulsingblob effects in the possession scene or the most gratuitously halfhearted topless bit ever or god knows what else i forget to be honest as dumbass pieces of sht go this one runs toward the high end congrats al
