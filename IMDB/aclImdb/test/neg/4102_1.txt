i generally wont review movies i havent seen in awhile so ill pop them in or rent them to give a full and fresh take on the film in the case of a sound of thunder i remembered my vow of never seeing this movie ever again so ill just go on memory in fact i havent thought of how badly made this movie was until i read someone elses review and remembered the experience i had back in 2005 when i actually saw this in the theater my movie buddy forced me to see it though i wasnt interested and wow later on i forced him to see basic instinct 2 in the theater reminding him he made me see this crap so i guess that made us even i certainly had my share of deep laughs at the movies expense of course which didnt make him happy as he really wanted to see it the timetravelbutterfly effect film had so many bad graphics the loudest chuckles from me was whenever they showed the dinosaur god i loved seeing that dino and them actually being scared of it Â– it was hilarious or just simply ben kingsley its great kingsley can remind us on how human actors can be going from gandhi and schindlers list to uh this even a meryl streep can do a shedevil from time to time so theyre forgiven for months i pulled an mst3k with my buddy consistently referencing this movie to any lowrent scifi film or kingsley flick yes the movie would be a great movie to see drunk or otherwise inebriated horrible overthetop acting special fx that even the nintendo64 would turn away and ridiculous plot twists the biggest disappointment was that the razzies didnt even nominate this film for any award
