this movie was really bad plain and simple how a movie like this gets wide release is a wonder to mebr br its a decent idea but it just didnt flesh out edward burns is a decent actor though i liked his small role in saving private ryanbr br lets get down to the big issue herebr br the visuals were so incredibly bad i thought i was watching an old dinosaurs in 3d cdrom pointandclick adventure demo on windows 31 i mean ive seen cutscenes in console games from pre2000 that have better looking dinosaurs than this i mean heck the original tomb raider trex looked better than this onebr br the lizardmonkeys were laughable i thought they were some sort of ripoff creation from killer instinct ive seen better sockpuppet monsters now that i think about itbr br you know theres a ton of madefortv movies that are better than this how does a gem like scifi channels the shining get such a small audience but this load of cgi easy to make 4 kidz gets put out in the open i dont care if its a ray bradbury story lameeeee
