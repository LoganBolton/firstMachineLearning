yeah sure the movie its visuals already did looked horrible and not very promising but the premise and the cast looked good so i still sort of expected to be entertained by this movie this however unfortunately wasnt the case the premise is good but the story is filled with improbabilities and is logically flawedbr br this movie is potential flushed down the toilet the main plot is interesting and somewhat original its good enough to make a good adventurous movie out of would you think this movie however fails to entertain and i think that that is this movie biggest flaw perhaps it takes itself too serious and a little bit more humor certainly wouldnt had done the movie any harm instead it now is nothing more than a lame and cheap looking movie filled with the one unlikely event after the other that also steals a bit too much from other more successful movies mainely jurassic park obviouslybr br the characters also dont help to make the movie any more compelling or at least interesting to watch i still think that edward burns did a fairly decent job as the heroic main lead the rest of the characters however really get muddled in into the movie and they get very little interesting to do the movie rather relies on its visual which are extremely poor catherine mccormack also plays a very irritating character basically all her character does is complain and talk about how right she was and the rest oh so wrong her character just isnt a likable one and the rest of the characterswell i already have forgotten their names i think that that is saying enough about them it certainly is true though that ben kingsleys performance alone makes this movie worth watching he is really excellent in his sort of villainous businessman role but from the moment when he disappears out of the movie the movie really goes downhill rapidlybr br visually the movie is extremely poor it has some dreadful looking cgi effects and they couldnt even get the more simple bluescreen effects look convincing in the movie the sets are also awful and cheap looking like they can fall over and break down every momentbr br the movie never gets tense exciting or adventurous since the story is brought in the least interesting and engaging way possible its a very distant movie with distant characters that fails to impress there are plenty of action sequences but all of them are so ridicules looking and far from believable that they never get tense or good enoughbr br so basically this movie is lacking in everything that is needed to make a genre movie like this one a good and successful one its sad to see how low director peter hyams has sunk to the last couple of years after making some good movies in the 70s and 80sbr br 410
