a complete zero out of four one worst sums up ajooba awful actually more words come to mind ridiculous thirdrate and terrible this is one of amitabhs worst movies ever he prances around in a cheap leather jacket and equally cheap tinsel foil zorrostyle mask with what appears to be wings on the sidesbr br the movie is set in ancient persia or arabia and is characteristically unhistorical for an indian movie as stated above a leather jacket from kmart with velcro straps did not exist 400 years ago unless all my history teachers were wrongbr br rishi also does his patented crossdressing in this movie far from being funny it is very embarassing to watch what could possess the son of the legendary raj kapoor to flay the memory of his house like this on screenbr br on the plus side if you want a real laugh go ahead and watch this film the glaring inconsistencies in the plot and costumes are no match for the awful dialogues and shoddy acting
