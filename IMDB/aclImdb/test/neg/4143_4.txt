i wanted to dog this movie but somehow i cant find it in myself to do thatbr br exhibiting a duality of fighting styles its li vs li in a somewhat decent battle for supremacybr br this is one of those movies where the story carries the performances lis acting is extremely amateurish hesitant and stiff for most of this movieright up to the very end at first i tricked myself into believing he was just doing that for one of his two characters you know to show a difference in personalities but it appeared to be inexperience or a lack of talent it did get a bit better more relaxed toward the end but that wasnt enough to save his performance jet lis acting does improve as his career moves forward i dont hate his acting i just hated him in thisbr br i also have to say that the effects were very b class effects what effects there arebr br the story itself had great potential it was uniquely creative daring and fresh unfortunately either the budget was not ample enough to accommodate better lighting effects film quality and some acting lessons or the director just did not care enough to bother with these little details he also did not bother with the science in the sciencefiction a fact which was a great detractor to this filmbr br the fight sequences were a bit one sided as he seemed to give more to one character and little to the other but all in all the story line made for a very enjoyable attemptbr br as enjoyable as this was i couldnt help but think all the way through that this was just one of those movies that you cant help but watch it for what it shouldve been rather than what it isbr br it rates a 6010 on the b scalebr br thats a 4210 on the a scale for having a good plot frombr br the fiend
