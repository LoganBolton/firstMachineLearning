i really wanted to like this movie because i love troma and loved the trailer and loved ghouls another of ferrins films it did have some almostgood moments like the oldies love song playing over the car crash scene and a scene near the end where the protagonist gets some closure but on the whole it was just boring and mildly unpleasantbr br the unimaginable shocks that ferrin came up with were really predictable and wornout poop murdering prostitutes incest could have still been good but poorly done unsure whether it was trying to offend amuse or both ultimately did neitherbr br in conclusion we watch troma movies because we want films with heart this film did not consistently feel like it had heart there were some good scenes but ultimately it was dull and unpleasant
