an epic story of hope constrained by budget and limited artistic ambition seeing as terrence malick produced this i expected something haunting and lyrical instead we get a typical norwegian coproduction revolution with al pacino anyone where  quite possibly  good intentions are scuppered by a dreadful screenplay and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes the metarzanyoujane english dialogue between the nonenglishspeaking protagonists is particularly cringeworthy Â– one could speculate whether nick nolte and tim roth adlibbed their own as they almost sound like real people the story is loaded with implausibility we are expected to believe that binh can speak a smattering of english after having spent his entire life living as a peasant slave his vocabulary but unfortunately not grammatical command increases impressively in the malayan refugee camp without the benefit of night classes coincidence is rife i wonder whether an hour or two has been edited from the first third he tracks down his mother in ho chi minh city almost immediately  after bumping into his thirty year younger half brother who nonchalantly recognises him mum gives him a gold locket or something similar of great value as they part but this is never referred to again his relationship with me dead inside ling is supposed to provide the obligatory love interest but feels as artificial as leonardo and cameron in gangs of new york br br the voyage in the rust bucket of a boat does convey a sense of the appalling conditions that human trafficking entails indeed the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable is the jerky handheld footage shot from the bridge during choppy weather conditions incidentally a boat cruise from malaysia to new york via the cape of good hope and the african coast without stopping for fuel or supplies is certainly an epic journey the beautiful shot of the new york skyline echoes malicks use of magic hour but i want to know why the coast guard didnt show up perhaps they were watching the super bowl or something of course binh manages to track down his blind old dad on a remote farm in texas with the same navigational flair he displayed in ho chi minh city i was impressed at how nick nolte could wander around digging fields and feeding horses on a large ranch without the aid of a guide dog or white stick for demonstration of how a story about the travails befalling refugees could be structured and shot on a small budget check out michael winterbottoms far superior in this world
