there is nothing worse than science fiction crafted by folks who dont have a feel for it grasping at a concept which wouldnt be so terrible by itself a future where cloning is common enough that it is necessary to make it a crime for you to breed with someone too close to you genetically the screenwriter proceeded to allow his illsuited imagination to run wildbr br when tim robbins character was able to guess a security guards computer password simply by getting her to tell him one thing about herself i knew i was in for trouble this ability was later revealed to be due to robbins having taken an empathy virus viruses being used to grant instant or nearly instant skill upgrades to their users robbins love interest complained about her own experience with such a virus  a mandarin chinese language virus which allowed her to speak chinese but as she complained she couldnt understand what she was saying okay first off empathy no matter how intense isnt esp without incorporating some sort of true mindreading aspect like an empathy virus which actively releases virions into the vicinity infects nearby people picks up bits of their memory then departs for the original host  which is as you can probably tell a smidgeon on the impractical side you cant justify being able to determine a specific detail like someones password just by listening to the things you didnt say nor can you acquire the ability to speak a language without understanding what youre saying  the virus cant infect your vocal cords and translate for you on the fly because a virus cant think to give you the power to speak chinese such a learning virus would have to modify your brain it would have to encode the knowledge among neurons and once its in there its yours  you certainly understand what youre saying because you have to to use your own brain to perform a task you must understand that task for the most part unless of course they movie is suggesting that the virus was deliberately designed to put in place some bizarre multiplepersonality mental schism where some subpersonae of yours functions as a builtin oneway translatorbr br the m√©lange of languages spoken by the characters is decent enough although nowhere near remarkable enough to warrant all the love other reviewers have given whats more all the multicultural insertions in the world cant make up for a simple frustrating fact the dialog stinks its slow its plodding and its unnatural again im sure adherents have convinced themselves that the dull strangeness is simply the result of an inspired genius creating a truly futuristic and therefore subjected to linguistic drift form of speech i disagree good dialog is good dialog in any era  and the same goes for tripebr br lastly ill revisit the central concept of the movie  the banning of sex with yourself widespread cloning is a nice classic scifi topic so is global warming leading to ecological devastation which code 46 also incorporates unfortunately the two dont go together if you have an ecological disaster cutting down severely on the available living area you dont run around cloning people you have population problems enough as it is  you dont add to them by cranking out reissues regular oldfashioned sexandbirth provides all the population you need and cloning of any sort would be ruthlessly suppressedbr br to be fair the movie wasnt all bad it had some nice cinematography perhaps if i had watched it muted i couldve enjoyed it
