if you are a weirdo who thinks its romantic and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is the genetic equivalent of your mother get her pregnant and then have sex with her again once shes had an abortion and not tell her that she is related to you then you would like this moviebr br nevermind the fact that the guy is married and has a son at home  it makes it even more disgusting and deplorable that he has no conscience as to what hes doing he cant do right by his job his family or maria hes a loser there is nothing romantic or positive about this movie  it is vile and incestuousbr br it moves slowly and it leads nowhere for over the first half of the movie i couldnt even finish watching this pathetic excuse for a romance im glad we didnt waste our money in the movie theater on this one 010
