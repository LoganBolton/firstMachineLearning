the film disappointed me for many reasons first of all the depiction of a future which seemed at first realistic to me was wellbuilt but did only feature a marginal role then the story itself was a weak copy of lost in translation the middleeastern setting man with family meets new girl overseas karaoke bar the camera movements and the imagery  all that was a very bad imitation of the excellent lost in translation which had also credibility this movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural it is not i wonder why tim robbins even considered doing this film the female main actress is awful  did she play the precog in minority report and why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this lost in translation didnt have to show excessive love scenes rrated just for this this movie isnt even worth watching it from a videostore
