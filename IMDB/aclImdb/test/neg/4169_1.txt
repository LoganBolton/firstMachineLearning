bad dialog slow story scenes that drag on and are absolutely pointless i cant believe this much money was invested in such a poorly written film the directing and acting couldnt save this bomb eitherbr br 50 through the movie and youre still waiting for it to start they lay the foundation with the opening preface and then spend the next 40 minutes setting up nothing you watch 40 minutes of footage that is absolutely directionless in an attempt to do what i have no ideabr br much of this film is like watching a really bad french movie where nothing ever happens and the characters are just sort of dull lifeless and egocentrics living without purpose or carebr br avoid this film at all cost anyone that recommends it is setting you up for disappointment and you will undoubtedly question their taste and depth
