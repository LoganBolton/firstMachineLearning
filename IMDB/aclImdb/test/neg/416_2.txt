ron howard and his editors only had one job to do follow the guidelines of the book which was rich mysterious moving and highly cinematic in its approach br br what they did they changed everything and i mean everything what is left is something that has no right being called angels  daemons br br i really love the book and find it very hard to see it being treated this waybr br i wonder what was the opinion of dan brown himself for this filmbr br i really have no patience to sit down and right the 1000000 changes they made it is pointless
