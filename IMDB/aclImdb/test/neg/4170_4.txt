code 46 is one of those scifi movies where the government controls who you are allowed to love and in fact will punish you if you try to procreate with the wrong person the haves and the havenots live in completely separate territories the powers that be can remove your memories etc weve seen this stuff before but thats ok no movie is 100 original this kind of premise is always fun to contemplate unfortunately just imagining such a future is more interesting than actually watching code 46 the characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting maybe thats commentary on a dehumanized future but its still dull to watch its sloooowbr br at times the imagery is nice but usually coupled with its evocative soundtrack just looks like a glorified perfume commercial code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of television camerawork that i find annoying you know two characters talk as the camera artlessly floats on one side two seconds later its floating on the other side of them in a vain attempt to keep your attentionbr br my friends liked this movie if they tried to get me to watch it again i probably would not do so unless they agreed to pay me 50
