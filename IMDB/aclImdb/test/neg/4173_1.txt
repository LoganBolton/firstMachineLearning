what can be said about this truly one of the most mindnumbing experiences of my life your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way i mean this in a terrible way a terrible waybr br this film has no redeeming features everything is appalling artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie lots of corn lots of mud the story is beyond stupid the script iswas there a script the villain is severely unscary and wears yellow wellington boots the kids are annoying the lead man is charismafree and it has the audacity to go on for 100 minutes utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture normally such a statement would be an exaggeration meant for comical effect not in this case ill even say it again  this is torturebr br at the end i was in a state of paralysis this was brief thankfully but once i recovered i decided i had to watch the making of featurette i had to understand maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity was it all an elaborate joke i watched the first 2 minutes of the making of featurette and discovered that the writerdirector was to put it mildly somewhat misguided i also discovered that because i had taken time out to watch the first two minutes of the making of featurette of dark harvest 2 that i was an idiot not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery life sucksbr br highly unrecommended
