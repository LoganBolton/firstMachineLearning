if you are looking for the feelgood hit of the summer dark harvest 2 might just be your ticket the production values of this movie are extremely high looks as if it were filmed with a sony handicam and edited using imovie especially the sound effects  they sound straight off of a spooky halloween sounds cd the scarecrow from the cover although he doesnt appear in the movie and otherwise has no relevance is terrifyingly realistic from beginning to end youll watch as a man aimlessly searches for his daughters through a pun intended maize at the climactic ending of the movie youll see wellyoull have to watch for yourselfbr br what im really trying to say here is dont come within 1000 yards of this movie i rented it because i thought it would be a campy sort of troll 2 funny but its not i cried after i watched this movie because i realized i had spent money on it and i found the 4 i spent on renting it i actually fell asleep for 20 minutes and still knew what was going on
