the first dh wasnt that great but i really didnt expect it to be but this horrible movie was just beyond criticism i really try to look on the bright side and give movies like this a chance but i just could not find a real good thing about this one i appreciate what bill cowell was trying to do but this movie was just soooooo boring the story of the movie really isnt that bad in fact its somewhat original but the movie form is really as bad as a lot of people say in my opinion this one ranks right up there with the off season and dracula 3000 i know a lot of people really trash and put down movies like this but i really cant think of any other good things to say about it
