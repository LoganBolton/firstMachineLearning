thisthing oh god this thing i cant even call it a movie a movie is something that does something goes somewhere has some semblance of a plot or something i dont know how im doing it i really dont first i say dark fields is the worst movie ever and i thought it was then pirates of ghost island proved me wrong and now third time in a row another film goes above and beyond the call of duty to prove me wrongbr br sighs ok dark harvest ii the maize lord this is awful let me break it down for you man senses daughters are in danger through some magical psychic powers he got from his act ii popcorn apparently and races to find them in a corn field of course this is the hugest cornfield in all of existence being the size of the cornfields from jeepers creepers children of the corn and signs combined the main character whose name is shy awesome name btw then runs through a corn fieldfinds some ghost girls talks to them andruns through a corn field digs a whileand runs through a corn field and the incredibly sad thing im really not leaving anything out that pretty much is the entire movie the only thing i may be leaving out is how he gets chased by two policemen who want to arrest him for i dont know pretending to be an actor i didnt care by this point he gets away and the police are somethinged by the killer offscreen holy crap theres a killer apparently yes there is as hes introduced nearly 45 into the movie but wait then he runs away for a while and theres you guessed it more running through the corn field and digging then theres the ending where he saves his daughters huzzahbr br the biggest problem with this movie is its boring its incredibly inhumanly tremendously boring i cant explain how atrociously dull this thing is nothing happens the characters are as appealing as a root canal and its just an hour and a half of nothing the only good thing that came out of this movie was that me and my friend may have found enlightenment due to the near nirvana state this movie put us into after the effects of the drugs in our brain had to kick into overdrive to keep us alive during the ensuing insanity i found hugging a wall much more enjoyable and my friend found a new passion for laughing hysterically while flopping all over the floor as if he having a seizure this is the sort of insanity this movie brings its not just bad its bad for your health the cover looks awesome with a picture of an awesome scarecrow killer that i would totally consider dressing up as for a horror con but this was the most misleading box ever dont let it fool you too do not watch this movie watch a better corn movie any movie about corn is better just dont let it get you dont a 0 out of 10
