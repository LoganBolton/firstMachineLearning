this movie was horrendous it was sorta like accidentally watching a gay porn waiting for the girls but they just dont comei waited for almost 2 hours for the damn scarecrowsthey just dont comeinstead its just some dumb ass wandering through a dead cornfield with a camera its a mix of blaire witch and some bad episode of the twilight zone and the best part is that as of october 23 2005 they started filming a sequel please dont be fooled by the box even though it looks exactly the same as the first dark harvest its not lions gate bought the rights to the maizethe movie and had the brilliant idea to release it as the sequel to the original dark harvestwhich i thought was funnythe only thing they had in common was they were both shot in a cornfieldthis movie willllll not scare the crop out of you like the first one so just stay away
