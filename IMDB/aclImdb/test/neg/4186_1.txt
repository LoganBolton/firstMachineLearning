my friends and i have often joked about movies being in realtime but this movie really is they will literally show 4 minutes strait of nothing but a guy digging in the dirt with his hands it has noplot and an incredible amount of gratuitous screaming i honestly dont believe that it won an award for its alleged suspense if you are like me and saw the first film and loved it for its horrible acting accidentally hilarious one liners and allaround low budgetness it wont matter this is so bad its bad memories might even rub off and taint any good memories you have of the original you would be more entertained if you were staring at a blank screen
