my spoiler is in my pants because thinking about this movie made me so angry i crapped myselfbr br once you finish watching it you stare at the tv set in confusion and horror then theres a soft tap on your shoulder and a voice hisses you will die in seven days you turn around and one of your best friends is standing there with a look of absolute hatred for the one that suggested this movie when you were in blockbusterbr br i wont lie this is the worst movie on the face of the earth i saw it with 5 of my friends all 18yearold guys and these were our reactions one person actually began crying and punching himself one person screamed and passed out one person stood up and staggered out the front door to reappear more than an hour later one person simply blacked out this one was me one person started babbling incoherently as if he had both cerebral palsy and touretts syndrome one person went into a sort of catatonic trance and did not respond to our voices for more than twenty minutesbr br the movie really is that bad theres one part where the retarded cameraman actually trips while holding the camera but the producers decided to leave it in seriously you can hear him grunt and swear when he hits the ground theres only one special effect and its special in the same way that a retarded kid trying to solve a rubix cube is special the camera rotates so that the onscreen action action n some dumbass lost in a corn field for 80 freaking minutes does a barrel rollbr br under no circumstances should it be watched and the movie itself even warns you of this fact do you know what the tagline on the back is some warnings should not be ignored i honestly think that the release of this movie to the public is a sick practical joke on the producers part thats not to say however that you should pass it by if you see it at the movie store  it would then sit on the shelf for some other poor sucker to see rather buy every copy of it you can get your hands on and mail them to people that you hate
