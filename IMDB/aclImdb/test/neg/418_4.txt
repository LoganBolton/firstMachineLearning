why did they not follow the book  i am really sad and disappointed i was so looking forward to seeing this movie however if you have read the book maybe recently it might be very difficult to remain objective my wife had not read the book and she loved the moviebr br reasons for the disappointment are 1 cerns involvement  gone with the wind such a shame there is a very small part at the start where the antimatter is created but even that does not stick to the facts why not the fact that vittorias father was burned with the first illuminati brand which is how langdon got involved would have been a perfect start to the movie 2 storyline between the deceased pope and camerlegno completely gone  this completely screws up the motive for the stealing of the antimatter 3 storyline between langdon and vittoria vetra completely nonexistentbr br allinall too flaky storyline and cannot understand that dan brown allowed them to put his name against it maybe i should revisit this film in 10 years time when i cannot remember the excellent book anymore fat chance on forgetting the book i am afraidbr br really sorry for the negative review which was spoilt by expectations
