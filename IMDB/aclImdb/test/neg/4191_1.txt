only adding to the chorus of people who deemed this to be unredeemable i will state the following without repeating the obvious flaws plainly stated by some of the other commentators the film is shot on video what type of camera i dont know but the cameraman had it on autofocus all the time so that any slight movement makes it go in and out of focus in many of the scenes the actors themselves go out of focus for their scenes this alone screams amateurbr br i also noticed that out in the middle of the cornfield you can hear the sound of the gasoline generator that is powering the lights  loudlybr br also what is with that single lighting source that follows and many times leads the actors when they walk around it looks like a newscaster with that on camera light that follows the people around like a spotlight there was no credit for lighting designdp and i know why the filmmakers saw no need to have someone who actually knew what they were doing lighting this picture note i didnt say film so be prepared for a single glaring spotlight as the sole source of cinematic lighting for most of the movie ughhhbr br this is probably the most technically inept production ive ever seen commercially released i bought this title because i like bad cinema usually its so bad that you can laugh at it this is just so bad that its unwatchable plan nine from outer space is citizen kane in comparison to this title
