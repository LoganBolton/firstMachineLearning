completely agree with other reviewbr br i watched this movie for about 5 minutes i looked up the one review on another site and found that it wasnt even a real sequel this was after i slowly backed away from the tv with remote in hand jaw dropping lower and lower br br the quality of the filming is beyond low budget it doesnt even look like a freaking movie if i were watching home video footage from a documentary i would expect itbr br in summary avoid avoid avoid boooo lions gatebr br completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and i hope that ive saved others from renting or owning it
