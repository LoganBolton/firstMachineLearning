a guy with the unlikely name of shy walker looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half thats the entire plotwith acrosstheboard bad acting of course walker wanders around a corn maze maize i get it hahahanot funny and yells girls where are you about 1000 times for some reason whenever he runs by a pumpkin a chipmunksounding voice laughs as if the pumpkin is laughing at him yeah ok his daughters scream for most of the movieeven when there is no reason to scream maybe because they are still stuck in this awful movie twin girls straight out of the shining show up every now and then most of the corn maze looks the same so walkers search gets very old very quickly the filmmakers realize there is nothing going for this movie even the music is repetitive so they try to make things interesting by spinning the camera around really fast filming upside down inserting smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles using red lights to make the corn look scary and rotating the camera 360 degrees at least im assuming these were done intentionally but its likely just examples of incompetent filmmaking more often than not when walker is wandering through the maze you cant see his face i guess the kid holding the camera cant look up that high this movie gives you a new appreciation for the original dark harvest which doesnt have anything to do with this movie except for the fact it also features a cornfield dont be fooled by the r rating walker says the f word three times and now we have an rrated horror movie ugh the scarecrow on the cover doesnt even show up in this movieand when you are wishing that those cheesy scarecrows from the first movie would come back you know things are bad instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around unfortunately he is dressed similar to mr walker so i didnt even realize he was being followed for a while i figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before walker did the movie is almost over by the time he puts 2 and 2 together natch the end of the movie drags on and onand just in case it isnt slow enough theres some slowmotion the last sound you hear besides your own laughter is very poor sounddubbing in case you cant tell this is the worst movie ive ever seen at least they didnt end with the promise of another sequel
