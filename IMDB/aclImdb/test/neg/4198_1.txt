i rented dark harvest the first one because it looked like a cheesy monsteron thebox type of thrill ride scarecrows also freak me out the movie had an effective title sequence but what followed was pretty lame flat bad lighting acting editing direction recently i noticed that dh 2 the maize had a pretty extensive ad campaign i thought maybe the first one was marginally successful so they upped the ante on this one a bit possibly delivering some bigger budget scares and fx from the killer scarecrows well there are no scarecrows in the video not a problem the problems start in dh 2 with a title sequence that looks like an unfinished concept with strange shapes and bars wiping away titles and whatnot as far as the actual photography every time the sun shines in a shot youd have all these blown out whites confirming that youre watching some ultralow budget minidv project that some midwesterner filmed at his uncles farm the acting was not acting at all the cheap ripoff of the shining twin girls was below freshman film student standards the editing was extremely amateur and lazy the sound was jarring and choppy eg every time the editor would cut to a new shot youd here the sound change perspective with it its as if someone gathered their friends and family actors took a video camera out in a cornfield for three days put a light on top of it for the night sequences no joke  thats what they actually did burned through some tape stuck the footage in their computer cut a very rough version tossed in some music bypassed any imaginative sound work or mixing burned it directly to dvd and threw it on the video store shelf any horror fan should be insulted by this type of direct to video work that is void of any skill or style just because a person owns a video camera and is able to get somewhat of an image on tape doesnt mean it should be released to the public if i could give this a rating lower than a one i would
