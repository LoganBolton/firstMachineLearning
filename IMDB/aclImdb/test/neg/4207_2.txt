i caught this movie a few years ago one night and it was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen however since it is supposed to be an action movie i cannot give it more stars since the humor was unintentionalbr br chuck norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the road to see his family and within the first five minutes the conflict arises which leads chuck to seek vengeance for the rest of the film good thing too cuz the subpar acting by everyone involved was starting to get old very fast actually the judge was pretty good but i cant really describe what makes him work youll have to check it out for yourselfbr br and the custom van chuck norris drives is hideously classic
