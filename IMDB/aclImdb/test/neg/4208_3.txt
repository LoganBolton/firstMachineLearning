in terms of quality movies this isnt one of them its actually the first chuck norris movie ive seen and i was left pretty underwhelmed the fight scenes are slow and dont have a lot of variety norris just uses a lot of roundhouse kicks on all the bad guys coming after him which makes the fights pretty boring the movie also is quite short but for some reason the movie doesnt even seem finished when it ends its a pretty anticlimatic ending all the same though ive watched a lot of bad movies and this isnt one of the worst that ive seen its worth a watch im guessing especially for norris fans theres also nothing like seeing a group of rigs hurtling down the desert which in my opinion was the highlight of the movie
