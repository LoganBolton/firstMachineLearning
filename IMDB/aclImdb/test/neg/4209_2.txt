saw this used dvd cheap and got it for a chuckle i had recently also found the octagon on dvd and bought that one to reminisce having seen it in the theatre as a preteen and loving it at the time the problem now with going back to these american karate films is that ive since then seen so many hong kong and thai action films in which the fight scenes are long fast and jawdropping im thinking particularly of fights like jackie and benny the jet at the end of dragons forever or tony jaas circularstairwell fight from the protector the hollywood kungfu offerings are just not filmed right and even make someone of certified skill such as chuck look awkward at times and whats worse than a fight going into slow motion then you know it looked crappy at normal speed so they slowed it down for effect it really highlights how ridiculous an opponent looks as they stand and just wait to get kicked in the chestbr br poor chuck he just has no intensity in this film nor does he project any righteous menace compare that to his former costar bruce lee who had charm and attitude to burn when bruce would square off against some opponents you could nearly see the air around him crackling with what was about to happen in breaker breaker chuck seemed to accidentally be kicking people with complete nonchalance when the judge comes to see him in jail and sentence him to death chuck is staring off with a sad look and i thought okhes doing that third eye focus thing and is going to grab the judge by the throat and get out of this but he does nothing except look up with a doeeyed stare terrible and while the dvd case gives you hope listing a run time of 1 hour 5 minutes its actually 1 hour 25 minutes so theres 20 more minutes of viewing pain br br for great fight action go watch jackie chan in the first police storythe fight in the shopping mall at the end is pure gold
