ive always been a fan of chuck norris for what hes accomplished and his movies for while i had been meaning to watch this film but for whatever reason didnt have chance apparently i didnt miss much this has to be one of chucks worst films so this trucker billy dawes augenstein is given the chance to make his delivery but on the way he is detoured and forced into a jerkwater town where a foolish local corrupt judge trimmings murdock who runs the whole town has him arrested and phony charges brought up on him he denies the charges and makes a run for it the local hick cops beat him and he disappears but now his brother jd john dawes norris another trucker goes looking for him he soon finds that the town is run buy the loser judge and that his brother is nowhere to be found not long after he begins to beat off just about everyone in town in the meantime the female of the film calls on local truckers on a cb radio and they all come rushing into town demolishing it lol with there big rigs eventually norris finds his brother and beats off more thugsbr br this movie was pretty bad it actually starts off ok and you feel great when norris starts to smash some of these local corrupt cops because there such losers but there is virtually no story the acting is bad and the ending Â…well it doesnt really have one the judge has his house rammed into by a big rig and you never know what happens does he live norris never even gets to trash him in the meantime norris takes on some thug cop at the end who cares norris also manages to take on everyone in town gets his hand broken and shot in the side and goes on to keep fighting come on this movie was apparently made to cash in on the cb craze of the time why there was one is beyond me they barley even use the cbs in the movie adding to this the movie near the end seems to drag on and you wonder why its not over yet this movie is bad but if youre bored and need something to watch it will pass the time as far as norris he went on to make much better films than this 3 out of 10
