the premise of the movie had much going for it however despite the novelty of models selling off someone elses furniture to live the high life this movie has nothing going for it the characters are cardboard the dialog is so painfully scripted its hard to sit through and if there were any jokes in the movie i missed them marilyn monroes walking into walls because she doesnt want to wear glasses is completely unbelievable  not funny grables stupidity is also too hamfisted to be believed bacalls golddigging is so forced its annoying to listen to why anyone would want to sit through this is beyond me
