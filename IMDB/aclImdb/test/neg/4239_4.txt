first a warning how to marry a millionaire comes prefaced by an apparently random five minute orchestral performance of street scene a gershwinlite piece treated with the full pomp and ceremony of well gershwin sitting through it takes some patience if you have the dvd rest assured you can skip forward you wont miss anythingbr br the film itself is one of the perpetual disappointments of 50s hollywood a movie so bolstered by major starpower opulent miseenscene and perfect highconcept that failure seems inconceivable the title alone is perfect generation after generation however are forced to ask themselves  how is this so limp the script is an albatross about the productions neck a dead smelling thing that chokes everything and everyone before they can really spark to life there are no comic situations just isolated moments that play for laughs whenever an actual comedy scene threatens to develop the movie quickly moves on to other less interesting things a case in point  the scene where the three leading ladies each bring a date to the same fancy restaurant one of them shortsighted refuses to wear her spectacles out of vanity one of the dates is married a classic hollywood farce setup surely complete with mistaken identity angry wife and probably a pie in the face for somebody well no instead we cut between the three dates as the ladies react comically to things their partners say hit the punchline and cut to the next limp joke if in doubt have marilyn walk into a wall wheres billy wilder when you need himbr br the three stars are almost a perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classic hollywood screen goddess this was one of marilyn monroes breakout films and the camera just eats her up even though the script gives her nothing to do shes so luminescent she almost seems newly hatched lauren bacall on the other hand had been a major star for nearly a full decade and she knows how to dominate the screen even when in frame with monroe she gets the only thing passing for a real role and delivers the few good lines with a cynical snap  given the right material she could have brought this thing to life shes a curiously ageless actress  when she lies about her age in the film and claims to be forty it isnt instantly ridiculous  and far less girlish than her costars giving her a convincing authority betty grable was far from ageless and had a good eight years on her costars putting her near the end of her hollywood career theres an air of desperation about her at times stranded on screen with nothing but a toothpaste smile and a few scraps of comic timing unable to play her real age but fooling noone as a contemporary of this new sharper generation of actresses relying on the same old schtick that had served her throughout her career for marilyndoubters seeing the two juxtaposed in this movie helps to throw monroes subtlety and  yes  intelligence into sharp relief shes also lumbered with the dead wood in terms of male costars although all of the men  even the great william powell  are guilty of lazy performances shes unable to strike any comic sparks off them better to have given her role to the underutilised monroe who could be funny all by herself and left grable with the repetitive mr magoo routinebr br that the movie is as enjoyable as it is can be put down to the luscious hollywood production the sort that renders even the twee likes of by the light of the silvery moon watchable but somewhere buried beneath the flabby jokes and professionalism lies the rough outline of a sharp cynical comedy about the business of marriage that bacall could have made sing  and new generations of movie viewers will sit down with how to marry a millionaire in expectation of that movie ready to be disappointed all over again
