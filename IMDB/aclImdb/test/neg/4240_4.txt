this show can most accurately be described as tv bubblegum its chewing it has a good taste to it and it lasts a long time but like bubblegum it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after a few too many chewsbr br this show features very simple questions that take the form of simply games like hangman guessing a simple phrase or guessing items on a short list callers are the contestants and anybody can playbr br the questions though are terribly easy theres some techno music pumped into the background thats fashioned into a continuous loop it never seems to get old but it never adds much to the show anyway the hostess however regardless of which one that it is extremely personable pleasant enough to watch and can make some very amusing facial expressions i rather enjoy that british womanbr br but theres nothing to this show its simplistic and uncompelling although it can be entertaining if absolutely nothing else is on
