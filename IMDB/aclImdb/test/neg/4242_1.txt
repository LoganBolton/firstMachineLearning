playmania is extremely boring this is the basis of the show mel or shandi ask extremely easy questions that a 2 year old could answer at an extremely slow pace this show lasts for 2 hours and they probably only play about 10 games in that period people may like this show because the hosts are eye candy but theyre hotness completely is destroyed by the fact that they are so friggin annoyingbr br during the show they mention that we need more players a million times the top 5 surveys that they do probably takes about 20 minutes out of the show this show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made one of the reasons they probably dont have callers is because the show is so cheap with the money the most money ive ever seen them hand out was 210 i wouldnt be surprised if this game show is canceled by the end of 2006
