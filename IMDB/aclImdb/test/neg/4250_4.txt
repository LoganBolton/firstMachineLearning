some people like to tell you that deep space 9 is the best of all the star trek shows because it stresses character development and continuity and features a more complex background and ongoing plots in some ways this makes it more satisfying but in many ways the show fails entirelybr br the series starts out as a soap opera on a space station with two entire seasons of generic science fiction stories balanced with banal subplots about the characters the characters are a good bunch and most of the actors are decent but i think the writers tried too hard to make them normal by normal they actually mean ordinary and tediousbr br at the end of season two we are introduced to the dominion who hang around menacingly for a while before finally going to war with the good guys in season five this is the main story arc of the show but it only takes up a fraction of the entire series we still get lame standalone episodes heroes still get stranded on weird planets for fortyfive minutes and theres an awful lot of lowbrow comedy featuring the greedy goofy ferengi a lot of episodes are merely dull and some are unwatchablebr br the dominion ds9s main villains are bent on galactic domination for the convenient reason that well they just dont like anyone the entire war is presented with a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination impressively pyrotechnic space battles appear with great frequency from season three onwards but these are carried out in ludicrously simplistic ways such as two huge fleets of superadvanced starships flying right at each other and blasting away the writers of ds9 including the talented ronald d moore later of battlestar galactica fame spiced up their monotonous show by starting a war but at heart it is still a pedantic soapbr br ds9 remains a very frustrating experience the continuous story is too flat and obvious to be really gripping and the characters never truly develop in interesting ways babylon 5 and battlestar galactica both fulfilled the promise made by ds9 and did everything much better for star trek stick with the original and the next generation
