i dont see why everyone loves this film so much true it does have good intentions and meaning but you cannot compensate for such a poor script woody allen is a brilliant filmaker but im afraid this is just a piece of garbage its extremely predictable and the subject matter is all too visible i happen to be a huge woody allan fan and love most of his work but this i cannot recomend
