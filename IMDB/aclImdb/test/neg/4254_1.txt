that was one of the worst movies ive ever seen why would someone make a movie about getting away with murder mr allen again plays the only type of character that hes able the sexually stunted man who cant get the girl get a clue allen theres a reason thats the only character that you can successfully portray stir clear of this movie its a waste of time unless you want to know how to successfully murder someone i feel sorry for the actors who say yes to woody allen look at his cast and tell me how many of those people are still working my respect for all of the actors who work for him immediately goes down because they chose to participate in the film
