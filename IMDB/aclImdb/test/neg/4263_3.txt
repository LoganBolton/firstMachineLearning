good attempt at tackling the unconventional topic of maydecember romances however the treatment is totally unrealistic sure sixtyyear old men can and do fall for younger women but theyre usually adult women with whom they share common interests and values and viewpoints  not neurotic immature nearunderage girls of course there are exceptions and they come close to being called pedophiles sorry rgv but its not credible that a sane and accomplished sexagenarian would throw away a comfortable family life and become a joke to his peers  all for an 18yr old that doesnt have a practical thought in her head and that behaves like an unstable escapee from a mental institution you dont have to have a phd in psychology to see that amitabhs character is seduced by sex and that the young woman has unresolved abandonment and daddy issuesbr br as for the recurring scene of vijay perched on the edge of a cliff contemplating suicide thats about as close as he comes to having anything in common with jiah by behaving like a smitten teenage boybr br on a positive note the actors did a good job and cinematography good
