keep away from this one the worst thing is the appalling story there seems to be an intent to convey some subtle spirituallovefriendship message but it is so pathetically devoid of any substance you cant help but cringe in addition the majority of screen time is a far below standard story of thieves criminals and our heroes dealing with some alien time travel artifacts i know you are asking for trouble when dealing with time but the story is more full of holes than usual also you have cheap sets bad acting and some of the worst music arrangements in the history of the moving picture overpowering cheap abrupt and disjointed all i can say is man alive  this film is bad
