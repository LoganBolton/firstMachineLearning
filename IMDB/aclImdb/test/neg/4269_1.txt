this horrible action  scifi movie is a crap i have just spent 90 minutes of my life watching one of the worst movies i have ever seen the story does not make any sense there are lots of flaws in the screenplay the characters are badly developed the unknown cast is horrible the lead ham actor seems to be too old for his role i was induced to buy this vhs which has a magnificent cover and see this crap due to the illogical imdb user rating and some ten stars reviews i have just checked the authors and each one of them has just one short review of linx issued in imdb and nothing else why are they promoting such a garbage my vote is onebr br title brazil linx conexão letal linx lethal connection
