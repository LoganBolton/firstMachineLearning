jeff speakman never really made it beyond the lowest ranks of martialartiststurnedactors lower than don the dragon wilson for example and with vehicles like the expert you can see why there are three major problems with this movie 1 the plot  or should i say plots  are all over the place there are some characters who get a lot of screen time but serve little purpose 2 there are only 4 fight scenes in total some of them completely unrelated to the main plot and some taking place in the dark 3 the music score is overzealous and overbearing strange as it may seem this is really the most annoying thing about this film the score persistently tries to convince you that youre watching some sort of grand epic instead of the lowbudget limitedaction film you are indeed watching with all that said at least theres james brolin around to lend a touch of credibility 12 out of 4
