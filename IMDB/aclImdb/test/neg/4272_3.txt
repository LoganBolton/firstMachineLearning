i always try not to be harsh while criticizing something that i didnt like but after watching this miniseries i was so disappointed that could not help my irritation on the one hand it is true that series stayed faithful to the novel and of course i found that very nice but on the other hand terrible casting poor acting especially of key characters Â– like funny price impression of stage play i mean theatrical way of acting makes you irritate from the beginning to the end i am sure with this budget even if it was low could have been done something much better and worthwhile it is up to you to watch this series but personally i dont advice you to spend your time on this disappointing ecranization
