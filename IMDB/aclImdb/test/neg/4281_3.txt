being a great fan of disney i was really disappointed when i watched this garbagethe animation was prettyand the backgrounds were amazingbut i believe that good animation does not make up for a weak scriptand weak story im gonna have to disagree with the people who say it is not suitable for childrenyes there are some deaths in the movie but isnt death something that children should at least be exposed to but i digress the script is riddled with bad puns and lame jokesthe kind i could expect from most dreamworks movies the music was soppythe morals forcedand forced without any charm whatsoeverand the characters would burst into song at totally inappropriate timesthe characters were also coldand i really couldnt muster up any form of emotion towards thembar irritation i am a great fan of jungle bookaladdinand emperors new groove but this disney movie was a total and utter waste of timedo not watch it
