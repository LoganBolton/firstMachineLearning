man kills bear man becomes bear manbear meets bear manbear stays manbear after meeting bear the end seriously that is the entire plot to this movie yes i simplified it to an extreme but you get the picture i just wish i maybe had not have seen itbr br the manbear alluded to is a native american indian that kills a mother of a cub and while that can be touching it certainly lacks to really draw in on the potential conflict between the two parties plus there was a certain misuse of the two moose in the film but that is beyond the pointbr br overall very much under par certainly needed a lot more to be entertaining maybe more laughs from the secondary characters and more drama between the two main bears thats what separates bad films from the good ones d
