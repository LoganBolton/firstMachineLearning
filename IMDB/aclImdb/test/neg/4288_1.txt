terrible psychological thriller that is almost painful to sit through every aspect being awfulbr br the combined talents of top actors kevin bacon and gary oldman are totally wasted and though they give good performances one wonders why they bothered the script from mark kasdan is a complete mess and martin campbell has the narrative jumping all over the place but if youre unable to follow it take it as a blessing there are far too many pointless crazy scenes that just dont make sense jerry goldsmiths music is not much help eitherbr br even if there was potential in the plot director campbells approach has utterly ruined it avoid at all costsbr br monday february 26 1996  video
