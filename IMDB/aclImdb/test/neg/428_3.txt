this film probably would have been goodif they didnt use cgi computer generated imageryfor the werewolf scenesit made the creatures look fake and the werewolves looked cartoonishcgi is great for certain effects like the dinasours in jurassic park or twisterbut when we see a film where the creature must look completely realcgi is not the way to golook at an american werewolf in londonno cgijust makeup and a mechanical creature and what you come up with was more realistic than what was shown in the sequelthis film did offer a few gags that was fun to watch and the humor in this movie seemed to have drawn me in but its nothing more than a film that i thought was okand thats not good enoughin my opinionan american werewolf in paris doesnt hold up to the original
