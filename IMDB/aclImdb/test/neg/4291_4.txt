first i must point out that the role wendell corey played was exceptional usually corey was relegated to supporting roles but here he is what helps carry this very limp film without him and the character he played the film would have been a lot worsehardly meriting a 2 or 3br br so why did i hate the rest of the film so much well one of my pet peeves is when characters act too stupid to live you cant base major plot points on the assumption that your major characters are completely stupid unless having a brain injury is part of the plot of course but this is exactly what happens in this film wendell corey is a crazed man who has murdered three innocent people and they know his next target is joseph cottens wife so what do they do yep they provide really inadequate police protection and a plan that makes no sense at all no marksman and guys with shotguns that are so far away they probably wont stop this madman and if this isnt bad enough the marked woman inexplicably runs away from her hiding place and walks right into the worst possible place she could be is anyone that stupid arrrggghhhhi hate when movies have such dumb characters in fact i found myself rooting for corey since i felt the idiots deserved to die for their behaviors in addition to these clich√©d characters there was also a bit player who fainted sure seeing your husband shot might cause someone to faint however in real life this is a rare occurrencepeople rarely faint unless there is a medical reason so combining this with the above character problems is a real nightmare for people who are looking for realismsomething film noir movies must havebr br all these serious problems are even more infuriating since wendell coreys character is amazingly wellwritten and conceived it was his chance to shine as an actortoo bad the rest of the movie was so limp that corey and the basic plot idea are sunk this is one film that could really use a remakebut this time without brainless characters
