the yokes on me is undoubtedly the most controversial film in the stooges 23 years of shorts the reason is understandable by todays standards this film can be considered racist for this reason it is rarely shown if ever on televisionbr br let me just state that for the record the japanese seen in the film were not soldiers they were japaneseamericans sent to a relocation center during world war ii they were treated and shown as the evil enemy in this film by all accounts  including the us government who made an apology and reparations in the 1980s  japaneseamericans during world war ii were as loyal and hardworking as any american their imprisonment during this time is a dark blot in american historybr br there are some stooge laughs in this film but the memories of how japaneseamericans were treated during this time sullies the entertainment value lets not confuse the loyal japaneseamericans with their representation in this film as evildoers loyal japaneseamericans and the world war iiera evil empire of japan are not synonymous 2 out of 10
