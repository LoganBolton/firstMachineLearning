took a chance to see if perhaps a really good wwi film had slipped my noticethis isnt it john phillip law and don stroud are both stiff in their acting and miscast for their roles the dialogue is dumb or nonexistent the flying sequences are okay but pretty repetitive compared to the terrific blue max this movie should never have been made watch george peppardjames mason and usula andress in the bm and you get why that movie is one of the best war films ever made and this isnt recently released on dvd richtofen and brown is presented as some great lost classic from the 70s i resold mine the day after i bought it dont waste your time or
