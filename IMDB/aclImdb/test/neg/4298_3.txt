i dont see the sense in going through so much trouble to make a movie like this and then throw the history book out the window there wasnt a single accurate detail in that movie other than the fact than richtofen died which i was grateful for at the end so i didnt have to watch any more movies like this are an insult to anyone who knows anything about wwi aerial historybr br ill skip the obvious that they were flying fokker dviis in 1916 because the blue max did that too or that 209 squadron was flying se5s and will attack other parts for one thing they call the pfalz diii an old albatross at the beginning for another they have voss goring and wolff all in jasta boelcke the only one who was in that jasta was voss and he joined after boelcke died richtofen wasnt held to blame for boelckes deatherwin boehme who collided with boelcke had swerved to avoid a british plane that richtofen was chasing when richtofen received his head wound it was while attacking a fe2d twoseater and he did not crash into the trenches and have soldiers fight over him and nowerner voss did not die that day he died september 28th in one of the most epic battles in wwibr br manfred was short not like the actor who towered over everyone else his brother lothar was never in jasta boelcke either he joined the squadron when manfred was in charge of jasta 11br br theres so many other glaring errors in historical fact that ill let them go except perhaps the worst one the death scene in the movie manfred is outmaneuvered by brown and then shot down making a perfect landing brown got off one burst at richtofen while richtofen was chasing may and the facts amassed over the years overwhelmingly show that richtofen was killed by ground fire not by brownbr br the only value in this movie was the chance to see the flying scenes themselves which were as good as the blue max other than that i wont watch it again and i paid 30 for the tape
