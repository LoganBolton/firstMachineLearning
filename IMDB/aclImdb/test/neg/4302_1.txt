as much as we might welcome a film that deals with people who have different challenges in the area of romance i cannot shake off the feeling that this movie was intended as a directtovideo gradec porn movie in which either a the actors backed out of doing the explicit scenes or b the producers ran out of money to hire for the inserts an amazing thing if it were truebr br i had to go back to blockbuster to figure out why on earth i had rented it which was due to an admittedly amateurish gullibility regarding the cover blurbs which seemed to imply a seditious john watersstyle humorfest with a sexual theme okay i laughed a couple of times and it definitely has a sexual theme although most of it cant be described as stimulating in any way but on some movies you might rewind to make sure you heard the dialog correctlyon this one you fastforward because you already know what theyre about to say but theres nothing to fastforward to so just fastforward past it on the shelf
