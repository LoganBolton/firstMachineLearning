the russian space station avna with a crew of four russians and two americans is threatening to reenter the earths atmosphere in a matter of days russia asks for nasas help in rescuing the stranded crew and nasa scrambles the space shuttle atlantis the nsa also have an interest in the prometheus a prototype microwave power source being tested aboard avna and organise for one of their men to be placed on the missionbr br thats the plot onto less important things the space station and the shuttle are the same blatantly obvious models used in fallout memorial day and dark breed and a handful of other films i suspect the model effects are so obvious throughout the entire movie and make the film look very 1960s the sets are a little better but are far too 80s for what is supposedly a brand new station built by an american company which later comes in as part of a conspiracy to destroy avna and the prometheus and claim the insurance the script has a few good moments including yuris farewell and the little spiel at the end but is otherwise fairly bland and substandard the acting is okay the only real standout performance comes from alex veadov who offers up some of the films better dialogue michael dudikoff is surprisingly one of the best parts about this film icet is icet nuff said the film offers a few surprises though that i dont wish to spoilbr br certainly one of the better lowgrade contemporaryset scifi films of the last six years but not the best the film is watchable but the special effects and plot will probably put a lot of viewers off rent the other stranded scifi film instead
