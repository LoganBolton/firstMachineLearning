this is one the worst movie ive seen and certainly worst movie nagesh kuknoor has made i cant believe person who has created movie like teen deewarein can create utter crap like this br br plot of the film itself is really faulty that zeenat has to search meera and get her clemency to help her husband avoid death penalty in soudi arabia common logic says if zeenat cannot search meera easily so wont the soudi government so zeenat can safely forge meeras signature or thumbprint and produce it before the soudis another silliest thing is shankar has given incorrect address in his passport so indian government officials cannot get to the address but after sometime meera gets shankars suitcase through soudi government wow doesnt it make soudis well networked in india more than indiansbr br nagya makes a slightly more than cameo in the movie with role of chopra who is eyeing meera and seeks meeras fatherinlaw girish karnaadthis guy is just wasteds help to get her as a keep br br nagya cannot speak hindi and he has been assisted by other guys to translates the english dialogs he writes in hindi this time it seems that his aide was in serious intoxication when writing dialogs like imaan ki chalaang leap of honesty within minutes to our worst nightmares meera not only takes this honest leap she taps her feet to do imaan ka naach dance of honestybr br one of the only bright spot movie has is its cinematography and really nice hues but since bollywood has learned the thing called postproduction almost all the movies have vibrant colors and nicely blended backdrops so no big dealbr br conclusion is that making a cheesy movie is not limited to chopras or johars or barjatyas nagyas and all are ready to get affected
