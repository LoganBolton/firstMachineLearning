i have read the other user comments and i am happy someone has compared it to the original by kamal called perumarzhakalam released in 2004br br the original had a tight story and no loopholes as described above about the indian govt not having proper records or even bad shoots and bloopersbr br the story is great and a touchy one and well described by others but sadly nagesh taking credit for it as his own story is a sad thing and amounts to nothing other than plagiarismbr br i guess he has been affected by bollywoods so called inspired syndromebr br he must at least give credit where it is duebr br i liked some of his older movies but now i suspect if any of them were originals after allbr br here is a link in imdb for the original masterpiece httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0425350comment i recommend everyone to see the original even with subtitles if needed to know what class direction and class acting is all about
