about the spoiler warning its not may contain it does contain spoilers readers beware br br okay first i need it to be known that im not bashing the actors theyre just working with what theyre given the problem was the script it was horrendous there was nothing believable about it at all sure when you have a movie based on a murderous hitchhiker theres going to be the bad mistake here and there that puts you in the terribly horrific movieworthy situation but these girls just made stupid decision after stupid decision the only girl smart enough to ever try and call the police was the girl added towards the end because hed already killed one and hit another with a car speaking of hitting her with a carwhy the hell did she try and outrun a truck rather than run to the side like a normal person also does the one who wrote the script honest to god believe cops are not going to investigate a door covered in blood frankly it wasnt suspenseful either the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were well this rant has gone on way longer than i meant to for such a bad movie so i wont bother to touch on the end besides the fact its unrealistic and lame
