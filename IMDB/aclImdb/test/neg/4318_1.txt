ok i went to this website before i watched this movie read the comments got pumped  cause they where all pretty good for a bflick  watched it and was completely disappointed the main characters wannabe lone rebel straight out of the midwest act was sickening to the stomach and dont even get me started on the two cops i mean theres a bloody door right there in plain view check it out the plot was completely predictable the editing was rather limited i swear the editor was even dozing off near the end when he was cutting this movie and the direction was clouded by bad cinematography now please dont get me wrong i love bflicks some are really goodbr br want to watch a good b rated flickbr br dave recommendsbr br  high tension br br httpimdbcomtitlett0338095
