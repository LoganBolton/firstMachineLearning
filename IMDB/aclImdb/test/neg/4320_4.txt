this movie is watchable but nothing special four girls on a road trip to vegas foolishly decide to pick up a hitchhiker because he is cute they all end up staying the night at a motel in the middle of nowhere and the hitchhikers psychotic issues with women become apparentbr br the characters are clich√©sthere is a married responsible woman a slutty party girl an unsure bridetobe and a manhater who just got dumped the hitchhiker is genuinely nice until he goes crazybr br theres not nearly enough gore and way too much rape i enjoy slasher horrorthrillers a lot and this one did nothing for me the ending was just as lame as the rest of the moviebr br on the positive side the actors did a great job with that they had to work with the dialogue isnt awful and overall i was impressed with the cast having never seen or heard of any of them before and the plot wasnt out of the realm of possibility although i really doubt any woman in this day and age would pick up a hitchhikerno matter how attractive he is so i wasnt groaning that things didnt make sensebr br overall the hitchhiker was wellacted and made sense but wasnt very interesting there are a lot of better movies in the same genre that i would recommend over this one rest stop the devils rejects texas chainsaw massacre even the hitcher remake do yourself a favor and skip it unless you dont have any other options
