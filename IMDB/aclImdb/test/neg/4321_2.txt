i cant believe that i actually sat thru this entire film a friend rented it because the jacket made it sound good in its defense the jacket was correct there was a supposed haunted room that someone slept in overnight from the jacket it sounded like this was on par with freddy jason or maybe the shining it couldnt be farther from the truthbr br if you are a fan of minimalist andor surrealist films you may enjoy it if youre looking for a good fright movie or a couple of thrills go rent jason vs freddy iv  youll have a much better night
