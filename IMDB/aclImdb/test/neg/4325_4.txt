if at all possible try to view all five of the universal mummy films in order not so much for the continuity between films but for the very evident lack thereof of course it goes without saying that the original boris karloff classic the mummy really shouldnt even be mentioned in the same breath as the so called sequels all of which come off as campy or cultish br br this time around its revealed that the mummified remains of princess ananka have made their way to the united states and once again as your eyes deceive you kharis the mummy didnt really die for the second time in the mummys tomb but is alive and searching for his lost love princess ananka with the help of the rhetorical nine tana leaves brewed during the cycle of the full moon to complete the mythology kharis needs a caretaker ably filled by a gaunt john carradine as yousef bey entrusted with the task by george zuccos andoheb high priest of arkan br br kharis and ananka are to be returned to their final resting place in the hills of arkan in egypt but as weve seen before being entrusted with the duty of a high priest is a sure bet to end in failure with carradines character falling for the reincarnation of ananka amina monsouri ramsay ames its shocking to see yousef bey and the poed bandaged one come to blows over the gorgeous amina br br riddle me this  in both tomb and curse lon chaney portrays the mummy with a limp right arm folded helplessly across his chest when he encounters the fainted amina he lifts her up in both arms with no problem as soon as he puts her down his right arm returns to its crippled position once againbr br the ending of the film is most notable  the monster gets the girl but its a short lived victory as the mummy and his kidnapped bride succumb to a swampy grave an ancient egyptian curse is fulfilled  the fate of those who defy the will of the ancient gods shall be a cruel and violent death
