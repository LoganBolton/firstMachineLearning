imagine watching a slide show where the projector lingers on every slide long enough for you to completely memorize it three times over now imagine that the images in the slide show consist entirely of mundane scenes  a small park and empty tennis court a piano now imagine that the people running the slide show are having a frustratingly slow semilucid conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the slides theyre showing you great  youve just imagined the entirety of the film india songbr br the film is an agonizingly slow montage of images that do little except to simply scream out look at me i am profound with such blatant selfimportance that the images themselves and the movie as a whole are rendered not merely bereft of profundity but comically bereft of profundity the visuals could easily have been replaced by a series of static images as described above since it is so rare that there are actually people on screen and even when they are the people actually move only slightly more often than the furniture they never speak or interact in any meaningful way  they just stand there looking at each other and occasionally crying the most energetic moment in the entire first hour of the film is when three people walk across a parking lot in slow motion in fact the visuals could easily have been left out entirely as the story is told completely through narration the story is about a woman who hates india because its hot and hates people dont hate india because its hot this point is covered several times it is also about a man who feels that he is entitled to sleep with the aforementioned woman since she will sleep with anyone who asks her to but he doesnt get to sleep with her simply because he never asks and hes very upset about this so he stares at her as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek later on he stares at his bicycle as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek actually you dont get to see the single tear running profoundly down his cheek when hes staring at his bicycle but you know its there anyway just because thats the sort of film this isbr br at best the narration becomes background hum serving as a perfect compliment to the comainducing visuals simply staying conscious through the entirety of this film would require a supreme act of determination to watch it and actually come away with a serious and meaningful idea of what it was supposed to be about would induce the same sort of migraine as trying to read lengthy technical documents in the dark this film is perhaps the greatest monument of pseudoartistic pretension that man will ever know
