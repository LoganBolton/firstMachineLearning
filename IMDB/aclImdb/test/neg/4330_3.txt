this film has an amazing cast mgm took some of its finest character actors and starred them in a film with the usually adorable margaret obrien lionel barrymore edward arnold and lewis stone star as three greedy old bachelors who live in the same home while they have amassed a fortune over the years they also have been selfish jerks one of them has an idea to donate some property in order to buy themselves a good name sort of like carnegie but it turns out the property they want to give away actually belongs to obrien and since shes an orphan they volunteer to be her guardians so they can give her property away and look like great philanthropistsbr br there also is a goofy subplot involving fairiesled by the wonderful character actor henry davenport and since obrien is irish as evidenced by her outrageous accent she and the little people make up much of the plot frankly i absolutely hated this portion of the film and wished theyd just dropped it entirely instead the story could still have been about sweet margaret melting the mean old mens heartsthis would have worked butthe little people sheesh overall the actors try very very hard but the silliness of the plot and the deadly earnest way they tried made me cringe i noticed a lot of people liked this filmi guess im just an old grouch i found the film horrible difficult to watch
