ben stryker an exgreen beret stops off at a little town called agua dolee to visit an old friend tick rand soon after riding into town on his suzuki and settling in a motorcycle gang known as the savages whos led by tyrant pigiron invade and finally take over the place stryker doesnt want to get involved but that changes when he friends become the actual targetsbr br is there anything good to say about this scuzzy item tough call as the only fundamental reason to watch this lowbudget car wreck is for the tremendous bcast the crew managed to get hold off for this project while i dont think its a complete botch job its not terribly good either now what a cast lance henriksen being the main character he strangely doesnt have top billing but the final one karen black george kennedy richard lynch bill forsythe mickey jones and leo gordon now what went wrong with this scummy lowbudget bungle the shallowness of the material is too onedimensional that it heavily borrows ideas from better movies namely mad max and comes up with a complete mess of ideas that just dont gel and could have been better thought out the clich√©s that are used can be manipulated into a good viewing despite being predictable but savage dawn seems to let it skimpily rush all by without letting the viewer soak it all up the cast are mostly wasted in nothing roles a bleachedblonde henriksen is capably solid and even with his commending presence that provides an enigmatic glow to his character he doesnt get up to hell of a lot and sometimes goes missing in action too much sideline action but when he did kick some bikers ass the good times flowed karen blacks hissing performance is a very odd one and is all about the screaming and cursing although she does get into one memorable catfight with claudia udys flirtatious vixen character katie a wheelchair bound george kennedy roams around aimlessly until the final assault and richard lynch looks embarrassed as a wayward priest  town mayor in a very redundant role an on edge bill forsythe simply chews it up as the head honcho of the notorious biker packbr br the junky story written by william milling and max bloom has that cheesy comic book getup and very much is influenced by the western genre just look at the villains for that how they came up with their names is mystery maybe they drew them out of a hat its pretty second rate material that more often moves onto one lacklustre scene after another unfunny comical elements are chucked in and as well a bit of sleaze tacky exploitation that doesnt get gritty enough and the deaths are quite laughable a clumsy script is filled convoluted details and unbearable trite simon nuchterns spotty direction was by the numbers and tepidly laid out one or two intense scenes cant makeup for its tortoiselike pacing and many cackhanded stunts the cardboard sets had down n dirty look but lack that organic sense the gravellike cinematography by gerald feil was better handled when the main focus wasnt on the town but on the desolate backdrop like the beginning and ending climax of the film with some neat camera touches pino donaggios clunky music choices are drowned out by its own incompetencebr br savage dawn is a forgettable quickie midnight movie thats a definite misfire for most part there are better and more convincing exercises of the same ilk out there
