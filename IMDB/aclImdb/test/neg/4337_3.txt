okay here is a really short review this movie blowed i wish i could just have a review that stated this simple principle but i must bore you with more bad review type words like horrible clich√©d and unwatchable its the type of film you watch when you are drunk or are stuck on a desert island with nothing else to do heres the premise the vice president is captured by a terrorist group at a playoff hockey game and only van damm can stop the madness truly truly terrible but then again i didnt pay to see it the first time around and only my dad felt the absence of girth in his wallet after this movie i hate the fact he is a republican and all but then again he did spare me the horror of paying for this piece of garbage okay that is now enough space to be recognized as a review so i bid adieu
