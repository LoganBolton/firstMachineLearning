the only thing in sudden death that outdoes the amount of nonstop action is the incredible number of plot holes what with that and the sheer amount of contrivances one could hardly call whats left a storyline to say the screenplay has borrowed from the die hard premise would be to make the worlds most blatant understatementbr br here we have a troubled hero working in the huge pittsburgh indoor ice rink as a fire marshall on the night of the seventh game of the finals series he gets tickets so he can treat his estranged children to the deciding game and of course spend a little time with them also catching the match but for political reasons is the vice president of the united states raymond j barry when a bunch of incredibly well organised mercenaries capture the vps box and demand hundreds of millions in government money our hero darren mccord has his plans more than slightly put outbr br each time a new one of these formula flicks is made it seems that all we get in the way of innovation is nastier bad guys and more and more spectacular and gruesome ways in which the good guys dispose of them director hyams and his screenwriter have gone over the top not that this is an original sin in trying to make us loathe the wicked terrorists the horrible baddies go about shooting the secret service the security and the civilians both old and young with gay abandon and with scant regard for the relative threat of each victimbr br van damme engages in plenty of fistycuffs and gunplay heroics and death defying stunts the script asks little of the musclebound european almost everyone else has walkons apart from powers boothe who seriously overdoes his under written shallow role as the cruelest meanest old ring leader there ever wasbr br theres a lot of clever cinematography and enough explosive special fx to keep anyone awake but really thats all this action flick has action though there are some nifty sequences nothing could be called outrageously brilliantbr br saturday february 10 1996  greater union melbourne
