normally i wouldnt even stoop to viewing trash like this but since roleplaying is a dear hobby to me and such was the subject of the film i did it was garbage in so many ways that i do not know where to begin i would rather sit through the plan 9 from outer space marathon than watch another minute of this vomit at least plan 9 didnt have an agenda how the media could capitulate and irresponsibly represent extremist agenda as fact is beyond me it is a scary time when a whole group of people can be unceremoniously trounced with no defense and no real facts presented i know this commentary went more social but it couldnt be helped as this movie begged it imagine a pronazi film being reviewed strictly on film merit wont happen as it sits the people who made this film are facists themselves and should perhaps move into a communist enclave where propagandizing is accepted
