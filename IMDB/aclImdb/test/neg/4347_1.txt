i had no idea what this movies was about it jumps from plot line to plot line erratically linking incoherent ideas with one another it simply doesnt make sense br br the chopped up time line doesnt help either we start in present day get a flash back to the past and then return to the future only to go back into the pastbr br this movie is also filled with horrible sappy lines and cliché themes such as princess and the pauper you cant have me even in my death lines you dont even love me enough line cliché to the maxbr br fighting scene were horribly corny lighting was constantly misplaced which offset the cg with the actors meanning you could tell some of the backgrounds were clearly cg br br although the society in di moon was quite interestingbr br i wouldnt really recommend his to anyone avoid if possiblebr br if you found this comment hard to follow the movie would be equally as bad
