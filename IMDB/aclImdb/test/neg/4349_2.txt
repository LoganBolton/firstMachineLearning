i and my brother are very big asian movie fans so when finding this movie hidden in a shop i bought this one on dvd because it sounded very promising and i couldnt wait to watch it so i watched this movie with my brother and i must say in the beginning it was very promising both of us really loved this brutal ball scene in the first scene but i guess that was all there are some interesting fights but it is not a action movie as it claims to be instead its a love movie with the cliché of love so extremely played over the top even shakespeare would vomit on this title sorry for my language by the way the characters act like being picked up from the street and given 100 for playing in this moviebr br well i and my brother watched it to the end because we thought it can only become better but heck it never did this movie challenged place 1 on my and my brothers worst movies ever seenlist only followed by fantasy mission force  do not watch this either
