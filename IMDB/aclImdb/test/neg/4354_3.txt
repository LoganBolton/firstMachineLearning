ive tried to watch this film 3 or 4 times but i just cant get past the fact that everything about it is just awful im sure it was a courageous move by somebody to cast jack palance as the protagonist but there is not one single fiber of my being that believes that he could act at all much less act against typebr br yes i understand that clifford odets was a brilliant author but its not evident here this odd and forced mishmash of 50s hipster dialog seems to obfuscate any genuine meaning which explains why none of the actors even the good ones steiger ida lupino shelly winters everett sloane seems to know how to deliver their lines  its as though they dont understand the meaning of what they are saying and in the meantime wendell corey and palance stage a terrific contest to see who can be more stonefacedbr br the direction is amateurish and completely overwrought the physical interaction between the characters is as stilted as the dialogbr br and can we discuss that hideous set its so busy ugly and contrived that it adds to the robotic disconnected quality of the characters the dialog and the portrayalsbr br this film seems to suck the energy right out of me it looks like everybody took an overdose of valium each morning when they arrived on the set it takes a pretty lousy movie to make rod steiger and shelly winters look bad but this one succeedsbr br i can see that it might have been effective as a play on or off broadway where intellectuals and beats could have congratulated themselves for appreciating the power of the plot and the artsy flourishes of the pseudohip dialog
