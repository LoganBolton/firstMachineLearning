the quality youre likely to remember after viewing the big knife is how claustrophobic it is its pacing is sacrificed to a uniform texture of dialog its talky in the extreme modern viewers will feel every point has been made and then some but the movie will still not move on or do the viewer a favor and change the scenery its very inert at the 45 min mark i was sure i had watched two very slow hours my beleaguered response was good god where is this going it feels like odets was paid by the wordbr br this is a good place to note the decline of drama from its high point in the 40s through the conceitladen projects of the 50s and 60s until actual filmic merit was rediscovered in the 70s only to vanish again here we get showoffy conventional emotional outbursts from steiger lupino et al and camera moves prearranged to meet overpracticed blocking this is due to the rise of the method the regrettable trend of sacrificing every other merit of film to grant actors their most selfish wishes great acting hohum has killed thought in moviesbr br jack palances forehead  pompadour retract and thrust forward every time he reacts to something its disturbingbr br this is awfully boring stuff
