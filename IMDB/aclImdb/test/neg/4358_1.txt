i really hope the makers of these movies read these reviews so that they know that people just dont want their movies they are just trash and an embarrassment to the killer clown genre of horror whether or not this was better than the first doesnt matter cause theyre both just plain terrible im surprised they didnt learn their lesson from the first movie stop now warning to horror movie watchers dont watch rent or look at the boxes of urban horror films and above all dont buy them
