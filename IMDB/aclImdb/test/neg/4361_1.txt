the first killjoy 1 but heres the review of killjoy 2br br contains spoilers so beware readersbr br oh my oh my my my ill start off with telling you that i had no hopes in the least bit that this movie would be good considering that killjoy the first movie is without a doubt the worst movie ever made the sequel didnt have much promisebr br as expected it didnt deliverbr br the deaths were even lamer than in the first movie there was absolutely no eye candy whatsoever and every single prop looked so fake that i wouldnt be surprised if they had a kindergarten class make thembr br look i dont even know where to begin hm for starters the movie wasnt even feature length it was only an hour and eight minutes long 68 min but then again ending it early was actually a reprieve in fact thats the only reason that this movie wasnt as bad as the first because the first was longerbr br usually i dont give spoilers in reviews but since i dont want any of you to go through the torture of watching this waste of film im going to spoil away not that theres much to spoilbr br lets start with the ending killjoy is the pussiest killer ever it takes explosions firebombs guns etc to kill all of the normal serial killers in horror movies guess what it took to kill killjoy a fing glass of water no lie in the end a girl picked up a cup of water and threw the water on killjoys face then killjoy started screaming and they tried to make it look like his face was melting by putting dried rubber cement on his forehead then he laid there and the people went to sleepbr br now lets hit the acting very terrible not even one person was believable in the least bit i dont even know what to say other than it looks like they just hired a few hobos living on the streets to act in this filmbr br seriously i honestly doubt that they spent any more than 100 dollars total to make this movie they had nothing most of it took place in the woods which wouldnt have cost them anything to film on the actors werent giving in any effort whatsoever so its blatant that they were probably working for free they didnt have any kind of special effects or nice props and they probably used ketchup for the blood hell who am i kidding they probably didnt even spend 100 dollars they probably spent 329 on a bottle of ketchup and that was it a fkin movie made with a budget of 329br br for bobs sake they couldnt even afford to rent a cop uniform in the end after killjoy dies the girl wakes up and says where is he and the main woman replies hes gone then suddenly some fat goofy guy with scars on his face pops out of nowhere with a cell phone saying you have a phone call the girl answers and says oh hi mom and smiles then the fat goofy guy walks along to reveal that its a police officer however hes wearing khaki pants and a regular button up green shirt with a lame badge on the front pocket hell it was probably the badge that the director got when he was in safety patrol in 3rd grade then they all got into a tan blazer and drove off as the credits rolled they couldnt even get a police cruiser so they just got a tan blazer fkin lame killjoy didnt even have the ice cream van that he had in the first moviebr br killjoy is without a doubt the most flamboyantly gay slasher ever if there was a slasher that wore hot pink spandex and carried a rainbow flag he still would not be as gay as killjoy killjoy isnt funny either and believe me he did try to bebr br the only good thing about this movie is an extremely lame threat given by one of the delinquents somebody makes a comment to some boy about not passing third grade to which the boy responds ill show you third grade in a threatening manner that has to be the absolute worst threat that ive ever heard ill show you third gradebr br this movie doesnt even work on a so bad its good level its filth unless you did something bad and you are feeling so guilty about it that you want to punish yourself severely dont watch this moviebr br just remember if a flaming homosexual clown with a huge black afro tries to bore you to death with gay jokes and attempt to kill you at the same time just throw some water at him case closedbr br final rating 1 out of 10
