i have never seen the first killjoy film and i have also never heard a good thing said about it so i see killjoy 2 in the local blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back starring trent haaga and debbie rochon it boasts now being the massive troma fan that i am there is no way im not going to rent this film out how can it possibly be bad with these two in it oh how wrong i was even trent and debbie cant save this excuse of a film from being as bad as it truly is trent quite frankly stinks as killjoy although this probably is more the fault of the writers giving him some of the worst oneliners in the history of film debbie does put a solid performance in but it isnt enough the kills are terrible as are the gore effects for example check out when the guy is supposedly impaled on something or other and just to top it all off the ending is just amongst the worst i have ever seen in movie history the film doesnt even work on a so bad its good level avoid like the clapbr br 210
