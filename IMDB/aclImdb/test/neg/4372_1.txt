i really dont know why i agreed to watch this movie but like a complete fool i did and for that i deserve to be shot i had seen the original killjoy well i say i have seen it i started watching it but found it that bad that i ended up watching it in 4x speed to get it over with and get rid of the annoying dialogue but i said i would watch it and i did even if it was in 4x speedbr br to cut a long story short killjoy 2 kicks off where killjoy left off by this i dont mean the plot i mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as acting and cheapness i have nothing against low budget movies in fact i kinda enjoy them they are something different from mega budget blockbusters but this film is just terrible the acting is diabolical and the script well i think you could of given stevie wonder a pen and paper and he would of produced something much better this movie is just annoying not to mention the annoying laugh the clown has which is so obviously dubbed i didnt make it through this movie anyway about three quarters of the way through it was time to turn it off and throw it through the window it may of been a rip off to buy as a dvd but as a frisbee it was a mega bargain br br please for the love of mankind itself do not watch this muck it is possibly the worst thing i have ever seen and considering some of the muck ive seen thats saying a lot br br my rating on this movie would be nailgun to the head10
