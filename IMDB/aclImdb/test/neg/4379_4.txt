for a norris movie this is pretty tame for an action movie it is kind of dull and as far as predictability goes my friend and i almost had every turn of this movie nailed it was nice that the killers every moves were not telegraphed by the cliches of 80s action movies but come on the only nonpredictable move defies the plot and the setup of the editing mainly it is said rather early on that the killer jack ohalloran whom is one of the few slightly known actors only kills women yet he all of a sudden stops his mo and kills men huh i guess it can be construed and rationalized some way but why is the movie edited to show that he is going to kill women br br yet again im sure that there is a reason ie to build suspense but why spend the time watching it when many other suspense movies are vastly superiorbr br fans of renegade may enjoy the small cameo by branscombe richmond as victor but his brief appearence cannot save the movie and even a vote of 4 seems generousbr br
