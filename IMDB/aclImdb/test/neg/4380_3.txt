this is simply another bad chuck norris movie norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women he put the guy away three years before but the guy somehow gets through the bars in the nut house hes in by using what looks like dental floss then the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives it over a 400 foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater undergoing renovation irish jack ohalloran is the best thing in this movie but like in superman ii he doesnt say a word somehow thats supposed to make him more menacing ron oneal of super fly fame and steve james are wasted playing the citys mayor and norris sidekick respectively the film also contains the idiotic subplot of norris and his girlfriend having a child out of wedlock its so 1980s when coupling norris serious acting turn with overthetop musical cues signaling every forthcoming scene in predictable fashion the film becomes a chore to sit through the buildup while searching for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with norris crawling through the shadows to discover the hideaway but the end fight is disappointing after beginning in such a promising way its yet another disappointment from cannon films and it plays like a movie made for television  of 4 stars
