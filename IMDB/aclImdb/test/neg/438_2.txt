i had been wanting to see an american werewolf in paris for a long time because i loved its predecessor but this film didnt impress me as much as an american werewolf in london actually to be quite honest it didnt impress me at allbr br tom everettscott and his dude pals are wandering paris and in a preposterous bungee stunt off the eifel tower rescuing wolfbabe julie delpy from death before youve time to work out if the constant mugging and lumpy dialogue is meant to be the stuff of comedy a fullmoon has hit and the brats are being chased by dreadful cgi werewolves down parisian sewersbr br the script is disgustingly poor the actors were made to make this film theyre horrible performances match the status of the movie from start to end this movie is never entertaining engaging or even slightly watchable i had trouble watching this whole film without throwing up my dinner to be quite honestbr br the action scenes arent exciting the jokes arent funny and the werewolves arent scary in short miss out or be haunted foreverbr br i rate an american werewolf in paris 2 out of 10
