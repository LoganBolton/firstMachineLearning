the box is why i originally picked up this movie and the back is why i rented it but i soon learned that i had been duped i had thought this movie would be something like a road tripeurotripamerican pie deal but i was wrong this movie is one of the dumbest ive seen in a long time the unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you the acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy it appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building go out and get eurotrip or road trip instead i cant believe national lampoon put its name on this dont buy it dont rent it dont waste 2 hours of your life on this
