this movie actually hurts to watch not only did i not laugh once i ended up getting a serious headache at times i felt so sorry for the actors involved the best way to sum it up is to note that among sex comedies it is probably the least funny and least sexy of all time im only sorry i cant give it a vote of less than one to give this a rating of one is an insult to every movie that scores two or betterbr br now i see that theyre filming a sequel hearing that someone is actually paying these people to make another movie convinces me that theres just too much money in hollywood raise their taxes making a sequel to this movie may very well constitute a crime against humanity perhaps an international tribunal should be convened or un sanctions applied to the filmmakersbr br in short its a really bad movie really really
