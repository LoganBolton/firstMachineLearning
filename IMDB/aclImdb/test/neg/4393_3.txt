me and a buddy rented this movie the other day at first look it seemed to be another teen movie which was also what we hoped for being fans of simple horror and comedybr br it seems that the movie is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible it quickly accelerates into something that holds a lot of potential unfortunately it never quite leaves the ground we had watched it for something that seemed like 1 hour when i finally halfsleeping managed to say dude this movie sucks it was only 35 minutes actually dude agreedbr br the problem is the movie is simply not funny it was undoubtedly supposed to be funny but it failed it failed in a way that made me sad it kind of reminds me of myself i had the potential to be anything i wanted and instead i ended up watching cheap horrorfunny movies all the time i pity the makers of this movie from the bottom of my heart its so sad all that potential and nothing
