this has to be one of the biggest misfires everthe script was nice and could have ended a lot betterthe actors should have played better and maybe then i would have given this movie a slightly better grade maybe hollywood should remake this movie with some little better actors and better directorsorry guys for disappointment but the movie is badbr br if i had to rewatch it it would be like torture i dont want to spoil everyones opinion with mine somy advice is watch the movie firstsee if u like it and after votedo not vote before you watch it   and by the way have fun watching it  dont just peekwatch it till the end
