national lampoons dorm daze is easily the worst movie i have ever seen and ive seen the movie kazaam anyone reading this who thinks this movie was good in any way shape or form has no idea what a good movie is and should never watch another movie again because they are indeed so stupidbr br its hard to name everything wrong with this movie first off the plot is all over the place and cant follow all the multiple misunderstandings very well at all the acting is awful to say the least and the whole thing was poorly made any and all who worked on this movie should not be in another movie of any kid ever againbr br it is too hard to sum up this movie in just a paragraph or two because it is so bad but for anyone out there reading this please do not watch this movie if you want a good movie to watch go turn on anything else on television even usa has better movies than thisbr br friend
