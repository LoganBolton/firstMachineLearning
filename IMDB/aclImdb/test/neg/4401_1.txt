br br wont be long on this movie the first half an hour was one of the most boring i have had to face since ive started watching movies the story didnt advanced nothing was explained about any of the characters it felt like a nonmovie a lot of people had already left the audience at this pointbr br a lot of the scene were totally unjustified and unexplainedbr br the director should have studied film a bit more to know that each sequence each scene has to make the story go forward he never did thatbr br the supposedly funny moments were contrived and only a few people laughed people with a weird sense of humor i guessbr br prize of the jury in cannes 2002dont know what the jury was thinking aboutprobably the politicly correct effectbr br i would have loved to love it the disappointment was therefore even biggerbr br you have to see it to believe it but wait for the video
