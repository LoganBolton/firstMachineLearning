i was very concerned about this film it was scheduled to play at a jewish film festival and was reported to be very hostile to israel while using clever humor and ironybr br i was relieved that the film was not a diatribe however as a work of film it was deeply disappointing the film was full of random events some of which eventually connected most of which did not some of the events were very clever and funny but some were merely random and pointlessbr br there are repeated scenes between two lovers where they sit in a car wordlessly and play some handholding game perhaps in some cultures this is erotic but its like watching thumbwrestling after the third time it really became tiresomebr br i have always found david lynch to be gratuitously bizarre using strange stories and images to cause audiences to think that he is so sophisticated that they dont grasp his work in fact there is nothing to grasp the same is true here the stories do not add up to anything and there is not much of a political point being made in one scene a boisterous israeli soldier humiliates palestinian drivers at a checkpoint thats newsbr br i dont understand why this film has garnered controversy nor why it has garnered attention it is an inferior work and seeing it was a waste of time
