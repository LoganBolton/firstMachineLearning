i really wanted to like this film for all sorts of reasons  the subject matter is inherently interesting and is probably the major issue facing the world today and has thrown up fascinating works eg linda grants when i lived in modern timesusually from the israeli side of the fence also a bloke i like told me he thought it was the best film hed seen all year so with such a recommendationbr br however i actually found myself nodding off at points admittedly i was tired and the cinema seats comfy but i found it too much hard work trying to identify with the characters once id got my head round the idea that it was a series of vignettes i went with it but this made it disappointingly like a sketch show rather than a film i liked the concept of a restrained almost silent mise en scene contrasted to these utopian moments  the sexy girl the red balloon and the ninja muslim fighter but personally i think the film has been over hyped im not saying narrative and plot is everything its definitely not but even a little more dialogue would have helped
