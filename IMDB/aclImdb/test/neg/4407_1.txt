its not plot driven ok its not a character study fine theres no action alright theres no point hmmmbr br maybe its supposed to represent the boredom and absurdity of living in palistine and parts of israel these days in a state of violence petty disagreements deep rooted hostility etc but mostly its long long scenes of nothing happening  or things which look like theyre dripping with meaning a checkpoint tower crashing to the ground an arafat balloon floating into jerusalem a crouching tiger women deflecting bullets into a halo but when you try to derive some meaning theres no there therebr br bonus you can watch this film in fast forward and it will make absolutely no difference except that it might be slightly less boring
