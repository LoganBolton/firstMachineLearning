after looking for this bruceploitation for months and then accidentally buying it cheap it was disappointing i heard about it on a dvdr site and it sounded crazybr br but no what i got was a pretty bad martial arts movie the kung fuing wasnt too bad but the rest of the movie was pretty awful and made the movie seem really really long much longer then its 85 minute runtimebr br on a positive note the ape was funny for a couple of seconds especially when i think they took the only close up of its face from another movie and the black guy who pops up half way through was funny because of the one line he said which singlehandedly made all black people look like complete simpletonsbr br but it wasnt enough sadlybr br 410
