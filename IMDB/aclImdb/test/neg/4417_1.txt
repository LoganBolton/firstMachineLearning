for me its a case youll never understand if you didnt live it so read this to know why would i have such unlimited angerbr br i heard a lot about bruce lee my father loved him my mother who hates any minor shot of violence loved him  and how she talks till now about his  the big boss aka fists of fury  and the experience of watching it at the egyptian movies 1973 with all the gigantic success further to that i watched a real good movie about him dragon the bruce lee story  1993 so i found myself crying  where are your movies bruce  br br i went to the video store and it was dumb move youll know why  and waw i found a lot of bruce lee movies i selected one named bruce lee in new guinea br br i did it to myself and watched that one oh god please forgive your servant i harmed myself but with no intended decision i wouldnt do it if i knew its evil damaging  its mythical level of hideousness  br br after that i didnt understand at all whats the big fuss about bruce lee as a great immortal star  why anybody would care whether he is here or there this hero whom ive watched  is not that gifted and not that genius and of course is not that sexy  br br until my father saw this star and he asked me to pause at any of his close ups and after he examined his face a little he told me in a very definitive way this is not bruce lee  so i became too confused to ask  whos this silly guy anyway  br br it was 2001 2 years after my first entry to the imdb database therefore i tended to it immediately to know who the hell is that man and i discovered the truth he isnt bruce lee no my dear friends he is bruce li  br br and what a huge so huge difference  i just want to know who can love that bad clone  or god forbid  love his repulsive movies i watched 2 of them and couldnt bear finishing the third  br br after that i ignored all our video stores because its cheap cunning writing on the posters that this is bruce lee  and ive got the original the one and only bruce lee who is such a great star indeed and oh boy he certainly had the right to immortality and no less
