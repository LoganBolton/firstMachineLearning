this film is a hodgepodge of various idiotic cliches for instance boymeetsspoiltrichgirl and gets her to fall in love with him by harassing her in college an overused backdrop in recent indian commercial films a male chauvinistic glorification of sexual conquest the climax is predictable having been used ad nauseum in several other films as with many other recent commercial hindi films the film abounds with the incongruous insertion of songs which probably contributed to the films success more than anything else
