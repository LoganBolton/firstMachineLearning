this movie is a waste of time though it has actors who have the potential to do something decent the acting in the movie is subpar and has a clich√© point you never know whats going to happen tomorrow so live your life to the fullest and do what makes you happy that sentence saves you from wasting hours of your life on this movie people who like this movie are the same people who would enjoy sitting for two hours before finding that the entire movie was a dream sequence if the most important part of the movie isnt even going to happen at least make it enjoyable to watch and captivating theres a reason this project didnt make a theatrical release and though indy films can turn out very good this one does not even come close
