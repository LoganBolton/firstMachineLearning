director lo wei was known to read the racing papers and take naps on the set  tells us something about his approach to filmmaking huh the reviews ive read fall into two categories 1 this is a film so bad it is funny or 2 this is a film so bad it is boringbr br so lets get to the point we all agree on  this film is really badbr br i vote for category 2 the story is almost incomprehensibly complex and it is further shredded and twisted by the remarkably poor camera work and editing yet lo wei was so in love with it that he slows the pacing so we can all have a long look at it whether we want to or notbr br maybe lo wei was upset the day or two this film was made  he just wanted to make everybody suffer cast crew and audiences alikebr br spare yourself the agony
