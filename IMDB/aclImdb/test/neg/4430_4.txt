this tatty am dram adaptation scrambles soulessly through the plot of dickens wonderful book replacing the emotional impact with hurried transitions and any exterior locations with drawings its not the fault of the actors and the production team that the budget is so low of course but you have to question the point of making this in the first place when theres neither the time nor money to do it justice michael horderns scrooge is far too gentle at the outset making his transformation lack power and this isnt helped along by a lack of reaction from him as he watches the visions the other actors range from acceptable clive merrison paul copley to noncommittal bernard lee to seeming like theyre about to forget their lines john le mesurier it doesnt even score points for effort to be honest
