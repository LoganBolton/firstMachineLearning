when i think bollywood i think of lite feel good musical dance numbers with gorgeous outfits on the men and women and catchy tunes horror thrillers mystery and suspense dont come to mind though and this to my western eyes is like an abstract comedy br br i think it would have been a better movie shorter even if the writer and the director had made a definite choice either gone for outright thrillerhorror comedymystery supernaturalsuspense or musicalromance instead of an awkward mixture of them all br br ill have to say more than once i thought the director must have seen i know what you did last summer and tried to give it a bollywood twist my first film was bride  prejudice which i thought was acted well br br this seemed like what a western audience would consider a straight to video cheese festbr br the acting was over the top at times it felt like they were intentionally trying to parody western thrillers but when you saw them try to inject the dramatic crying screaming or fear it felt out of place br br the viewer was left wondering when one of the actors would wink at the camera more than a few times when the audience was supposed to be horrified we could only snicker a the absurdity br br i watch a lot of foreign films and even though i dont know hindi i have to say they did a poor job subtitling the film sometimes it was difficult to read the white lettering against the bright background br br the villain was particularly amusing at least to me because he came with his own mood music the supposed surprising twist actually felt like a cop outbr br the lead couples were handsomepretty enough and the musical numbers made it worth my rental fee id suggest it to someone as a musical comedy but id tell them to just fast forward the rest of the movie because it wasnt worth the effort of reading if youre determined to read a whole subtitled hindi flick then check out the superior romantic drama namasteay london br br but i was not scaredunless thats really what they think is horrifying in india 1 out of 10 for what its being touted as 6 out of 10 for its unintentional quickness  ability to illicit lots of laughs and its musicaldance numbers enjoy
