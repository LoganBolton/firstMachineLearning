ramsay  the kings of comedy or was it horror whatever wake after years of hibernation and yes i did get scared no not because of the horror element of course i am not that squeamish but because rats were constantly dancing on my feet in the khatmalchaap theatre where else do such movies runbr br so check the plot a man is repeatedly stabbed choked to death stuffed in plastic and dumped in a pool but he still returns to take revenge now was the film a thriller or a horror that itself is the suspense for you to discover and the end turns out to be another mask mystery remember those trademark ramsay undercover agents  men wearing some stupid horror masks only here the mask is of a human i suppose no more detailing is required to skip this flickbr br amarr upadhyay tends to get overdramatic and theatrical forgetting the difference between cinema and tv soaps a cheaply and skimpily dressed aditi gowitrikar in her typical pink lipstick looks like  uh you know whatbr br the background score is a straight lift from alfred hitchcocks psycho not a single department of the film whether technical or creative is worth commenting novelty lacks both in story and executionbr br dhund certainly fogs your senses
