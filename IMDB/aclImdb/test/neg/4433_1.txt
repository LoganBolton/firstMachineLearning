to call this film a disaster will be an understatement i dont even know where to begin i have questions though and lots of them i would like to know who conceived of this script who gave them money to make this film who was in charge of casting and costuming they should all be sued i saw this film in my local librarys catalog and i thought hey great i had just seen the two fog movies that hollywood had produced and then realised that bollywood had a version unbeknowst to me that it would turn out to be a total and utter crapfest br br dhund  the fog is a film about four friends actually just one of them but you should know that there are four friends one of them is a beauty queen played by indias 1st mrs world aditi govitrikar and the director spares no expense at letting you know this the script even claims that she the characters name is simran has aishwarya rai eyes kareena kapoor lips and rani mukherjee hair feel free to barf if you want to at least at this point you havent seen the film unlike poor me br br anyway simran receives a death threat one day from one of the contestants uncle who tells her to drop out of the contest so that his niece would have a better chance of winning but simrans boyfriend doesnt allow her to do this and thus she participates in the pageant and wins this causes the crackcocainesniffing uncle of her former college classmate tanya to come after her but with the help of her cousin kajal simran drowns the culprit and they enlist both their boyfriends in the task of getting rid of the body its tough but they eventually get around to doing itbr br in a scene that borrows from hollywoods film diabolique the pool where the dead body is hidden is drained only to reveal that the body is missing and this begins a conundrum of whodunit and whereisit by the time the film is over the film successful steals scenes from i know what you did last summer i still know scream 1 scream 2 scream 3 murder she wrote episodes and not to mention columbo and scooby doo shameless i tell yabr br inconsistencies and problems within the film include but are not limited to br br 1 a scantily clad simran answers phonecalls three times from her wouldbekiller the camera shows her drop the phone off the hook yet the phone is able to ring again each time and she picks it up to answer br br 2 tanya tries to kill herself because she doesnt win the beauty contest wtf even aishwarya rai who is ten time more beautiful did not attempt suicide when she didnt win miss indiabr br 3 in the pool scene the kids who come to retrieve the ball that has fallen into the pool conveniently disappear as soon as the police arrive and the ball disappears too br br 4 the clich√© blue contacts lenses of the killer change from blue to brown in the drowning scene yet when his corpse surfaces again his eyes are blue br br 5 nobody who dies in the film is mourned strange especially for indian societybr br 6 when vikram jumps into the dirty murky pool an underwater camera shows us his actions and miraculously the pool is transformed to olympic size and is clean and clear as day br br 7 sexy bellydancer performs a pseudoorgasm drenched song and dance number about coming of age that would have been cool for some bachelor party but they were celebrating simrans pageant win hello br br 8 kunal sameer simran and kajal can neither dance nor lip synch properly but dont blame them just accept that there was no choreographer for the dance numbersbr br 9 nothing within the film was choreographed it was like they just told the actors to show up and do whatever the want br br 10 the film played out like there was no script either that or the director was high and drunk when filming this junkbr br 11 when simrans picture was published without her consent in a magazine she flew to the police headquarters to have the photographers arrested yet she receives death threats and never bothers to alert the policebr br just to mention a few of course this film was a painful experience for me and i advise everyone to skip it by all means necessary and possible bollywood should be terribly ashamed of this kind of filmmaking
