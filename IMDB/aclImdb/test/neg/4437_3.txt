the best thing i can say about quintet is that its not quite as bad as i remembered it being on my first viewingbr br but that doesnt mean its goodbr br this weird scifi thriller is not quite like any other movie ive ever seen which i guess at least gives it the stamp of novelty but its a borderline disaster of a movie and one of the worst robert altman ever made on the dvd special feature about the making of quintet its clear that even altman didnt know what the hell the movie was supposed to bebr br its set in some distant future when the world is in the grip of another ice age the film was shot at the abandoned site of the montreal expo 67 and i do have to admit that this gives the movie some interesting production design elements even if much of it looks like its being filmed in an icedover shopping mall paul newman looking zonked out and absolutely disinterested in anything going on around him and brigitte fossey play drifters who wander into this futuristic city looking for newmans brother soon newman is caught up in a deadly game of quintet which all of the bored inhabitants play for lack of anything better to do and the rules of which are never made clear to the audience all we know is that the object of the game it to kill everyone else youre playing with and remain the only person alive this gives these nihilistic inhabitants their only thrill because as one of them says at one point in a psychobabblish soliloquy only by being near to death can one appreciate being alivebr br the movie is slow ugly and actually uncomfortable to watch due to its unrelenting gloominess its almost as if altman was purposely setting out to make a movie no one would want to sit through there arent characters  oh sure actors walk around speaking lines but none of the lines really means much and the impressive list of international actors altman assembled for this register not a whit only bibi andersson gives the closest thing to a memorable performance as could possibly be found in a movie like this but nevertheless it does succeed in establishing an atmosphere even if that atmosphere is one of pure awfulness and it is oddly fascinating in the way that watching a man slowly starve himself to death would be fascinatingbr br altman really hit a dry spell after nearly a decade of superb films quintet followed close on the heels of the atrocious a wedding and was followed in short order by the not bad but mostly forgettable a perfect couple the byallaccounts terrible health which ive never seen because its not available anywhere to see and the disastrous popeye thank god he reboundedbr br grade d
