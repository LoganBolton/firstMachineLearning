quintet is definitely not a film most people would find amusing or even interesting for that matter there is no scene dialog acting or plot development that would light a spark the icy world is one thing but muddled plot is something you really cant bear the characters are not only threedimensional theyre not even onedimensional there is no emotion and there is no sense in anything that goes on there is a world encased in ice where nobody is doing any meaningful work except playing quintet and the rules to the game are never even hinted the homes are not heated even there is electricity but who and what produces it there is wood but there are no animals except dogs so where do clothes come from or shoes for that matter since apparently there is no industry and everybody is dressed as in 16th century europe which is in odd contrast to not so futuristic pavilion backdrop the entire movie seams to be stuck inside altmans imagination and he never bothered to share his ideas or his vision with audience desolation or hopelessness have nothing to do with lack of appeal to this movie the world of george lucass thx1138 is no brighter place and characters are no more fun but the story has its path in quintet there is no obvious or even hinted path and in my opinion it doesnt even provoke thinking about the idea behind it all as for example similar film john boormans zardoz its not even done in altmans unique style so it doesnt appeal to his fanseither and im one of them all in all robert altman had a dream and he woke up without telling anybody what it meant not even to him
