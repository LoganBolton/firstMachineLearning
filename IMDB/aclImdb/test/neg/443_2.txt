perhaps im being too generous when i give this film two and a half stars out of five but there was an occasional moment however as an american werewolf movie this one is a missed chance there are no real plot connections to the superior original to speak of but the story is similar in some ways to londonbr br possible spoiler warning american kids go to foreign country one falls in love with a beautiful girl another one of the kids gets slaughtered by a werewolf in the same night that one gets bitten and despite his undead friends warnings by the light of the full moon he sprouts fur fangs and clawsbr br but there are some differences in the story for one the girl is one of the werewolves second there are three american kids and third theres some weird werewolf cult intent on taking over the world as crazy as it sounds that last one wasnt a joke spoiler endsbr br the films suffers from many things first the weak acting drags it down immensely tom everret scotts performance is amatuerish at best and he and julie delpy who plays his love interest dont seem to have any chemistry together at all second a weak script that seems to be all over the place many elements of suspense and dark comedy that made the original one great are missing in this one and whoever said that eating out the heart of the werewolf that bit you will change you back human last i heard this wasnt part of werewolf lore at all third terrible special effects the werewolf effects are done with computer animation which works for things such as dinosaurs ghosts and space ships but seems choppy fake and artificial when used for furry creatures like werewolvesbr br however there were a few things that saved this one from total turkeydom theres one hilarious scene in a paris cafe when andy scott is having coffee with serafine delpy he drops a bunch of condoms on the table and tries to pass them off as chewing gum by chewing and blowing a bubble also the soundtrack a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like bush and smashmouth although none of the songs have the word moon in their title like the original movie the soundtrack is great nontheless and another funny scene when a rotting corpse played by julie bowen attempts to whistle and her eyeball pops out had me laughing out loudbr br but as a whole this film seems to lack the wit and suspense of the original and the overly contrived ending doesnt help it out much eitherbr br 12 two and a half out of five stars average
