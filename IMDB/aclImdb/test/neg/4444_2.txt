altmans quintet has to be considered more than just flawed as so many other reviewers have pointed out the ideas behind the film even some of the choices in depicting those ideas ought to workand yet very little in this difficult film does the partially fogged camera lensi remarked to my wife that it has to be the most distracting directorial conceit ive ever seennever allowed me to get into the films worldbr br in general there are serious problems with the miseenscene employed here its clear that no small amount of thought went into factors like costume and production design but neither is very effective in evoking a believable world perhaps it is a matter of scale the film is so stagebound that i laughed out loud once it was mentioned that five million people lived in the city yes i understand the constraints of the films budget matte paintings here and there might have helped in all the most disappointing altman film ive ever seen great ideas and grand metaphors do not always come through in artits just part of the game
