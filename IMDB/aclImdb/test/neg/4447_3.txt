seriously all these satan comes to earth movies always involve the catholics why doesnt lucifer ever mess with the other denominationsbr br the plot is that asmodeus played by former jason vorhees kane hodder has a plot to become human but wasnt he always a demon by getting this young girl who is his sister pregnant with his child except maybe she isnt his sister the plot isnt clear on this and they intersplice these scenes where he is seeing a shrink about his problembr br the lead girl gets pregnant while still a virgin with an incredibly creepy scene of her father giving her a gynecological exam to prove her hymen is still intact eeeewwwwww her sister played by a washed up and looking much worse for wear denise crosby concludes that this is a sign from heaven praise be br br well the demon baby takes moms body for a joy ride and picks off in order a truck driver her friends boyfriend and her friend all being watched by an exmilitary priest whose mission is to kill the baby when it is born we discover that asmodeus is actually a catholic cardinal who is running the whole thingbr br the ending is pretty much incomprehensible and if you could make it that far straight through you have a stronger stomach than i did i paused the film a couple of times it was so awful
