god that sucked you cant end a horror movie with a happilyeverafter family setting yeash i was kind of ambivalent going in to the final act but my god he didnt have to kill the girl she didnt die the ghost father appears with a cure which makes no sense because his spirit would have been liberated after the yank kid killed all the bad werewolves what a hunk of junk this is the worst horror movie ive seen in a long time and ive watched a lot of horror movies this is a slap in the face for landis and everyone else involved in american werewolf in london blegh i hope that this ruined the career of every one in it bar julie delphy and cgi kind of new and chic back in 1997 but today it just looks drab compared to the artful prostheticmakeup work of london anyway im done i hope ive scared a few people of get the original instead or failing that the howling or failing that watch american idol reruns just dont watch this mess
