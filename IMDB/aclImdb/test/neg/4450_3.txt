i just watched that movie and was pretty disappointed i didnt expect much to begin with as the premise of the movie doesnt suggest greatness anyway sadly it doesnt even manage to deliver just as stupid entertainment the main problem is probably the acting while ive seen far worse actors in far worse movies the story would require some people to act out as violent maniacs some others as people caught a in really stressing predicament and they fail to deliver that although i watched the german release i watched with the original audio so its definitely not just bad voiceovers or anything like that added to that the german dvd release seems to be cut the killings are all pretty much left out meaning that except for a few semigory scenes closer to the end the german release doesnt deliver as a movie for gorehounds either cant comment on that for other releases of course the plot has some stupid moments thrown in here and there and the beginning is just hilarious ever heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist too bad the movie takes itself far too seriously if it was filmed as a horrorcomedy and changed a bit here and there accordingly it might have worked better the ending is just a huge disappointmentbr br if youve got really nothing better to do and just cant stand the boredom anymore you might and its really a weak might consider this movie if theres anything else available to watch or do pick that alternative
