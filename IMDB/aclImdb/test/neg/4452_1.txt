this must rank as one of cinemas greatest debacles i was wandering europe at the time and had the misfortune to stumble upon the crew making this movie in what was even then one of the worlds idyllic unspoiled settings i was enlisted as an extra and what followed was an exhibition of modern day debauchery forget all the accusations youve ever heard of peter mayalls intrusions on this rare piece of french life geoff reeve and his cohorts embarked on a level of revelry at the restaurant at les beaux that left the maitred slackjawed in disbelief they were quite simply awful uncultured and undeserving of french hospitality
