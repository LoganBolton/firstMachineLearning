its weird this film you get the impression that the makers of this snoozefest spent more time in the local bars than on set in fact its a surprise not to see harry alan towers name on the credits it certainly has the flavour of one of his taxshelter productions but here the motivation behind the project seems to be for all involved to enjoy a prolonged stay in provence despite the fact that the film is supposed to take place all over the region les baux and the area around it stands in for almost everythingbr br david birney makes for a spectacularly colourless hero  as michael lonsdale says at one point youre a walking clich√© what lonsdale is doing in this is anyones guess for some reason the most interesting character played by rampling is sidelined whereas regardless of the book she should have been the central figure because she clearly has the skill to carry the movie which would have been dull anyway but at least wed have got more of something pretty to look atbr br all in all a pointless affair that is only worth watching to see how actionless an action movie can be
