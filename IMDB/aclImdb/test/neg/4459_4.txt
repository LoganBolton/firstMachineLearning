though i had sort of enjoyed the satanic rites of dracula 1974 i knew i shouldnt expect too much from its even more maligned predecessor surely the least of the hammer draculas marcus hearn on the audio commentary for the creeping flesh 1973 even goes so far as to call it the studios nadir the film really flounders due to its totally unhip  and now embarrassingly dated  updating of the myth the modernday setting actually suited satanic rites rather bettereven if truth be told its still vastly preferable to dreck like dracula 2000 2000 or van helsing 2004br br despite christopher lees vociferous bashing of the film he still cuts an undeniably striking figure as the undead vampire even if he appears very little and is inexplicably confined to one setting likewise peter cushing delivers his usual committed performance the only other noteworthy acting job in the film is that given by christopher neame son of director ronald as johnny alucard  even if thats only because of how unbelievably hammy it is unfortunately the two bestknown female members of the cast both of them horror regulars  stephanie beacham and caroline munro  cant rise above their physical attributesbr br the camerawork is by dick bush who had shot the blood on satans claw 1971 and for hammer when dinosaurs ruled the earth 1970 and twins of evil 1971  but is perhaps best known for his longtime association with ken russell which manages some nice atmosphere throughout especially during three crucial sequences the carriageride scuffle at the properly gothic beginning the hysterical black mass sequence followed by the resuscitation of dracula and the final confrontation between lee and cushings van helsing
