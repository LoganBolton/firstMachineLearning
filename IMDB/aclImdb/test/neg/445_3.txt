once upon a time there was a great american film which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills this film featured clever direction groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting it was entitled an american werewolf in london sixteen years later the long awaited sequel was finally pinned onto the poster board outside your local theater surely it would have at least some of the thrills of the original think again an american werewolf in paris is an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish the problems begin with the leading man tom everett scotts performance is stiff and tiresome from the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are simpletons in his defense not even a seasoned shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue at one point one of scotts deceased friends whos soul is doomed to walk the earth after being carved up by one of the werewolves is finally able to leave for the afterlife he then quips to scott and his friends okay guys see ya what a memorable goodbye julie delphy soon shows up as scotts mysterious european love interest basically shes a french girl playing the french girl it isnt much of a stretch but all this stupidity isnt even the most disappointing thing about the film the special effects such an integral part of the superb original film fall far short in this flop the werewolves look like cartoons and no matter how well you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles its still hard to get scared of a cartoon so instead the vacationing american gang led by the ultra weak scott keep finding excuses to return to the werewolfs catacombs lair here its much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness some have said that if you dont look on this film as a sequel its not as bad by comparison i disagree this film can not stand on its own and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original if it doesnt want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 film i  dont care how much you love werewolves or how much you worshiped american werewolf in london as i myself did this one is simply not worth wasting your time okay guys see ya terrible 3 out of a possible 10 th
