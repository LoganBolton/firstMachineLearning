veteran british television director alan gibsons dracula ad 1972 qualifies as one of the least appetizing entries in the hammer studios series about bram stokers immortal bloodsucker actually this represented the first time since terence fishers memorable horror of dracula 1958 that christopher lee and peter cushing fought each other as mortal enemies they would reprise the same roles a few years later in the final hammer dracula the satanic rites of dracula further it was the secondtolast dracula for hammer in which lee performed as the infamous fangster for the record dracula ad 1972 was the seventh hammer draculabr br the exciting prologue from 1872 prepares you for something vastly different than what the rest of this disappointing horror flick yields eternal rivals count dracula and his nemesis professor lawrence van helsing are literally at each others throats atop a runaway carriage in londons hyde park for a vigorous opening scene that makes everything else look comparatively anticlimactic the carriage crashes and dracula emerges hugging half of a wooden wheel with its shattered spokes embedded in his chest of course christopher lee has to grip this broken wheel against his body but the imagery is striking enough in its own way to pass muster the count expires and so does his opponent van helsing however one of draculas disciples snatches the counts ring and scoops some of the vampires ashes into a vial for safekeepingbr br don houghtons screenplay hurtles the action ahead a hundred years to swinging london in 1972 we meet a smarmy young man johnny alucard christopher neame of no blade of grass who loves to raise hell with a group of hippies that crash parties and drive the british police with their antics alucard happens to be the descendant of one of draculas servants now alucard has the counts ring and a vial of his dehydrated blood alucard chooses the sight of a desecrated church to arrange a black mass he invites his trendy friends among them laura super sexy carolina munro of the spy who loved me gayner marsha hunt and jessica van helsing stephanie beacham to attend this black mass because it offers them something different not surprisingly they resurrect the count and the evil bloodsucker sets his eyes on jessica meanwhile after lauras body is discovered drained of blood scotland yard inspector murray michael coles of doctor who and the dalkes solicits help from van helsings modern day offspring lorrimar peter cushing dracula wants to exact revenge on van helsing by taking the latters granddaughter as his bride lorrimar tracks down alucard they fight in his chelsea apartment and the young vampire drowns in a tub of water remember running water is just as lethal to vampires as sunlight and crucifix van helsing finds dracula in the deserted church with his daughter awaiting the count van helsing and dracula tangle van helsing flings holy water into draculas face the vampire falls into an open gravesite with a stake awaiting him and he decomposes againbr br the chief problem with dracula ad 1972 is that we dont get enough of lee as the count though we do get considerably more of cushing as van helsing furthermore scenarist don houghton keeps dracula confined to the ramshackle church and never allows the vampire to venture out into the city despite its low budget dracula ad 1972 could have been a lot better the scene where the contemporary van helsing has to jot down alucard and spell it backwards to get dracula seems almost laughable youd think that hed know about this backwards spelling trick unless you are afraid of horror movies this one will make you yawn occasionally gibson presents us with a superb closeup of dracula with his bared fangs and bloodshot eyes but this is about as scary as this chiller gets and that isnt saying much
