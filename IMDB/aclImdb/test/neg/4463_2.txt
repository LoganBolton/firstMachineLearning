film starts off great in 1872 with a violent bloody fight between dracula christopher lee and van helsing peter cushing dracula is impaled and dissolves to dustvan helsing also dies somebody gathers draculas ashes and buries them in the grounds of a church cut to 1972heres where the film falls apartbr br we are instantly hit over the head with loud bad 70s music horrible fashions and silly dialogue when this was made hammer was losing money and decided to try anything to get a hit putting dracula in the 1970s was not a good idea the fashions music and dialogue date the movie horribly were introduced to a bunch of annoying kids in their 20s who decide to have a black massfor a giggle naturally they have it at the church now abandoned and naturally revive dracula its a good thing a descendant of van helsing is aroundbut dracula goes after his niece stephanie beacham in revengebr br lee and cushing are great as always in their roles and whenever theyre on screen the movie gets a muchneeded shot of energy the opening and ending battles are the highlights of the film although the ending is spoiled a lot by playing lousy 70s music also the main ringleader of the kids is named johnny alucard christopher neamea truly stupid name that dates back to the 1940s the film also has scream queen caroline munro looking absolutely great the film is welldirected and pretty wellacted but the plot is stupid the constant barrage of 70s fashion dialogue and music gets annoying real quick and i was basically bored sillybr br most hammer fans agreethis was one of the worst dracula moviesits followup satantic rites of dracula was the worstand the last hammer dracula film this gets a 2just for cushing and lee
