in this desperate and thoroughly silly attempt to keep hammers dracula franchise alive despite having lost most of its power long time already our legendary vampire is brought back to life in the swinging london of 1972 exactly hundred years after he was destroyed by his archenemy van helsing an occult disciple named johnny alucard get it get it gathers his flamboyant friends in an abandoned church among them van helsings great granddaughter jessica and performs a satanic ritual that resurrects dracula in a haze of smoke draculas only mission is to wreak havoc upon the entire van helsing lineage and fragile jessica is the ideal victim to achieve this this is probably the only 70s film that goes immensely over the top in trying to look likea 70s film considering the previous six dracula films were all set in the victorian era director alan gibson really wants to stress the fact were in the 20th century now and thus he stuffs his film with insufferable hippiecharacters hideous 70s fashion trends and awful 70s music christopher lee and peter cushing seem hopelessly lost in this setting and their performances regretfully show it the opening sequence a flashback and the showdown climax are fairly enjoyable but everything in between is painfully boring and the complete opposite of scary the greatest elements in this series of films have always been draculas dark castles and the exhilarating coach races and obviously this installment lacks all of that luckily for the fans hammer studios contemporary released other films revolving on vampires that are much better the vampire lovers twins of evil the legend of the seven golden vampires not recommended
