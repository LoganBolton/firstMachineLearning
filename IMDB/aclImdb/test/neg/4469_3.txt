very serious spoilersbr br this movie was a huge disappointment there are so many problems i dont know where to start so ill talk about what is good about the filmbr br the cast was great steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy queen latifah plays a big beautiful urban black gal and eugene levy well he pretty much plays himself add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast  everyone played their parts really well and if watching these guys for 175 hours is worth 8 to you then you wont be disappointedbr br but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone all the white people are uptight bigots all the black people are ghetto ebonicsspeakers the blacks are hip cool withit and poor the whites are nerds stiff and rich except eugene levy he is clearly taken with queen latifa and speaks the lingo  so latifa nicknames him a freak so  if youre a white man and you like black women and you know street slang you must be a freak the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobsbr br putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character she comes to martins home under false pretense but martin takes a liking to her anyway shes supposed to be wrongly accused of robbery martin takes up her cause 34 of the way through the film we find out latifas character escaped from jail so our sympathy for her goes out the windowbr br there is no real plot the movie plods along from scene to scene with latifa showing up in some place where shes not supposed to be like a country club or martins house and martin trying to hide her thats the running gag then in the last minutes of the film they decide that theyre going to finally deal with latifas assertion that she was wrongly accused of bank robbery martin goes under cover as a homeboy to extract a lets face it unusable confession from latifas ex boyfriend and everyone lives happily ever afterbr br finally but there is a lot more wrong with this flick this movie appears to be a hodgepodge of clips from other movies the premise is clearly borrowed from another martin movie the housesitter where goldie hawn comes to live with martin and shakes up his stodgy middleclass life martin and latifa meet online  ala youve got mail the whole quirky nanny fixes rich mans life goes as far back as the sound of music and mary poppinsbr br i wouldnt see this movie again for free
