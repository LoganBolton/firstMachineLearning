cmon lets put aside the sophomoric humor that we can find in racism and be honestit isnt funny i was appalled at the fact that the two main stars would agree to do a film that was so offensive and so detrimental to race relations and im not referring to the obvious blackwhite commentary in the movie but to the slams towards other ethnicities such as betty whites characterizations of the hispanics should we just chalk up her agreeing to do this movie as a sign of senilityis she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotypical trash or is it the fault of the writers how about the third assistant makeup person nope the fault is with us for perpetuating this kind of crap in the guise of comedy that hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say enough is enoughracism is for real and it isnt a laughing matter were all different lets celebrate that diversity not poke fun at it and promote divisiveness
