steve martin has always had my respect for being a very funny comedian and a pretty good actor and i loved planes trains and automobiles and bowfinger  but bringing down the house definately isnt one of martins funniest works and it doesnt even seem as if its trying to be which is just plain sadbr br i dont know maybe i didnt like this movie because of the fact that i rented it along with harry potter and the chamber of secrets and phone booth both of which are excellent films or maybe its because im used to so much better from martin or maybe its just because im in a frickin bad mood todayregardless this film just wasnt very funny or entertaining and i never managed more than a smile or a weak chuckle at the films gags which is really a shame since the previews of this comedy were so promising i was expecting bringing down the house to be an allout comedy bash and i certainly expected more slapstick comedy and interracial laughs from martin instead were treated to seeing queen latifah jiggle all over the screen trying to do her best with her totally uninspired character the funniest thing in this clunker is eugene levy but even he doesnt get the screentime he deservesbr br i wouldve really liked to enjoy bringing down the house but i didnt and id find it very difficult to recommend it to anyone but the most diehard steve martin fans skip this one and rent planes trains and automobiles insteadbr br youll have a much better time
