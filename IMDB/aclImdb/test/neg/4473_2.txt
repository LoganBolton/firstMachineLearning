hollywood will stop at nothing to make money on a film even if they have to keep dragging out stereotypes and putting them in the most impossible and stupid situations this effort is a clear example of that and i really do believe in my heart that a film like this is racially irresponsible story is about a divorced lawyer named peter sanderson steve martin who has been chatting with a lady on his computer and when he finally meets her she turns out to be the opposite of what he was expecting charlene morton queen latifah is a stocky black woman who has no intentions of dating peter but instead wants him to look at her case where she was convicted of robbery he wants her to leave for good but she keeps popping up at inappropriate times and to save his job he reluctantly agrees to look at the facts involving her casebr br spoiler alertbr br peter has his kids staying with him and charlene turns out to be helpful in raising them but suddenly a news bulletin announces that an escaped convict named charlene morton has broken out of prison peter tells her to leave when the fbi comes snooping around but he figures out that she is in fact innocent when her old boyfriend shows up and threatens himbr br this film is directed by adam shankman who keeps things moving at a nice pace and it is a good looking film technically speaking but the script is just so improbable and every character is a stereotype to the point that a 1970 film called the landlord is clearly more in tune with race relations than this mess i have always been a big fan of martin and i think hes one of the most talented persons around but he loves to work constantly and at times just seems to pick any script handed to him on the other hand ive always had a problem with latifah and the way she barges into the life of martin is so over the top that she instantly becomes ingratiating basic premise that hollywood loves to use is the hip black person showing uptight whitey to loosen up and then pass on some street logic that will help them with their lives thats basically what the story is here but of course they have to let martin dress black and overact like a retarded eminem because hollywood knows that this is what viewers want well i was pretty much insulted by everything in this film and its not because i dont have a sense of humor but unfortunately for hollywood anyway i use logic and common sense when i watch a film yes i enjoyed eugene levys talking jive but are we really suppose to believe that he would be instantly attracted to latifah i guess weirder things have happened and how many times does a main actor get shot only to be saved by something in their pocket wouldnt a cell phone shatter if struck by a bullet even if your the most die hard martin and latifah fan i wouldnt recommend this i know ive said this before but this isnt an attempt to make a good film its an excuse to try and make money
