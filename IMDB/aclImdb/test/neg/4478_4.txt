i had high hopes when i went into the theatre having seen the trailer i was as hyped as the next person to see great talent participate in the making of a story with a beautiful premisebr br however its disappointing to see this talent laid waste by the poor composition of songsthe words are chunky and cheesy probably because it was composed with a more western theme i wouldnt find it difficult to imagine the same melodies with french or english lyrics in mandarin they just sound strangebr br the musical items were also cut together badly far too quickly to be enjoyable and the shots of the actors looking anguished lasted far too longbr br the special effects are the next disappointment suffice it to say it is highly obvious where the special effects start and stopbr br its not moulin rouge and its not in the mood either inspite of the occasional and very similar slow waltz theme altogether and hour too long to tell a simple story
