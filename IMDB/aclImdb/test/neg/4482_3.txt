today being presidents day my wife and i had the notebook dvd checked out at our local library its a movie released in 2004 that fell beneath our radar as we are big movie goers im a published author with hopes of screen playing my first book id noticed references to the notebook in reviews of other movies which is why i brought it up about us watching and this morning provided the perfect opportunity we both really liked it it made my wife cry we could relate to many things in it with our own continuing love affair and even i fought back choking upbr br this afternoon after lots of chores yard work and eating we decided to actually catch a matinée when we got to the theater having seen most of the current batch of films playing we elected to see victoria day which for some reason was not at the theater even though both imdb and my phone movies showed it playing there so instead we looked at the poster for dear john and that it was written by the same writer as the notebook making it the obvious choice as we enjoyed tn so muchbr br what a disappointment first the characters did not have the same believability or sense of empathy as tn and we kept commenting throughout all the similarities  two dozen or so  quickly causing us to realize this movie was nothing but as another reviewer commented a poor mans notebook it had a real cash cow feeling meaning the sparks simply threw a story together based on the exact template of tn simply to make a quick buck not only that after the bugeyed trollop improbably dear johnsjohn for the wimp cancer patient we ridiculed the movie with each passing soapy stupid line all the way through to the end there were only about 6 of us in the theater during this 445pm monday matinée and my wife even told me to keep it down so i wouldnt ruin it for the othersit was so badbr br seeing this on the heels of tn ensured that the rip off similarities were vividly recognizable and sparks blatant cheap attempt at template writing painfully obvious we only wish we couldve seen victoria day insteadno matter how bad it mightve been after seeing this poor entry to cinema and oh for the last 30minutes i kept saying dont give that cow the coins dont give that cow the coins
