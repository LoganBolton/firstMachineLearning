after reading the reviews i am so relieved to know that i am not the only person who was very disappointed in this movie i am a huge nicholas sparks fan have read all of his books most of them more than once of course i loved the notebook and a walk to rememberi havent yet seen message in a bottle or nights in rodanthe so i cant comment on thosebr br but i did go see dear john this past weekend and i was terribly upset the movie was not good at all when looking at the movie alone and not thinking about the book at all it was still a terrible movie i did not get the rush and range of emotions from this movie that i have got from other movies i enjoyed especially the notebook i was not smiling and laughing and crying and worried and scaredever from the very beginning all i could notice was how they changed everything the only thing about this movie that is similar to the book is that there is a guy named john who is in the military and a girl named savannah who is notthe part about his dad being obsessed with coins is about the only other part that went along with the book everything else was totally off first of all in the book allen was tims little brother not his son why they had to change that i dont understand it made a lot more sense how it went in the book when tim was just a little bit older than savannah and they grew up together and allen was savannahs inspiration for wanting to work with horses and autistic childrenthat didnt happen in the movieughand in the book they spent a lot more time together than just those initial 2 weeks and then the 1 nightwhy did they leave those times out i could go on and on and on but then i would run out of space so basically if you are a great fan of nicholas sparks dont waste your time or money on this moviejust read the book againbecause its terrible and nothing like the book
