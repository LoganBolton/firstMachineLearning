the only reason i rated this film as 2 is because channing tatumis beautiful however the whole film lacks emotion and was boring to watch usually i adore a good romance but this was just a waste of time i didnt shed a tear despite it containing sad content it just wasnt acted very well at all im no film critic but i just advise girls to avoid this really unless the only reason youre watching it is to see channing tatum lol the rest of the film is rubbish and if he wasnt in it not that his acting was any good i would have stopped watching much quicker its a shame really because if the right actors were chosen for this film it could have had the potential to be a real tear jerker  if youre looking for a good cry or a film for a girly night ingive this one a miss
