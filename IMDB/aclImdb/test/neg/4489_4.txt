having read this story a while ago i was very excited to see the movie i read the book again it is one of my favorite nicholas sparks books what i think what makes the story is the relationships that was the down point for me in the movie because i think the relationships were poorly expressed in the movie i have no idea what the point of changing main characters roles tims and alans characters the movie didnt at all capture john and savannahs relationship maybe if you havent read the book you might like this movie but i thought it was so dull compared to the book i thought channing was a great pick for johnbut i had a feeling he was going to bring all young adults out to watch it so i think it was more geared towards them the ending cuts the whole point of the book out so i was also unhappy with that i was hoping the movie was more like the notebook or a walk to remember and the way they captured the books i do feel like i wasted a friday night out and 10 bucks on a sappy love story not at all the story i was expecting to see
