lets describe larry as an interviewer a complete suckhole in every way possible he laughs at all his guests jokes he asks the most boring questions and he would never dare contradict them he hits me as the type of person who wants to be liked byeveryone friendly boring olpredictable harry he probably owes his success to being a dream interviewer for celebrities because they dont get bombarded with what we the people want to know and have a right to know lets put it this way he interviews as if hes in a red country 0210 2 for the guests that come on the show yet it all seems pointless when larry starts asking his mind numbing questions such as whats it like to be a mother followed by the usual answer along the lines of being a mother is the greatest thing that ever happened to me its wonderful but tiring
