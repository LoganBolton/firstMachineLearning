i suspect this board will soon be full of comments from overemotional people praising dear john as a pearl and a rollercoaster ride and all the other vacuous words this films target audience typically employsbr br i am most definitely not this films target audience but i do not dislike romantic dramas either as long as they are well made so here is my objective take on the flickbr br it is not goodbr br its not a bad movie either but the plot meanders development stagnates where it shouldve been moving forward right around the middle to be precise and as for the endingit almost felt as if they had run out of ideas so they suddenly said hey lets just film a last scene real quick put some sentimental string soundtrack over it and end it that way even amanda seyfrieds beauty could not save this channing tatum too gave a good performance but you can only do so much with a flawed scriptbr br speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy from the smokey voiced irritatingly highpitched female folk singer schtick surely chosen to appeal to the majority of collegeage girls that will go see this movie to the overused shimmering strings and piano combo it only annoys anyone paying more attention to the film as a whole rather than to his own feelings the film has a good beginning and the major conflict that launches us into the second act were all promising so was part of the second act itself as the story unfolded then the film just dropped the ball beyond that id have to give spoilersbr br dear john is not a bad movie but it doesnt work as it should either if you want to see a truly moving film about prolonged love waiting to be reunited go watch notebook which was truly superb
