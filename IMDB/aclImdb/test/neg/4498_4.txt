it must be remembered that the gammera movies like many of the firstseries gozilla films were in fact aimed squarely at kids little kenny and his cohorts are living out the daydreams of the kids in the audience they get to run around and play with topsecret stuff while the adults stand by and allow it they get to cavort with monsters and even when the bad guys enter they are never in any real dangerbr br perhaps the first gammera film is an aberration because the child does get punished and is put into danger but the rest of the series is pure wish fulfillmentbr br as one critic said these arent failed adult movies but successful kids movies
