having been a godzilla fan for many years gamera was to me a cheap knockoff to capitalize on the success of tohos 1 kaiju star attack of the monsters was for me at the time 1975 an almost painful viewing experiencebr br last weekend i attended the annual godzilla fest known as gfest where carl craig one of the stars of gamera vs viras made an appearance of course they featured this movie it was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made of course you have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it in one scene for example the boy scouts held prisoner on board the alien space craft manage to escape by distracting the nottoobright aliens when they realize theyve been duped one of them says thats funnyi think those kids lied to us not even plan nine from outer space can boast that kind of dialogbr br this may not be godzilla or even gamera 3 but this one is a decent enough time waster if you watch it in the right frame of mindbr br however if you want top quality kaiju entertainment check out the recently released gamera 3br br rating 12 out of
