i actually saw the evil on the big screen i saw it as part of a double feature during the early 1980s dont remember the other film when i was in my midteens the film is bad cringeworthy bad embarrassingly bad the effects are atrocious you can clearly see the cable pulling the black girl across the floor theres absolutely nothing scary about it in fact i laughed throughout the filmbr br the story tried to create this big built up for the climax when were suppose to finally see whos responsible for all the evil goings on and we see greasy victor buono whos as scary as an overstuffed twinkie seriously what where they thinking buono who was a villain on the batman tv series is one of the hammiest actors ever to grace the big screen and i just cannot imagine anyone being remotely terrified of himbr br the evil is all but forgotten now for good reasonsbut its actually a very funny film and i wish i could see this turkey again just to see that black girl being pulled across the room by an unseen force with that very visible cable
