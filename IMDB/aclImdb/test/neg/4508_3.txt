victor buono as the devil surely somebody must have been drunk when that casting decision was made thats not the worst part of this silly mishmash of sundry haunted house devices but it gets my vote for being the funniest part of it while the film is by no means terrible it doesnt even approach other 1970s haunted house flicks like amityville horror the changeling and the legend of hell house the evil can be entertaining in spots but dont expect to be scared its better approached as what it is a silly horror film made all the sillier by its overserious approach
