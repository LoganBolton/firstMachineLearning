this is truly abysmal i just got a copy of disco beaver from outer space after hearing good things about it and i have to say this was just so incredibly unfunny and bad it will leave you numb and mystified how this ever got madebr br i mean what was it is it that this is typical late 70s humor i dont think so this is just so bad and believe me i dont mean so bad its good either this is a collection of extremely unfunny skits as if you are watching cable tv sure enough this was an hbo program and to think this may have been considered groundbreaking is scarybr br there is one somewhat pretty girl in it and there is some old nhl footage of the ny islanders hockey team which is fun to see even though i am a lifelong ny rangers fan but they even mess that up as they try to get some humor out of two hockey players scuffling on the ice as if they are dancing and even worse reverse the videotape of two hockey players fighting to make it look like they are having sex oh how funny in one slight bit of cleverness there is an interview a hockey player named chico who resembles ny islander goalie chico resch but they even blow this by having him wear a rangers jersey well maybe that was intentional who knowsbr br the bottom line is disco beaver is just so blatantly horrible so unbelievably bad you will definitely feel cheated after watching this and wasting almost an hour of your life youll wonder what possibly made the makers of this garbage think they had something funny here and youll also wonder why these skits cant even come close to the worst saturday night night slop incredible just incredible
