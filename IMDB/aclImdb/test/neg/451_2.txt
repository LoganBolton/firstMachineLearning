to be fair i didnt see a lot of this show probably because it wasnt as good as the original mash but i seem to recall them moving it around on the weekly schedule some shows just arent worth the trouble of following around every week but i really did try at first so it wasnt all bad maybe i just kept expecting it to improve but i cant give this show a 1 in all honesty i cant give it any more than a 2 eitherbr br it wasnt mash im not going to type those stupid s every time and it was trying to be mash without putting forth any effort like it would just magically happen well guess what no magic the best i can do here is to compare it to other showsbr br trapper john md was a much better show by far however they should have called it bj hunnicut md because pernell roberts looked exactly like an older bj but nothing at all like trapper john keep everything else the same just change his name and the name of the show presto after mash wasnt the only sequel to completely bomb and dishonor the original archie bunkers place was a lame followup to all in the family it had no heart no conflict no depth Â– all of the things that made all in the family so memorable likewise mash was funny because the doctors were reacting to the impossible absurdity of war remove the war and you remove the drive for 99 of the humor potter cant yell at klinger for wearing a dress because klinger isnt wearing a dress because hes not trying to get kicked out of the army because hes already out of the army because the war is over breathe all of the jokes became forced because there was no motivation for anything the least motivated was the viewer to stay around and watch the showbr br and from what i remember the whole show seemed to be potter klinger and mulcahy just standing there unnaturally facing the audience like a trio of vaudeville performers it was reminiscent of good times where they spent 90 of the show standing behind that couch and talking to the audience trying to make it look like they were having natural conversation they werent and it felt even less natural on after mashbr br another random tidbit i recall is that the people who made mash never got any royalties from the spinoff the studio used the absurd excuse that after mash was really a spinoff of the movie mash which they owned and not the tv series nice try but mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie and he was never deaf i guess studio execs will do anything for a buck anything other than make a worthwhile sequel that is
