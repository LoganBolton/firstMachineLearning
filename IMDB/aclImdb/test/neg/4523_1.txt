i have never seen the tv series or the previous movies probably thats the reason why i didnt enjoy it much boring and just not funny sums it up nicelybr br considering the budget the movie seemed to have its embarrassing they couldnt do an even passable jobbr br we went to the cinema with no exceptions at all and the hope to see a somewhat funny movie that wouldnt be too taxing on the mind my friend fell asleep halfway through the movie and i spend the next 2 hours hoping that it would finally pick up a hope which died with the end credits
