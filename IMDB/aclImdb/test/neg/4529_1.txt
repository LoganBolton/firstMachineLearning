this movie sucked the problem was not with the cast i think the cast was great lots of good talent lots of great acting but the script was terrible it seemed to be mostly just a frame work in which steve carrell could do his improv and that is what he does best but it just didnt work here the script was hard to follow the story was nonsensical and scenes were random and lacked direction also much of the action was extremely contrived and poorly thought out it was a good effort but as max says they missed it by that much i am shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this stinker here on the imdb obviously the movie producers are getting people to write lots of positive reviews on their movies and fill up the entries on the imdb if you read the positive reviews and compare them to the negative reviews it is pretty clear which ones are genuine reviews from normal usersbr br this movie was full of problems and jokes that just didnt work i loved steve carrell in anchor man and i like his comedy and style but i will tell you that i never once laughed while i was watching this movie yes i had a couple of light moments a couple of chuckles but no real laughs nothing that struck me at allbr br spoiler alert one ridiculous scene was when max had his hands binded on the airplane and he goes to the bathroom to try to escape he uses his special swiss army knifebut instead of just using the blade of the knife he tries to shoot the binding with his miniature crossbow and as the crossbow missfires and shoots little arrows into him over and over again almost putting out his eye max doesnt give up or try the blade insteadno he just keeps shooting himself with the crossbow what was he really expecting to do with that crossbow it seemed to be the worst option on the knife to try to remove the bindings it just made absolutely no sensebr br that is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that made up this movie they were ridiculous poorly thought out poorly motivated and made of pure nonsense and that was truly distractingbr br as i said this movie was a big letdown and i recommend you avoid it a note to the imdb you should do something about these phony reviews that people are leaving it degrades the authenticity of the site
