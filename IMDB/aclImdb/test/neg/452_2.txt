rose  does anything actually happen in this episode it introduces our two leads a slowwitted grinning idiot of a doctor and an utterly uninteresting companion theres no plot to speak of childish humour mixed with some extremely bad pacing and incidental music what else is there to say reallybr br the end of the world  a marginal improvement in that we see our first outerspace scenario subsequently brought down by poor contemporary humour paperthin logic very poor pacing and tired sf clichésbr br the unquiet dead  best episode to date showing what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode write interesting character dialogue and integrate an intriguing plot let down solely by the doctor and rosebr br aliens of londonworld war three  doctor who degenerates into farce what more can be said penelope wilton brings the proceedings a little gravity trying her best in dire circumstances some poorly written and outofplace soap opera elements come to the fore in these two episodes and a return to poor pacing bad plotting and cringe worthy humoursatirebr br dalek  not great however still far above the rtd fare to date the pacing and script are all fine though the doctor and rose still irritate the effects and menace of the dalek are introduced well the finale however took an interesting premise that reduced the doctors most notorious foe into a cuddly touchyfeely mess and turning a previously unseen menace to a blue rubber squid that looked like a childs toybr br the long game  the first rtd script to show any plot even if it was in a clichéd 80s style still it was marred somewhat by his usual overreliance on juvenile jokes placing it too far in the future to make logical sense and again poor pacing not as bad as his previous efforts but instantly forgettablebr br fathers day  the initial premise couldve been vaguely interesting but common sense and logic abandon this episode from the very beginning also we are treated to a whole episode of soap opera before you start thinking this is all about characterization remember theres a big difference between lame soap opera and characterization on the plus side it does prove rtd isnt the worst script writer so farbr br the empty childthe doctor dances  this started off in a mediocre way with some cringe worthy moments and some illogical mistakes that even a primary school pupil wouldnt make well lit windows in a blackout anyone after this the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn florence hoath truly steals these episodes showing us what an interesting companion couldve been like she could also act instead we get the annoying and politically correct captain jack as the new companion the conclusion was a little hasty but sufficient the pacing and script improved with a reasonably good storyline making these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing br br boom town  i have to be honest except for a few examples i had been so disillusioned by the current series that upon seeing the trailer for another slitheen episode i gave up and didnt subject myself to the torturebr br bad wolf  reality tv arguably the worst facet of the modern media is basically used as the premise theres no subtlety whatsoever do we get any interesting social commentary as in the likes of the running man or truman show no of course not this in an rtd episode so theyre basically here to cynically try and pull in the audience of said shows once again logic goes out the window as were placed 200000something years in the future rtd tries pointlessly to shoehorn in some overarcing story here with no relevance other than its own existence and when the villains are revealed at the end they make empty threats and the doctor grins once more like an idiot for the climax faster paced for the most part than rtds other efforts this has one or two interesting moments otherwise another lacklustre instalmentbr br the parting of the ways  the big finale more of a damp squid literally all of the dalek menace set up in dalek is brought crashing down as they become rather pathetic so many plot holes riddle this episode with typically poor contrivances daleks want to harvest humans as daleks but then vaporize entire continents daleks can vaporize said continents but not destroy the tardis in space the tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere even over people so they can be saved in it this ability cant be used to easily destroy the dalek god the daleks can vaporize entire continents but dont just nuke satellite 5 to destroy the doctor and instead let him play around the doctor is a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions after eradicating his whole species to try and eliminate the daleks these and many other holes aside we are treated to the lamest dues ex machina solution ever conceived joined with a near pointless story arcbr br so what can we say about the new series allinallbr br would this have gained a second series if it were anything other than doctor who with rtd behind it would most of the episodes have been seen as anything other than unoriginal and forgettable if they were anything other than doctor who and had rtds name attached i think notbr br some people would have us think we cant say anything against rtd since we owe him for bringing doctor who back to our screens however this at the expense of good characters and stories personally id rather not have a poorly planned ill conceived product churned out at that price id rather wait till someone could come along and make a genuine effort for the most part this is the kind of puerile rubbish that gives sf a bad name marring what is otherwise the most creative genre
