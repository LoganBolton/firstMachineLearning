br br after the wit and liveliness of highway 61 and roadkill i expected this movie to shine but it was as bloated and selfdeluded as the hardrock stars it parodied the pace dragged not helped by an overlong hallucination sequence the characters were flat and unmemorable and art bergmann is no jello biafra i had to poke myself to stay awake
