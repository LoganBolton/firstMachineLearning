well i like to watch bad horror bmovies cause i think its interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie i always compare this movies to  for example  some spielbergs works and againandagain dont understand the huge difference in what i see i like ed woods movies cause its so inept its very funny but people the chilling is not funny and is not even interesting its extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable theres no acting no screenplay no direction no thrills and not even blood its extremely inept amateurish film its definitely the worst movie i had ever seen and i had seen a lot of worst movies  believe me i warned you  110
