woof pretty boring and they might as well have shot it in black and white it was so colorlessbr br the movie starts with rolling text explaining cryogenics and asking whether god or satan is behind it there are some protests outside a cryogenics lab some people rob a bank and many of the robbers and guards get shot the father of one of the robbers i think arranges to have his son frozen theres a lot of jumping around in the beginning from scene to scene introducing characters without us knowing how they relatebr br theres a power outage and the cannisters containing the frozen people get struck by lightning and they emerge as zombies theyre all wearing silver mylarlike suits and their skin is dark green and wrinkled no idea why they look so bad  being frozen evidently didnt preserve their looks and they have silver eyes they go around killing people sometimes lurching like zombies sometimes moving like normal peoplebr br linda blair keeps showing up every once in a while to what purpose im not really sure i think her character works at the cryogenics lab but shes not very important to the plot and her role is very smallbr br the movie ends with some freeze frames with text captions that tell us what happened to the characters next which are pretty silly
