as to be expected theres a pretty good reason why this film is so obscure and unknown in spite of dealing with the alwayspopular premise of zombies and starring the 80s bmovie queen linda blair namely it sucks the chilling is trying enormously hard  way too hard  to be a story with depth and factual background whereas it should have just been a lightheaded and gorepacked horror flick about frozen zombies it takes an incredibly long time before anything remotely interesting or significant happens theres a lot of drivel about cryogenics which i learned in my physics class is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures so naturally in this film a bunch of people are studying the behavior of human corpses when deep frozen needless to say this is extremely boring until two dimwitted night watchmen decide during an electric power failure that its a good idea to put the metalconstructed cool cells outside at the heights of a thunderstorm the coolers are struck by lightening obviously and the bodies spontaneously defrost and come to live to go on a murderous zombie rampage the chilling is a boring and surprisingly for a late 80s effort at least gorefree horror film that doesnt even use up a quarter of its potential all the painful attempts to build up an atmosphere of suspense and eeriness fail tremendously and i cant think of any reason why the zombieattacks had to be so bloodless even in spite of the low budget available they could have done better the set pieces makeup effects and costumes are pitiable the research lab for example looks like a proper apartment flat whilst the zombies couldnt look less menacing with their green faces and foilwrapped outfits how linda blair managed to get involved yet again in such an embarrassing lowbudgeted horror flick is a complete mystery shes attracted to lousy bmovies like bees are to honey
