ok lets start with saying that when a dutch movie is bad its really bad rarely something with a little bit of quality comes alonglek karakter here in holland but not often costa is about 4 girls going to spain to go on vacation party get drunk get laid u know the drill its also about the world of clubbers or proppers pros whore trying to lure the crowd into their clubbr br im not sure how long it took to write the script but i suspect somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because youre watching a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes long nothing and i mean nothing is believable in this movie its almost too riduculous for words what happens with the storyline suddenly the movie transforms into a sort of karate action thing with a oneonone fight with the bad guy in black and cliche car chase scenes trough a watertankcar can it be more cheesy also the words characterdevelopment and casting are unfamiliar to the makersbr br after having seen traffic 3 days before this i fell from sheer brilliance from a piece of art to this this is filmmaking at its saddest and dont start about low budget because even with a low budget you could write a better script it almost seems that the filmmakers were too busy partying themselves to make a decent moviebr br anyway the chicks in the water at the end made it up a little bit but for the rest of it dont waste your money on such garbage
