i am in awe of the number of people who consider this film to be decentmuch less great do the majority of people even have basic standards for a film they watch i just dont know anymorebr br this commercial cinematic product doesnt really deserve the respect of being called a film to call dean cain talented is a gross injustice to anyone who actually has talent i have had a lot of respect for lori petty but most of that has gone right down the tubes at least her role was extremely small maybe she had a bill that desperately needed to get paidbr br the ignorance i saw while viewing firetrap was amazing let me start out by getting this off my chest if you cant show fire realistically then dont show it at all okay its an embarrassment to all involved when you show lame effects that dont even come close to simulating an actual burning buildingbr br some interesting tidbits 1 a janitor opens the door to a large storage closet and finds the entire room engulfed in flames what does he do he tries to put out the fire with his broom 2 the same janitor who knows the building is on fire later comes across a door marked hazardous materials his brilliant mind tells him that it would be a great idea to open said door big mistake 3 a woman is giving a fantastically generous donation of 100000 to a greyhound rescue fund butshes wearing a fur coat to the charity event theyre holding wouldnt people who care about animals kinda frown on that sort of thing 4 several of the people in the movie are forced into a vault of some sort with massive steel walls that even an electromagnetic pulse couldnt penetrate yet they have a spacious air vent leading right into the back of the thing that anyone could crawl through that sure seems like a lapse in securitybr br i could go on and on but i have grown tiresome thinking about this lame movie our hero whom we are supposed to be cheering for is a career criminal who early on tries to kill some police officers what a swell guy if the general public wants to waste their minds away on this drivel then more power to them i just wish i could have it erased from my memory 110
