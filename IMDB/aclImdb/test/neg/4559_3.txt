ugghhh this is exactly the sort of precode film that could incorrectly convince the viewer that films from this time period are lousyand they are notits just that this particular film is horrid horrid because while the film tries very hard to be hip and adult it also is so hopelessly old fashioned dull and hokey that i was torn between laughing at the film or just falling asleep this is a unique combination to say the leastbr br so why exactly did i hate it so much well the film is incredibly sleazy but has no style and the film is meant to shock but lacks subtlety and takes too many ridiculous turns to be believable the film begins with a clich√©a hooker with a heart of gold dorothy mackaill is a prostitute and she appears to accidentally kill a man shortly after making her escape she meets up with an old boyfriend who insists on marrying her he doesnt realize her profession seeing this mans innate goodness she determines to change her life and stop living the wild life this is tough when she hides out on a fictional caribbean island here alone and waiting for her man to return there is nothing to do and the place is infested with superhorny and totally unappealing men in fact this portion of the movie is so dull that the audience might have a hard time staying focused the men on the island are so inflamed by the presence of mackaill that they perpetually seem on the verge of raping heronly to be rebuffed because she isnt that sort of girl any more frankly i got very tired of all these salacious scenesthere is simply too much eye rolling and tonguewagging to make it seem anything other than a very bad film and looking at all these ugly horndogs was just annoying and stupidbr br but waitit gets a lot worse the man she thought she killed shows up on this tiny island what are the odds and he tries to rape her as well however hes not to be dissuaded and she ends up shooting to save her newfound virtue while the jury on the island is about to acquit her she rushes back into court and liestelling them she meant to kill the man and it was premeditated  because even if shes acquitted she knows the evil jailer will have his way with her when she is sent to jail for a gun possession charge given that the jailer himself gave her the gun to set her up her rushing into the court and saying she was guilty seemed really really silly why didnt she just tell them the jailers twisted plan supposedly she did this in order to preserve her virtue but to admit to killing someone so people will think you are a virgin so in order to avoid a short jail sentence and once again the threat of rape she doesnt consider telling the court that he is trying to force her into a sexually compromising situation the jailer has promised to rape her when she is locked up and just before she is taken to the gallows in order to avoid the rape the boyfriend shows up in time for her to send him off and the credits rollbr br impossible situation and coincidences aboundcoming so often that the film is just dumb combining this with all the sexual innuendo this makes for a bad and sleazy mess of a film which will only appeal to the most diehard fans of precode films all others beware this is very sticky and silly from start to finish
