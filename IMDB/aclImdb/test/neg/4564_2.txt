i usually love teenhigh school genre flicks but this film was really lacking in originality the only premise this film has is four friends cheating their way through high school and the strain it puts on their friendship theres just not enough depth in the story or the characters to keep the viewers attention for the full length of the film the acting isnt all that bad although the actors dont really have much to work with as the dialog is tripe and clich√© after watching this movie one must wonder how on earth a producer could come across a project like this and think i must make this film no wonder it couldnt get a theatrical release andrew gurland is a hack avoid or burn
