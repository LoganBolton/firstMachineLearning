im generally not a fan of high school comedies they rely heavily on humor in bad taste and rarely stray far from clich√©d story lines and characters and downright dull dialog however ive had my share of guilty pleasures particularly when i was still in high school myself seeing the ohsorecognizable teacher figures get their butts kicked always cheered me up and an occasional laugh could also be the case these movies only work if at least one of the characters is an instantly likable one this was not the case in cheats especially not the protagonist of course it didnt help that the actor in play was one of the most irritating notalent arrogant kids ive ever seen in a comedybr br to act in a comedy is no joke its hard to be funny the delivery has to be just right or the material goes to waste in this case there wasnt much good stuff to begin with and the jokes that were halffunny were screwed up professionally by the castbr br this movie felt 3 hours long the director never heard of pacing obviously stay away from this one there are many other enjoyable teen comedies out there such as 10 things i hate about you whos your daddy and superbad
