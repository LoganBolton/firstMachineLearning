the one is a very aptly name show mostly because it comes close to being the only network shows on in prime time that barely more than one person is watchingbr br when i first heard of the one i thought to myself weee another singsong show we dont have enough of those and then proceeded to strap on my helmet and run about my home hitting my head on blunt objects and sharp corners because in all honesty the constant year round pain and suffering inflicted by having only one or two talent based reality shows running just isnt enough we needed another one and not just any one  the one the one with slightly less attractive contestants with slightly less talent the one with slightly less of a point though its hard to imagine a scenario in which thats possible the one with pointless footage of the contestants when theyre not performing included because i care what johnny singsalot does in his off hours i really do now you may be thinking hey on the entire continent of north america less than 4 million people watched the first episode doesnt that mean this show sucks well to that i say less than 4 million people in north america have syphilis so sometimes low numbers bring good news now dont they think about itbr br in the end the one may be horribly unoriginal a show that even the airing network couldnt be bothered to promote because they too realize how absolutely worthless it is but its still not syphilis yay
