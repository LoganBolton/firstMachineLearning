i wouldnt call myself a big fan of the genre inventive silliness so i might not be the best audience for this show although being a critic i do have a sense for what i personally like and dislike this being the laterbr br lack of humor is a big turnoff when it comes to comedy things can be catchy cool and perky for about 4 minutes and after that you start getting bored unless its the badger animation from a couple of years ago  this is the exact opposite with a stiff script and all overacted voiceovers its just plain silly and very very boring to be subjected to unfortunately since it did have a big market ahead of itself and a lot of potentialbr br a waste of time
