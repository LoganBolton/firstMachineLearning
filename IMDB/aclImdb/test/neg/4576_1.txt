i went to see passion of mind because i usually get a kick out of the genre of alternate reality romances ie sliding doors me myself i etc br br but this was the worst one ive ever seen i had to force myself to sit through it i didnt even stay through the credits which is unheard of for mebr br the magical realism was completely missing because demi moore was grim and the lovers she was twotiming were guys who usually play villains though each was kind of sexy and appealingbr br there was actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives with a distasteful frisson of the elektra complex maybe the magic shouldnt be explained for this genre to workbr br originally written 5282000
