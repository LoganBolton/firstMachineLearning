just saw the film tonight in a preview and its a film for kids only it does not improve or add to the original disney film in any way there is a corny scottish pastiche style throughout not helped by weak writing where motives are lumped in by the spadeful and acting that is uneven and often unengaging despite what reads like a decent cast i have no problem with the wee dog  although there is a certain skippy the bush kangaroo see below quality about his shotsbr br  for those that dont know skippy was an australian kids tv series from the 1960s where the kangaroo would be an essential part of all the stories it is said that to get poor old skippy to act they stuck an elastic band round his muzzle that he then tried to get off with his paws  sort of appearing to be communicating with the human actors bobby has a similar range and you just dont buy his series of heroic rescues at allbr br advice would be to take kids aged 812 below that they might be scared above that if they or you love it good luck to you but this is strictly cardboard cutout filmmaking for the undemanding its a missed opportunity since there is real pathos and cuteness in the story of bobby and this film fails to deliver it
