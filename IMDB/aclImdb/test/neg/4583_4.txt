but like the disney film of two generations ago this film fails as well in the accuracy department but at least disney used a skye terrierbr br is the true story to mundane for movie producers i dont think so there is ample documentation to accurately portray they true story instead of the fictionalized accounts we have had to suffer through br br some day a movie will correctly portray bobbys owner john gray as the edinburgh policeman that he was and correctly portray bobbys license a being paid for by the lord provost when that happens ill be at the theaters
