this film goes into my worst films ever made file i have a copy of this film which i watch when i want a good laugh and this isnt even a comedy i am disappointed that such great actors agreed to be in such a piece of garbage this film is inaccurate in its portrayal of hockey offensive to canadians and i wasnt even all that impressed with the acting even the story was a bit weak if you have never seen this film youre lucky if you have im sorry
