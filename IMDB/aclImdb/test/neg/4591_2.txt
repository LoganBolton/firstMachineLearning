i should know better ive seen too many of rob lowes early work to expect anything good from this movie even if it is about hockeybr br here we have yet again another tired sports theme kid has potential for greatness has the apparent to go far if his cocky attitude doesnt screw things up and boom he comes out of it as that helluva player kind of champion is that all that can be said of sports movies surely there must be other feats that athletes undertakebr br nonetheless this movie has got to be one of the biggest cheeseballs everybodys interactions are just downright silly and not in a stupidfunny kind of manner and i cant think of any ancillary qualities that could enliven my position not the actors certainly not swayze who plays lowes reluctant mentor not the story not the music and very little from the skating sequences br br normally im a sucker for 80s movies even if they do tend to be a little fishy ie north shore the karate kid but this doesnt even make for good 80s trash for a good 80s sports movie check elsewhere theres plenty of them out there
