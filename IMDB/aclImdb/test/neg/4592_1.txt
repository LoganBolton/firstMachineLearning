this movie is terrible a true hockey fan would have to assume that the people that appeared in and produced this movie never played or watched a real hockey game i got this hoping that it would be a guy movie but the only people that would probably enjoy this movie are females between the ages of 1317 the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc its so difficult to predict the end of this movie though for those who have seen it who would have guessed for those that havent seen it dont waste your timebr br i figured it out less than halfway through the movie to call this movie a drama is ridiculous
