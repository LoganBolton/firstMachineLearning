where to start with speck the true story of richard speck a killer of eight nurses in the 1960s director keith walley has worked on a few of the extremely low budget full moon releasing movies such as birth rite and here works from a script by at the time full moon regular don adams unfortunaly whilst the film seems like a accurate portrayal of the horrendous crime the script isnt great perhaps because the real specks ramblings were not terribly interesting despite the care that has been taken to make this authentic it wreaks of a cheap cashin of the acclaimed cinematic serial killer movies of the same period such as ed gein filmed in a dirty brown not quite sepia for the most part and narrated by star doug cole the film fails to present the horror of the crime because the narration is irritating the colouring distracting from the story and the crime though gruesome and upsetting to watch is merely that and no editorial work seems to have occurred on what is pretty much a very poor quality camcorder viewing on the events there is no examination of the motivation or of specks life really just a cheap shot at a gruesome crime released by full moon there is little evidence of full moons better output here charles band ignoring his own rule that his films feature fantasy killings eg dolls monsters and so on and not quite knowing what to do with this new reality incidentally band introduced a special label for these films called shadow entertainment band has said that he regrets the period of full moon output alongside tempe entertainment whose creator jr bookwalter and regular danny draven also speak very badly of charles band the tempe era features uniform apple mac editing and brutal handheld camera filming very much like a home movie speck retains these qualities and whereas witchouse 3 for example managed to use these well speck is merely boring and gross
