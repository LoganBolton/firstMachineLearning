after matt dillons phenomenal performance in crash most will probably rush to pick up a copy of factotum to see if dillon is for real or simply got a lucky rebound from a great scriptbr br well factotum certainly has its moments but the plainness of everything will most likely turn viewers off however nothing should be taken away from dillon his performance is wonderful and full of excellent deadpan humor proving hes a solid actor with significant chops its just a shame about the directing and scriptbr br the story is about henry hank chinaski dillon and his refusal to conform to anything resembling normalcy he quits or gets fired from jobs in mere minutes only to find himself back in a dreary pub meeting even drearier women while trying to write a nonconformist novel we never really know what the novel is about except that it involves everything cancer movies you mebr br skipping from workplace to workplace and constantly returning to jan lili taylor the haunting a loser girlfriend whos just as dispiriting as himself hank tries vainly to discover what his life is supposed to hold for him whether he ever learns what that is is up for interpretation some may say that he never does while others might argue that his life is simply a path to obscuritybr br regardless theres not much substance to factotum even with matt dillons fine performance the story meanders through hanks life without much thought given as to where to take the audience and thats a shame dillons performance wouldve shone even brighter if given a decent script
