some twenty or so years ago charles bukowski was a hero of mine i blindly accepted the image that was created by intellectual types and seen in various films of course i never got to meet the intellectual types that prescribed bukowski as a hero they usually could be found safely behind the counter at hipster video stores and record shops these people hardly talked and when asked a question usually sneered and nodded in some vague direction they were useless when it came to locating a specific title but their shelves were always stocked with strange and unique titles to be inducted in the secret hipster club i believed i had to shed my bourgeois upbringing and espouse the counterculturebr br my introduction to bukowski started with the movie barfly the late 80s film that starred mickey rourke and faye dunnaway i was a fan of rourke at the time he also embodied a sort of modern male fantastical antihero a brooding intellectual type at the time this appealed to me barflys hero scoffed at convention a mid30s tramp who lives life with no ties answers to no one ohand to be recognized as a genius by a hot female literary snob icing on the cake afterwards i read postoffice and hollywood the later being bukowskis take on his experience with the filmnow allow me to fastforward to the latest film based on bukowskis book factotum one which i read and enjoyed bukowski takes the form of chinaski in this novel i often wonder where bukowski ended and chinaski began 20 years after barfly the fictional movie bukowski is still the same i have watched about an hour of the movie and i have yet to see signs of the facade cracking here is why factotum bukowski was my hero chinaski is handsome played by matt dillon he has clean neat hair styled but not over the top when dillon smokes and writes he looks cool chinaski goes from job to job ignoring andor fighting with various bosses he screws two floozies one of whom he lives with walks out on only to return to with little repercussion chinaski is his own man and we never see him emote hes a sterile onedimensional 30 something james dean archetype factotum lies to the viewer it does so by haranguing the idea of a man a writer without consequence a poor man whos suffering for his art what could be cooler than that now lets say there are some truths to factotum in that the events took place what the audience is missing is the pain that shrouds chinaskis existence maybe the point of this movie and most movies is that for 80 mins we need to escape the world thats filled with consequence and pain and takeup vicariously with an antisocial womanizer that smokes talks drinks with detached coolness one who rejects conventional behavior of job and family my hero used to be movie bukowski long ago that would have worked it was easier then now i have yet to claim a hero things are not as easy hipster logic and movie renditions of counterculture icons offer no solutions or even ask questions
