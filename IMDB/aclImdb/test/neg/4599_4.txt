a boring movie about a miserable loserthats factotum in a nutshell matt dillon plays henry chinaski alter ego of author charles bukowski upon whose novel the film is based as we meet chinaski he may be a writer but hes certainly not a successful one he floats through life getting fired from one menial job after another and not caring a bit the fact that hes always drunk may have something to do with his not caring he meets a woman jan played by lili taylor and a relationship ensues chinaski moves into jans apartment and now instead of getting drunk by himself he can get drunk with somebody else good times eventually hes had enough of this relationship so chinaski strikes out on his own unfortunately he still cant hold down a job so soon enough hes broke at this point marisa tomei shows up and for some reason her character laura decides to rescue this miserable drunken loser whom she doesnt even know we soon meet some of lauras acquaintances and the film veers off into a sort of bizarro world with this rather eclectic bunch soon enough tomei and friends are out of the picture and once again were left with chinaski and his drinking and his miserable little life theres some more time spent with jan but mostly theres just time spent being a drunk unemployable loser and then the movies over and not a moment too soon 94 minutes of absolute monotony and it seems infinitely longer as the movie drags on nothing happens nothing ever happens if you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching matt dillon drink then this is the movie for you if youre looking for a compelling story well developed characters or any entertainment value whatsoever then youve come to the wrong place dillons performance actually isnt bad at all too bad the movie which surrounds him is in fact rather bad
