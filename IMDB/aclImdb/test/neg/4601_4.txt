this movie has some good lines but watching dillons lessthanmasterful rourke impersonation just left me wanting to see the original i like marisa tomei but shes no faye dunawaybr br also in my opinion the number one movie rule is to make the lead character someone you care about you might not love the character but you should care what happens to him this is achieved in barfly with the hilarious running gag about the fights with eddie the bartender the main fight in factotum is when completely unprovoked he stalks up to the lily taylor character in a bar punches her to the floor and calls her a whorebr br the whole thing just didnt work again some great lines  some laughoutloud funny  but as a movie overall its a fail mediocre attempt at reinventing something that was brilliant and you cant get past that next lets remake breakfast at tiffanys with kate hudson
