clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of charles bukowskis work the autobiographical henry chinaski character in bukowskis stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by mickey rourke in 1987s barfly also starring faye dunaway anyone who has seen factotum should certainly see barfly to get a better look at how bukowski wrote his character factotum lacks the greasy seediness of bukowskis screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero the inadvertent humor that bubbles through in the dark desperation of chinaskis misadventures doesnt work for dillon as it did so admirably for the overweight filthy bloodsoaked rourke rourkes character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous nights misbehavior a placesetting for yet another grueling ugly day in the life of a drunken misanthropic unknown writer dillons character misses these marks in favor of a strutting handsome relatively cleanlooking wannabe writer that scarcely passes for any moment in that of chinaskis story dunaways sleazy heroine wanda is the perfect complement to the neerdowell henry the women in factotum cant hold a candle to dunaways distressed goddess and the use of more profane sexual subject matter in factotum proves to be more of a crude distraction than a tip of the hat to bukowskis raw and unapologetic portrayals of dysfunctional relationships i was stunned at how many of the exact same scenes were used in factotum marisa tomei buying all the stuff and charging it to the old man is an exact ripoff from barflybr br if you want to see the best bukowski stories on film see barfly and love is a dog from hell which also goes by the title crazy love
