be warned by the line on the back of the box that promotes a story involving over sexed jocks there isnt a thing redeeming about carrie 2 the plot is absurd the acting terrible and the ending all too predictablebr br i wasnt expecting a masterpiece but i was expecting to be entertained i wasnt the only way i could rationalize watching this movie was because i was at a relatives house while waiting for my car to be fixed unless in the same predicament stay well away from this film
