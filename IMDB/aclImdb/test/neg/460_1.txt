alien was excellent many writers tried to copy it they all did a bad job or almost but dead space is the worst alien copy because of the bad actors the bad special effects the bad scenario and other bad stuff it would take about 3 pages to tell everything that is bad in this film the movie wasnt very long and this is a very good thing the only one you cannot laugh because it is too seriousthat is a bad thing because in almost each bseries scifi film you can laugh during the whole time it can be terrific sometimes but instead of watching this stupidity just watch alien or event horizonthese are much better i give it 1 out of 5
