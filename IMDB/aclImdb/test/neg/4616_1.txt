id never walked out of a movie before this one id entertained the idea a couple of times but this time i did it snuck in to see the end of another movie but had to come back and see the end of the rage while i waited for my friends they told me i didnt miss much while i was gone either i was generally offended by the entire movie in such a grand way that i cant even describe it my gut instinct told me to get myself out of the theatre it was a visceral reaction to a horrible movie the plot centered around the cruel actions of some reprehensible teenagers against vulnerable and troubled others there was no ray of light no resonsible or likeable person to provide contrast i found that even the good guys of the movie did nothing for me were silly stupid whiney or just plain ineffectualbr br the repetitious graphic suicide imagery was way overdone unnecessary and disgusting not in a im easily grossed out way but more in the portrayal of disregard for humanity way and besides the repetition of that scene in slow motion from so many angles the other visual aspects interesting camera work etc had potential but just became annoying sometimes i am a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them usually i can find some good things to counterbalance the notsogood of any movie im not saying that this movie had nothing good but i am saying that whatever that may have been i cant remember it with all the other crap that drove me mad im really sorry about that too maybe the best parts were the clips from the classic original
