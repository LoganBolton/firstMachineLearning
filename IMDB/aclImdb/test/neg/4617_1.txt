one of the scariest movies i have ever seen was carrie the first one now as with other movies they have totally ruined the carrie franchise with the rage carrie 2 from the beginnning the movie plods along like geriatics in a beatup van there are hardly any scares and this movie is chockfull of all the various highschool sterotypes ie the football jock the bitchy cheerleader the followers and of course the black nailpolish wearing misfits another sad thing about this show is that you know whats going to happen the moment you see the opening credits sure sure girl gets humilated thourghly and then turns into crazed psychic murdereryawnbr br been there done thatbr br even the actors look like they were forced into doing this movie emily bergl is as frightening as a cabbage patch doll while jack london lets just say i didnt pay to see wood act apart from the actors the flasbacks serve more to irritate than to link up with the first moviebr br bottom line if you can beam objects around like carrie then for the love of god beam yourself out of that theatre
