could be considered some mild spoilers but no more than in anyone elses review of this filmbr br i knew that nothing could conceivably live up to the absolute brilliance of the original carrie which was more of a film about social criticism than it was about setting the gym on fire carrie white was victim epitomized and her story conveyed the helplessness that the truly exploited must feelbr br whoever conceived the rachel character for the rage must have completely missed the subtleties of carrie for the audience to genuinely share the victims rage she must be a sympathetic character a true outcast who is more a victim of circumstance than of hisher own vices rachel is entirely too unpleasant to convey any sort of the emotional depth and connection of sissy spaceks carrie and she looks and acts like she should be right alongside the attractive and popular brigade that she ends up torching she like the rest of them has a soul that is every bit as corrupt whereas carrie was a complete innocentbr br it just doesnt work theres no satisfaction in seeing the pretty children not even the home improvement boy getting offed in this movies climactic scene and its so unnecessarily gory there was no actual bloodshed seen in the burning gym br br and there is one person in particular that this movie should not have had the audacity to kill off but i wont say who it is if youve seen the original carrie its the sort of character who dies unjustlybr br at least they did create the connection to carrie appropriately its explained as it should have been but that and the arm tattoo which was done rather nicely is just about the only thing this movie has going for itbr br yet another hideous scream knockoff and it taints the reputation of one of the most compelling films ever made br br rating 1 out of 10 i wasnt expecting much but i was still horribly disappointed an unsympathetic character a series of irritating popculture references thrown in for no good reason and an ending scene that pales in comparison to carries gravestone shocker
