i want to believe all new horror films coming out of japan these days are edgy and make for enjoyable watchingbr br spider forest is neitherbr br it is seldom that i finish watching something and end up teed off for the waste of time but spider forest was an exception in this regard i was very teed off the makers of the film succeeded on one level throughout the film i could not stop because i wanted to see the answer to the mystery spun by the storyline i could not stop watching thats why i was so angry when the film finished they dragged me all the way through 2 hours of tedium for this poc warning spider forest is another one of those japanese ghost stories though you dont realize that going inbr br i never want to see a japanese ghost story again theyre phony and contrived its a ghost story has become like a big rug under which to sweep any and all unresolvable plot holes you have in your storytelling
