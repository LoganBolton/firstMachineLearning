wow that james purefoy looks exactly like thomas janebr br thats the most profound thought i took with me after having seen the rather underwhelming george and the dragon for a fantasy comedy the story was very dull and the effects unspectacularbr br the problem wasnt the acting james purefoy makes a good knight and his various sidekicks are not bad characters i even thought patrick swayze in this role was a pretty good idea too flatchested piper perabo also had some nice potential i even liked the kidbr br but the story and everything that happens and the way it happens was just eh not interesting compared to another recent fantasy comedy ella enchanted which was actually funny this movie comes up terribly short im sorry for the decent actors who were in this yawninducing trudgerybr br 4 out of 10
