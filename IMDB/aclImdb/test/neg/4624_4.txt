this movie started with some promise big name cast good looking sets but then it fell apartbr br most of the time it cant tell whether its a serious movie or a comedy one minute theyre talking about how theres no joy in killing and the next there is a fight scene set to funny music and funny banterbr br some of the acting is pretty bad mainly from patrick swayze and piper perabo she also gets some groaner lines like when i marry it will be about love ughbr br but the worst thing about this movie is that its just boring not enough action not enough humor not enough plot not much of anything really just a lot of clich√©s and cheesy momentsbr br also a movie with dragon in the title should contain a lot more dragons than the few and pathetic cgi dragons that appeared in this moviebr br cant the scifi channel show any good movies
