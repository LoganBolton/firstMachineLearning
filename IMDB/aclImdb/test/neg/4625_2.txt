this movie starts out great and sucks you in most acting is good until patrick swayze with his texas twang everyone else sounds britishlike even the muslim shows up and proves that he cant act you can live with that until the first fight scene where all they all fall to pieces why does patrick swayze fight baddies with an ax when he just stuck his sword into the ground 5 minutes agobr br theres further misplacing of swords a few minutes later and people knowing about other people they shouldnt know about other reviewers mentioned troubled production and it showsbr br at the end i just didnt even care about the fight scenes sure the cgi dragon was weak but the storyline was the biggest letdown
