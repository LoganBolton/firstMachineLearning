i saw this on the scifi channel so i knew it would be bad to start with but i was surprised at how much worse it was than expected the cg effects on the dragon were terrible even for the scifi channel and the writing was pathetic i couldnt tell if this was supposed to be that stupid as a joke or if it just came out that way the only redeeming quality of this movie is that its so terrible its almost funny especially the part where patrick swayzes knight character goes home to his knight father who has retired after losing his legs and is now bedridden in his armor for the sole purpose of letting the audience know he was a knight the majority of the movie focuses around an enormous dragon egg that hatches into a notsoenormous baby dragon with some of the worst cgi ive ever seen this was just awful
