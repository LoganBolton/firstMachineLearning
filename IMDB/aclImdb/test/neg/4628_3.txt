i had a very hard time sitting through this film unless you really are very proadultery and like to hear people endlessly talking about their sexual exploits i cant see how you could enjoy this film geezmost of the main characters behaved like rutting weasels and their bragging about their many infidelities grew tiresome about the only element of this i appreciated was the disgusting scene where the one character was urinating and blood was splattering everywhere because hed picked up an stdbig surprise hmmbr br if you want a good film watch the sequel barbarian invasions despite the general unlikable nature of many of the characters the sequel is very involving and more realisticwell worth your time
