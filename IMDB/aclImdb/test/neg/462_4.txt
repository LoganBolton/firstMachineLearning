the filmmakers apparently had enough money to be able to afford decent makeup effects but not enough for a creature that would move around and attack convincingly we never get a chance to see the monster move from one place to another  whenever that happens supposedly the camera focuses on the terrified reactions of the humans that are nearby and when a man is attacked by it he simply seems to be holding an inanimate object against himself so that it wont fall to the ground this is still not the worst alien ripoff around the two xtro films are even worse for example its actually sufficiently entertaining if youve got 68  minutes to spare 12
