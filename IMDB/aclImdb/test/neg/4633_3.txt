im rating the decline of the american empire just about below average since it wasnt terrible but also not great i liked the very open conversations from people so incredibly selfish and ugly inside and out that was probably the most original aspect  a dialoguelaced sexual small film with people who are extremely far from models that aside it seems ironic that these frenchspeaking canadians have a movie about a neighboring society that well is in decline when their own actions are their own demise a group of women friends and male friends spend half the movie laughing it up on their infidelities and acceptance of such behavior and the other half intellectually speaking of how powerful they are for their speech and actions these are the normal targets in typical sitcoms the main characters make fun of at parties occupied mainly by college professors sadly its not their intelligence or mastery of history that disturbs me its their pedestal made of ego and mightierthanthou attitude that pushes me away and not one character could i relate to nor like when one cries i couldnt care less  its your bed when one complains i barely flinched what made me skirmish was one character uh peeing red another example of playing with fire sure i understand it happens to some people but it was hard to watch and i sincerely hoped the he washed his hands as he had no problem going right back to cooking for everyone on the complete opposite end of the nosesup educators they introduce a stereotypical nomad this made me cringe as no one seemed real everyone was as shallow as their laughter on society unfortunately with no one left to root for youre left as empty as these characters souls
