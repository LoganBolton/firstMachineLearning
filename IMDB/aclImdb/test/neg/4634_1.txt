i saw this movie and was bored out of my mind i am a fan of peanuts but i cant understand why charles schultz let this disaster be made spoilers aheadbr br i cant believe snoopy would let his friends sleep on the ground outside in a dangerous situation and go out to a bar and swig a few cold ones without standing watch the story was complete nonsense even for comic strip characters it takes them toooo long to get to france plus once they get to france i had a feeling that the writer i still cant believe it was schultz didnt know what to do once they got therebr br peanuts is best made in 30 minute episodes not 80 minute moviesbr br go home charlie brown you are at your best therebr br
