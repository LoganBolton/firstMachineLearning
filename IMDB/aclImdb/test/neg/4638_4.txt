world war i gets a glossy sepiatinted makeover in jeanpierre jeunets relentlessly whimsical a very long engagement jeunets trademark style consists of mechanical almost clockworklike narrative construction garnished with lavish chocolate box production values and seasoned with fauxnaive humour its an approach that worked pretty well with his previous picture the romantic fantasy amelie thanks in no small part to the inimitable contribution of audrey tatou in the title role applied to vastly more sombre material jeunets method backfires rather badlybr br tatou crops up again here in a variation on the same sort of sweetly offbeat character as amelie shes mathilde an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting determined to trace what became of her child sweetheart manech gaspard ulliel several years after he went missing in the war manech was one of five soldiers courtmartialled for selfmutilation in 1917 at bingo crepuscule and sent over the top into nomansland as a punishment hes presumed dead by all but mathilde who cherishes the hope of finding him the film follows mathildes dogged quest to find out what really happened and as she delves deeper she uncovers a sad even shocking story of highranking corruption and inhumanity mathilde must filter the facts from the fictions that arise from various conflicting overlapping or incomplete accounts of what seem to be manechs final hoursbr br all this should be poignant and gripping but its more often simply confusing thanks to the visual and verbal clutter with which jeunet pummels his audience theres simply too much going on at any one time including an intrusive narration that adds precisely nothing to our appreciation of the story and characters without a moments respite from informational overload i felt denied the space to reflect on mathildes quest or the room to engage with it on my own terms jeunets unceasingly busy camera spirals and swoops and circles caressing every surface contour of his exquisitely designed production but it singularly fails to penetrate to the soul beneath the storys skin the result is deeply uninvolving and worse grotesque the first world war was a particularly dark hour in human history imagine it recreated as one of those picturesque commercials for a well known belgian lager and you have the measure of this film
