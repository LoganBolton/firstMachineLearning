how can anyone even begin to like this film is really beyond mebr br the idea it has none a guy fell apart thats the idea wow an environment was slowly killing him now thats original and worth watchingbr br this is the first fasbinders film ive seen ive heard that hes a genius of miseenscene but ive seen student films with more attention inspiration idea and craft than this this this nothing it has nothingbr br each and every shot is too long theres so much emptiness in them the actings horrible you can see the actors had no preparation at all no understanding of their roles not even an attempt at showing emotions its so superficial the lines are so explicative that you could removed 90 of them and still have the same crappy film tempo who cares about it atmosphere dynamics thats for pussies one shot per scene 80 of the time people staring unrealistically having no idea how to represent emotions and importance of the moment besides hollow staring at the camera or one another editing all rules of editing have been disregarded with no pa payoff of any kind photography half of the shots have reflection in them and crappy lighting with no stylization of any kind shadows play of shadows who needs that we need a guy pissing drinking hitting his wife like hes like hes acting we need a bunch of close ups of a notsobeautiful woman we need an amateurish climax of his capture by an unconvincing arabian torturer this film has so much wrongs that it isnt worth the nobudget it hadbr br frankly i havent seen a film this bad since american pie 5 yup that badbr br ive just started watching his veronica foss movie which seems much better based on the first 15 minutes since it does have a hint of directing and artistic idea unlike this crap so i wont argue that fasbinders clueless but this this film sucks
