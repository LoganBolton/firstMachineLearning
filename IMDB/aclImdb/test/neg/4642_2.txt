okay granted i am a fan of lowbudget horror which along with it does come the occasional piece of garbage that even the most diehard fan of campy flicks can not bare to stand witness totrancers 6 directed by demonicuss jay woelfelbr br first of all the trancers series started back in the mid80s by charlie band and his empire pictures is basically the franchise that it is because of tim thomerson and his excellent portrayal of trancer hunter jack deth well low and behold due to the sinking budgets of full moon features which despite what people have said have actually brought along very high quality features such as hell asylum and dead  rotting thomerson did not return for the sixth installmentbr br full moon writer courtney joyner returns once again and delivers another belowaverage screenplay which features jack deth played by thomersonin flashbacks which are extremely poorly insertedhe has a different hair style like every time he is shown and some shemp laying on a table going down the line into his daughters body well from here on out you have jo deth acting like jackbut its a shame that she really doesnt give off the same screen presence as jack deth didbr br the film shot on 16mm is simply put an embarrassment to the trancers nameno offense to anyone at young wolf productions i mean i respect you guys for actually wanting to jump forth and do a trancers film without tim but with a little more time despite it being filmed since december of 2001 it could have been betterbr br however check out full moons dvd of it which is a double feature with the original trancers and features trailers for the last 10 plus full moon featuresbr br overall i would probably have liked the feature more if it wouldnt have the trancers name but like anything you can judge it by someones opinion and you must check it out for yourself
