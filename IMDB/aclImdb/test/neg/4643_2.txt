i know that full moon or any other film studio for that matter could never recapture the fun and cheesy scifi feeling that was the original trancers and with the last two entries in the series having jack deth in medieval times instead of futuristic los angeles it became quite obvious that there really was little hope in reviving the trancers series breathing new life into a film is one thing but taking our main character out of his element and putting him into the past well it didnt work so now with trancers 6 full moon has breathed so much new life into the series that we dont even deal with jack deth any more we now deal with his daughter jo jack is in her body and must go into the past and fight the trancers one more timebr br minor spoiler first scene of the film revealedbr br 	to prove how bad this movie is you only need watch the first two minutes of the film when the original jack deth appears on the screen but its not actually tim thomerson its clips of him and sound bytes strung together trust me you can tell theyre strung together horribly to provide the viewer the last of the true jack deth humor and from this point on things only go down hill having this girl jo deth as our main character while jack deth is supposed to be in her body is the worst idea in the world having this cute young woman act as a rough and tough man isnt the right track at all it doesnt work and it really comes off as foolishbr br 	im not going to go into the aspects of special effects and makeup because most reading this know what full moon has become a really really low budget enterprise i dont know what to say about this movie except i really wish full moon could be like it was in the days of demonic toys puppet master and trancers 1 back then while the special effects werent great the story telling was they made serious bmovies for serious b movie and horror fans and that just doesnt take place today with the new full moon studios i yearn for the good ol days and truly hope that full moon can pull itself out of this horrible slump that theyre in right nowbr br 	trancers 6 gets a 2 out of 10
