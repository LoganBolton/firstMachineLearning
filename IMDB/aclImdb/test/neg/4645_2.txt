after reading both rivergod and theseventhscroll i cant begin to express how disappointed i was with this film while i agree some poetic license may be admissible this movie is at constant variance with the books doing an incredible injustice to the exciting plausible and wonderful stories written by wilbur smith i can only believe that the writers director and producers of the movie have never even heard of mr smith let alone read his work smiths vibrant characterizations are converted into wooden stick figures all historicity is ignored or discounted the realism of the books has been changed to include phantom monsters more appropriate to a cartoon and why is an egyptian henchman speaking spanish geesh no wonder the movie was made into a tv miniseries did wilbur smith have any input into the making of this movie i cant believe that he did terrible terrible movie if youve read either or both of the books dont waste your time or money watching this money you will be sorely disappointed i assure youbr br only a moment of supreme generosity persuaded me to give this movie a ranking of 2 and that only because of the beautiful sometimes spectacular photography
