the movie is precious and cage is a babe br br but will anyone agree with me in saying that the punk representation in this movie is atrocious br br wheres the clash the ramones misfits social distortion the cramps sex pistols anyone the music is this movie is incredibly disappointing at least they play the curebr br plus randys feathered hair and pleated khakisbr br this definitely looks like a movie about punks the way that a bunch of movie industry squares see punksbr br although its a 90s movie slc punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 1980s just sayin
