along with his turn in the supersleazy classic the toolbox murders 1978 this is considered the ultimate bad cameron mitchell horror effort its a little too slowmoving for my tastes has zero likable characters in it and not much action until the very end but mitchells dedicated central psycho performance as vengeanceminded whackjob vincent rinard is fun not anthony perkins good mind you but definitely fun enough as a spoof of the shallow conceit that is hollywood its only soso as a horror movie its also only fair and even as just a simple vintage exploitation picture its just ok im a big fan of the unnecessary gratuitous dance sequence so i was also thankful for the appearance of the gazzarri dancers who just rule five of them do a crazy hairthrashin floorslidin hipshaking gogo dance routine to dont cry look for the rainbow by the tbones watching these ladies bounce around with huge smiles on their faces in their fringecovered bikini top and parachute pants ensemble is a defining reason why i give this a slightly higher rating that usualbr br former movie makeup man vincent rinard the best since lon chaney goes after people at paragon studios a flashback shows how max black berry kroeger a jealous and drunk studio executive flung wine in vinnies face right when he was about to light a smoke hes engulfed in flames and dives into a pool but not before scarring up one side of his face and losing an eyeball not to mention his sanity now employed by the worldfamous movieland wax museum in buena park california vincent uses a special serum described as a mixture of truth serum nerve medicine and special vitamins and minerals watch out centrum to paralyze victims they disappear and the dense detectives on the case headed by scott brady act baffled as new statues are put on display in the museum vince talks to himself im a terribly nice man chainsmokes mumbles hisses and describes how he gets excited by the sound of a womans screambr br he also has to deal with a bunch of backstabbing scumbags and selfabsorbed witches most of whom will deserve whats coming to them there is also nick hollis morrison a boozy inept museum tour guide who sees a statue blink but doesnt go to the cops aside from max a real gradea jerk who doesnt even die and the stupid cops the other two lead roles are women and both are pretty atrocious marie morgan anne helm is not your typical innocent heroine this tramp has been engaged to no less that five different characters in this movie  including vince max and two of the wax dummiesmissing male stars i guess she never had time to make a go at the one missing girl for some reason she also begs and pleads in her irritating babyvoice for vince to give her a replica of the head hes designing of the newest missing actor and fianc√© number 5 tony deen phillip baird she doesnt know that vince has already jabbed a syringe in the back of his neck but i love it when mitchell dryly agrees with her demands so you can completely retreat for reality he also wants her to pose for him which means shes eventually held prisoner in a box unfortunately the box has a hole where her head sticks through so we have to continue getting aurally assaulted by her highpitched whinesbr br the other woman is theresa victoria carroll one of the aforementioned gogo girls shes first seen proving she is thoroughly rhythmdeficient by jiggling on stage in a limegreen fringe bikini theresa is tolerable before she talks but when you realize her grating presence combines the abrasiveness of lorraine bracco with the airhead mentality of the landers sisters you wish vincent would inject her with the serum as soon as possible unfortunately were first subjected to a scene of her making endless demands to the studio head honcho and running around in the museum trying to avoid mitchell she and the rest of the characters are completely unsympathetic but function as a way to poke fun at the hollywood system in general i guess and im probably giving this movie more credit than it actually deserves the pluses are few and far between but include other than mitchell and the dance routine colorful slightly stylized lighting and a bizarre ending that seems to suggest that rinard will be severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in his own personal hell married to marie yikes now that is scarybr br also in the cast are director john bud cardos also the production manager as a police sergeant james forrest as a film director virgil frye as a statue rini martin and kent osborne as a bartender many of the people who worked on this one including executive producer and scriptwriter rex carlton also worked on the al adamson movie blood of draculas castle and other atrocitiesbr br my score 4 out of 10
