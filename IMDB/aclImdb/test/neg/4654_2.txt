pretty bad this film about a grizzledand frankly rock stupid old prospector and his dogshep ie lassie as well as an annoying kid whose name i cant recall at the moment at the beginning of the movie the old prospector has deliberately buried himself in some sand so that the poor dog will have to dig him out why did he hate the dog anyhoo somehow or other this idiot has managed to strike gold and goes to tell his partner but the man has died and his sleazy other partner is happy to assist old jonathan in digging up the gold the geezer tries to leave is dog with the dead guys son but not even the retarded mutt wants to stay with this kid theres quaint old preacherfor quaint read smelly and the oily guy finished off the old guysurprise surprise and tries to steal all the gold plus he poisons the dog and tries to kill the kid too so i suppose its okay that a devilish and crazy lassieerrshep does this the guy in at the end although its pretty disturbing in what is basically a childrens movie there are extremely stereotypicalto the point of racial slur native americans who speak without using verbsas in me make camp fire type speech and thats pretty much the extent of the cast because apparently lassies salary was too big for them to hire anyone else kind of dull not very interesting and a tad too dark not a great movie in any way
