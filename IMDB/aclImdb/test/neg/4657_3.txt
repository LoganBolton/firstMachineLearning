i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad im surprised anyone took it seriously characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys the only merit here is that its so lame its funny actually for me there is the added benefit that it was shot in a state park not far from where i live so seeing some local sights on the big screen is a hootbr br the lead character is a offduty cop and makes a big point of lecturing a good guy that vigilante justice is not just a bad idea its against the law imagine how long that lasts br br most of the movies northern california characters are blowndried hollywood cheeseballs looking like theyve never actually been in a fight the story line is totally predictable this film is ripe for a mst3k lampooning camp value only im pretty forgiving of films in general but seeing the old positive reviews i had to speak up this is a dog i give it a 3 out of 10 and then only for laughs
