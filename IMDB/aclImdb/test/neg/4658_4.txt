i have to say that i had low expectations for the movie before viewing it all the people around said it was great but i perfectly knew what they like they like aerosmiths song which is indeed great they like the amazing special effects which had coasted a lot they like the comedy side of the movie and of course many girls who love affleck who according to my opinion is a really bad actor who tried not to be one failed and now he is nothing and all these things plus the reviews and the ratings i read in internet gave me a clue the movie would be a huge disappointment since i am a big disaster kind of movies fan well ive been right but at least i was preparedbr br the movie is really commercial its been said but i will say it as again we have over 100 million budget we have a romance between hollywood stars ben affleck and liv tyler and many other famous actors who are popular with the fact that they rarely agree on becoming a part of the cast of a commercial movie if their names arent written with big letters on the screen such as billy bob thornton and steve buscemi which are highly respected actors that i also like a lot they could play many characters in many different kind of movies they could improvise they could turn tasteless lines into hilarious jokes on the whole they could turn small movies into really interesting funny or dramatic motion pictures people love and will always love such as fargo in buscemis case or a simple plan  thornton and to be honest i am really disappointed they took part of armageddon thornton plays a smart and refined man involved in politics if i remember correctly buscemi is one of the members of the deep core drilling team which is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid which is about to vanish the worldbr br what i didnt like  well i guess ive been already understood i pointed out bad factors the story is dull artless and silly it is so obvious that the movie depends on the effects and the dramatic ending that its ridiculous at least movies like deep impact and godzilla have something special that might be considered as art at least it aint that obvious that the movie is made of financial purposes other than that bad performances from all the huge stars the jokes aint funny the lines are absurd and sometimes they doesnt make sense at all in fact i recently read that on the stage ben affleck has asked bay whether it would be easier if they teach astronauts to drill than drillers to becomes astronauts and bays reply has been simply shut up which is a really funny story which perfectly shows the creatorss desperationbr br and enclosing ill give an explanation why i give 4 to the movie well i like dont want to miss a thing and i was impressed by the special effects which are obviously the only good thing in the movie the first scene is memorable these are the the only 2 good things i liked about the movie michael bay is an average director but the rock and both bad boys were hundreds of times better than armageddon which was is and will always be one big bad movie
