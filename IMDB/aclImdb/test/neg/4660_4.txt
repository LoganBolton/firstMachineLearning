i watched this movie about six years ago and i recently did so again if i remember correctly i did not like it at all the first time and i appreciated it slightly more this second timebr br this movie is obviously on a big budget the effects are mostly top notch except for one or two impacts and the cast is impressive however there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the showbr br firstly whoever decided that peter stormare should act as a crazy russian astronaut should be fired being a swede and a fan of peter im pretty sure he can play a russian character well but his performance in this case is plain stupid both with respect the lines uttered and the acting so something must be wrong with the script id like to see peter as a professional russian astronaut insteadbr br secondly the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is nearly unbearable to watch it is a total chaos that lasts over thirty minutes with too few moments to catch ones breath in addition to this the events that unfold are simply not credible id like to see a much more sensible and stripped down version of this part of the moviebr br finally the scenes that involve flying space shuttles are too actionbiased the shuttles are maneuvering like if they were a couple of migs at zero safety distance while bouncing off carsized ice blocks like pingpong balls the director should watch apollo 13 to learn the limitations of spacecraft like thesebr br i like the music score because it is dramatic to a degree making it very touching the overall performance of the actors is great apart from the things mentioned above the story is interesting and quite easy to followbr br with some minor changes this would have been a 810 movie im sorry it isnt
