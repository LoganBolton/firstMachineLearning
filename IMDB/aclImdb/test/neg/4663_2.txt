the acting was horrible the special effects while exceptional dominated the movie the writing was pathetic and the dialogue was unbelievable and the silly little love story between liv tyler and ben affleck was out of placebr br but the worst offense of armageddon was the total lack of scientific reality the asteroid is the size of texas says billy bob thornton er thats 800 miles wide no one in nasa even sees the asteroid until a midday meteor shower wrecks havoc in new york suuuuure nasa hires a drilling team to join the astronauts and trains them in a week yeah right someone brings a sidearm on the space shuttle with them yeah thats realistic and bruce willis blows up the asteroid with three seconds to spare how disneyesquebr br how bad was this movie i rooted for the asteroid
