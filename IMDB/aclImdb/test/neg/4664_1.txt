two movies the fifth element armageddon the same subject to save the world the same main actor bruce willis one difference armageddon is very inferior to luc bessons film some spectacular special effects dont succeed in hiding a labored and globally conventional screenplay several parts of the movie are showing it i think about the presidents speech and especially willis relationship with his daughter grace at the beginning of the movie he tends to neglect and overprotect her and this makes her weary then at the end of the movie its true love and understanding that shine in him on another hand the movie falls in the following trap michael bay takes his subject too seriously of course the movie tries to be funny but the result doesnt work as the humor introduced in the movie is often crude and pretty lowlevel whereas in the fifth element the humor was zany involuntary and enabled to overlook the serious side of the action the movie suffers from two other handicaps it often falls into the ridiculous the russian astronaut and almost all the actors are bad used bruce willis is all the contrary of his fifth elements character he plays the heman he hams it up and sometimes hes unbearable the other actors are barely credible in their own roles particularly willis sinking crew it seems that this crew is here just for having fun one of them is taken for being very qualified but he looks like a fool and poor liv tyler shes at the nasa just to be decorativebr br when the movie was released in france in august 1998 bruce willis expressed is weariness of saving the world his weariness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie
