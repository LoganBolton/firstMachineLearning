i cant remember when ive seen a worse movie the acting was overwrought the dialog trite to the point of being painful to listen to the special effects secondrate and the overall story laughablebr br ive never wanted to walk out on a movie more and if id been alone thats what id have done about 30 minutes into it and saved myself nearly another two excruciating hours of nauseainducing dialog and a plot with more holes than a swiss cheese the size of texas i just cant overemphasize what a miserable experience sitting through this collosal waste of perfectly good celluloid wasbr br
