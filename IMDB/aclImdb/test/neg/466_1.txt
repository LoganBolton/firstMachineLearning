i had high hopes going to see this as i always enjoy paul bettanys performances i thought he was very good as darwin and did his best considering the terrible material he had to work withbr br darwins book on the origin of species was one of the most groundbreaking controversial and innovative publications ever yet youd never think it based on this tedious movie its like a twohour episode of a soap opera in a victorian setting there is virtually nothing about darwins fiveyear voyage on the beagle to the galapagos islands for example surely of supreme significance to the story as it was from his investigations of the wildlife thereon that he began to form his theory of evolutionbr br this is just one long dreary domestic drama with darwin portrayed as a slightly loopy eccentric seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and being given the cold shoulder by his emotionallyconstipated wife jennifer connellys portrayal of emma darwin is nothing short of awful and bears little relation to historical descriptions of the real emma there could have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on earth from either emma or from the local priest as played by jeremy northam a blinkandyoudmissit part which is a complete waste of a talented actor to act as a counterbalance to darwins views but it wasnt taken up br br the story focused too much on endless mawkish sentiment about darwins grief for his daughter annie and too much time was also wasted in darwin wondering whether or not to write his book eventually i was so bored it was difficult to care br br all in all this was a bit like making a movie about picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him having a fight with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist
