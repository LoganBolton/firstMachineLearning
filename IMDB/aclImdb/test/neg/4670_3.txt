i remember thinking that due to the cast the subject matter and the director i was going to love this moviebr br stepping into the theatre and taking my seat i was like a giddy schoolgirl as my anticipation for the opening scene builtbr br i was not disappointed with the opening and felt that i was truly going to love this moviebr br if you havent seen the movie and feel that anything that gives away scenes might be seen as a spoiler please stop reading im not going to give away anything really important but it might be seen as such so that is the warningbr br spoiler may be included below bewarebr br i think that the first scene that really hit me as just utterly ridiculous was the russian space station scene i mean honestly refueling a shuttle with no real prior warning and then to simply show the station as being so fragile that a simple little mistake can cause the entire thing to just explodebr br while all of this is possible it seemed to me to be way over the top im not sure if it was just the situation or if it was the cheesy acting the silly view of the russian technology or just the campy attitude of the scene itselfbr br it only got worse for me after that because then we endure what seemed like 2 hours of constant super loud explosions in spaceyou know that place where there is no sound because its a vacuumbr br but the coup de grace for me honestly was the gun scene spoiler possibility  earlier in the movie we see bruce willis tearing apart their land vehicle the vehicle that they will use to drive around in when they get there and to help them drill when he is told that this is what they will be using he is taking pieces off and complaining about it because much of whats on it is heavy and not required for what they are doingbr br so then as we are wandering onto the asteroids we see that they have opted to add a massive gatling like gun to the vehiclesyou know standard nasa fare is to have heavy weaponry on all space missions in case you know aliens or somethingbr br i could have taken the explosive 2 hours the silly russian space station refueling scene the cheesy love scene near the end the bruce willis character being nothing more than most of his other past characters but the steve buscemi going mad and shooting the space vehicles gun all over the place and causing havocdamage well that threw the entire thing over the top for mebr br save your money and time and avoid this movie if you want a good meteor movie see deep impact if you want a fun space movie with awesome special effects see space cowboys but no matter what avoid this flick
