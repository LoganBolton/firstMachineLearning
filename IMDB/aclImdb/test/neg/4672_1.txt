i like action movies i have a softspot for b flicks with bad dialogue and wooden acting so ive been wracking my brain to come up with one of my guilty pleasures that was worse than this blockbuster i cant youd be hard pressed to put together a bigger piece of crp than this bruce willis vehiclebr br armageddon is the story and i use that term loosely of a team of superdrillers flying off to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the earth realistic not really but who cares its an action flick im not blasting the premisebr br minor spoilersbr br the movie begins with a couple of scenes designed to introduce the threat and the characters bruce willis is the toughasnails leader of the team and spends his first bit of screen time chasing around ben affleck with a gun for the unforgiveable act of sleeping with his daughter for some reason that didnt make me laugh it was forced like everything in this moviebr br the team is called in because theyre the only people in the whole wide world who can drill the asteroid okay im prepared to accept that premise if it gets us to the action  the supposed meat of the movie more attempts at humor with each character going out to do some crazy nutty thing before blast off again lame finally they take off heres where the movie really pied me off they arrive on the rock and set to work would you believe it nothing works right and everything has a suspenseful countdown whoah ten nine eight one  oh surprise surprise we saved the day againbr br and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick i can only assume they were trying to cover up the gargantuan holes left by the insipid performances by cutting away to a different shot every few seconds and this from someone raised on mtv  mr short attention span himselfbr br just when i thought it couldnt get any worse wait  theres a manufactured tearjerker ending that was so tacked on it made the rest of the film a virtual citizen kanebr br summary the witticisms werent witty the plot  well i said id let that one go the acting was bad really bad even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse camerawork  again bad i didnt even mention the dumbest love scene in the history of motion pictures  think animal crackersbr br rating 1 out of 10 im giving a half point for steve buscemi who makes me smile against my will and another half point for the times i was able to look at the lovely liv tyler and attempt to ignore her acting performance this is far and away the worst movie ive gone to see in the theater ever
