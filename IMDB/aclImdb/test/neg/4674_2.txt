i saw this film last nightbr br and im worried im turning into one of those leftwing liberals they rightly make fun of in south park because i found it hugely offensive am i being ridiculously sensitive firstly theres the old staple that is america being the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything everbr br secondly and chillingly there is the early meteor strike hitting some unnamed Â– why do they need a name asian country the reaction to this is to look at it as a warning as in my god imagine the tragedy that could happen because you know it happened to asians it might happen to white americans and that would be tragicbr br then later on a bigger meteor hits paris our cast on the ground are irritated because this might mean our boys have less time than they thought not much upset in america no mention that a lot of people have diedbr br then theres michael clarke duncan a wonderful actor wasted never has a black man been so token among a team of hardcore drillers his job seems to consist of standing in the back occasionally saying hey you da man really why did they even bring him its not like hes petite  he weighed down that shuttle for nothing not once does he lift a tool steer a space ship or even help fix anything that blows upbr br even if you ignore the russian cosmonaut peter stormare another great actor wasted in a pointless role who seems drunk most of the time and hits things with spanners instead of fixing them because dats how we do dese dings in russia its pretty horrificbr br all cemented of course by the site of blond blueeyed american children all celebrating in corn fields at being saved and everything being all right because all the death and destruction to the rest of the world is irrelevantbr br you expect the bad script the dodgy acting the implausible plot fat middle aged men being trained in 12 days to be astronauts including one who appears to be retarded but i couldnt believe the racism and xenophobia implied in the film and the callous disregard for the lives of anyone not cornfed americanbr br its a chilling indictment of the attitude of a section of western society to the worldbr br and its a crappy film too
