the use of the term comedy with relation to this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy and worse yet is the pain that is inflicted on the viewers of this production almost nothing was funnybr br this documentary followed a small group of standup comics on the road as they travel from town to town to perform in small clubsbr br its interesting to note that their conversations and behavior offstage and onstage are indistinguishable but sadly equally unfunnybr br its possible to understand the self delusions of grandeur which the featured comedians possess but its harder to grasp the sounds of laughter heard from their audiences perhas these are the same audiences for whom the lame sitcoms on tv are intendedbr br this was possibly the worst film ive ever watched in my 50 years of movie viewing
