i wish i could tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it espouses but i cant another species could have come and mutated while i waited for some action for such a controversial man darwin lived the most conventional life if you didnt know about the mad theories you could almost mistake him for a stamp collectorbr br the filmmakers have cast darwin as a dullard which does him a disservice even when he briefly loses his mind due to his tireless theorising it wasnt interesting to watch maybe great thinkers are dull people i dont know what i was expecting a foreheadbanging eccentric with wild hair and eyes espousing his love of all things simian the glint of madness straining from a furrowed brow a longhaired hermit who babbled to animals a headcradling lunatic with eyes lit up like beacons of truth all of the above would have been great this is the movies for scorseses sakebr br but there was none of that no lightning no thunder no wonder no awe just paul bettany and jennifer connelly fresh from the subtle as breath school of method acting i imagine that someone with darwins ideas had a brain like a speeding train so why did this film just pootle along  chug chug chug  like a slow winter the disappointment is immeasurable
