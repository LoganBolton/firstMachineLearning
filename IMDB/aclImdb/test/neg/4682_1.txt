as i write this usercomment tim burtons interpretation of the sweeney todd tale is making big money at the box office and the film even earned a couple of oscar nominations if im not mistaken i havent seen it yet but i sincerely hope burton didnt look for inspiration andor stylish trademarks in good old andy milligans bloodthirsty butchers yes even though the title distinctively mentions butchers the main characters in the plot are a barber the infamous sweeney todd and a female baker together they form a vile alliance where he kills the customers in his shop and she processes the bodies into her famous london meat pies in other words an andy milligan premise at his most typical derivative delirious and amateurish i think the imdb rating for this film speaks for itself although the actual story definitely isnt the worst ive ever seen milligan somehow inexplicably attracts sheer ineptitude the production is one gigantic mess with an incoherent narrative structure truly hideous photography poor lighting lousy acting and directing laughable gore and zilch tension or atmosphere more than half of the footage is pure padding and words fail to describe how boring the film is even with a running time of a mere 80 minutes ed wood ted v mikels and bruno mattei you guys need not fear as none other than andy milligan is  hands down  the worst director ever but i dont think he cared maybe if you dispose of a really high level of tolerance bloodthirsty butchers is worth one viewing
