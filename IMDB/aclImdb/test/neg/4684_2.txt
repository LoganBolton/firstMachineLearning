this is awful you just couldt believe it the score is annoying the filming is bad for example sometimes you see the shadow of the cameraman appearing on some actors faces the quality of the movie is ultra bad seems like it was made in the 20ies its terrible there is a bit of blood in the beginning and through the movie but always too dark filmed no gore no effects the director made some better one like blood rites but out there there is a following of the man cause searching to find this cheap flick isnt that hard but you have to pay hard earned cash for it surely this will get in my top ten of worst horrormovies ever i dont know if i would call it horror there is too much talking you will get bloodthirsty after watching it
