the word boring gets thrown around way too often when referring to exactly how bad a lowbudget horror movie might or might not be ive seen many a bmovie many horrible terribly inept bmovies some with a production value of a few hundred bucks does ineptness lousy acting worse continuity and embarrassing budgets really make a movie unwatchable some would no doubt way yes most of which are probably huge fans of the matrix well i hate bigbudget movies so i say no bad can sometimes be funny blood freak sometimes even mindblowing troll 2 but boring will always be unwatchable hey kinda like bloodthirsty butchers which reminds me im writing a review for this pile of garbage uh yeah anyway this is one of late british director andy milligans many alternatives to sleeping pills this one is based on sweeney todd great milligan takes a boring story and still manages to butcher it hey thats pretty funny i said bu sorry i keep getting distracted this isnt exactly easy on second thought ill make it easy no gore no scares no entertainment just unlikeable annoying people having incoherent conversations thats bloodthirsty butchers oh yeah and something about a barber killing people and something or other about meat pies i dont know its not importantbr br for something a little more rewarding from andy milligan theres always the only other one ive seen the rats are coming the werewolves are here yeah you heard me but hows about we forget about this milligan guy all together and pick up something sweet like sick girl or teenape goes to camp whatever you decide just know bloodthirsty butchers sucks possibly even more than any other version of this already lackluster tale and that bmovie fans is really saying something 210
