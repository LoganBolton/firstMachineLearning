you know the story of sweeney todd now most likely thanks to tim burtons recent movie you probably dont know it though from this take on the old tale from andy milliganthat notorious sleaze merchant that gave al adamson and ted v mikels a run for their moneybr br it had to happen eventually in my years of watching horror and exploitation from the 60s to the 80s im finally reviewing an andy milligan movie you see from 1964 to 1990 andy gave us many an exploitation and horror movienone of which was any good and barely watchable the bloodthirsty butchers is no exceptionbr br there is dialog and well there is talk and thats one of the things you will find herelots and lots of talk the movie reaches almost manos the hands of fate levels at times as you wait tirelessly for something to happen while i love cheap looking gore effects the violence is too few and far between and in spite of its reputation the breast scene isnt that shocking br br i love cheap and sleazy exploitation as much as the next trash cinema devotee but bloodthirsty butchers is the kind of bad that mst3k would tear apart mercilessly sadly milligan would die of aids in 1991 and if there is any movie of his id say i sort of like it would be the delirious the ghastly ones this is no ghastly ones thoughits just bad
