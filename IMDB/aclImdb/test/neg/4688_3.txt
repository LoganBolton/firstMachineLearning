for the uninitiated almost any andy milligan film is a shock but despite the fact that ive seen many of his films this one still takes the cake for sheer shoddinessbr br this is of course milligans take on the sweeney todd tale done with period costumes but not necessarily period hairstyles in some cases and the usual headacheinducing camerawork  grainy quality as for the gore well the version i saw may have been cut some for theres not a lot for a film with bloodthirsty in the title the best indication of subversive filmmaking here is a meat pie consisting only of some poor victims titbr br so while i will still treasure this piece of uh work on my video shelf its definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though recommended for only the foolhardy  morbidly curious 3 out of 10
