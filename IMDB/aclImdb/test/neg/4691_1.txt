not many people remember the carey treatment and i cant say i blame thembr br blake edwards did this during his lean years ie  between pink panther movies and for a story of a doctor turned detective coburn working to solve a murder in his hospital its actually pretty forgettablebr br coburn is dependable as always and oneill is beautiful as always but there just seems to be something missing from the proceedings the story twists and turns arent very involving and even the climax which is supposed to be nervewracking is gutwrenching insteadbr br a missed opportunity altogether and an unfortunate one at that since it was based on a michael crichton book br br oh well at least crichton didnt write a sequel to itbr br one star carey on coburn
