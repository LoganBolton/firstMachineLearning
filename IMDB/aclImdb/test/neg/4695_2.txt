this flick which is aka life in the fast lane is easily one of the least entertaining movies ive seen in a long time i think it was made in mind of the sick twisted and jaded la women who represent about 00000001 of the population in the states the characters are all onedimensional even the lead after she stabs her boyfriend in the head with some scissors a cheap laugh is attempted and unsucceeds by sticking a cork in the boyfriends skull to stop the bleeding oh clever patrick dempsey whose movies are almost always a class act sarcasm plays this devil who changes her life  but from what weve seen her life was this series of vignettes to begin with no emotion no laughs no story the only reason i give this a 2 is that jeffrey jones is ok as the priest and there is a bit of style albiet zero substance in the camerawork otherwise one of the 5 worst films ive seen grade 2 out of 10 an f i think that even the most drugged out junkie who would laugh at a toilet seat falling would dislike this film i cant stress enough how much you should stay awaybr br
