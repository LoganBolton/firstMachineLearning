the imdb plot summary erroneously makes it sound like it is noah taylors movie when fairuza balk is the central character it is unbelievable how such a cast of established actors could have been in such an amateurish pointless nonmovie balk breaks up with boyfriend taylor sleeps with the devil i guess  played by dempsey and accidentally kills taylor  who follows her about for the rest of the movie as a ghost may be the worst movie i have ever seen
