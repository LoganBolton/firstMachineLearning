i liked halflife i am still its fan it was frightening intelligent and challenging i dont tell any news it is one the best fps ever made maybe im too hardcore halflife fan but the so called halflife 2 is not halflife 2br br and i have a question is this the next chapter of halflife maybe the creators valve thinks so but i dont where are the intelligent enemies where is the frightening atmosphere nowhere i believe they wanted to make a bit different halflife instead of another research station story but they didnt just made a very different one they made something that has to do with halflife like for example quake does to doom the entire game so unsightly and unreal that its almost forlornbr br though the physics are truly great and there were a few good level to play the idea to make a revolutionary physicdriven gameplay has utterly failed when you get the gravitygun that can move objects you can expect with rights to use it as a weapon that would turn the schematic fps gameplay upside down the truth is you cant use gravitygun as a real weapon why because the best you can do is throwing boxes and barrels that dont do much damage if you want to keep an object in front of you to protect it can fall from about 3 shots if you want to throw an exploding barrel to your enemy it can explode in your own hand the gravitygun doesnt work as a weapon the best usage is solving some physicpuzzles i ask valve why the truth is you must use your boring schematic fps weapons to the endexcept for last level weapons are not that made original halflife a classic if gravitygun would be always like at the last level a real weapon id admire what valve did but not this this is disappointingbr br so if you want halflife then you are searching at the wrong place maybe you will enjoy it but i repeat it is everything but not halflife and even not a faithful continuation of that this is the greatest disappointment of all time valve have shown they can make awful games too they have managed that
