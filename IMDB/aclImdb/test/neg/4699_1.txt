this film had all the ingredients of a good adventure movie but it revealed incompetence at almost every levelbr br the presence of roger moore in the cast list is usually a sign that the movie is not going to be anything more than mediocre because moore always has lead roles and he cant act but this movie also had ian holm and lee marvin in it and was based on a wilbur smith book so i thought id give it a chance when i saw the dvd for sale in the bargain binbr br it was a mistake the opening scene appeared to start in the middle of a reel with sound suddenly appearing as if the first second of the soundtrack had been truncated the scene showed a dreadnought at sea with a german crew this bad editing was a sign of things to come but the scene with the dreadnought was interesting enough to keep me watching the special effects were good and the crew wore the proper uniforms and spoke in german indicating that the director at least paid attention to historical detail i was surprised br br so i kept watching and then moore appeared and my supicions were confirmed bad acting clichéd lines clichéd cinematography and cheap humourbut worst of all there is a disastrous attempt to blend the lighthearted feel of the film with serious drama and tragedy it just does not workbr br the film ends as suddenly and as badly as it started  in the middle of a reel
