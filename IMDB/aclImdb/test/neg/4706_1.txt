well dude wheres my car might be at least a novelty as one of few hollywood films that seems to have been written cast filmed  edited in less than a day i honestly cant believe this got made or that i allowed my friends to make me sit through the entire thing the jokes are too stupid and predictable to be dumbfunny and the actors involved dont seem like they would be capable of pulling off any kind of funny had the script actually provided it oddly enough unlike most mindless slapstick comedies this movie actually has too much plot  every scene seems to introduce a new moronic and uninteresting subplot of course they were obviously going for moronic but it doesnt work on any level whatsoeverthere is only one aspect of this film i enjoyed donkeylips from the old nickalodean show salute your shorts has a very small role this is the role that will turn him into the next richard gere though you just watch
