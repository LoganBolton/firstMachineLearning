i rented this movie because elijah wood has done some good work and i thought this might be an overlooked treasure it was not a treasure i dont know if this was straight to video but it should have been straight to the dumpbr br elijah wood fans will like the fact that he appears shirtless in a muchtoobrief shower scene but no sane person would like this script imagine memento played by teen actors but ten times more confusing and a hundred times less plausible case in point janeane garofalo plays a caring psychologist apparently keeping the chain of mediocrity alivebr br as if false memories syndromes and mindovermatter medicine werent hokey enough the movie also hinges on one of those unexplained psychic twin bonds that keep the plot moving and the audience baffled this same twin bond creates a few too many contrived love scenes between woods character and the girl from shes all that who plays the saintly sister of woods angry cancervictim friendbr br adding to the triteness of this screenplay woods other friends are a mentally challenged cancer victim and kidney a young black boy afflicted with a mysterious kidney disease kidneys dying wish comes true when dr garofalo gives him his own walkman this characters hackneyed function in the story is matched by his onagain offagain relationship to walking usually bound to a wheelchair kidney has several inexplicable scenes showing him pushing others around in itbr br kindeys characterization may be one small detail but it is indicative of this films many other flaws the bumblebee flies anyway is definitely bumbling but it never flies
