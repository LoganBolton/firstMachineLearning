i remember seeing this at my local blockbuster and picked it up cause i was curious i liked movies about mythological creatures i like movies about werewolves vampires zombies etc this is based on halfcaste a halfhuman halfleopard creature that preys on the people of africabr br the movie is horrendous the actors are terrible there is no script whatsoever its all improvised the whole thing is filmed at night because they say that is the only time you ever see it its obvious bullbleep they film at night to make it scary but they have failed to scare me after the first person was killed i put this back in the case and took it back to blockbuster one of the most boring movies ive ever seenbr br now you are probably saying i have no right to review a movie if i havent finished it well this is one of the films that didnt deserve to be watched all the way throughbr br 1 star out of 10 this is really bad
