probably the worst movie i have ever seen it is so cheesily filmed the focus is not even on this supposed real halfcaste it is more on the crew coming from hollywood to make the movie no cinematic significance whatsoever and if i could take back the almost 1 12 hours that i spent watching this film i would feel much betterbr br at first it starts out giving you the impression it will be filmed somewhat generically like an actual hollywood production however then they go into the narration of the story and its filmed so fing terribly its supposed to be a take on blair witch project really since they pretty much use what you would think is real camera footage its not dont be fooledbr br worst movie i have ever seen    on the positive side it has like one semiscary scene in it and the visuals of the halfcaste werent too bad looking at all dont rent
