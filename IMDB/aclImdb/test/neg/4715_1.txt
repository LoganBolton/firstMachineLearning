this movie was a big disappointment the plot sounded great about a halfhuman halfleopard creature in africa that becomes the subject of a documentary by young american adults when many of the crew members are found dead the 2 survivors are taken into questioning i wouldnt even call this a horror movie since most of the movie is actually about the misadventures of the aforementioned narcissistic 20somethings which include sex and smoking animal dung to get high isnt as entertaining as it soundstrust me you rarely get to see the creature and the main actor who also happens to be the director screen writer editor and producer is incredibly annoyingbr br i was finally so annoyed by the neverending dialogue that i fastforwarded to the end i had guessed the ending in less than 10 minutes into the movieand i was right thus this awful movie is utterly predictable tooas if it wasnt bad enough moral of the story avoid movies that are acted directed edited produced and written by the same nobody and avoid this movie unless held at gunpoint
