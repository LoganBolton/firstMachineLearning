you know those movies that are so unspeakably bad that you have to laugh halfcaste wasnt one of them which sounds good right but no its not its not a bad attempt at a horror movie thats fun to watch because its lame or not well acted or has bad special effects or anything else like that no halfcaste is just plain boring they dont even make an attempt to be scary until the last 20 minutes are so its just kids running around in the african bush country and getting high off of elephant dung for the first 75 of the movie and its not even funny the last 20 minutes though are hilarious i have no idea what happened but it was really fun to watch that cgi leopard rip out the throats of all of those white guys i couldnt tell apart anyway if youre in the mood for a bad horror movie dont rent this one because youll go to sleep before they get to the fun stuff if you do accidentally rent this movie id recommend fast forwarding to the end and skipping any scene that happens in daylight you wont miss anything you wont have any idea which character is which or exactly what is going on even if you do watch all of the backstory
