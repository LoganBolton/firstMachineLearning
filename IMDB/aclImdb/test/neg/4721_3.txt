cult purchasers are unquestionably familiar with the term video nasties this was a notorious british list containing all the films that could bring damage to society if viewed by irresponsible audiences dramatization for gore buffs this is an excellent checklist as it contains inhumanly cruel and disturbingly realist movies faces of death cannibal holocaust driller killer as well as outrageous and ultrasick horror films the burning nightmare city the toolbox murders keeping this in mind its quite unusual to see night of the bloody apes listed among the other nasties it sure is goryÂ…but the blood and violence are so poorly presented i cant imagine anyone would be offended by it and the silly plot about a desperate doctor transplanting a gorillas heart into the chest of his dying son isnt exactly what you would call disturbingly real neither all that remains is a fairly amusing pulphorror flick with awful acting and pointless sleaze the manape make up effects are laughable and theres no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere enjoyable only if youre in the right mood in other words the few sequences showing detailed matches of ladywrestling which one of the leadactresses does for a living are very cool
