this film was a mexican made horror film from the late 60s its not that good but really not so bad either there is plenty of schlock and it is padded pretty heavily with nudity and violence but it had a plot and at least tried to keep to it even if the plot was the same damn frankenstein inspired dont tamper in gods domain bmovie fare there was some padding mixed in with the female wrestling but it was made in mexico and wrestling does seem to be popular in mexicobr br the plot is that a doctor wants to save his son who is dying from leukemia the other doctors have given no hope for the poor guy but dad has the idea of transplanting a gorillas heart for his sons to save his life i dont know im a lawyer not a doctor the transplant works but sonnyboy ends up becoming a manape who terrorizes nude women and kills anyone who gets in his path theres also a subplot involving a cop and his girlfriend who is a wrestler this really didnt add too much but if they wanted to throw in some masked female wrestlers heres a good reason to do sobr br the film was kind of cheap but not too bad for a bmovie of the day the plot was basically just recycled and there were a few things that werent tied in that well however this film is kind of fun in its own way i dont know why maybe because its a mexican horror film and sticks out in my normal bad movie diet i guess it may be because its a mix and mash of some very weird thingsbr br watch it if you like cheesy foreign films nudity and female wrestlers
