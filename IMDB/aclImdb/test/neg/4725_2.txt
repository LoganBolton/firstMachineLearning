the following review is one from the wrong side of the tracks meaning two things you will hear nothing but praises coming from me and dont be fooled by my rating i also could tell you that this review contains no spoilers but technically thats a liebr br well screw the review im just going to ramble a bit it has been a while since i had so much fun with such a bad film and if you cannot enjoy this piece of utter drivel then you simply have no sense of humor first off this movie was meant to be taken seriously and thats the main aspect were the fun is coming from the story a doctors son is terminally ill daddydoctor decides that a harttransplant must be the only way of saving his son so in true maddoctorstyle he decides that the heart of a gorilla will do the trick of course the gorillaheart is much too potent for a human so sonnyboy transforms into this hideous apeman that immediately breaks free and goes on a killing and raping spree because thats simply what any horny beast would do isnt it the makeup of our apeman is hilarious theres simply no other way of putting it the guys face looks like a turd im talking human excrement here the solid brown kind beautiful the gore in this flick is wonderful too aside from real footage of an openheart surgery we also have incredibly fake but quite nasty looking blood  gore effects a decapitation an eyegouging a throatripping the scalping of someones skull its hilarious and indeed its quite incomprehensible why night of the bloody apes ever made it to the notorious uk videonasties list because all of the nasty things portrayed in this film are simply too ridiculous to be taken seriously oh and theres only one bloody ape running around in it too by the way so needless to say that la horripilante bestia humana is a much more accurate title for this terrifying and convincing tale of science gone horribly wrongbr br when not trying to shock with poorly staged acts of bloody violence or random portrayals of female nudity this movie manages to be highly entertaining with ingredients like nonsensical dialogues cheap cardboard sets plot stupidity and incredibly bad acting just a few random examples maybe about the sets one can clearly see that the setdesigners just used the same walls doors windows etc over and over again to be build various different interior sets eg one side of the hospital room  the window side  where the unconscious wrestling girl lies looks suspiciously similar like the window side of the basementlaboratory from where apeman escapes the setdesigners also took one of the sidewindows from the laboratory made it a bit larger and just placed it in the conferenceroom of the hospital all the walls in any building are the same greyones then theres the setting of the park clearly shot in a studio you can see on several occasions that the grass is loose whenever theres some strugglingfightingraping going on the grass just shifts and shuffles and you can see the grey concrete from the studiofloor beneath itbr br just a few random lines that come out the actors mouths br br  in the conferenceroom where all the doctors are debating the disappearance of unconscious wrestling girl a disappearance that would of course mean bad publicity for the hospital daddydoctor intelligently utters we find ourselves in a situation that is difficultbr br  during that same debate a colleaguedoctor cleverly remarks a sleepwalker any sleepwalker gets up hereby providing a solid excuse for the disappearance of unconscious wrestling girlbr br  after our investigating detective through the amazing process of his own logical deduction concludes and tells his superior that the murderer must be a half manhalf beast his superior answers that its absurd adding the line its more probable that of late more and more youre watching on your television many of those pictures of terror truly one of the best lines of the moviebr br other sources of laughter br br  the two scenes were daddydoctor and his igorlike assistant kidnap the gorilla from the zoo and unconscious wrestling girl from the hospital  these well thoughtout acts of abduction are like taking candy from a babybr br  daddydoctor speaks to god a lot doesnt hebr br  sonnyboy calling daddydoctor papa on more than one occasionbr br  an old lady screaming aaargh a dead man a dead man a dead man a dead manbr br  the plot periodically stops to wallow in scenes of women wrestling only to go on again and do nothing with that concept sure daddydoctor replaces sonnyboys gorillaheart a second time with that of unconscious wrestling girl but do you think something spectacular happens after that like apeturdman growing breasts or something trying to rape men this time our leading living wrestling beauty norma lazareno doesnt even go into a climactic wrestling contest with apeturdman near the movies finale but apeturdman does start to show some motherly love near the end almost and i say almost in true king kongstyle ie the top of a building and people on the ground pointing and screamingbr br okay i think thats enough now i chipped in more than my two cents here vomitrons rational rating for this sleazy piece of hilarious dreck 210 vomitrons rating from the wrong side of the tracks 810 go see this film people it is well worth it
