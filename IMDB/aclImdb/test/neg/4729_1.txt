against my own better judgment i went to see this film today and god i wish i hadnt awful the first avp film looks like a classic compared to this its that bad these guys actually make paul ws anderson look like a master storyteller in fact this is what id expect an alien andor predator film to look like if it was made by uwe boll this movie actually offended me and lord only knows what would transpire if ridley scott or hr giger were ever forced to watch this piece of crap i cant understand how any fan of either franchise could like this filmbr br truly i dont know where to begin i mean the first avp was poop but it at least a semiinteresting story and setting and occasionally some genuine tension it didnt take itself overly seriously and it could at least be semi enjoyed on a purely leave your brain at home basis but this one it felt to me as though the people behind it thought they were making the next horror masterpiece one after the other was a contrived suspenseful scene in a dark room or corridor with creepy music playing essentially bashing you over the head saying be scared now as james cameron once said you cant be told to be scared you can only have your own senses heightened the guys that made this film obviously werent paying attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to be scared rather than letting you come to that level yourself its a clich√© for internet nerds to say god i was so bored from this movie and felt like leaving well this is exactly how i felt even in the middle of the action scenes they took this film totally seriously which removed any possibility of enjoyment even the gag about how governments dont lie to their people was played without a hint of ironybr br as for the characters i knew going in that the human characters were going to be completely pointless to this film but seriously if theyre going to be onscreen at least have them doing something that is relevant to the story i dont care about this guy being beaten up by his dreamgirls boyfriend i dont care about the mother whos own daughter doesnt even know her boohoo a pair of nightvision goggles for a present give me a break or the released criminal just trying to make a decent living and set an example for his brother what a guy hell even the obligatory hotchickinpanties moment was more contrived than usual i get the feeling they expected the audience to be so shocked at the ending as well as seeing chestbursters come out of kids expectant mothers being raped and the like that that would make up for everything i dont think sobr br then we move onto the stars of the film and again very little to write home about were the aliens welldesigned i wouldnt have a clue because you can never see the damn things all you see is one of a mouth a head a tail or a really dodgy cg outline climbing a wall and barely enough to actually process that it is in fact an alien before mr i cut marilyn manson and nin music videos think ill do the same thing here editor goes at it with the slice tool also notice how hack action directors always set their films at night and in the rain hmmmm the predator couldve been fighting giant sea monkeys for all we knew yes the predator was more impressive this time around and i did think some of the new weaponry was cool but that was about it also since when does a predator sound like a dinosaur from the lost world there were a couple of things that i kinda liked though one was the use of sound effects and music from the original films i also giggled a little bit at get to the chopper although other references were stupid the main characters name being dallas give me a break i also liked the visual fx for the predators vision as well as how the hybrid alien looked certainly beat the one from resurrection but really those are the only positive thingsbr br overall i found this movie inane pointless insulting and above all else offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures that theyve left the door open for another one leaves me almost depressedbr br if they had any decency theyd remove dan obannon ron schusett and hr giger from the credits of this film theyve done nothing to deserve this
