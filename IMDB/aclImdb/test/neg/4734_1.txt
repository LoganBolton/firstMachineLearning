this is the worst movie ive ever seen and it takes the price of the rotten movie of 2007 which is made by me anyway this movie misses every single ingredients of a good movie i mean come on the actors had a bad performance the story is just crap im really really disappointed they could have done better stuff than this piece of junk ive just wasted my time and my money on this movie i wish that the production company could give back my money anyhow id high expectations on this movie and ive got disappointed i dont recommend anybody to watch this so if u wanna waste ur money on something do it on some thing else than this piece of junk
