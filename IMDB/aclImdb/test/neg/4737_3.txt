anyone who watched alien vs predator mustve known that the conventions of the alien quadrilogy were not exactly adapted for the film amongst some of the unusual elements the rapid growth of the aliens over seemingly a matter of minutes aliens with extremely long tails and so on however the idea of the predator species providing the impetus of city and temple building to create a hunt for would be warriors sounded so appealing that i couldnt resistbr br i had hoped the end of the film would not be the impetus of this sequel and unfortunately i was wrong for those who forgot how the first film ended the dead predator had an alien burst through his chest which carried the traits of both speciesbr br for this film im going to just go through a list of good and bad traitsbr br the good lots of gorgeous people especially the men br br the bad lots of gorgeous people get munched by both the mutant predatoralien and the predatorbr br the good an interesting idea of the predator planet br br the bad an inconsistent scale of a town its a small town without many opportunities but with a very sophisticated read big city sewer system and homeless is it a small town or a city the police force is one sheriff and three deputies or so i countedbr br the good um br br the bad why do these mutant alienspredators grow so fast in a matter of five minutes they seem to grow to their full size i mean cmonwhat are these thingschia pet aliens and while were on this subject why is it that an alien inside a predators body mutates but an alien in a humans body doesnt does that make sensebr br the good still thinking br br the bad why would only one predator come and why does it pour acid over all the remnants of the aliens but it decides to murder a cute deputy and then skin him and hang him upside down i mean so much for being incognitobr br the good ahim stuck i guess theres lots of loud sounds br br the bad how do these mutated alienpredators procreate apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a kiss type of motion they deposit several offspring into the womans body yeah just what youd like to see eh pregnant women having their bodies explode into mutant aliens as if the previous way wasnt gross enough i mean there isnt even an alien queenbr br the good did i say that the guys in this movie are gorgeous br br the bad when a nuclear device blows apart buildings how does a helicopter manage to survive the blast and how tacky is it for one of the passengers to mockingly chide the pilot i told you not to crash i mean given the nuclear fallout when he wakes up in the morning hell have no hair leftbr br i could go on and on but i think you get the message mutated alienpredator bursts through dead predators body grows over the matter of a couple of minutes kills all the predators and manages to get crashed on earth more mutant alienpredators are created while one measly predator comes to earth to destroy this new mutant species predator kills humans mutant alienpredators kill humans humans kill humans sucks to be a human in this movie ehbr br if youre impressed by lots of bangs and bumps youll love this moviebr br if you liked the first i suggest you skip this sequel
