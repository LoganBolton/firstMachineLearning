avp2 is an awful movie the dialogue was pointless the acting was pathetic it had virtually no story line and you cant really tell what the hell is going on half the time due to the continuity errors and plot holesbr br but you will love it anyway because it pushes the boundaries on gore violence death destruction and chaos they even kill children newborns and unborn babies in this movie you will be sitting there thinking oh my god that is disgusting and they surprise you by killing the sexy chick who always makes it out alive when the predator and aliens are fighting in the hospitalbr br its like the movie industry has said we know what we did in the first alien vs predator movie was was bad so were doing it again but this time were getting help from psychopaths with vivid imaginations its predicable moronic and down right pointlessbut you will be thinking about it for a while after you see it
