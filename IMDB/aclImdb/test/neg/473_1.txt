lets get one thing out of the way i am a huge bruce campbell fan i have the evil dead series have the action figures and have seen bubba hotep i am a fan of cheesy laughable horror flicks and know how to appreciate the whole its so bad its good deal br br i wish i could say the same about this movie i watched this movie with high expectations i wanted it to be good campy something from the bc we have all come to know and love it started out promising enough but after the first 20 minutes i resided to watching the rest of this sorry excuse of a movie as if i had just been shot with tranquilizer darts br br the idea itself isnt a bad one two men dont get along both killed by the same psycho woman half of one mans brain is transplanted into the others head they argue disagree and the comedy ensues br br what killed me is how extremely unorganized and boring it was it had potential even as a camp flick to be so much better than it was the plot was boring even bruces zany physical slap stick couldnt make it work br br words cannot even properly express the ridiculous robot that bruces wifes brain ends up getting put into easily the worst looking robot i have ever seen anywhere even for a b movie the whole idea is dumb br br what the hell was going through bruces mind when he made this steaming pile is beyond me why ted raimi didnt go running to his big brother asking him to slap some sense into bruce and not to mention some lessons about making an enjoyable movie on a budget is beyond mebr br shame on you bruce
