this movie made me watch paul ws andersons avp1 and enjoy it i am not even going to dream of comparing requiem to any of the alien or predator series moviesthis is a horrible teenage bhorror footage set in an american small town no one cares aboutbr br avp1 at least had heaps of handcrafted art carved into the movie setsit had bags of eyecandy not previously seen in any of the original movies  but was ruined by unconvincing charactersactingbr br requiem takes bad acting to the lowest imaginable leveland it also lacks in every other department just as muchits a sacrilege to include alien and predator suits in this kind of rubbish
