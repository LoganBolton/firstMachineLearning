this film and the 1st avp film both all over the whole aliens and predator franchisebr br they are awful films badly acted badly scripted and terribly directed they just seem like someones desperate attempt to make money off of the good name of the original aliens and predator films but instead of delivering a well thought out quality production they came up with the predaturdbr br the original alienalienspredatorpredator 2 films were great they redefined the horrorthriller genre by inventing these insane and yet still believable creatures who took the role of the serial killer as opposed to a human br br these films are just milking the franchise and do nothing but darken its namebr br the aliens vs predator comic books were brilliant and had a great story they were true to the alienpredator mythology didnt crap all over the original stories etc why didnt they make the comic book into a great film because hollywood are idiots thats why
