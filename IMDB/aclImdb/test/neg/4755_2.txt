i really really dont understand how that movie could get a rating bigger than 4 here on imdb its simply a huge mess and i have to admit that i actually liked avp 1 close to no story okay i can live with that but at least they got to the point pretty much at once avp 2 does not after the stupid premise has been presented there is well over half an hour of stupid and unfitting teenager clich√©s dumb as hell dialog and close to nothing else except for a few alien scenes that feel like an excuse to have that first half of the movie and predator scenes that make you ask yourself whether those guys making the film even watched any other predator movie or just didnt care enough to be botheredbr br after that that crapfest finally gets to the point where the predator starts attacking the aliens or at least pretends doing so and boy is that predator stupid blind and deaf its awful how he even managed to earn that stuff he has is beyond me he misses with almost every shot only notices aliens when theyre right in his face or if its absolutely necessary for the script so that he can move where he has to be he even gets caught on surprise by puny human teenagers and deputies all of the time whats that guy supposed to be after the first hour of that abomination i was more or less constantly shaking my head at every scene close to no scene in this movie passes by without unbelievably stupid dialogs stupid predator actions or stupid lack thereof or stupid actions from our heroesbr br then that thing finally ended to my surprise not only me and my friends didnt know whether to laugh or to cry but everybody i overheard leaving the room was halfcrying halflaughing about those 1 12 hours they just wastedbr br dont watch never
