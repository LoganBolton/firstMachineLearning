i love b movies but i like to be aware from the beginning that im watching one i cant believe someone could mess up a movie about aliens and predators so bad br br aliens and predator are awesome this movie made a big joke out of them the creators didnt take this movie seriously at all i am throughly disappointed in how the strauss jerks handled this film they made a mockery of amazing characters its like they were trying to be serious in the beginning then their writers got high and gave up almost nothing was continuous the main characters were awful and were not aliens or predators i am so ridiculously sad that no one takes alien and predators seriously anymore these characters are icons of american pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect to the original films they should not be allowed to cash in on the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves
