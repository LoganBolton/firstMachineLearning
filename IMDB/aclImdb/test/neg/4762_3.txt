if you suffer from insomnia then radiant would be the best way to send you into a 7year coma the film is so preposterously overwrought and mundane that its hard to imagine that director steve mahone could overlook such obvious dullnessbr br the story has an exiled doctor who we never get to see move out into the desert to create a vaccine that will cure all diseases by filling the hosts full of antibodies that can combat any infection yes just like that episode of futurama the vaccines dont work and the human guinea pigs become infected with a virus that kills within 48 hoursbr br not wanting to be caught by the government guys in masks the group head into the desert for cover hoping that the sunshine will kill the virus all of this is narrated by michael the only one of the quartet immune to the infection and its the most boring narration ever they could have cast someone with an interesting voice but instead we get someone with less vocal personality than clive owenbr br on top of this the editor insists on fadecutting more than half the movie giving it a weird dreamlike feel and increasing the audiences desire to go to sleep its no surprise that half of the audience walked out of this i was not one of them for some reason but i bloody well should havebr br the ending is supposed to be shocking and clever and foreboding but its plain and simply not a relief yes but not dramatic in the slightestbr br the utter cheapness of this production and muffled sound that renders a lot of the dialogue unintelligible cripples what could have been an interesting scifi story if it had better actors cooler locations and a sense of urgency as it is radiant is a snoozefest
