bob clampetts the hep cat is a distinctly average cartoon only really notable for the fact that it was the first colour looney tune previously looney tunes were all black and white while merrie melodies were in colour the tale of a singing dancing cats attempts to woo a lady cat and a dogs attempts to catch the cat the hep cat lacks the trademark energy and pace of most clampett shorts to be fair clampett doesnt have a great deal to work with warren fosters script is embarrassingly thin and while he has spun straw into gold with other cartoons clampett doesnt manage it with the hep cat its often said of clampett that you cant mistake his cartoons for anyone elses and its generally true but the hep cat is an exception theres flashes of clampett genius such as the chase scene in which the cat stops to ask the dog hey are you following me when the dog confirms that he is the cat simply says oh and the chase immediately resumes unfortunately theres very little of such brilliance on show here knowing who directed it the hep cat is a bitter disappointment we all have off days and this was clearly one of clampetts
