just watched this today on tcm where the other reviewers here saw itbr br sorry that i was the only one to find davies a weak actress with a truly awful attempt at an irish irishamerican or otherwise accent as shes the star it was sort of hard for me to get past that  especially as the other reviewers have said that this was her finest performancebr br another particularly terrible davies performance was in marianne 1929 which i also watched today in this film given a 9 of 10 rating here her accent switches from that of a correct french woman to an odd combination of italian and swissbr br interestingly in tcms onehour bio of davies  captured on film the true story of marion davies 2001  film historian jeanine basinger claims that one of the things that you note about marion davies in her sound work is how good she is at doing accents of course this bio also includes commentary by fans make of that what you willbr br davies was a very attractive young woman and by all accounts a terrific comedienne in real lifebr br and because a part of her anatomy added immeasurably to the reallife answer to joseph cottens characters search for the meaning behind kanes final word in the opening scene of the great citizen kane shes earned her spot among the great stories if hollywoods historybr br but i think welles  mankiewicz got it right for the most part with the susan alexander facsimile of the real articlebr br dont bother voting as to whether you agree or disagree with this post as i really couldnt care less
