while this isnt one of miss davies very worst films it is pretty bad and its sad that in a revisionist fashion recent imdb raters have deliberately overinflated the scores on some of her films to make up for her being slighted in the pastor so it seems for years conventional wisdom has been that davies was a terrible actress and only got the roles she got because her beau william randolph hearst bought her way into hollywood this certainly is the image created in orson welles citizen kane it is true that hearst did use his considerable wealth and clout to build davies career with all this money its not surprising that she made some excellent films and it isnt surprising that people got snippy due to all the extra attention she got sleeping with the man who finances your films is bound to get noticed however despite this edge she also made a decent number of bad films and i think we really need balance when it comes to the scores of her movies after all no rational person could believe that as of today 1508 peg o my heart and two other davies films recently shown on turner classic movies the florodora girl and marianne deserved the exceptionally high scoresranking them higher than such films as high noon ben hur the best years of our lives and all quiet on the western front in fact marianne would now rank as the fifth best movie ever according to imdb with a score of 88 considering most people out there dont even know who marion davies was and most of her movies were financial disasters this is a serious problem however she was a much better actress than citizen kane implied and initially broke into films before she began sleeping with hearstbr br what sets peg o my heart apart from these two other movies is that marianne and the florodora girl were pleasant little filmswhile peg o my heart is in some ways just terrible much of the reason was the terrible miscasting of marion while her french accent in marianne was cute in peg her irish accent just sounded bizarrenot particularly irish plus and perhaps im mistaken but her continual use of the word ye makes her sound like she should be doing shakespeare not a film set in 1933 ireland also there was a bizarre insistence that marion should be the consummate multitalented starso they had her not just act but dance and sing the singing actually fit the scripts in some of her films but here it seemed out of place and seriously detracted from the film it just seemed like you could almost hear hearst shouting out seeshe is a great actresslook at her sing and dance sadly marion just looked uncomfortable and out of place in many of these scenes but for me the biggest problem was the idea of having 36 yearold marion playing such a youthful role it was obvious that the character she played at the beginning of the film was supposed to be like the ones mary pickford played in the teens and twentiescomplete with the pig tails and plucky attitude miss pickford could carry off these roles even though she too wasnt a girl any more but here marion had put on a bit of weight and looked at least 30 no offenseshe looked fine for her agebut she did not look like a teen br br oddly with the millions that hearts spent on marions career he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money on was a good script and one that fit marions talents believe me i have rated several of her films very high i especially adore show people but here she just couldnt help but flopthis film was a turkey
