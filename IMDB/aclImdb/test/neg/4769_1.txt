first off i saw another reviewer said this movie was fantastic well nothing could be further from the truth this movie is complete garbage a moronic horror comedy that is not even slightly funny dont take that mean that its so bad that its good because its not its a total waste of time and moneybr br heres what i see in this waste of a dvd a group of friends get together on a weekend get drunk and then decide to make a backyard video they grab mom and dads video camera and start coming up with scenes on the spot they all get a big kick out of watching themselves mug for the camera they figure if they think its funny then everyone will think its funny well theyre wrong this backyard home video is garbage the acting and comedic gore effects are lousy but i guess thats to be expected since this is nothing more then a home videobr br on the bright side i guess the fact that this crap got out there gives hope to anyone out there who wants to make a movie if these people could get their movie made and released on dvd then anyone canbr br 010 save your money
