if you value your life in any way shape or form you will do yourself a courtesy and pass by this seemingly interesting movie on the dvd rackbr br i know what youre thinking i saw the preview and it looked great however buyer beware i fell into the same trap one of my friends expressed certain reluctance to watching this movie but i forced her to sit it out oh how i regret that decisionbr br like most horror movies the movie starts out cheerfully in a sunny mexican resort where two couples are lured to an ancient mayan ruin by a fellow resortgoer upon arrival they are disturbed by the appearance of two jungle people who are all but oblivious to their greeting shouts as if this isnt ominous enough the tour group casts aside large plant growth and declares an unused path consumed by wildlife a perfect route to their destination i guess it wouldnt be much of a movie if they utilized rational decision making and turned around just then but well this wasnt much of a movie anywaysbr br after some hiking the sixsome the resort goer brought a friend stumble upon the ruins and at once their doubts are dispelled by its beauty and history that is until frantic tribal people emerge from the jungle armed with a vengeance for no reason in particular shouting in an indecipherable language since when are brutal verbal assaults assuaged by calm patronizing language  dont ask me  but nonetheless the cast tries anyway to no avail obviously suddenly the sixth trail member dimitri is punctured with several arrowheads from the mayans and all hell breaks loose a gunshot finishes the job and the horrified travelers retreat quickly up the ruinbr br now if there was ever a plot to this movie it ended here the introduction took at most 20 minutes and it was unfortunately the best 20 minutes of the movie on top of the ruins the now fivesome realizes they are stranded by murderous locals and proceed to make countless good decisions one of them being to use a withered rope to lower one of their members into the bowels of the ruin needless to say the adventurer is seriously hurt and then trapped within the ruins and the two girlfriends are gravely injured trying to rescue himbr br the rest of the movie continues plotlessly with no real horror only only blood and gore as displayed when one girl yanks a plant growing within her out gushing torrents of blood and then again when somebodys legs are cut off only to have the same plat from within the girl strangle him laterbr br my only satisfactions in this movie were observing the very attractive jonathon tucker playing jeff mcintire grow increasingly more frazzled and distressed and sitting long enough to ascertain that almost all of the cast dies a horrible gruesome death their simulated pain seems an adequate compensation for the time suck that was this moviebr br supposedly the storyline goes that the ruin is an ancient house of of dangerous spirits with an evil flesh eating plant to ward off and consume unlucky visitors unfortunately i got no such warning from screaming bloodthirsty plants and the only evil thing relating to this movie that i am truly horrified by is the script writer
