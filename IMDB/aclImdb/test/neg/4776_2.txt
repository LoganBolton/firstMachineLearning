the movie started off ok a couple of tourists on vacation in mexico having a good time decide they should go on a hike they uncover some hidden trails and end up and this huge temple like fortress angry villagers show up and try to deter them from climbing it but because of the language barrier people get shot and the tourists end up climbing the stupid thing turns out the plants are evil bloodthirsty things that the villagers wont go near so they guard the temple so the tourists cant get off there are a couple of scares in this movie but nothing really makes sense i mean theyre plants dont bother buying or renting the dvd wait till it comes out on cable
