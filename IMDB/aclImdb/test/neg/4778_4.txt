when i saw 60 on imdb i was rather impressed and excited to watch this movie as a 6 for a horror movie should be rather entertaining at first i thought it was going to be some disturbing unseen evil force having not read the book to terrify the audience  but it turns out to be something rather mundane  killer plants regardless i am a rather openminded individual when it comes to movies so i thought perhaps the movie would bring some kind of breakthrough spin on carnivorous vinesbr br unfortunately it failed to meet my expectations due to the excessive amounts of cliché and lack of any originality to top it off the female lead character continues to annoy you off with her stupidity unless the movie is intentionally a bad brated movie that is entertaining in the hilarity of badness no movie should ever ever ever have a main character irritate you if one expects the audience to care about the character such roles should be reserved for secondary characters characters were undeveloped the monsters plants in this case left unexplained and clichés were dripping all overbr br the only thing that is mildly effective are some of the bloodygory scenes although the gore pales in comparison with movies like high tension or ichi the killer consistently failed logic such as why would a character not watching the top of a rope during a second attempt at descending into the ruins when it just snapped and almost killed someone even if minor adds up and just continues to anger the audience the movie couldve saved itself by using characters or some kind of story device to reprimand or redeem idiot characters who just did something stupid or at least let the character recognize or regret her own mistakes but to continue to allow idiocy to preside will certainly cause the audience to abandon all care for the character in turn taking away the terror of the moviebr br overall this is a poorly done movie an example of a well done movie involving pretty twentysomethings getting killed is the texas chainsaw massacre remake and the prequel too that certainly instilled fear and had much less character logic flaws in summary if you have a lot of time to kill go watch it if theres nothing else otherwise dont waste your time with this subpar flick and go see something actually scary and highly satisfying like the hills have eyes remake
