i saw this movie with very low expectations i didnt know a lot about it so i wasnt sure if it was going to be worth itbr br the story did an ok job of getting you curious about these ruins they travel to the suspense continues when the mayans show up and force them to stay at the ruinsbr br then the movie turns from somewhat suspenseful to pointless the amount of gore found in this movie did not balance out compared to whether it was truly necessary or used more for shock valuebr br the fact that they didnt make any attempt to fight the vines from hell they had fire and didnt try to burn it nor did they try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not they quickly jumped into a victim role and their helpless attitude was not real it reminded me of the old horror movies where the people just scream and yell and dont have half a brain to try to fight back
