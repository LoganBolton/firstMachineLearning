im 35 bruce was the man in evil dead and i still love to watch ed1 and ed2 it was cool also to see him as the king two or three years ago in bubba ho tep in which he showed versatility and great acting talent but this screaming brain adventure is certainly not for bruces early fans either im getting too old for this sh17 or im just not part of bruces target audience anymore im positive kids age 9 to 13 will love this film but this over extended matinée scifi comedy contains about 5 minutes total of interesting moments and the rest is cheap kids slapstick humor campbell better talk seriously with sam raimi and get their brains screaming together for a last evil dead reunion picture to get back my interest at least there would be a good director behind the camera sorry bruce this just doesnt cut it for me take care
