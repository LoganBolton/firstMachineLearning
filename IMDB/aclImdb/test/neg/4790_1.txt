other than cop rock and that show where the kid dies from eating a spoiled hamburger he found under the bed this has consistently been the worst and dumbest show to survive prime time if not for jason lees unjustifiable success in film this show would have never made it out of conception if pitched with a relatively unknown as the lead br br the concept is terrible moron redneck hick spends his lottery winnings to redeem himself with the white trash of his past is it funny periodically but not consistently is it stupid each and every single episode br br ive seen a lot of great shows come then go before their time yet this blunder has survived longer than i ever could have imagined the dialog is incredibly unfunny as are the episode themes every episode for someone with an iq over 100 is an absolute struggle and the icing on the cake jason lees annoying voice narrating each episode if it werent for the states southern culture and rednecks of the south this show wouldnt have an audiencebr br if youre a moron and need a show completely lacking humor yet overflowing with bad taste bad dialog and dimwit characters failing at lifewell then youre probably an actor on this show
