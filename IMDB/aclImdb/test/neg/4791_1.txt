have you seen all the big adventures of last few decades if you have dont bother with this one as youve already seen most of the scenes already  and i can guarantee that those scenes were originally in much better moviesbr br the story im sure that true storytellers will never forgive me is childish and stupid stupid in a way that making it play in a mortuary would result in a bunch of angry walking dead every character is based in a cliché and well theyre nothing but the cliché and yes again all you need to be a hero is to be americanbr br at least in finland they advertised this to be the kind of movie the dvd was made for maybe i should sell my player thenbr br 110
