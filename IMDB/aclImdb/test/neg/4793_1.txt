infamous for being brought to you by the digital effects team behind independence day coronado is even more of a spectacular failure just from being juxtaposed with id4 this ridiculous mess of a film starts off with a brainless premise and goes completely downhill from there a wealthy soon to be married couple in beverly hills are the subjects of this idiotic story claires fiancée has taken off on a business trip right around christmas so she decides to spontaneously fly to switzerland so they can spend the holiday together i especially love that her initial reason for wanting to go was because he had left some documents at home that she thought he might need she grabbed them up and yelled after him while he drove away concluding that her best bet would be to fly to the other side of the planet rather than call his cell phone i refuse to believe that a couple living in such a cavernous mansion as theirs were unaware of the existence of mobile phonesbr br so up until this point the movie is unbelievably bad but check this out this is where it starts to get bad she gets to switzerland and when she cant find her husband she gets some cake and calls her friend to whine about how unfair it all is this woman is not an action hero and she is definitely not a german indiana jones for crying out loud she is an overgrown cheerleader a pampered sorority girl whose outdoor experience is probably limited to digging her spike heels out of the ground when she gets tipsy enough to wander onto the lawn during a wine and cheese party out on the bluffsbr br she gets a tip that her fiancée is in south america so she like totally flies there to get him once there this moron thinks shes going to go into the jungle by herself sniff out the enemy base and rescue her poor helpless boyfriend she laughs off a comment about the danger of going in there then freaks out later because she finds out that there are battles going on you never said anything about battlebr br there is one point where claire and some journalist that she met up with drive this huge truck across a bridge that is hundreds of feet high and hundreds of feet across and suspended by two by fours literally there are thousands of thin pieces of wood tied together with twine and these morons decide to drive over it not only does it crumble under the weight of the truck but claire manages to fall off of it falling hundreds of feet and landing on her back in the shallow river below later she recalls the event laughing it off like oh maybe it was only a hundred at least she wasnt twirling gum on her fingersbr br what is truly sad about this catastrophically bad movie is that they even managed to coax a terribly performance out of the tremendously talented john rhysdavies a real indiana jones veteran there is a lot of nonsense about an uprising at the end of the film where we meet an extremist rebel leader who when we first meet him has such a thick accent that he rolls his rs like he thinks hes in a ruffles commercial then later he talks like some guy they pulled off the streets of venice beach unbelievablebr br the special effects are negligible the team that brought you independence day by the very fact that they were involved with id4 was simply going through the motions throwing together some matted and blue screen shots i have to believe because they just had nothing better to do the story is astonishingly bad and kristin dattilo who many other imdb users cite as the only reason to see the film doesnt put the slightest effort into her performance maybe she thought the digital effects team behind independence day could superimpose some meaning into this messbr br and given how far theyve fallen maybe they thought they could toobr br they could at least have tried
