so were supposed to find it funny that this woman travels all the way to the jungle  to the warzone  just to find out why her fianc√©e didnt travel to switzerland or are we supposed to take it seriously its not even remotely funny clever or entertaining  its stupid  and so is the movie the lead actress is one of the most annoying characters i have ever seen in a movie  even worse than jarjar binks dialog tries very hard to be funny almost all the time but it never is the number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing and as for the plot  did they even once bothered to explain to us what are the rebels fighting for other than being antigovernment i guess that didnt matter to anyone  neither to the rebels nor to the characters who just blindly flew to the battlefield dont waste your time coronado is neither funny nor entertaining
