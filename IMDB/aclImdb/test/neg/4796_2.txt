it didnt feel like a movie and was thankfully short under 90minutes it felt more like a commercial of possibilties in computer graphics most of the special effects are great to be sure but that cerainly dont a great or even a good movie make not saying its absolutely worthless viewing since its possible to see what are the possibilities in cgi or gci or what ever its calledbr br as i read somewhere you cant fix it in the cutting room a bad story and nondirected actors cant be fixed in the cutting room or even with the most magnificent special effects things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and material to work frombr br however they thought this could be sold in usa is anyones idea since usa is the crooksbr br and isnt it sooo typical of low budget stories they have to create an imaginative country south of mexicobr br well well i gace it 2 just because of the special effects the rest is absolute trash
