i went to see this film over matchstick men in fact buying the tickets to matchstick men and going to the other because it looked like a fun movie with action romance thrills jungles and exotic locations they had all that but so do a lot of movies with a conception of storybr br all i can say is why why why why did they not just make it a straight narrative instead of some sappy flashback storybr br here is all the movies from what ive seen the film was derived from of course indiana jones and romancing the stone but also true lies proof of life that old 80s tom selleck movie bananas woody allen and hero from the use of digital extrasbr br ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up
