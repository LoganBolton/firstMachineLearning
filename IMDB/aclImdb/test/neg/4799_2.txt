the bipolarity of this movie is maddening one moment its making fun of latin americans american tourists and banana republics in general the other it wants to be touching with burned villages and orphans even the serious revolutionary hero becomes a parody of a revolutionary at one point but the comedy parts arent even funny because its so obviously stolen from star wars yes star wars the hero is basically a rogue with a heart of gold add to this stereotypical sounds effects latin americans who speak english with one another and a villain that just disappears from the story and whats the point its basically revolution propaganda with no resolution and no planning because there is just no way these people can lead a country the us government are bad guys but wholl make money producing this not some poor farmer thats for sure
