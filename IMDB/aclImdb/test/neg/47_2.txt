i caught this on ifc last week and i thought it was typical of the indie short subject film heavy on style little on substance and originality does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive and blond to boot boy with 70s shag hair and toocoolforschool clothes plus this film wallows in late 1970s chic which works for some sofia coppolas the virgin suicides comes to mind but not for this directorbr br another reviewer compared this to harmony korines work and i agree yet i dont view this as a positive thing what has he done lately anyway bobbycrush is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved if you happen to see it late night on cable turn the channel and watch something else instead
