when i first saw this movie i said to myself hey what the heck it sounds like a good movie why not rent it so yeah i rented it and went back home to see it when i inserted it in my dvd player i was shockedbr br well first of all no one told me it was a mexican movie and was spoken in spanish good thing it had subtitlesbr br second it was nude nude nude since i have no background whatsoever in mexican movies you could see my shock when i saw it gasp covering virgin eyes noobr br third predictable to say the least but actually being it predictable was no excuse to me in liking movies because i dont seem to care if its predictable unless its way over the top br br fourth how heidi and kike were reunited so cheesy br br fifth how the movie ended it was a bad bad ending how mr van der lindes sudden approval to the mayors election was because her daughter knew how to throw the party blah blah i was hoping that he wasnt that easy to accept it the director might have just rushed it br br after all of this bashing of the bad stuff the good stuffs are here to come the movie was actually quite hilarious at some point with maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and all heidis attitude valentina being poetic with words what i really also like about it was the song that valentina made with her girl friend thats all and for the other stuffs that i havent mentioned they were just soso
