adela is a rebellious teenager with the attitude that she is right and everyone else is wrong she needs to be the center of attention and shell act stupid to make it so with her attitude she gets sent to charm schoolbr br there she meets the typical characters in todays cinema the nerd the clumsy one the stepford housewife and the sexual minority things happen and in the end adela learns her lesson so to speak the plot tries to carry a deeper meaning to the state adela is in but utterly fails to deliver at least i didnt buy it so what you are left with is superficial interaction within the same stereotypes youve seen in a million movies before plus the director seems to have a breast fixation adela flashes her boobies a few times too many at least i cant see that they are relevant to the storybr br so the film is ok but if you are like me and dont like to watch a teenager pissing people off and making a behavioral uturn in an instant which i found very unbelievable think twice before watching
