as a bruce campbell fan for nearly two decades i was thrilled to have an opportunity to see his latest film on the big screen with the man himself in attendance unfortunately man with the screaming brain was itself a disappointmentbr br set in bulgariawhere the scifi channel makes its saturday night original filmsman with the screaming brain is a curious mix of 50s bmovie horror bodyswitching comedy violent revenge flick and overdone slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation if that doesnt make sense well neither does man with the screaming brain campbell plays a pharmaceutical company ceo who visits bulgaria with his estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the former communist countrys halffinished subway system the two fall in with a former kgb agent turned cab driver and all three ultimately meet their demise at the hands of a vengeful gypsy womanbr br a local scientist stacy keach and his goofy assistant ted raimi who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab drivers brain into campbells damaged skull also they put his wifes brain into a robotic body they just happen to have at handbr br campbell escapes and with a hastilyrestitched skull and the voice of the cab driverwhose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his bodyechoing in his head sets off to find and kill the gypsy his robot wife does the same br br but first theres an attempt to emulate steve martinlily tomlins all of me when campbells two personalities battle for dominance over a restaurant dinner just as he was playing his own evil hand in evil dead ii campbell is adept at making his body appear to be inhabited by more than one mindbr br at times screaming comes closest to another steve martin film the man with two brains as it also takes a silly approach to 50s scifi clich√©s however it tries too hard for too little result and that goes double for ted raimis semicomprehensible bulgarian oaf who gets entirely too much screen time nothing against raimi its just that hes better in smaller doses br br in the end its neither outrageous or funny enough to satisfy as a spoof nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a bmovie pastiche i was glad that campbell had already left the screening by the time it ground to a halt as i feared having to say gee bruce that was reallysomethingbr br perhaps the best praise i can give it as a film is that at least the images stuck to the emulsion and it was twice as good as alien apocalypse
