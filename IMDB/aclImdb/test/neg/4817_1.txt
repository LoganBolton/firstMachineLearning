totally braindead actioner made in the philippines this belongs to the mode of filipino movies which tried to pass themselves as american films on the international market after a rather dull beginning the movie takes off and never disappoints again it is actually a ripoff of the worst movies chuck norris ever made  an american prisoner in vietnam is brainwashed by the soviets who implant a microchip in his brain so he is programmed to kill the pope then the president of the usa one of his old buddies played by bmovie stalwart max thayer is sent to stop him utterly ridiculous action scenes putrid acting nick nicholsons performance as the evil soviet commander is a mustseeand implausible plot make up for one of the cheesiest action pictures ever bestowed in the general public
