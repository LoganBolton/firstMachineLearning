ive watched this film about thirty years ago and it stuck in my mind until now when i came across it on dvd i didnt hesitate too long even more because i have a predilection for early belmondo flicks but what a bad surprise some movies should be allowed to resign from public exposure to preserve a certain memory and not to shock audiencesbr br widely hailed as one of chabrols rare cynic works the only lasting impression i got from re watching it is boredom some movies really do not age in style but what about movies which didnt have any sense of style at allbr br the flaws in the script uninspired acting  presumably due to the lack of direction  a sort of production design which doesnt deserve its name less than mediocre photography and last but not least the worst editing job ive seen in ages make this one truly hard to standbr br my impression was that there was a bunch of people with too much money and equipment but obviously no idea or any skills at all it really comes as a surprise that this one didnt abruptly end chabrols career dont blame it on the overall bad taste of the 70s this one is crap in its own right and a worthy contender for the most useless waste of celluloid ever
