i love the socalled blaxploitation films and have seen dozens some such as cotton comes to harlem shaft and hammer have excellent production values and are very entertaining while many others are very cheap and silly but still entertaining such as brotherhood of death or coffey however dolemite manages something rare for the genreits just cheap and silly and not the least bit entertaining its like blaxploitation made for very very stupid peoplebr br years ago i saw a takeoff on the dolemite films on mad tv and unfortunately the real dolemite isnt any better like the parody the acting is just atrocious rudy ray moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood he can barely read his lines and his karate is a jokewith his kicks obviously missing the target again and again as for the rest of the actors many might be even worse my favorite was the fbi guy who couldnt even remember his lines and really struggled to get them outyet they didnt even bother to refilm these scenes in fact so much of it was inept that i had a hard time figuring out whether the film was intended as a jokebr br if you think that despite horrible acting and action that there is something worth seeing about this film youre wrong even for the perverts out there hoping to see some skin will be disappointed the naked women in the film really do look like hardluck prostitutes and theres nothing remotely sexy about their sagging bodies i think looking at old people nakedreeeaally old people nakedis no worse than looking at these ladies and as for rudy ray he has man boobs no black superhero or antihero should look that bad naked for goodness sakes put on your clothes people and come up with a script that doesnt look like it was written by winosbr br fyiapparently there are actually sequels to this film i cant imagine watching them so youll just have to find someone else to review them i have watched plan 9 from outer space teenagers from outer space and robot monster but i just dont think i can bring myself to see another dolemite filmthey are that bad
