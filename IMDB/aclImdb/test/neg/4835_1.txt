what offends me most about the critics following this film is the mentioning of originality this film does not contain one innovating element if by originality you refer to pathetic action scenes overacting gluttony in violence blunt humor and a script beyond intellectual belief then originality is something swedish film can do withoutbr br how röse and karlsson can agree to act in this poor excuse for a film is a mystery to me and how eva röse after the making of this film can be seen at breakfasttv promoting it just disappoints mebr br this film doesnt contain a story the script is illogical stiff and last but not least just plain bad these two young directors have put together a quite disgusting boyfantasy containing violence comicstrips and trivialized psychological portraits i wouldnt be surprised if the scene of dd masturbating in the kitchen over a microwave dinner actually is put there to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown cinematic nerds that pose as directorsbr br i wouldnt show this movie to my worst enemy
