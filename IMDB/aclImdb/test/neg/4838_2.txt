i do not understand why anyone would waste their time or money on utter trash like this dont get me wrong  i love a good western  notice i said good  this is just trashbr br the acting is horrible  val kilmer must know someone or owed a favor or something for them just to use his face and name in this ridiculous piece of crapbr br to those of you who enjoyed this movie i am making a list of youre names to ensure i do not watch anything you suggest  our tastes are definitely different yet it is your right to voice your opinion no matter how far off base it isbr br i gave this movie a 2 just in case they do throw out all of the ones and not count them just bad in all areas
