sure you get to see some boobies but if thats all youre looking for in a film you get more mileage from youtube i just paid a dollar from redbox because i saw val kilmers name bad move plot didnt thicken dialogue was shoddy characters undeveloped at best somebody said cinematography was alright but dont expect too much this movie moved very slow and ended without grace blacklist i spent much of the movie wondering if some event or color scheme of things was symbolic i never actually rewound to figure it out because nothing was ever explained in the end no twists it also left many questions that as it turns out i had no desire to hear answered one of the worst movies i have ever seen
