as most of you ive watch a lot of great movies in between those we often either voluntarily or mistakenly also find those movies that are so pointless that we think of reasons as to why anyone would make it this is exactly what i can say for dead mans bountybr br the very least i can do is try to warn some of you if you enjoy being entertained by a motion picture because of the story acting and intensity than you might want to chose something else now its not all badin fact if all you want is creative film editing and unique angles along with original music ambient than you might think its ok as someone that values movie plots acting and being entertained by a film the truth is i thought this movie was so terrible beyond words i could easily find a spot for it on my list of worst movies seen in a while br br as for having val kilmer in this the truth is he was casted probably as a favor to the director as a fan of some of kilmers films i cant understand what his motive for this was the movie seems part western part romancein the end im sure most of you can agree with me that it simply is a rude waste of our time in case you havent seen this movie my recommendation would be to avoid it completely
