i had never heard of dead mans bounty when i saw it at the dvd store a few weeks ago and i thought i had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem since it had val kilmer in it in a truly unique role sadly it wasnt more than ten or fifteen minutes into the movie that i realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions the first clue you will see of how genuinely awful this movie is comes near the beginning when you have a bunch of dirtbags in an old saloon laughing like a bunch of hyenas in a scene that goes on about five times too long its unbelievable how bad it is and sadly it doesnt get any betterbr br val kilmer is featured prominently on the movies cover box maybe to trick you into thinking that he has a role in the film but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of halfwit crooks and the most inept conceptualization of a unique town sheriff that ive ever seen in a movie hes played by boguslaw linda who is unable to or uninterested in covering his polish accent immediately making it impossible that the movie is meant to take place in the american old west br br does poland have this type of frontier past i dont know my knowledge of polish history is not my strong point but i can tell you this the sheriff as he is known in the movie is the worst representation of law enforcement that i can ever remember seeing in a movie he is introduced in a truly ridiculous scene where he is wearing some kind of blindfold and a roomful of men take turns punching him in the face before they start hitting him he explains that they can each hit him once and then after the first round they will each hit him again and if he can identify who is throwing the punches they lose what the hell is this crap i am completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever be put into any movie br br throughout the movie the sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and bruised and drunk and battered until ultimately he does nothing but show up occasionally stumbling on screen and mumbling notwithoutthe law you see there is a lot of talk and preparation for a hanging the details of which are as meaningless as the rest of the movie br br it takes place by the way in a town that consists of nothing more than two ramshackle wooden buildings facing each other across a flattened bit of dirt that is more of a path than a road my understanding is that it is a part of poland that is supposed to look acceptably enough like the american southwest where none of the characters except maybe the dead guy could possibly have come frombr br i have heard that val kilmer accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role and also by director uklanskis minimal use of dialogue in favor of a reliance on cleverly timed juxtaposition of images in unique visual montages br br yeah whatever br br seems to me that kilimer was unable to overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling that he must have gotten when he was offered the role personally i would really feel that i had reached quite some level of success if someone approached me and offered me probably a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lay still for a while i like to think that he didnt even read the script for this mess because if he did i am at a total loss to understand why he accepted the rolebr br at any rate the movie opens with a man bringing in the corpse of a man played by kilmer seeking the reward soon he finds himself embroiled in a ludicrous love story involving the town prostitute the alcoholic sheriff and lots of mayhem involving a series of stupid stupid characters br br there is also a extensive and preposterous lack of understanding of american rituals in one scene a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and squishes the halves into kilmers eyes for what reason i cant imagine and then later a man makes a short speech over kilmers corpse in which he explains that he was one of the finest men we ever had and then he proceeds to lop his head off with a shovel what the hell br br not convinced yet here are some more reasons not to watch it in one scene the sheriff appears to be covered with ash except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only possibly be described as bright red lipstick a man gets a head wound that drenches his head and body in blood in a daze he cauterizes it with gunpowder smart near the end the sheriff appears to have a broken arm sitting at the bar he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm and uses his good arm to pull on the rope lifting his shaking beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth rather than using his good arm to drink also smart br br why doesnt he just use his good arm i have no idea that like everything else in the movie makes no sense whatsoever like the title summer love are you kidding me avoid this mess at all costs br br in the meantime heres something for the imdb goofs page  br br errors made by characters possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers  this movie got made ha
