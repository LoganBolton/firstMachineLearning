i kept waiting for this film to improve but alack this is the worst kind of escapist movie a spunsugar confection that sinks under the weight of its own ponderous selfimportance the pace stumbles on like a legionnaire stranded in the sahara the absence of good dialogue leaves the appealing stars with little to do other than look good in white linen irons plays yet another moneyed charmer whos had a touch of the sun kaas is a pleasing singer but not much of an actress luckily the script does not often call on her to emote away from the jazz club microphone all the enviably relaxed pretty unnecessary characters take turns masticating the scenery with an air of weary sophistication the whole exercise comes across like an interminably long ralph lauren ad br br if youre past forty and believe francophilia is the key to sophistication you may well mistake this piece of cardboard for a baguette well if you liked this movie you probably felt smart for appreciating godards leaden Ã©loge de lamour and you may even have sat through le divorce without cringing
