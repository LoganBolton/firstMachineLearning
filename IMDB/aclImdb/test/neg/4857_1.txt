i have to say that this movie was really quite awful the acting was average the pacing of the movie was terrible as well as the soundtrack and cinematographyi found that i was bored in most parts of the movie and the clich√© lines did nothing for me the two boys that played the main roles looked terrible at times and didnt pull off the emotion that was needed in the movie the little girl was creepy at times and looked like a doll which was scary the ending wasnt satisfying although the movie to be over the ending didnt make me feel anything for the characters this movie was boring and did nothing for me i recommend this movie to no one
