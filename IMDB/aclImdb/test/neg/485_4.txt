this is better than the early cronenberg horror films but nothing more than your basic whatisreal story the videogame theme has been told before too nothing original is left except the weird cronenberg atmosphere which is not that strong here with the amusing sexual references and shores dark score the story never grabs your full attention it just flows forward event after event with boring pace rating 410
