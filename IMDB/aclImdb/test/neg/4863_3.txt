would you be surprised if i told you this movie deals with a conspiracy no how about if i told you the ringleader was a shadow puppet what you dont believe me  ok yes i made that up its too bad this movie could have used a sense of humor i understand charlie sheen doing this at the time  another movie equaled more money  as for donald sutherland and linda hamilton  why dont even get me started on stephen lang he was so much fun as the party crasher in the hard way and now this junkbr br ah no matter everyone involved should feel ashamed if you aim to make a bad movie and succeed  its twisted  but i seriously doubt that was what they were aiming for here flat out the story stinks and were actually supposed to take this yak seriously makes you wonder if this movie even had a glimmer of hope seriously i doubt it and in an industry so tight with the purse strings how this got green lit in the first place is beyond me maybe even more scary is how this dog pile made its way to theatersbr br oh  sam waterson how great you are in law  order why are you here demoting yourself to the role of the president of the united states who might i add gets to be shot at by a remote control biplane controlled by the gonzo assassin then again this is a masterpiece of work from george p cosmatos whos directing credits include rambo first blood part ii amongst other gems hmm case in point
