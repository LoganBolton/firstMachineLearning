this film starts with a pedestrian setup before blundering into the standard sort of suspense action where an office worker keeps beating up trained secret service men etcbr br i couldnt say the acting was bad  there were some good surprised faces by hamilton and sheen  but then i really wouldnt have to br br risible finale did at least give me a good laugh for my pains still if my life was flashing before my eyes i think i would fast forward this 90 minutesbr br i have to write two more lines of text just to get this thing published yes very resistant suit that sheen wears i made a special promise to myself never to watch a film this bad again
