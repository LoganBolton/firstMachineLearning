this all looked quite promising an upandcoming presidential adviser is framed for a series of murders as he has been tipped off that a conspiracy is going on within the white house it stars the excellent donald sutherland among several capable actors yet very few people have a good word to say about itbr br the whole thing really needed some depth you can pick up the idea that the president is being too leftwing with his ideas and some within the government want him dead to stop those ideas being carried out conrad appears to simply want the country to be governed his way rather than the way of the elected leaderbr br however the action scenes had a few logic holes  the sewers and elevators already mentioned and the rather haphazard assassination method  and linda hamiltons character is completely uninspired her the presidents my father diversion was ludicrous  that would make the president about 10 when that happened worse still was her predictable final scene with bishopbr br they could have made a challenging inventive political thriller but either bottled it or failed they couldve gone to town on special effects but the good ones were wasted they could have achieved so much more in general this was barely worth the Â£1 it cost me
