1st watched 2252002  4 out of 10dirgeorge p cosmatos predictable action thriller where any frequent movie goer could guess what was coming next charlie sheen is the good old boy to the president who just happens to be not liked by the rest of the presidential staff of course he gets involved in a situation where hes framed over and over again and he has one friend in the white house played by sutherland who naturally doesnt stay that way for very long his other friend is a reporter played by linda hamiltonwho has very little to do or say in this meaningless role and of course his biggest and bestest friend is the president himselfsam waterston who stays his pal till the end despite everyone else being killed around him brainless yet actionpacked meaningless trife despite loads and loads of acting talentall pretty much wasted
