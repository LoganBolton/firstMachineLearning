they make everything too easy in this film it sort of reminded me of indiana jones where he hides on the outside of a submarine during an ocean crossing everybody knows everything thats going on its just real easy to get anyplace you want in the white house i dont even know why i watched half of it because i like charlie sheen and donald sutherland i expect the usual ability to dodge bullets from every angle and be able to run faster than a motorcycle usually its faster than a car in a garage or a allyway it was silly mostly and i didnt even know then had a tenstory elevator in the white house anyway anything conspiratorial is always interesting
