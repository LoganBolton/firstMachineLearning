i just saw this on a local independent station in the new york city area the cast showed promise but when i saw the director george cosmotos i became suspicious and sure enough it was every bit as bad every bit as pointless and stupid as every george cosmotos movie i ever saw hes like a stupid mans michael beywith all the awfulness that accolade promisesbr br theres no point to the conspiracy no burning issues that urge the conspirators on we are left to ourselves to connect the dots from one bit of graffiti on various walls in the film to the next thus the current budget crisis the war in iraq islamic extremism the fate of social security 47 million americans without health care stagnating wages and the death of the middle class are all subsumed by the sheer terror of graffitibr br a truly stunningly idiotic film
