this movie is not worth seeing at least not at a cinema the story is hard to follow and understand it starts with 10 minutes of something happening 3 years earlier its hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or just is so badweird that it sometimes seems like it american sirens and lights on swedish police cars is just one example the acting of persbrandt and bergqvist is good as usual but i think jenny lampa acting as jasmin acts very poor zara zetterqvist acts pretty well shes not been seen as an actor in swedish movies for a long time if you still want to see it wait until its released on dvd or is shown on tv
