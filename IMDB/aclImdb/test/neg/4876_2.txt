this movie features several well known actors which i usually like so i had at least modest expectations when i rented this on dvd i was highly disappointed in fact i walked off for some snacks somewhere during the last half hour and somehow i ended up in the kitchen rather then going back to the tv the actor performances where poor pretty much all across the board and none of the atmospheres in the movie felt very convincing virtually all scenes had that just a movie feeling to them i just sat there waiting to hear the director calling cut followed by the crew having a little chat about the scene before moving on to the nextbr br since the movie is about gangsters most characters are tough and moblike the problem here is just that this whole badboy attitude is played out so poorly that it just feels like a joke the constant guitardrilling soundtrack really tries to emphasize this atmosphere too but when the same track is played the 18th time it just adds to the already strong feeling of the whole thing just being fakebr br maybe it was just a really really bad script maybe it was just poorly executed im no movie critic in fact i consider it rare to see something thats really good but this was just plain bad no matter how objective and forgiving im trying to be not recommended not even as a rental
