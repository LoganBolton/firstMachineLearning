where do i start lets list the good things about this movie firstbr br 1 mikael persbrandt is great as the gangster thomas this is the only character you will actually care about and hes a bad guy allthogh never does anything bad and is generally a pretty likable guy 2 kjell bergkvist is always great hes a bit toned down here but he is quite funny still 3 the movie looked pretty good by swedish standards good use of depth of field and lightsbr br now the bad this is by far the worst script to make it into the big screen ever the acting by everyone else was pretty bad and over the top the direction was horrible a totally meaningless story totally unrealistic characters and events and 15 hours to long during emotional scenes pretty much everyone in the theater laughed people just started walking out during the course of the screening br br theres no way to actually summarize the story into something coherent so i wont even try every clich√© ever conceived is in there and in all the wrong places im sorry to say this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life br br watch it for a good laugh but try not to pay any money for it br br r
