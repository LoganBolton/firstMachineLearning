i was not expecting a classic but at least a funny film there were only a few scenes that makes you laugh but nothing more you dont scare it is full of american teenslasher cliches and you can guess what will happen easilybr br but it tells much about a senior student in a turkish highschool pressure of student selection exam oss that 3hourexam determines which university youll go and thinking about the exam when a ghost is after you is not exaggeration the movie is bad dont waste your time to watch it
