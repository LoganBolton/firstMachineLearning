i got this movie in a bargain bin hoping for an amusingly bad flick boy was i disappointed except for avon you see the movie is indeed horrible but so horrible it isnt even laughable the plot oh wait there is no plot i suppose you could say its about the main character rising up in the ranks of street fighting at the end of the movie the directors decided to either not make any more sense or more likely died and had a monkey finish directing the movie dont read if you dont want the ending spoiled although the ending doesnt really spoil anything the main character somehow ends up in a room filled with mirrors a la enter the dragon and then gets real angry has stupid flashback and hits a mirror the end wheeeebr br the only redeeming factor of this movie was avons scene hes talking to the rival street fighting boss and says something along these lines completely deadpan do not worry about him anymore sir i have killed him in a sophisticated manner i wined him i dined hm we went to a disco we was havin a lot of fun and then i killed him at which point the boss says good work avon youre number 1 and avon says number 1 alllriiiiight alriiight the scene continues with avon continuing to say alllrriiiight over and over the next scene is of a dead avon floating in a pool intelligent i think notbr br lastly i own the homeboy version of this movie meaning the title on the box i own is homeboy it shows a huge guy holding a giant gun and screaming this never happens in the movie this man is never in the movie high qualitybr br notei am new to this reviewing but hell yes i am going to keep it up
