this movie is overrated to say the least its not good as a comedy and its not good as a serious film either the pacing is far too plodding for the former and there is too much lame slapstick for the latter the only laughs come from some of bud spencers reaction shots when he becomes exasperated by his brothers behavior the dubbing is excellent but the fullscreen framing is appalling 12
