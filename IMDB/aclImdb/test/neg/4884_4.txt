very interesting to find another reviewer who had the exact same reaction to this movie as i did it was a heck of a lot better when i was 10 or 11 years oldbr br seeing it more than 30 years later its still okay but it only mildly held my interest what seemed hugely funny back then was only mildly amusingbr br also things that were astonishing to me as a 10yearold came across as just silly for example in one scene trinity is walking along and fires his revolver behind him and kills two men without even looking in fact he doesnt even bother to look and see if theyre dead because he knows he hit the mark um yeah rightbr br in addition a lot of the dialogue sounds quite wooden sorry but 35 years later it hasnt really aged that wellbr br although its been a long time since ive seen that one as well probably a better terrence hill film than this one would be my name is nobody
