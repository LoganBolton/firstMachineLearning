i purchased this one for a couple of dollars at the local video store as they cleared out their tapes in favour of dvds i doubt theyll be replacing this one somehowbr br i couldnt say that its one of the worst movies ive ever seen but its very dull no real cannibal scenes me me lai is not naked enough of the time only about 4 or 5 times and shes not the thai goddess that i expected either so two of my reasons for watching this movie were knocked outbr br there is some severe animal violence here for those that enjoy that sort of thing a great fight between a mongoose and a large snake gets quite bloody animal torture as well some of which is real and some fake thankfully the fake is somewhat funny but the real is just a little sickeningbr br generally speaking its a 70s film  overly long underdeveloped not as deep as it would have liked to have been but its something different right one and a half stars
