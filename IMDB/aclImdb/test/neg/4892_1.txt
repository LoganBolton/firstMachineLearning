i have to say this this is the first movie im reviewing on here i didnt finish watching i mean i couldnt continue no matter how adamant i am for watching things until the bitter end the ballad of the sad café proved no match to this viewer vanessa redgrave stars as the strange woman in town who does things like walk through the river with a full set of clothes on anyways a long lost relative comes to visit hes a midget and well thats as far as i got what the heck was the point of all of this i didnt even bother to wait for michael carradine to come on as i was already pummeled senseless by the combination of the slow script and having to deal with a midget in a dramatic role i call this coffee table cinema the type of cinema that appeals to just a scant few of you but the others just stay away
