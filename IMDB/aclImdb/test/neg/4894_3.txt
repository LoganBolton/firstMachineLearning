the ballad of the sad café worked hard at its image but when it came down to crunchtime it was left standing in its own selfcreated dustbr br one cannot image saying this out loud but if vanessa redgraves amelia were to fight john wayne or even clint eastwood my hardearned dollars would have to go to redgrave her portrayal of amelia was as close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to any multimillion dollar contracted persona redgrave gave amelia this soulful drawl that was a blend of her own unique voice and a hardearned woman from the south to the average viewer this could be construed as annoying but as the film progressed it became her  miss amelia transforming this stage beauty into a roughneck it was redgraves performance as well as her interaction with the other characters that made this film stand tall  but not the tallest the others following her performance were needed but not stellar as we moved past the murky cliché image passed on by every set designer hired for the postdepression south job the minor characters felt like poster board the image was needed to set the scene but the characters of the town had no other purpose take for example rod steigers vision of some old wild spoken preacher his scenes alone will make any viewer question the validity of this offthebeatenpath town the main two players who surrounded amelia battled with charm for the admirable top scenestealing moment but due to the lacking direction  it just seemed faded the most absurd of the two albeit both rank high among the questionable sanity line is cork hubbard who plays amelias cousin who shows up randomly one night his character is never quite defined he lacks true motive and his loyalties remain uncertain he plays no vital role in this film outside of forcing us the viewers to question his sanity and honesty can you create a character simply by sticking out your tongue flicking your ears and punching your chest and head finally there is the other end of the absurd  keith carradine callows closeups of this tormented man build character but our lack of understanding between him and amelia causes his purpose to flounder these were the characters as cliché southern as they were  some stood forward and attempted to create an absurdist period piece and i cannot argue that they failedbr br where ballad of the sad café failed to rise above mediocrity was in the cinematography and narrative this film was about amelia and her need for other souls in her life the audiences level of comfort with the arrival of her midget cousin was entertaining  one couldnt help but wonder if he was honest or merely a confidence man attempt to leech off a warm heart cork hubbards character is never quite understood but we do accept him with brief shots of him and amelia doing small things together it is his idea that transforms from a recluse businesswoman to a bonafide café owner the problem is that director callow never quite takes us to that dramatic take level between cork and redgrave  is the man crazy or does he represent all of amelias family i needed something from callow that brought these two out of the david lynchesquire relationship that they had then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of carradine as amelias love interest using the technique of a flashback within a flashback we see the two wed but never consummate their love  which amelias anger against their love drawing him into the world of madness why was amelia so angry why was there no connection between carradine and redgrave why was this even in the film with the lack of focus towards these characterss connection the eventual scenes between the two made no sense  throw in corks choice and it just gets completely discombobulated while there were a few beautiful choreographed scenes that callow created the inability to transfer his characters from point a to point b i lost focus interest and my care for the characters plummeted when i didnt understand the ultimate question  why br br overall the ballad of the sad café began with a bang but ended with a very small crack of a firecracker my emotional feel of this film swung up and down up and down and eventually stayed further down mainly due to the lack of understanding of the motives of the characters redgrave did a phenomenal job as amelia and while the other characters outside of the random steiger tried their best i just didnt quite understand who they were their motives were so muddled that when the emotional ending finally occurred i was apathetic director callow seemed to have been lacking importing connecting scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all of our main players callow created some beautiful scenes where faces seemed to overlap the scenery which allowed us to focus on amelia  or carradine but nothing was explained or developed the film played out with anger discover happiness flashback anger anger anger fade out without the comparative connectors this transformed from distinguished period film to actors playing parts in front of camera it was a shame because sad café had the promise it just couldnt deliverbr br grade  ½ out of
