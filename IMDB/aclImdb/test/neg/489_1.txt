contains spoilersbr br but if you werent dropped on the head as a child and then used as a football then youll agree with me that this is one of the worst and yet hilarious series ever made centreing round a woman who as a young girl was beaten by her father who also killed her mother she spends her time drawing but wait for it then she becomes her superhero drawings and goes on to fight crime therefore being drawn by pain so clever the story itself is actually ok but its just how its done jesse the writer and director has no idea how to write a script just listen to a monologue featuring the 8 year old version of the hero and it sounds like it was written by a 30 year old man while her dad who sports a great moustache just walks around the house all day while looking angry just showing how bad the characterisation is especially the bit where he gets angry in the first episode and begins repeating the phrase no more while holding his wifes head before killing her using the marble work surface the following bang sound effect and just his terrible acting as all he can convey is angry just is brilliant including after where he goes to beat his daughter using his belt which is all done with him moaning and looking angry in slow motion the episodes themselves could contain easily a good clean script ranging over 5 minutes but oh no jesse doesnt want this little jesse is shitting out post modernism as if hed just eaten donnie darko and then douched himself to death pointless camera jerks all at weird angles overly repeated lines and even pointless sequences just muddled up every now and again to fill the overlong episodes in conclusion the idea isnt bad its just how its done also there is a great character of a fat guy on a bench who doesnt come up enough and is great i just wanna hug his lil chubby cheeks cause they look so soft the character development is non existent as the main character just says the first philosophical sounding thing that comes to her head although they all contradict one another but all in all mainly stbr br indiana jones 4 however is much better type jeeharv into youtube as well the results may make you weep at the beauty of the world also youll hear a lot of cheap sex jokes mostly gay ones
