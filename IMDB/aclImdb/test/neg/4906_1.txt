i respect mike hodges and liked get carter immensely for its bleak outlook but the croupier just seems like a particularly dull itv dramabr br the reserved cold acting isnt just the preserve of the lead character its spread to the entire cast meaning there is nothing to contrast owens character withbr br none of the characters evoke any kind of feelings at all except boredom the ending of the film is also untidy at bestbr br  the camera work etc is fairly good but if you want to see hodges best watch get carter dont bother with this uninteresting unimaginative trawl through emotions he covered better 20 years ago
