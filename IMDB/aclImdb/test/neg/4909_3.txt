this film is a third rate attempt at a compelling moody thriller and fails miserably on all three counts it just about managed to keep my attention as the protagonist was seen slowly and predictably breaking all the life rules he had conveniently set himself at the beginning of the filmbr br but its in the last 25 minutes or so that things really start to spiral a vaguely plausible plotline and thats being generousbecomes completely rediculous as suddenly new characters appear from nowhere and random and bizzarre events are never explainedbr br this wouldnt be quite so bad if the scripting wasnt so cheesy the acting so wooden despite a strong british cast and the direction so uninspiring this is not an example of good british film making nor indeed should it make tarantino bat an eyelid at least not in comparison to his earlier workbr br my advice in this case if its hard to get hold of dont waste the effort if youre a brit like me and its in your local video shop steer well clear perhaps head to the video entitled american beauty  now thats an example of great british direction
