first of all the genre of this movie isnt comedy its more of a dramabr br i had low expectations on the movie and still they didnt come up them as some of the other reviews point out there are some nice music in the movie but if you want to listen to good music i suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with bon jovi or m√∂tley crue itll be more quality timebr br last if you want to watch a good movie in this rocknroll genre i recommend almost famous
