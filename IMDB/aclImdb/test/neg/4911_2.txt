weak direction weak plot unimpressive music i wonder why udita goswami is there in the movie world in the first place  she tried to reveal a lot of her talent mostly skin but failed to impressbr br music wasnt that impressive as well only one song jhalak dikhlajaa was worth listening to br br aksar the title  well they tried to justify the title of the movie in the end but it didnt make sensebr br there were many unwanted twists and turns in the story which made it more boring however if someones a dino morea fan please go ahead and watch it
