not a good one not at allbr br this installment revolves around a descent of the original murderer inside the amityville home who must face his past to rid himself of the nightmarish terror of amityville itselfbr br its basically nothing my bet is that this film was made for some extra fastcash to buy a boat or something because this ones just ridiculous thankfully it doesnt kill or ruin the series but it just has no effect on the series at allbr br id have to say that just the fact that it is constantly referenced to the old infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this one slightly more bearable than the amityville curse
