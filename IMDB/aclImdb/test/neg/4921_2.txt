there isnt enough space to explain the many ways this movie is a disappointing mess silly special effects and an incomprehensible plot are the least of this movies problems the film looks like it was conceived in the mideighties and just stewed until it could finally be made in the early nineties the mulletheaded hero complete with fashionable miami vice threedays shadow beard the hamfisted slams at ronald reagan it would be funny if it didnt take itself so seriously as it is the movie is just pathetic i actually feel sorry for the poor actresses who wasted their fine nude scenes in this awful movie
