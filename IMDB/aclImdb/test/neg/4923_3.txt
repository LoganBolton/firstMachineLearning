the fact that a film is on dvd doesnt guarantee that its quality is very good the fact that a films quality is threadbare doesnt mean you shouldnt buy it this review actually applies to 2 films paired on a single dvdbr br the plots of these films are of little consequence they are of interest only to people who collect holmes films  anybody who merely wants a few of the better offerings would do well to purchase some of those made by jeremy brett  or in a pinch basil rathbone there are a few other very good holmes films featuring good actors on a oneshot basis  such as seven per cent solution or private life of sherlock holmes in any event these films are considerably less estimablebr br here we have a pair of films featuring some of the best actors to do holmes even if the results tend toward disappointing this appears to be the only disc with these films on it although deadly necklace appears by itself in the same version on other discsbr br sherlock holmes and the deadly necklace dates from 1962 although it neither looks it nor sounds it some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produce by hammer studios not that hammer hasnt turned out some really schlock stuff but where christopher lee was concerned they usually did a better job the print a direct transfer from a rather worn 1133 copy in blackand white the quality of the color suggests the original may have been in color and the snipped ends of the films aspect suggest it may originally have been 1166 or morebr br the film is set in the early 20th century  not improbable since holmes was still working then and didnt actually die until 1957 however the script is not adapted from any actual doyle story it involves an egyptian necklace and professor moriarty shows up as a worldfamous archaeologist as well as the prince of crime the plot is melodramatic and banalbr br the biggest defect of this film is that  for whatever unfathomable reason  hammer filmed it in germany it was nonetheless filmed in english it was then dubbed in german and then redubbed in english so what you hear isnt lee nor any of the other original actors but a bunch of unknowns  not that outside of lee i doubt anyone would know any of the other actors this is too bad since lee see his hound of the baskervilles makes a quite decent holmes as it is his voice double is condescending and plain as bread pudding with no raisins nor cinnamonbr br the music for this film is primarily jazzy in a possible attempt to be period too bad nobody thought of ragtime as it is the music doesnt relate to whats happening on the screen and often is at odds with the actionbr br the other film is sherlock holmes and the speckled band from 1931 starring a young raymond massey the quality of the picture and sound is fully up to that of the 1962 effort and in fact a bit better massey makes a quite respectable holmes although he certainly doesnt own the rôle in the way rathbone did and brett does the other thespians who take part in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers the acting  as is true of many films of this period  owes a lot to the postvictorian stage and to silent filmsbr br it should be noted that while the deadly necklace is available on dvd by itself the speckled band is available only with the former filmbr br there is very little else to be said of this film the settings seem to be an odd combination of the 1890s horsedrawn carriages and the 1920s electronic devices such as a primitive dictaphone taken altogether its an interesting curio and a sufficient inducement to buy the dvd with the pairing rather than a dvd with deadly necklace only
