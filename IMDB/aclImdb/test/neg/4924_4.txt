creakiness and atmosphere this film has but so unfortunately does the print i just viewed raymond massey provides a laid back sherlock holmes almost comically so in early scenes in his bathrobe which he trades in for a laborers garb to investigate the creepy mansion of dr rylott lyn harding what wasnt clear to me was why rylott would have wanted his stepdaughters dead if as in the case of helen angela baddeley he didnt want her to run off to get married he would have accomplished the same thing by having her dispatchedbr br other curiosities abound as well after setting an early wedding date with helen the fianc√©e is no longer heard from for the rest of the picture the presence of a band of gypsies at the time of violet stoners death provides merely a diversion and what could have been an interesting murder tool a poisonous snake is diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra the musical renderings of the indian man servant notwithstandingbr br athole stewart competently portrays holmes aide dr watson though he takes some getting used to if nigel bruce is more your cup of tea as rylott lyn harding is sufficiently menacing a trait that would be put to good use as holmes nemesis professor moriarty in two later films  1935s the triumph of sherlock holmes and 1937s murder at the baskervillesbr br with repeated choppiness and an unsteady camera its surprising that the story line isnt more disrupted than it is its integrity is generally maintained even if one stretches a bit to fill in the gaps i guess that would be my main complaint with the film as mentally bridging some of the jump cuts in the picture proved to be a real pain in the asp
