just saw this film at the fantasy filmfest berlin i am not impressedbr br as far as the story goes too girlfriends return from their mexico vacation while waiting for their luggage they get to know a couple of boys who then take the last and of course wrong shuttle bus to the city on board is also one other older man so weirdly portrayed that you instantly guess that he is one of the bad guys the other one is the driverbr br the shuttle takes them into industrial wasteland and then one after the other goes done a little blood some cut of extremities some violence mostly playing with the fear of the girls in the end after some ups and downs heres and theres some not too new scary moments everyone is dead but the driver and the girls the girls end up in some garage where one of them is killed after confessing that she had slept with the other girlfriends boyfriend the other girl which is the conclusion is sold by the leftover kidnapper yep weirdo got killed in some cargo box to asia a freight harbor being the final picture first story tons of loopholes questions you ask yourself loose ends and a conclusion that is not a good revelation but a total disappointment i cant see how such a unprofessional looser is supposed to have abducted dozens of women as is indicated by a drawer full of drivers licencesaha second acting mediocre at its bestbr br third scare factor ok but i am bored by torture as a means to nothing but itself trade with humans could be a good reason for a horror flick but its not used as one just as a backgroundbr br fourth music and sound some nice tries but the sound possibilities of the industrial landscape warehouse garage and truck sounds have not been really explored music would have been worse without it but apart from that some pseudo moving synth string theme for emotionality when the girls reach their final destination ok i guessbr br verdict avoid it
