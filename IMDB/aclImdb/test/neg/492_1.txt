wellhow and where do i start to describe this utter nonsense imagine the morals of a cheesy hollywood western throw in a lavish helping of the most trite soap opera storyline and try to dupe the kids into thinking its cool by dressing it up to be about something contemporary this film is all package and absolutely no substancebr br it starts with promiseyoung men dreaming of becoming rockstars and engaging in the kind of excessive heroworship everyone can laugh at after that it all goes downhillquicker than a bobsleigh with no brakes the scene involving the first gig with steel dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of cine kitsch i have seen in a long time the singer appears on stage for his debut and falls down some stairswill he get up and singor will he stay there on the floor and not singwho cares by now it gets worse but i dont want to bore myself by having to remember it in all its excruciating detail if you watch it after this review its your own fault
