i hate guns and have never murdered anyone but when even half of the events that take place in shuttle happen to you or close ones and you find a gun you shoot your attacker three times five times whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you i think even god would say good call in a very hosteltype film but more realistic  as this really could happen to anyone well if youre a pretty young woman that is  shuttle was a decent film though on the long side a few good shocks always call aaa even just to change a tire basically just one surprise but for the most part you could see things coming and aside from the typical tie him up instead of the previously mentioned shooting him the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other getting past those its enjoyable for what it is basically we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from mexico home wow thats original and one lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport until late and after an obvious foreshadowed signlanguage scene they enter a toogoodtobetrue halfprice shuttle ride clichéd jocks previously introduced con their way on the shuttle to join what appears to be alan rucks stunt double from speed from here its obvious what happens i did mention it was a hostel knock off but still i didnt find too much horrible yet nothing spectacular though it wouldve served the audience better with roughly 1520 minutes deleted i would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and are into sick horror
