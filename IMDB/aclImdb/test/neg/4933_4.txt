the beginning was decent the ending was alrightbr br sadly this movie suffers from complete and utter shallowness of the characters unrealistic confrontationsfight scenes lack of anyone intelligent outside of the shuttle this makes for an awful middle screenplay br br stuff to look for overly obvious foreshadowing fasthealing cuts overly smoky fires fun seatbelts delayed reactionsbr br i did give it a 4 not a 0 because the start of the movie had some nice elements of happiness and basic character development the relationship between the main darkhaired girl and her fianc√©e is touched upon briefly and the placement of the blond friends impact on that relationship is present though awkwardly so the business discovered at the end is becoming more mainstream and decently done though as another commenter pointed out not unexpected br br viper
