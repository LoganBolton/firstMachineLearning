i found shuttle an incredibly frustrating film to watch it starts quite well and moves along briskly until the first injury which is a doozy after that it becomes very lazy and underwritten as a story it was the case of the plot driving the characters and not the characters driving the plot if you hate film where you cant understand why characters do what they do you will loathe shuttle particularly the last act is odd and seems to occur in a world without common sense also at the end one of the characters confessed a past misdemeanor to her friend rather than generating sympathy from the audience most people started to giggle this was probably because the heroines of the story was a complete idiots finally there is an ending which just seems tacked on to be shocking and comes from the horror copout school of people are bad audience so just accept it without any explanationbr br shuttle is neither good or bad but mediocre and annoying
