this was intolerable spoiler 1 protagonists avoid the pointless disclosure of agonizing truths to their loved ones lest they surrender said status and assume the roles of antagonists spoiler 2 the writers would have us believe that the exposure of multiple transgressions by the transgressor presents a threat to and provokes a retaliatory response by the primary victim of the transgressions spoiler 3 until the final 15 minutes i was anticipating a score of 6 to 8 out of 10 instead it was kind of like discovering that lieutenant columbos dog is the real murderer the story just wasnt credible and i dont think the worlds best director could have saved it without massive editing
