after viewing still life a short film directed by jon knautz i was genuinely excited for his feature film debut jack brooks monster slayer still life had perfectly captured the essence and feel of an episode of the twilight zone and i was eager to see what knautz could do when taking on the horrorcomedy genre the campy nature of the name and promotional materials suggested something along the lines of evil dead or army of darkness a fun gory 80s style horror flick with lots of monsters while that was what knautz was going for he utterly fails at capturing any of the fun or entertainment value these movies hadbr br the problem with jack brooks monster slayer is that it completely lacks an understanding of what made these horrorcomedies that it tries to evoke so great in the first place twothirds of the running time is primarily devoted to the films hero jack brooks a plumber and college student as he goes to class and attempts to deal with his uncontrollable bursts of anger theres nary a monster in sight for the greater part of the film barely even a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at anything horrorrelated even if evil dead or dead alive had subsequent amounts of the gore cut out theyd still be entertaining jack brooks isnt its plain boring which is the worst thing a film of this nature can be jack brooks himself is not all that interesting at least not enough to warrant the amount of screen time hes given all one needs to know about him is revealed in the films first ten minutes and from that point on whenever hes not beating the pulp out of a monster and he rarely does hes not worth watching the movie goes nowhere following him around on psychiatric sessions and scuffles with classmatesbr br eventually things do pick up jack brooks battles a few monsters some heads are crushed a few humans are slaughtered and then its over just like that all within the span of about fifteen minutes it is a good fifteen minutes the monsters are all fairly inventive and done entirely in camera and theres some great gore gags the best being a zombies head crushed in but after sitting through seventyfive minutes of pure tedium fifteen minutes just isnt going to cut itbr br thats really all there is to it i could ramble on about the acting which is fairly well done especially horror icon robert englund in a nontraditional role and how the creature prosthetics are a nice throwback to the days when films didnt use cgi but it really doesnt matter jack brooks monster slayer is utterly boring and while jon knautz obviously does have the talent to create a good film once again the last fifteen minutes are killer and still life was amazing Â– check it out jack brooks completely misses the mark it has its successes acting makeup but those dont change the fact that its not very entertaining at all the screening i caught this at had the director and cast in attendance one piece of information i picked up was that a sequel was in development and that this time it would focus more on fighting monsters as opposed to the creation of a hero my advice skip this one and wait for the sequel
