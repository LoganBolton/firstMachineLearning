jack brooks quirks are at first somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy feel of the beginning of this moviebr br i found myself getting angrier and angrier as i was duped into seeing this one through to the end in hopes that the payoff would be worth the supertedious waitbr br the climax cant begin to make up for all the setup timebr br normally one might expect shallow characters from this genre but the fact that the waittimebeforeaction index is so high should mean that the meantime would be devoted to some interesting character developmentbr br not sobr br while not without its initial charms this movie ultimately infuriates and disappointsbr br wish i could get all that setup time back to reinvest it into something that pays off
