if theres one thing ive learnt from watching george romeros creepshow its that if you stumble upon an mysterious old crate that someone has obviously gone to a lot of effort to hide just leave well alone theres probably something nasty insidebr br obviously professor gordon crowley robert englunds character in jack brooks monster slayer isnt a romero fan cos he busts open the old wooden box he finds buried in his yard only to discoversurprise surprisean ancient demon that possesses his body initially causing him to eat and vomit rather a lotbr br when the demon eventually erupts from crowleys body during chemistry class and begins to transform the students into hellish fleshtearing beasts its up to plumber jack brooks trevor matthews to try and stop the foul creatures armed only with a length of pipe and fuelled by a lifelong hatred of all things monstrousbr br the dvd packaging for jon knautzs lowbudget monster flick promises one hell of a fun ride offering cheesy thrills and spills of the kind one might expect from your average 80s creature feature toothy critters rubber monster suits gruesome gore and absolutely no cgiand for the last 15 minutes thats exactly what viewers get nonstop splattery effects a silly tentacled jabbastyle demon thingy and mucho macho monster mashingbr br its a shame then that the rest of the films running timea massive 70 minutes or sois mostly spent following jack as he goes about his boring everyday business plumbing visiting his shrink going to chemistry class and upsetting his girlfriend if you think you might enjoy a film that focuses primarily on coping with childhood trauma and anger management buying spare boiler valves from a hardware shop and the chemical properties of sodium then this is the film for you but if its a massive dose of monster mayhem youre after then id advise looking elsewhere
