its embarrassing i had like 3 minutes on my way to a job to stop at the video store and it was 2 for 1 night and i was really intrigued by the half nekkid pic of the star br br i guess this film shows what the new york film school and sir daddys fortune  judging by the bio of this clown in the lead  can do for you and you and you cause thats about what we have here and in addition a photoshopped pic of the lead actor with someone elses body in a still image that doesnt happen anywhere in the movie its weird cause in so many ways it had money thrown at it obviously low budget money buckets but from the outset when all the extras are laughing in their scene of terror it doesnt bode well would have maybe had some charm if it had been done for 2 cents in short order i skipped scenes and fast forwarded to see the image on the box that was all i really cared about strange why dont i just rent a porno or something but wow there is bad acting thats funny i guess and bad acting thats just bad robert englund is pretty pathetic in this along with everyone else it does make you appreciate the more not so straight to video horror thats out there   blah most of which i wouldnt bother with shoulda watched uh hellraiser 3 if i wanted to see an 8 pack i would imagine horny old gay guys with 2 minutes in the video store are going to be the principle renters of this and they ought to start a class action suit
