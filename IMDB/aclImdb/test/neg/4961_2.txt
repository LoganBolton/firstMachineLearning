with my two stars i will probably make it to the head of the imdb hated itlist for this apparently tremendously popular tv seriesbr br not least because of the enthusiastic comments on this website i decided to purchase a dvd edition of the series because i usually find british humour suits me just fine i gave up in the middle of the second instalment  and according to other comments the funniest bits were already throughbr br so now i know according to another comment that i definitely lack a sense of humour but then i had to laugh like crazy while watching and rewatching fawlty towers to which black books is  albeit faintly  thematically related why the different reactions it might be a mere generation thing and yet the differences can be pointed outbr br both fawlty towers and black books are set in businesses which are meant to sustain their owners financially both businesses are not successful but seem  by a miracle  to survive fawlty towers is funny because the protagonists have to deal with situations they cannot cope with the funniness lies in the fact that they make a serious effort to succeed and while laughing one also feels sorry for them black books has no situations its just there and the owner passes his time feeling sorry for himself if a situation threatens to arise it is quickly shooed away it is remarkable how fast and how often a subject is dropped and the protagonists turn to something entirely different to produce an additional joke telling jokes  and not very good ones  seems to be all black books is about why a bookstore a hardware store would have done the job just as well br br no stop wait its a bookshop because below the veneer of rudeness vulgarity and arrogance the protagonists are supposed to be delicate and cultured they are not some lowbrow gorillas but bumbling semiintellectual losers hey they are like you and me the manner in which the series makes that claim is the only way i can explain its success there is nothing remarkable in the protagonists actions whats special about them is their economically unrealistic living conditions many viewers maybe envy them for that protagonists that narcissistic and vapid convey a sense of belonging and companionship seems to be a trademark of the time the first world is presently living inbr br recently i watched tittybangbang also a fairly new british tv comedy show i found it uproariously funny it is often quite tasteless or xenophobic  but always with a purpose and hitting the bulls eye in its social criticism the humour is mainly created by situations or by characters with a purpose the low ratings in imdb might indicate that this brand of humour is not in keeping with the times but i am glad its still alive and kicking and hope it will continue to do so
