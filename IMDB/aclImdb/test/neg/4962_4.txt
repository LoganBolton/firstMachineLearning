i am a german student so sorry for eventually mistakes im working on it  br br the stylistic very interesting converted and with effective sound effects accentuated platitudinous action of the drama deflect in no way from the horrible bad actors insincere and unnatural moves and expressions of feelings and makes so the relatively weird and senseless story less better just the typical slashergenre with in this case very odd action many byplays destroy partly the main story and let the viewers up to the end into the dark create weirdness and let surmise the senses of actions and the point mere hazily for sure its an hit for slasherfans but not for me but although the interesting style of cinematography and adeptly use of light is turned out wellbr br so not the best one
