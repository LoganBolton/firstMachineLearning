think of this film as fan service a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer we start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins the virginal mandy lane is coveted by every jock and nerd in her school and gets invited to spend a weekend at a ranch by three guys who think they can get lucky and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size so you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night who want to do nothing but have sex do drugs and drink booze the only other company is a hunky ranchhand who may or may not be suffering from gulf war syndrome hmm potential future suspect maybebr br so as youre probably ascertained by now all the houseguests end up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways and for a change the black man isnt the first to die there are some conventions that still hold up though like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field or the lights going out mysteriously in the evening as our heroes unwisely separate to tackle the problem even down to the socalled shocking twist at the end the movie is like an old 80s horror updated for the noughties and on this score it succeedsbr br unfortunately it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too namely the paperthin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise people get cut up shot bludgeoned etc but because of their innate hatefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations its hard to care as the bodies stack up someone gets murdered one of their friends goes out to look for them alone bang theyre brown bread rinse then repeat maybe one day well get a screenplay with plausible intelligent likable characters who make rational decisions but still end up being outwitted by a genius killer until then we have to tolerate teenagers with the iq of pondlife being picked off by a deranged hoodie oh well 410
