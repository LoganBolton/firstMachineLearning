how could this get a 60 rating are we as horror fans so used to horror films being so utterly bad these days that when one comes along that has some and i repeat only some redeeming qualitys we get much too excited and give a rating that is just a wee bit too high the director has a certain visual flair no doubt about that but in between some decent shots he forgot a good story mood or scares it had a very slow first act lazy killing scenes annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very unbelievable twist and whats with the portrayal of american teenagers in so many of these kinds of films do they always have to be this stupid irritating and so goddmn superficial i dont remember teens being like this when i grew up here in holland all things considered in cant give this film anything more that a 4 out of 10 rating
