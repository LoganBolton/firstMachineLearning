now thats its 2008 who really has a care in the world about a guy like db sweeney even back then he wasnt a big dealbr br two tickets to paradise is an outlined story thats well and true where three friends hit the road under each of their personal circumstances again a proved plot the problem with this film other than its so bad its compelling title is the scriptbr br cliché after cliché three guys do the same things youve seen in every other road movie and blow up vanna whites housebr br john c mcginleys acting job is superb especially compared to that of the late db sweeneys his career is dead hence the late though i hear hes moving to tv good for him also john c likely has the least awful character in the filmbr br the score is so generic it actually feels like youre watching a third rate film from 1993 or jeff andersons movie now you know also set me back a few years but at least that was more entertaining i mean yah i guess i enjoyed parts of it but the nerdy guy is annoying db tries to be this cool failed guitar player with some rough influences like some of the worst of classic rock who has some strange relationship with a stripper and john c is a gambler whos wife and kid leave him after the death of his father as well as a visit from one of his bookies henchmenbr br i keep thinking up ways to make this movie better but i think burning the script would have been a healthy startbr br but as ive hinted this whole time its not the worst movie ever and any chance i have to see mcginley in a starring role ill take it hopefully he starts getting some better projects
