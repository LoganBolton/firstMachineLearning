this movie was an all around uninspiring film it was a nonmoving story that definitely does not get you thinking anything other then where is all the strong moving material the other critics say about the film the 3 main actors are good and there is a few laughs but once again it becomes another movie that you keep watching in hopes of it getting better and it just doesnt i watched this movie last night and wished that we hadnt wasted our precious time while baby is sleeping watching this film br br i plan not to recommend this to my family and friends as well as obviously anyone looking to rent it i was pretty much nonimpressed with everything about this film
