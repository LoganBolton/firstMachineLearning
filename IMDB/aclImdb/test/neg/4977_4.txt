and now for another point of view i didnt like it i didnt finish it in fact i know that unforgiven is ranked by some as one of the greatest westerns ever made i know that it stars and was directed by clint eastwood one of the icons of american cinema i know that it won a bunch of oscars still i didnt like it i dont like westerns and thats clearly a matter of taste but i also dont admire eastwoods acting he is not and never has been a leading man he is no burt lancaster no paul newman no john wayne in this film alone he is dwarfed by richard harris and gene hackman they are both actors no eastwood is a tall guy with a reedy voice who usually plays tough guys here he plays a retired tough guy when i see him on screen i see a man laboring at his acting then theres the antiwestern western plot it is too obviously intended to inject contemporary values  a respect for the role of women blacks native americans and single parents a disrespect for violence and drinking the wholesomeness that comes with marriage including interracial marriage and small adorable children  into a century in which those values werent necessarily accepted at least in these ways by promoting those values the movie comes across as mannered if not preachy then there are the hoary movie stereotypes  prostitutes with hearts of gold the kid who cant shoot straight the city slicker new to the wild west the sage brush shimmering on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in major chords finally there is the pacing of eastwoods direction i gave up after an hour eastwood was still riding north chatting with morgan freeman and the kid who couldnt shoot straight sixty minutes after the plot driven by the slashing of a prostitute was set in motion it was way too slow somebody had to find these elements uncompelling i am afraid it was me
