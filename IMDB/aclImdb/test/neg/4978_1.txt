when i heard disney had the rights to underdogi figured at the very least it would be a cool pixar partnership affairand wed get a great adults  kids film like the incredibles alasi forgot how disney must dumb down classic material for todays dumbed down youth what were they thinking underdog was a product of the 60syour prime fanbase is in their 40s and 50swhy would you refocus it to 5 year olds it should have been done ala roger rabbithalf animated half real instead we get characters like riff raff  a wolf  dumbed into another dogunderdog cant have an energy pillas were now so enlightened it would obviously be a steroid or drugs referencethe only good casting was patrick warburton as cad because he actually sorta resembles the cartoon version otherwiseold school underdog fans should avoid this like the plague it is what next a live action version of the gogo gophers disguised as a revisionist history lesson  my advanced apologies if disney jumps on this
