the idea of nine stupid prisoners escaping and going on a road trip sounds pretty good for a movie especially because its meant to be funny and i guess heartwarming in some weird way the problem is the movie was very rarely funny and often just seemed pointless and needlessly gross it was as if jokes or interesting scenes were being set up again and again but no one bothered finishing any of themthere was just no payoff also the movie was just brainless and had the crooks meandering across japan even though they left so many crime victims alive that its impossible to believe they wouldnt have been caught almost immediatelyespecially since they continued to keep using the same stolen camper for days on end and as far as being gross goes i just didnt need to see scene after scene after scene of guys peeing along the side of the road plus believe it or not there is a scene where four of the guys are out raping sheepbr br all in all i really hated this movie and its a shame as i almost always love japanese filmsjust not poorly made and uninteresting ones like this one
