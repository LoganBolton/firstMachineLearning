good things out of the way firstbr br underdogs voice acting was fine but jason lee being awesome himself that really is no surprisebr br peter dinklage barsinister also did fine for what trash was given to him he acted the part shockingly well and so did patrick warburton the moronic assistant now it was idiotic character but he acted so extremely well i actually liked the character better than the protagonists the lines given to him were childish but wittybr br however alex neuberger did awful and hope he never acts again his scream was so disgustingly fake silence silence aaahhhhhhh in the scene where he hears the dog talk an oh no impossible would have sufficed in place of the pathetic fake screambr br and then there was the girl and her female dog that chased patricks character cad on the roof at first this makes sense shes a reporter a school reporter but still an inquiring mind regardless but why why the hell did she carry her dog around that was worthless and the damn dog didnt even say anything other than a heartless oh underdog her presence was extremely unnecessarybr br overall the script was pathetic the only reason i give this movie a 3 is barsinister his assistance and underdogs voice
