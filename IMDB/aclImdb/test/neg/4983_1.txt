god i never felt so insulted in my whole life than with this crap there are so many ways to describe this piece of crap that i think that if i said everything that came to mind i would get banned by this sitebr br how do i begin well for one it doesnt take knowledge of the original series to know that this movie is a slap to the face of people whove seen it the biggest butchering of a theme song ever made is here from a metal version to a freaking rap version what were they thinking how does underdog and a electronicheavy musical style match the story is so basic that i will do something i dont usually do and not even give a summary just think this a dog gets superpowers fill in the rest thats how predictable this movie is and then comes the jokesplease kill me now this style of humor that might not even get the kids laughing its that bad well expect that punch line after the sneezing that was slightly funnybr br but what surprises me the most is why jason leeny name is earl patrick warburtonemperors new groove and jim belushiaccording to jim are all here in the showsmovies i mentioned the actors in my opinion do a good job and excluding lee are the best actors in this movie but that says very little the rest deserve golden rasberry nominations for this crap i am very sad to see such good actors buried by this disasterbr br all in all this is just as bad as doogal which i reviewed as well and again my head would explode if i saw anything worse than this
