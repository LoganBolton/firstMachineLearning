i didnt like underdogi mean it was really unnecessary and needed a big face lift and then it would have been maybe passable but for the main part i didnt like itthis wasnt like any other kid movie its one of those movies that wanted parentswho grew up watching the cartoonto come with there kids to come see thisi am neither of them so the film didnt appeal to me in the slightesti had some problems with it like i dont think jason lee was the right voice for underdog it made it him sound sloppy and really unintelligentthen it was really predictable which makes you feel tired and madthe humor was really what made me mad it was just to unfunny and somewhat patheticthe one thing that bothered me the most thought was how almost everything out of underdogs mouth was sarcastic or rudethe acting was passable but needed a little improvementif you have kids they might enjoy it but if your not a kid by all means see it you might like it unlike me 34 stars out of 10
