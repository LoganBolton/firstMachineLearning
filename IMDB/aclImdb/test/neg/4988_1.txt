when underdog the cartoon debuted in 1964 at the age of 7 i was hooked immediately he was top dog pun intended in my bookthat is until batman premiered on abc a year or so later even when it was clear that disney was going to make a liveaction version of the once popular saturday morning cartoon it was equally clear to me that it was going to be a piece of crap even reading the reviews in the papers seemed to confirm this however i made it a point to a never attempt to write a review unless i have seen the movie from start to finish and b never to spend one red cent on a movie that im almost certain i will hatebr br thanks to youtube i a am fully qualified to write this review and b it only cost me 84 minutes of my hard earned timebr br it also proves my point namely that this movie is not merely a piece of crap its a steaming pile of dog droppings it resembles the tv series in name only even though they almost got it right with simon and cadbr br all in all underdog is a huge waste of time and money which thankfully i didnt have to spendbr br rating 12 out of
