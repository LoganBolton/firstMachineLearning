rise of the undead starts as some huge nuclear type blast rips through an unnamed american city a few people survive in a building by leaning on the door so itll stay closed  keep the nastiness out they argue amongst themselves for ages then a monster thing arrives from seemingly nowhere  begins to kill them of onebyonebr br written produced  directed by jason horton  shannon hubbell one has to say rise of the undead is terrible the script takes itself very seriously but makes little sense the first thing i asked myself was if theres this huge nuclear blast type thing going on outside destroying the entire city why are these people im watching still alive why is the building they are in still standing then i asked myself when was something actually going to happen the entire first 20 minutes is set in one room actually thats a bit generous its more of a corridor as the main characters argue then it turns into some return of the living dead 1985 ripoff with a government created virus which turns people into zombies before one of the most abrupt pointless  seemingly random plot twists ive ever witnessed which renders most of what has just happened a complete waste of time then for the final 30 odd minutes rise of the undead turns into some strange scifi type thing as something which resembles a ball of energy floats around killing everyone was i the only asking what this floating ball of energy thing is  where it came from getting back to what was happening outside what was the reason again oh thats right we are never told rise of the undead is a mess the characters are awful  arent even given names the twist about halfway through will have you tearing your hair out in frustration the dialogue sucks nothing is explained  theres virtually no story here the final 10 minutes maybe a bit more of rise of the undead features no dialogue whatsoever  the film just suddenly endsbr br directors horton  hubbell were obviously working on a low budget the entire film is set in about two rooms  three corridors the photography is awful they use annoying colour filters seemingly at random  sometimes it really does look like rise of the undead was shot on a camcorder theres no special effects theres some fake blood splashed around but no actual makeup effects to speak of there are some cgi shots of the city being engulfed in flames which look alright but the floating ball of energy creature thing looks terrible there is one baffling shot early on where two people are sitting against a corridor wall  talking for some bizarre reason their heads are cut off at the top of the screen just their lower bodies from the neck down are seen yet nothing else is happening in frame they are not moving  theres no else there but for some strange reason their heads are cut off the top of the frame as they talk to each other its quite an odd thing to watch actuallybr br with an ultra low budget of about 10000  according to the imdb shot in two weeks i have to congratulate the makers for getting rise of the undead finished  distributed but thats where my congratulations stop because otherwise this has awful production values  is set in about three corridors which are located somewhere in new orleans in louisiana as thats where rise of the undead was shot the acting sucks so i wont dwell on itbr br rise of the undead sucks it sounds like a zombie film but in all honestly it isnt everything about it is sub par  i know the filmmakers were working on a low budget but thats not really an excuse as far as im concerned definitely not recommended
