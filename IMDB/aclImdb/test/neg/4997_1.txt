hey im a fan of sobadsogood movies but theres nothing sobadsogood about rise of the undead its just sobad and thats it no redeeming cheese no unintentional humor nothing  boring apocalyptic zombie the undead  a few people with hardly any make up nonsense with lame special effects if you can call those effects dumb plot and annoying actors they also have the nerve to rip off and quote from other better movies resident evil dawn of the dead  night of the comet and managed to put me to sleep on the side however it was rise of my eyelids once the end credits rolled though my advice save your money its not even worth a rental unless you want to pss off andor put some people to sleep then go ahead and give it a spin youve been warned
