so youve seen the romero movies yes and youve seen jacobs ladder right and the later hellraiser movies okay now lets make a movie out of all three only lets just jam everything together and make a whole big mess of it sounds like a good ideabr br this movie is terrible absolutely godawful yeah its an indie flick who gives a crap is that a pass to make filmic excrement the film attempts to establish credibility by focusing on character interaction that much is evident unfortunately for the writers theyre not good at character interaction this isnt night of the living dead the characters are nonentities shouting their inane lines at each other in a vain attempt to be caught by the microphones on set the dialogue is never interesting for a movie that focuses so much on character interaction youd think the characters would have something more to say than what are we going to do i dont know well weve got to do something well what are we going to do i dont know we should leave lets just accept our fate no weve got to leave well lets leave then no maybe we should staybr br this isnt exaggeration there are exchanges in this film that reach that level of redundancy and inanitybr br the worst thing about this movie half of it is a dream and it really has zero purpose nothing in the dream has any relevance to anything in the rest of the movie the writers couldnt decide whether to make a zombie movie or a monster movie and so they just made both its patently ridiculous the cheapest trick in the book and its maddeningly insulting especially since im pretty sure they ripped off the idea from jacobs ladder which handled the concept a hell of a lot more competently than these jokers could ever hope to dobr br and then theres the editing years of watching mtv and playing horrorthemed video games must have inspired the filmmakers but its surely a sad thing they didnt realize what made the choppy editing and obfuscation in those pieces of media effective in the first place in this film you will be confused often and not in the good david lynch way but in the bad wait i thought she just got killed no then who the hell was that wait who is that guy where did he come from how did they get here kind of way its constant and consistently badbr br this movie is a laughable piece of trash and should only be sought out if you want to get trashed with a few friends and laugh at itbr br and as a final note as for the comedy people in other reviews are talking about its all unintentional there isnt a single intentional piece of comedy in this film its all supposed to be a big serious character study because the filmmakers want to have credibility in their horrorconcept sadly their pretensions dont match up to their ability
