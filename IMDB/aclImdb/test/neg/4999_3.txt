ok  i gave it a 3 just because they obviously had no money to make this film but i feel it might deserve the 23 rating it had when i got here im actually helping to raise its rating despite being bored for the last hour and a half i will save the 1s and the 2s for the higher budget pieces of crap at least the makers of rise of the undead didnt waste that much money they did manage to waste 90 minutes of my lifebr br the movie is too claustrophobic for me the entire movie takes place in the same building in dark rooms and hallways with a setting like this there should have been more action or character development but there is just a lot of meaningless talk i didnt get to know any of the characters there is a schoolgirl and a goth chick but we never find out much more about them none of the characters seem really likablebr br terrible movie made on zero budget no scary special effects no suspense really nothing interesting at all here folks i admit i downloaded this from the net it was free but i am throwing it awaybr br sorry to the filmmakers better luck next time this one is more like a soap opera than a zombie movie
