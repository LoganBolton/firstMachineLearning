frightmare begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is laid to rest this icon who has some christopher lee qualities to him then continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is inbr br the first ten minutes is wellfilmed good writing and lots of potential for murderous mayhem but the film drags in the middle although thankfully not as much as house of death and never really gets that initial spurt of energy backbr br lots of the deaths are confusing as they seem to have people just falling over scared when they see a floating coffin or other odd things twice we see poisonous gas being used but the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played boy is that false advertising unless he spent his career playing boring old men who take naps and watch matlockbr br the general principle of the film is decent horror society kids stealing a corpse of a dead icon a modern equivalent digging up vincent price or peter cushing would make a great film maybe a remake is in order if that wouldnt be too disrespectful sometimes theory doesnt come across as well in application and this film offers that examplebr br the only redeeming quality of this film besides the beginning is the brief appearance of a very young jeffrey combs i saw him and thought thats jeffrey combs but felt i was mistaken as the box never mentioned him but sure enough combs was present a note to this movies filmmakers mention combs on the cover of the dvd youll sell more copies if if you would be deceiving customers if youre a jeffrey combs diehard check out this early role otherwise i cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon let me suggest intruder or popcorn as those are both pretty decent and will stand the test of time
