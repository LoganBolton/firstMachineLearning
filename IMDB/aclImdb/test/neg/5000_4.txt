zombie movies are hot i love em cant get enough why i would purchase a film of this caliber goes without explanation i just really love zombies surprise this really isnt much of a zombie movie lowbudget i can handle being duped just irritates mebr br a group of horrorfilm clich√©s hold up in a warehouselabwhoknowswhat to escape a fire storm outside panic yelling lowlight and eventually zombies ensuebr br i kind of feel bad for the film makers as it is obvious that they really thought they were putting together something good a serious scary horror film it isnt far from it its a boring mess of wooden acting cheesy fx poor lighting excessive dialogue and over editingbr br things first go awry when it takes a good 10 minutes for the characters to ever sit down and start to figure out what is going on it gets worse when another 20 minutes go by and they are still sitting around trying to figure out what is going on all of this is littered with nonacting and bad dialoguebr br finally some one gets attached not by a zombie though and hope flickers just a touch before the characters are again lounging around whining the only emotion any one every generates about how much this sucks me too guys me toobr br finally zombies are in the mix but no one watching cares any more i think there was some blood and gore tossed in but i was too busy praying for the credits to roll to notice and when the screen finally did fade to black i felt even more cheated by the pointlessly cube inspired endingbr br i will give credit for trying very hard even if it failed miserably that and the punk chick was very hot if totally under usedbr br cant really recommend this to anyone save for film students looking for nono pointersbr br 410
