im not sure what the appeal of this movie is but i couldnt find it its a really long barely credible hardly lucid conversation between three guys on one set br br it doesnt move anywhere the characters are just totally bizarre the underlying plot equally so its lost on me definitely a walk out moviebr br the one thing that keeps you from walking out is the ever unrealized possibility that it might have some kind of point or meaningful climax and the fact that all irritation aside at the banal personalities theyre acted quite reasonably but you have to brace yourself for endless dialog wishing on many an occasion that teach would just shut the  up for a moment
