this movie was terrible it was so very terriblebr br most annoying was the way the trial was conducted the defense attorney is allowed to ramble on and on when questioning a witness without the prosecution making any objections he attacks the children brought to give testimony with cruel ferociousness and repeatedly yells at them that theyre lying these just arent things that they subject children who have been sexually abused to the trial is silly and it ruins the whole movielaw  order has spoiled me for courtroom accuracyness
