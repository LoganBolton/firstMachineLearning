ugh yes its exactly like the mcmartin mess or the horrific arrests in wenatchee washington in the movie the mother keeps aggressively questioning her little boy over and over and over until he finally tells her what she obviously wants to hear the court investigators and therapists repeat the pattern the questioning itself is sexually creepy a relentlessy repeated assault in its own waybr br the moviemakers throw in a doctor talking about physical evidence of abuse maybe to justify the films point of view that two to fouryearolds never make things like this up well they will if every adult they know is asking them to the way this piece endorses such discredited interrogation techniques makes watching it an exercise in frustration for anyone who knows what it takes to get a successful prosecution in real life br br they also add a special arrest incident towards the end to prove their case  no parallel to this fictional incident ever occurred in real life cant say more here without turning this into a spoiler but youll know it when you see itbr br yes children are abused sometimes by paid care providers but to watch a movie which affirms the ludicrous hysterical accusations against so many totally innocent people to watch recreations of the trials that ruined the lives of countless children as well as the lives of the accused  i didnt think id last until the end its just too sad and made more so by the writing teams seeming endorsement of the abusive paranoid obsessional questioning techniques that started  what can we call it the bonfire of the sanities br br no one i know has ever been accused of child abuse thank heaven but my 12timesovergreat grandmother was accused of witchcraft and killed for it mobs filled with what they think is holy anger are just as dangerous now as three hundred years ago sensational drivel like this  these accusations of satanic abuse are cropping up all over the country there must be something there so tell the jury that  just eggs them on br br and whoever thought it was a good idea to have kids under ten some of them under five play these roles its traumatic to watch them delivering their lines how much more traumatic was it to act these parts the moviemakers commitment to fight child abuse apparently doesnt apply to themselves and what were the childactors parents thinking melinda uncredited at least in the version on the ae network in 2005 but i think it was cassy friel and teddy brian bonsall were terrific professionals or not though they were too young to be exposed to this material much less to be paid to act it out despite ruthlessly exploiting these reallife children do you know the muffin man got an emmy nomination for directing  which just goes to show how crazed things were back in 1989
