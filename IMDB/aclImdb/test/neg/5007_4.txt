what is wrong with curacao  also known as deadly currents though what the reasonn for the name change is i have no idea  can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover br br  keep it down baby  im trying to sleep  br br its not the dialogue thats the problem or the way its delivered  its the fact the actress has has a central european accent  nothing wrong with that until its revealed her character is from philidelphia in the united states  this what struck me about this thriller while watching it  the way accents dont match their characters  apart from the philly woman with a german accent we see a south african with an english accent  a local police chief who sounds like hes an irishman impersonating a gestapo officer and worst of all george c scott playing someone whos either dutch or british with an accent that sounds like it might be american tinged with south african  you soon give up following whats on screen and end up concentrating on what nationality a character might be due to the strange way they speak  its interesting to note that this site hasnt given this movie a country of origin  with so many different actors from different countries you do feel that this was produced by the united nations br br even if youre not curious about accents or dialects youll probably have to give up following the action anyway because curacao is plot less  things happen like a boat exploding  and a hostage situation and the hero being recruited as an agent for south african intelligence but youre left scratching your head wondering what the heck this is all leading to  i was lost
