i watched this last nite with an open mind sorry to say it is still bad first the movie is too noisey and you cant hear what people are saying the accents are bad especially richard masur what is the french chick doing in this film  miscasting at its worst walkens makeup is strange the harvard scene is useless and not needed kristofersons character is unlikeable and i wanted him to get killed and go away meanwhile the walken character gets killed too early and easily  despite the makeup the settlers are all stupid get organized you bunch of hicks people are coming to kill you  john hurts character provides some humor buts thats allbr br i have nothing good to say about this excessive piece of crap the only good thing is it ruined the directors career and killed united artistsbr br still crap after all these years
