i attempted to watch this and was highly disappointed dont expect intelligent and insightful humor ala amys brother david amidst this dreck it is the polar opposite but if youre into poop fart and boner jokes youll be in seventh heaven this is bathroom humor aimed i assume at those whove had several bongs which can only explain why many ecstatic reviewers have heralded this crap as the best television writing ever i assume that those who hate such simpleton humor were unable to watch long enough to care to submit a review but i am just sending out a warning shot to those unaware viewers who are looking for highend comedy the characters overact the shock factor is set to 10 and the laughs are set to zero unless of course you seek juvenile lowbrow humor br br i made it through 40 minutes praying the whole time it would turn the corner toward worthwhile entertainment but alas it just got worse and worse and beware of amys everpresent and hammy overbite expression  it will set your eyes rolling it was nice to see cameos by recognizable comedic actors i enjoy but i can only assume they agreed to participate as a favor to the sedaris familybr br to those who loved it im sorry this is my opinion it was so bad it inspired me to write my first review
