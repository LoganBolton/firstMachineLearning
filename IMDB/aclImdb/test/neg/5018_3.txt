not a bad concepti just wish they had taken it in another direction its a movie that tries to be interesting by shocking you with bestiality to begin with which works for most peopleprudes with weak stomachsbut besides this theres not much to this movie its not funny nor is it romantic so please somebody change that label  and since i already knew that bestiality is actually legal most places and a million dollar industry i wasnt really shocked but most people do not know this and i thought that how the movie evolved after the secret came out was just disappointing because it could have been one of those shocking eye opener movies that would teach the ignorant about a fetish that is very much a reality foryes i did my homeworkhundreds of thousands of peopleso if you like watching bad movies that you can daydream about how you could make them better while watching them than surehave fun doing that
