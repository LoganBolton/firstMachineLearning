this film is totally unbelievable the only way a girl would perform this act on a dog is if she had serious mental health issues or had a long history of sexual abuse or was under duress yet we are asked to believe that an otherwise normal healthy female just got a bit bored and made a little mistake and oops had a sexual encounter with a dog whats more it never had any detrimental affect on her ever again except when she tells someonebr br not she was raped by a dog or the dog did something she couldnt resist  she actively initiated oral sex and completed this activity with a pet dog of her own choice she wasnt on drugs or anything she just felt like itbr br the rest of the film seeks to put this action in a light of hey it could happen to anyone shes only being honestbr br but really for this to be believed we have to believe that this is a woman who is capable of doing absolutely anything if she just feels like it think about it  could she have considered the rights and wrongs of this action before carrying it out if she had she would have stopped in her tracks human beings have instinctive boundaries for reasons if we are now to start considering bestiality as a cute little aberration what is next child abuse yet the heroine is portrayed as a hard done by nice girl who had one moment of aberration if she had been forced to carry out this act by an abuser  the story might have made more sense and i would have been able to accept the storyline but there is no way that anyone carries out the prolonged activity required and referred to even once  if there is not some deep disturbance that requires a great deal of psychiatric help this is no way a one off happening in an otherwise perfect lifebr br i know this is just a film but it is through normalising behaviour such as this via the media that society becomes desensitised and more and more awful realities become possiblebr br i could imagine an abuser showing this to a child to persuade them that it isnt such a big deal and then moving on with their agenda it could also be used by an abuser to underline to a child not to tell about the abuse  because look how people will react to you if you dobr br this is not about truth the director wants people to think its about truth this is about degradation and how easily people the viewing publiccan be manipulated into accepting the most appalling concepts if wrapped up in the right way the watching public are being manipulated degraded and laughed atbr br this is a film in which the actors and the viewers are being humiliated and made fools of in a very sophisticated way by a clever but extremely disturbed film writerbr br this film appears to me to be being used as a vehicle for the creator of the film to get off on the excitement of playing with your mind in an abusive manner i dont know whether it is conscious on their part  but it is the most classic example of mind fk that i have ever encounteredbr br i hope that this doesnt offend anyone too much but if you watched this film  i dont think there is any room left to be offended by anything any more
