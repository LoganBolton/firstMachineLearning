may or may not contain spoilers br br inuyasha is not a good anime its actually very overrated why theres absolutely no story line no plot and the show just drags on and on and on thats because there are more side stories and fillers than episodes that make the plot progress and the fillers are just the same stories being repeated over and over again the same episodes seem to go with the same plot kagome sensing a jewel shard a wormslimetentacle demon thing pops up inuyasha says windscar iron reaver soul stealer etc and kills the demon they get the jewel shard and then we just repeat this scene 160 or more timesbr br besides the repeating of episodes theres the repeating of comedic devices and theyre not funny anymore wait they never were sexual harassment is not funny viz rated the series older teens 16 i have no idea why they rated it that theres nothing bad about it except for the socalled funny sexual harassment which is kind of suggestive and that could get you arrested these daysbr br now this is how we know inuyasha is overrated the videogames they all sucked especially the mask game i played that at my friends house it wasnt anything interesting the game was slow boring and it had nintendo 64 like graphics in a magazine it got a rating of 410 saying this roleplaying game is slower than milkshake moving up a cocktail straw then theres all these stupid inuyasha toys action figures trading cards stickers and coloring books coloring books we thought inuyasha was 16 maybe not but after being a member of inuyasha groups on msn about half the people on there were 10 to 13 i guess inuyasha is a little kid anime after all i think that just a small bit of editing done to this show it could be shown on toonami there are over 40 manga volumes i can only help but wonder how many miles of forest that have been cut down to make them sadbr br then theres the music the music is so annoying we hear the same 5 songs every episode after 10 episodes the music gets really annoying in other anime they have music to fit the mood and we dont hear some songs very often there are about 15 different inuyasha soundtracks dont waste your money on that garbagebr br and how do you think i know all this because i used to be a fan of inuyasha i feel ashamed of myself id rather watch kim possible or pokemon instead sadly those two shows have more romance between the two main protagonists than inuyasha will ever have
