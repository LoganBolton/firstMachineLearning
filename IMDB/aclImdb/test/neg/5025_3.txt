rossini once described rival composer wagners work as having some wonderful momentsand some awful quarterhours inuyasha it seems can also be described this way it has many great episodes but in between them are countless filler episodes the entire series consists of about 175 episodes of which id say at least 125 are filler or some sort of subplot i didnt bother to count and i wouldnt be surprised if that number were in fact higher thoughbr br some of these filler episodes are actually quite enjoyable though many are quite silly or dull nonetheless the constant digressions start to wear thin after the first few seasons as the plot ends up progressing at a labored crawl for most of the series character development too slows down greatly and by the later seasons the cast has become quite unchanging resulting in increasingly stale jokes particularly those concerning the monk whos ironic traits start out as mildly humorous but grow tiresome when the jokes associated with them appear repeatedlybr br however all of that isnt to say that inuyasha is a bad series it just isnt a great series the way neon genesis evangelion for example is generally considered to be as something to watch at the end of a hard day it is nice but it could never be confused with high art
