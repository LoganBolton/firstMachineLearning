oh man this series has to be the worst possible anime ive ever seen in a whilebr br it started out new exciting and fresh and i really liked it then kagome was a good female role model for the show and inuyasha was funny and hotheadedbr br then it just kept falling more and more downhill as the series progressed and ill tell yall the reasons why warning spoiler alertbr br okay they basically destroy inuyashas relationship with kagome early on by reviving his 50 year old dead girlfriend whos drippy sappy and a total waste of timebr br they introduce a pervert named miroku whos supposed to be a sort of religious figure for the show which really bugged mecause it was out of place and stupid then they introduce a demon slayer named sango whose only purpose in life is to try and fail to save her brainwashed brotherbr br the big bad of the show naraku while starting out as a really good bad guy lost his touch after a while he got pretty old pretty fast and it bothered me that he was the only baddie in the show who did anythingbr br the characters all became wooden and unemotional and then the ending of this terrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there nothing happened naraku never got killed or defeated kagome and inuyasha never fully fell in love cause he was still all in love with his 50 year old dead chick plot holes were left open the animation got worse and worse as the series progressed and nothing changed in the plot i meanthey dragged it out to over 150 episodes and nothing changed in the plot at all and they expected me as well as other fans of the show to be satisfied i was disenchanted disgusted and annoyed as crap i at least had high hopes that thered be a good ending to the series instead all i got was a dragged out commercial for the mangabr br seriously if you wanna see a good anime about swords and stuff like that i strongly recommend rurouni kenshin that show progresses and goes somewhere plus it has really good animation toobr br but stay far away from this bland excuse for anime as best as you can
