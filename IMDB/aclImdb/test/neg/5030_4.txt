as you might not know e√ßa de queiroz is one of portugals most rightfully celebrated writers he was witty he spared no one in his critics and must now be rolling in his tomb and thats not due to this movie being bad which it is but as a result of the treatment dispensed to one of his masterworks o crime do padre amaro its treated like cheap throwaway trashbr br when it was publicized that this was to be a modern and urban take on the book i feared for the worst normally modern in these contexts means taking the liberty to take the p when doing an adaptation to half arse it in the shoddiest possible way and so the moral and social dilemma of a priest having a secretforbidden affair are substituted by extralong passages of people dealing drugs and singing hiphop for no particular or pertinent reason to the plot its just there like it might very well not have beenbr br oh and theres lots of sex so you can at least be counting on that when you put this on remember how every movie in the 80s no matter the genre or the tone always found a way to sneak in some nudity if it was a thriller and they had no need for it they simply found a way that when they were capturing a felon he happened to be in bed with a woman that would prance around screaming naked of course when the cops barged in ahem gratuitous is the word i think not that theres anything wrong with nude scenes but here they make the creators of this movie look desperate simply because theres nothing else to the movie its totally devoid of what do you call it dramatic content
