i was not making big assumptions on the fact that this for sure was a very very free adaptation from the work of eça de queiroz and i must say that this free adaptation form the book as a lot of possible good ideas and characters the problem is the way that is done without any care without any taste just a rumble of bad taste clichés everywhere the script is so fake and the characters so unreal thats makes petty seeing nice actors as unas bryner morgado lagarto and others lost themselves in a net of whatever except cinema or storytelling for my surprise the newcomers jorge corrula and soraia chaves bravely stick in their performances but you can see them lost like a drifted boat without any direction and talking about direction this seems to be something totally missing on this moviewheres the director everything is bad taste the frames are whatever and whenever the use of hand camera without any justified reason the light design that should build environments doesnt exist and no excuses that the all point is a dark real story the problem overall in this trying to be film is that as no taste or very very bad taste its sad to see jorge and soraia melting away in such fake and gratuity sex scenes painted here and there trough out the movie like closing narratives holes or used as fakes transition motives maybe carlos coelho da silva should see the 2002 carlos carrera adaptation of the same book of eça and get the felling of how to build a true movie
