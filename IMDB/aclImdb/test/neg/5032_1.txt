i saw this film yesterday on tv i had just finished reading the book in which the movie was supposedly based in the opening credits it said this is a free adaptation of eça de queirós novel i should have turned off my tv at that momentbr br vera sacramentos idea of free adaptation is turning a story about churchs influence over people and the hypocrisy of people claiming morality at the end of the 19th century into a story about sex in fact the only thing she adopted from the novel was the sex part which was only mildly referred in eça de queirós novel and of course the name of some charactersbr br as of the characters in the novel amélia and joão eduardo were victims of churchs influence amélia was seduced by father amaro and all the time she was controlled by him joão eduardo her fiancé was excommungated by the priests because he dared to criticize them in this movie amélia seduces every one she meets and father amaro is just another victim joão eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weaponsbr br vera sacramento has turned a novel which criticized moral costumes of an epoch and turned it into just another movie with lots of bad sex even worse her story was completely empty of ideas two wasted hours eça de queirós surely did not deserve this
