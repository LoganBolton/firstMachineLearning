i turned this off within the first five minutes its very sick and disturbing the moment i turned this off was when the beautiful white horse was let into the slaughterhouse and its skull was punctured by a small tubed instrument this creature was lying on the floor in a state of shock before it died the narrator said the animal dies instantaneously it didnt i dont agree with graphic realism towards animals insects or any living creature i was very disappointed as i had just watched eyes without a face which was a brilliant movie and this short film was attached which spoilt my night  as i couldnt hurt a fly never mind watching this savage documentarybr br reading other reviews on this page i had noticed they used words such as aesthetic  this is not art or beauty i can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound but not aesthetic
