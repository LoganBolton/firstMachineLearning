this appalling piece of tripe was conveniently loosely based on a true story that involved two family members of mine played by jack thompson and jacqueline mackenziebr br this film is offensive besides the fact that it wasnt a particular good film anyway it does not in any way capture what it was like to lose such a close family member and completely omits those who were really affected by the truelife tragedybr br as for the director he managed to cash in on a familys misfortune for the price of a porschebr br if i could have given this a zero i would havebr br avoid this film at all costs
