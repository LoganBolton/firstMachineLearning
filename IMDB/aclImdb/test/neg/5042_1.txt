the acting was flat at least none of the actors sounded like theyd just got the script that morning and the film and sound quality made me think of the 70s movie of the week bombs the only thing that told me that it was indeed not a 70s movie of the week was the reference to dna testing but for me being eastern orthodox the most egregious thing about thisfilmwas the total romishness of the religion romania is 88 orthodox but youd never know that from this movie father soren is irish and id have known this even if i hadnt seen the actor play the irish pub keep michael sullivan in star trek voyagers fairhaven episodes the bishop was wearing roman vestments and for the record not even orthodox bishops wear their vestments unless theyre saying the liturgy especially if they live in a monastery about the only nonromish paraphernalia i saw was the 3bar cross on the door of the church and even then i had to squint to see it the first reviewer said the producers had done their research well if thats true they messed up on the religious aspect of the film
