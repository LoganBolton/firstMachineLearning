you know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has a mouth full of listerine or whatever it is and hes trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink thats a great metaphor for this movie i kept watching even though it was really difficult but keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth i should have spit it out when i had the chancebr br the premise is corny enough to be fun for the first time in like a thousand years gargoyles have returned to romania and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead its up to michael pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the gargoyles run amok unfortunately the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads the best acting is done by the cg gargoylesbr br in the end this movie feels like a poor mans van helsing if you check your brain at the door this might get you through a dreary monday night i gave it 3 out of 10 stars
