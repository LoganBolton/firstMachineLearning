this is just one of the hundred million movies where the directors try to shove too much drama into a movie thats not dramatic at all like in the beginning the part where the monk dude shoved the arrow into his own hand then shot that same arrow into the gargoyle five minutes laterno sense whatsoeverbr br the only thing worse than the plot line is the cgi which would be greatly rivaled by a homemade flash movie the actors look like theyre doing their hardest to portray a bunch of 70s robots the dialogue makes so little sense its not funnybr br many things just happen with no explanation as to how or why such as a lady suddenly wandering around a zoo that had shut down hours ago and when she sees this thing flying towards her her first reaction is to take a picture rather than what she does a full ten minutes laterpowerwalking not even running like her life depended on itwhich obviously it doesntbr br overall not recommended makes me wish they still did new episodes of mst3k
