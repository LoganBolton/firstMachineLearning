i dont think im spoiling anyones experience of this film by telling you not to see it if you have anything better to do like clean under the stove it gets dirty under there and youve gotta clean it sometime br br i think the movie suffers from a lack of sex and violence though there is one car chase stunt that looks so dangerous it could only have been filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer gargoyles heart is in the right place but its aspirations are conservative it is at least not pretentious but i had a great time acting in it playing the perennial idiot in the horror movie who says whats down this hole and dies for his hubris plus i got to meet michael pare every film junkie should work with a bmovie staple at least once before death and romanians are the loveliest people ive met literally the loveliest walk down the street in bucarest if 7 of every 10 women arent absolutely beautiful youre walking down a street i didnt come across and be consoled by the fact that at least 5 of the 10 are available for drinksbr br part of the film was shot in casa radio an abandoned unfinished classic communist bloccumgeorgian nightmare edifice originally intended to house kgb propaganda ministries ie radio notsofree europe the buildings five stories tall and takes up a city block best of all while its facade radiates big brotheresque state solidity it resides near the city center like a postapocalyptic ruin in a jungle of burdock and hemp peopled by dozens of gypsies and scores of wild dogs construction on casa radio was suspended when caucescu and his wife were executed on tv in 1989 and still there are gaping holes that drop from the sunbaked top floor offering surreal vistas of a modern quartermile stretch of concrete roof decorated with jutting rebar and old car parts overlooking a crumbling ancient city all the way down to the damp creepy subbasement which doubles in the film for the gargoyle lair no americanstyle guardrails or warning signs for bucarest br br since the demise of the soviet union casa radio has hosted several nonunion film shoots including highlander iii it is attractive to producers because its a cheap location massive in terms of scale and available space bizarre looking and free of insurance headaches as its still state property plus no one complains if you dont clean up after your production anything left onsite is interpolated into the resident gypsies construction of their shanty town in this actual urban jungle br br an assistant director was bitten bloody by a wild dog during the shoot of gargoyle the apples provided by catering were pressed into service by cast and crew as projectiles in order to keep the prowling dogs at bay i too was bitten by wild dogs in bucarest once in a bar  and once in a city park i also survived two car wrecks in two weeks both in taxis and neither of which was seen by the drivers involved as grounds for stopping the carsbr br geek note the scifi network or channel or whatever was one of the backers of this film the smaller the budget the more producers on set so its a little weird that nobody had a problem with the original title gargoyles until it was almost time to show it on the network even though scifi already had an unrelated series of that name the title was changed sometime relatively close to release as i have a colorcorrected copy labeled with the former title
