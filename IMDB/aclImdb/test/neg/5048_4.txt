going into teaching mrs tingle all i wanted was a fun enjoyable teen comedy that would entertain me for its running time despite a rather good first half hour the film quickly subsides into a dull clich√©d mess thats about as entertaining as pulling out your eyelashes with pliers rusty pliers at that scream writer kevin williamson wrote and directed this movie and proved that scream may well have been a fluke most of the elements of this movie have been seen a million times already in other films and while it was ok for him to steal elements from other movies in scream due to the fact that its meant as a slasher tribute here it just looks like hes completely ran out of ideas the plot follows the cleverest girl in school played by katie holmes after being caught cheating along with two of her friends the three decide to take the teacher that caught them hostage in her own home however this isnt just any teacher its mrs tingle the meanest bitch in school she isnt taking being tied to the bed lying down either as she begins to play mind games to turn her captors against each otherbr br the plot is very similar to the 1997 flick suicide kings and a whole host of earlier films its actually not a bad idea for a movie and if williamson could have populated the film with interesting characters it could have worked really well the character of mrs tingle is the most interesting in the movie but shes massively one dimensional and like all the other characters in the film is merely a caricature the acting is largely diabolical with the exception of helen mirren in the title role shes suitably evil in the role and while she doesnt have a lot to get her teeth into she clearly enjoys herself playing the central figure the teenage cast isnt worth mentioning with only katie holmes standing out and thats only really because of her star profile not her acting talents williamson has draped nearly every scene in dull soft rock music which would be really annoying if the film wasnt absolutely terrible anyway honestly this movie does have a few moments that are rather good but basically if you want to see a good example of the teen comedy  this isnt the movie that you want to see
