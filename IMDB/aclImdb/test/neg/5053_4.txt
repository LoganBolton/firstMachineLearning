i made it about halfway through this movie and at that point realized that i absolutely didnt care how it ended it is basically a bland teen comedy that i only watched because i like helen mirren who is in fact very good as an impossibly cruel teacherbr br the basic idea of the movie or lets say the first half of the movie since i dont know  or care  how the second half goes has been done before most notably in 9 to 5 and a comparison between the two shows how thoroughly tingle gets it wrong you need to feel things are spiraling out of control in a way that makes you feel events are inevitable and you need welldefined interesting characters who you care about and you dont have that not the worst movie ive ever seen but it never grabbed me for a second
