i heard this movie was badthey even warned me it was terrible but for some reason probably katie holmes i still watched it when it came on national tv watching kevin williamson films means torturing his scenarios arent funny definitely not scary and not the least bit creative teaching mrs tingle breathes the same irritating atmosphere as his brainless series dawsons creek and its probably meant for the same target group as well before the credits even started 5 people already wanted a hug and they stated that eerie i love yousentence it doesnt get any better as the soundtrack is filled with annoying poprock and the storyline is ultrathin three students on the verge of graduation get caught cheating by the wickedest teacher in school every highschool has a teacher like that you know to save their skin they try to convince mrs tingle that it wasnt their intention to cheat but this attempt goes horrible wrong the typical highschool humor is completely lost on me the overdose of sentiment is pathetic and the acting with the exception of helen mirren is abominable im sure katie holmes can act  thats a fact proven by her role in the gift  but she urgently needs to stop accepting frumpish girl roles as said before the only positive comments goes out to the brilliant casting of helen mirren as the shrew its like kathleen turner in serial mom the role suits her perfectly and you cant imagine anyone else playing her other than that this is avoidable teenage nonsense
