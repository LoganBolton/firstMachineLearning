sorry for any spoilers that this contains but if you want to read on anyway i really wonder why so many people are so high on kevin williamson lets just take a quick look at his work as a screenwriter shall we theres scream 1 and 2 plus the story for the next one which i think are pretty funny but very overrated besides by making scream into a franchise it ceased to become a parody of horror movies and simply became another one then theres i know what you did last summer which is essentially the same movie again he cowrote halloween h20 but even he had the sense not to take credit for what he did on that monstrosity then comes the faculty which i can only say was godawful lots of fun to make fun of though dont even get me started on the ridiculous soapoperatic dawsons creek i could rail about how bad that is for hours so then we get to teaching mrs tingle first of all there are tons of little implausibilities in this one for example in most high schools that i know of the valedictorian is not the only one who gets to go to college this idea that katie holmess character would never go anywhere unless she was valedictorian was absurd havent you ever heard of financial assistance damn it also i dont think you get expelled from high school or dont get into college because of cheating on one test there are a bunch of other ones but ill skip to the big one now the ending really bothered me they committed a crime but it was ok because the teacher was a bitch great do you know how many of my teachers i could kidnap based on that logic im sure the police never took any statements to find out the whole story either that sure wouldnt be necessary helen mirren was good she added some nice flair to a character who as a previous commenter noted had no reason for anything she did and has anyone else noticed that katie holmes absolutely cant act her selfrighteousness became incredibly annoying you wanted me to fail blah blah blah her last two scenes with mrs tingle were the worst the only reason i dont regret losing 825 on this disaster is because she got beaten up a bit no wait i do regret losing the money it wasnt real and she survived mr williamson if youre reading this youve made the same movie some violence andor scary stuff offset by wiseass kids who make sarcastic jokes and references to other movies just a few too many times now i count 6 so for not including scream 3 and whatever follows it and i would really appreciate it if you would stop otherwise i might just have to kidnap you and threaten you with a crossbow ok
