mr motos gamble has a fairly straight forward plot  when a boxer is murdered in the ring with a mysterious poison its up to the even more mysterious mr moto to solve the casebr br im shocked at the number of positive reviews for mr motos gamble on imdb because to mewell i found it extremely disappointing i enjoy mr moto and i enjoy charlie chan but i cant say i cared for this mishmash of the two for those unfamiliar with the story behind mr motos gamble it was originally intended to be a charlie chan film but when warner oland backedout some of the scenes and action were rewritten for peter lorre and mr moto as i indicated the end result left me underwhelmed mr moto is not chan hes more mysterious hes more athletic and hes more exotic so trying to put moto in a chan film is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole  it doesnt work and listening to lorremoto try to deliver one of chans trademark euphemisms just ends up sounding silly add to that the fact that almost 10 minutes of the already brief 72 minute runtime is made up of boxing scenes something that i never seem to enjoy and you end up with a movie that i couldnt help but dislike if i have to say something positive i would point to the performance of keye luke but even hes not near enough to save mr motos gamble in my eyesbr br sorry but a 410 is about the best i can give this one
