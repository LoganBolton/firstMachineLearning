now infamous western that was at its time the biggest budgeted disaster in hollywood history i was lucky enough to see the full 220 minute version at a theatre in 1990 it was truly staggering how bad the film wasbr br they had a great cast a story based on a true incident a fight between foreigners and americans in the 1800s magnificent sceneryso what went wrong three wordsdirector michael cimino he was so full of himself after the deer hunter he went out and made this god awful western hes not totally to blame his previous film the deer hunter was considered a masterpiece and united artists gave him free reign to do anything they let him all aloneand everything went wrong the cost went barreling out of control and cimino insisted on redoing sequences again and again until they were perfectbr br first off the sound is horrible entire sequences go by and you cant make out a word the characters are saying for instance jeff bridges character is introduced during a dance sequence but i still have no idea who he was the dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible thats the directors faulthe should have made sure the dialogue could be heard some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around you can barely make out whats going on the story line doesnt make a whole lot of sense and cimino took great liberties with the factsin the real story only one person was killedcimino turns it into a massacre there is some admittedly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue also the bad sound was not the fault of the theatreall the prints sound that waybr br this garbage effectively closed down united artists and was the end of ciminos career a textbook example of a director so full of himself he doesnt realize what hes doing jeff bridges has said this is the worst movie he ever did this is from a guy who made tron a definite mustmissbr br there is a pretty good book called the final cut which details the whole disaster this gets a 1 i wish imdb had negative numbersthis deserves it
