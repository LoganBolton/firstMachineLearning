controversial german journalist jutta rabe who herself got divers to the estonia wreck put this silly thriller together to save her investmentbr br donald sutherland is of course always watchable  but hes only in three scenes he delivers his material perfectly  as you can ask from a professional also the main lead j√ºrgen prochnov is at times very goodbr br the rest of the cast is however bad the actress that plays the swedish minister secretary or whatever she was  she seems not listed in the cast is extremely badbr br the script has some nice ideas and the story is actually kind of interesting the final screenplay should have been rewritten a couple of more times though some scenes are plain ridiculous  especially the end scenesbr br the film is almost 2 hours which is about 45 minutes too long presented as a 60 minutes tvfilm this could have been really interesting as a two hour feature its pretentious boring stupid and plain out sillybr br jutta rabe might be a good journalist her ideas about governments using estonia to transport military items from estonia to sweden have been concluded as true recently when the swedish military officially said that they actually used the ship estonia for this but as a film producer she sucksbr br the director the writer and the actors suck morebr br i give this film 310 i wouldve given it a 1 if it wasnt for the fact that the story is quite interesting at times donald sutherland is in it and it has real stock footagebr br but we dont even see the boat sink what kind of movie about a ship that sinks is that like a werewolf movie without werewolves
