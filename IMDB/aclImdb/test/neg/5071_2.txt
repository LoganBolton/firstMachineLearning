id love to write a little summary of this movies plot butthere simply isnt one if you just take a look at the plot keywords for this title you pretty much know the entire content of the film sex breasts exploitation female frontal nudity and womens prison 80 minutes of pure sleaze and nothing more escape of the island women an alternate title that isnt even listed here clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial womaninprison classic but it totally lacks the brutality of one wipflicks are meant to blend graphic sexual images with shocking violence but the violence here has just been replaced with more sex director erwin dietrich surely cant compete with specialists in the field like jess franco or joe damato and he should have sticked to making ordinary softcore flicks the only aspects that slightly look like cultcinema are the resemblance of the tyrantpresident with fidel castro and the grouprape of a minor girl by soldiers the girls are ravishing though and the ibiza filming location looks very enchanting
