i went to see this because of snipes  statham but honestly chaos is terrible this movie has absolutely nothing going for it  it should not have been madebr br dont read this review if you dont want to read spoilers cause im going to address a lot of plotholes herebr br first of all  the opening scene its the great big event that made the two semilead characters statham and snipes turn crooked but its boring and mundane only at the very end we get to see what really happened and by the time you wont care anymore also  this whole event where one bad guy and his hostage get killed is hardly big enough news to fill hundreds of newspaper articles as referred to in the moviebr br then the bank job  it doesnt get off the ground for any second the bank robber makes some unneeded references to chaos theory which has nothing to do with the whole story by the way the way statham gets summoned is very die hard with a vengeance but more boring then the things that happen in the bank are strange and pointless whats with the safety deposit box there seems to be some plot unfolding there but then it doesnt why go through the trouble of stringing up two people when it leads to nothing it involves a lot of preparation and its used for nothing at all why doesnt the swat leader listen to the officer in charge when he tells them to stand downbr br and this is only the first 10 minutes it keeps getting worse and worse br br the whole romantic  love interest story with the he wasnt just a better cop he was a better man remark to finish it of is painful to watch its just pointless why would stathams character point out the change in camera position in the footage reviewed from the bank this essentially leads to finding the virus that will get him all the money why go through the trouble of forging some guys signature and killing him but then not kill the guy that can identify youbr br i could go on for ages really but its like this movie is pointless the whole script is a mess the smart references to chaos theory are really laughable and quite pathetic the plot twists can be seen from miles away and the lead characters seem to be making mistakes all the time it is really painful to watch a movie like this where the audience is taken for granted as dumb popcorn crunching people of which the director hopes they wont see all the plot holes and the overall ridiculous script the explanation scene at the end only adds to insult it is really really not a good movie in any waybr br people who come to see an action film dont get what they come for people who come to see a copbuddy movie dont get it people who come to see a smart thriller dont get that in essence everyone gets the same  a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money do yourself a favor and skip this one
