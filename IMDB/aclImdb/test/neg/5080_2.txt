seeing the names of the starring actors statham snipes and phillippe i thought that the movie should at least be decently funny or interesting instead all i got from it was not just boring 92 minutes but the frustration of knowing everything that was about to happen and hearing tons of lame and shabby bad cop phrasesbr br the main problem is that the movie doesnt have a good story to begin with and when you have that than no one can help you not statham not wesley snipesnot even john mcclane could save this movie  it could be cool for the kids if they arent over 12 years of age because they dont care so much about the story and there are some big explosions in the movie
