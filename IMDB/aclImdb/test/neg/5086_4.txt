warning  this review may contain spoilers  br br the idea behind the character of danny jet li is a good one  young boy is taken by hoodlum and raised to behave like a vicious pitbull controlled mainly by whether his collar is on or off his neckbr br however the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the constraints of believabilitybr br he has danny meeting a blind pianist sam morgan freeman who has to be the most trusting fool a man ever was  along with his nitwit endlessly babbling rather unattractive stepdaughter victoria kerry condon i was stunned by the way when i learned victoria was supposed to be 18  she looked 25 or 30 to mebr br amazingly there is no romance between danny and victoriabr br when danny turns up again wounded what does sam do but take him straight home danny is out for 2 days but do these nitwits take him to a hospital nooooo i dont know if they even called in a doctorbr br now danny is obviously not a mentally stable person this is apparent from the getgo yet sam takes him into his home where both he and his stepdaughter could have been seriously harmed or even killed by this rather strange young manbr br why morgan freeman took this insipid role in this asinine film i cant even begin to guess surely mr freeman is not that desperate for a paycheckbr br then we have bob hoskins as bart the gangster who owns danny  now you talk about a son of a gun thats hard to kill the car bart is in gets riddled with bullets that would have rivaled bonnie and clydes demise we think hes dead but nobr br then we have another car accident  and yet again ol bart escapes unscathedbr br in addition to that we also have danny fighting half a dozen tough guys at a time plus a scene where danny has decided he doesnt want to fight any more i dont care how much a person doesnt want to fight when it is down to the wire of you fight or you die i think anyone would fightbr br as i said in the subject heading  this film is about 40 miles outside the boundary of reality as we have come to know it its not just a case of suspending belief  its completely beyond thatbr br furthermore i never did understand why dannys mother who turns out to be a nice lady rather than the prostitute bart claimed she is became mixed up with bart and his gang and got shot maybe that was my fault i got distracted right about the time that scene came onbut it seemed highly unlikely she and bart would have ever crossed pathsbr br 4 stars out of 10  and thats being generous
