apart from the beautiful imagery thanks to new zealand cinematographer alun bollinger this film is not worth seeingbr br the storyline is so fragmented and lost that its hard to know what is going on at any given time and just when you think youre following then the direction changes again like a lost bipolar puppy dogbr br the musical score is awful relying too heavily on extremely emotive pieces that try to force the audience into feeling a certain way as if the instruments were acting as an emotions queue sheet 혰 feel sad here feel shocked here feel scared here on top of that the repetitive samples used over and over again leave the audience on the verge of laughterbr br gone are the days of silent film where musical instruments were the sole portrayal of voice 혰 but you wouldnt think so while watching river queenbr br the voiceover was so overutilised that one has to wonder if this film really even needed any accompanying imagery it could have easily been a radio play although even then it would be hard to follow the storybr br and the stolen ideas from jane campions the piano are too obvious to overlook not only are the beach and forest shots almost identical to those in the piano 혰 perhaps some of this comes down to alun bollingers camera work on the latter 혰 but the voiceover feeling and levels too are strikingly close and who could forget when holly hunters character has her wings clipped in the form of her index finger being cut off by sam neill does it remind you of when wiremu has his trigger finger amputated and surprisingly too with an axe i thought sobr br all in all i cannot recommend this film for viewing unless you wear some earmuffs and just go with the scenery in mind
