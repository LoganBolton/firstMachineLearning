the recent death of stephen bach one of the producers of heavens gate has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film moreover the original release the long version was recently shown on tcm exposing the film in ail probability to its largest audience ever br br i saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd avenue cinema across the street from bloomingdales i think it was released on a friday and withdrawn on the following wednesday maybe that wasnt a fair release but it was and is a terrible film seeing the fulllength version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films i am better able to articulate whybr br first there is the dreaded phrase miseenscene whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzles even after being defined basically its everything that happens in front of a camera for example a crowd extra will be given a piece of action say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from when the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action if theres another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on action all of the extras do this then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and embraces another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing this is miseenscene in the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multidimensionalbr br the importance of defining miseenscene is because when the french critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a métierenscene even more derogatorily referred to as a traffic cop an auteur was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the directors body of work a theme or themes discerned the metierenscene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper it is the difference between say john ford and sam woodbr br the second point is how the director michael cimino got into the position of directing films cimino first gained prominence directing the first milliondollar tv commercial this depicted a chevrolet floating down the grand canal in venice this commercial never appears on any lists of greatest tv commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was the effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she flings her dress over her head cute for a three year old embarrassing for a thirty year old so cimino was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some overthetop image and so he learnedbr br his first film thunderbolt and lightfoot 1974 has a scene where clint eastwood and jeff bridges are passengers in a lunatics car that drives back and forth back and forth until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits which he proceeds to shoot one by one i had the feeling that if the producer eastwood hadnt stepped in that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killedbr br which brings us to heavens gate i guess if one watches the film on a dvd in snatches like a miniseries it can be impressive this is because scenes are directed with such a dense miseenscene that each scene is like an encyclopedia its just plain exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this its like sex at some point it just becomes a whipping there is the opening 40 minutes which takes place at harvard brilliantly photographed at oxford it is something of a nonsequitur i personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial now im gonna tell you what im gonna tell you of most films however the whole preface adds up to only one line kris kristofferson and john hurt went to harvard together now twenty years later all of that time money and effort not to mention all of the audiences attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of informationbr br then theres the scene in the street between kristofferson and masur which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of expositional information its just so exhausting there is just one scene after another like this its like trying to eat a thirty pound pizza then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible witless dialogue which go on and on and are exhausting and boring br br of course any single scene excerpted looks brilliant overall its a rich piece to spin praiseworthy articles about seen in snatches with the possibility of fastforwarding through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling miseenscene whipped its basically painless but dont let anybody tell you its a good film when i saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where kris kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times thats symbolic he said of he doesnt know which way to go that is basically at its kernel the basis of every pro heavens gate critiquebr br watch it if you must but be forewarned this is not a film whose time has come this is a stinker which will smell for all time br br heavens gate is historically inaccurate in the extreme i recommend the book banditti of the plains by asa mercer on the johnson county war
