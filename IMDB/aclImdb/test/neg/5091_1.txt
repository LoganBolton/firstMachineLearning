for weeks i had been looking forward to seeing this movie only to find myself hugely disappointed after wards in my opinion the only good thing river queen had going for it was the amazing scenery used as backgrounds the story line was all over the place samanthas character sarah was very difficult to understand and what on earth were all the many close ups of her face for it brought absolutely nothing to the storyif there was one at alla better actor for the part of boy could also have been selected to me it sounded like he read his lines straight of the script while shooting his scenesoverall a real shame as it could have been such a good movie
