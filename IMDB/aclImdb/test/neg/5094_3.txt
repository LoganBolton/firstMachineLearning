a good example of reversed politically correct racism where white men are presented as senseless brutes whore only there to be massacred and their aboriginal adversaries as noble heroes superior both in their appearance and abilities apart from making the story overally dull this also prevents the neutral viewer to identify himself with one or the other side  its just too simplifying the repetitive score is incredibly annoying as is the voiceover the characters lack any depth and the viewer is soon lost between questions like who is this character and what the hell is that supposed to mean photography is wonderful though and on the whole theres a lot of atmosphere to it but nice shots of misty landscapes alone dont save this movie the dvd box uses kiefer sutherland as an eyecatcher in fact his character could have been played by anyone else because its basically just an empty shell like most nonmaori characters and disappears anyway around halfway the film but if you are eager to see jack bauer in a kilt thats your kind of movie
