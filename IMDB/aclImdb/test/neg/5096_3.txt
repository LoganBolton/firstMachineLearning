with an interesting premise in the conflicts between europeans and indigenous peoples sometimes the battle lines were not so clear this should have been a good film but the story is sabotaged by the directors overriding infatuation with his own cleverness twinned with a very poor scriptbr br yes the natural setting is beautiful and yes the movie is authentic to its 19th century historical setting but the filmmaker keeps gilding the lily over and over again adding layer upon layer of overthetop musical accompaniment not to mention a completely unnecessary voiceover to the soundtrack that ultimately overwhelm the viewer and by calling attention to themselves take away from the storybr br to me it was clear the director with his microscopic closeups and the endless recurrence of the musical motif of danny boy of all things was trying to make a new zealand version of an epic sergio leone film something on the order of once upon a time in the west but given the earnestness of the story most of leones westerns were tongueincheek not to mention that its no longer 1968 he succeeds in making a parody of onebr br too bad
