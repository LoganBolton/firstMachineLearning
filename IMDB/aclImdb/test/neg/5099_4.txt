as the above suggests i was ultimately unimpressed with this movie it is lovely to look at the scenery is lush but the detail of the story in particular the characters are totally unbelievable films dont have to be believable but films like this with a political edge and social commentary do br br similarly i have no problem with commercialism as such but once again films like this shouldnt be making casting decisions purely based on box office draw this is absolutely the case with sutherland who is frankly rubbish as doyle his accent was far from authentic but he fell into the biggest trap of all his accent is his performance and we end up with a caricature of irishness with no personality outside of his nationality i find it totally implausible that anyone involved thought he was the best man for the job all in all this is a clear case of commercial interest over quality and when youre trying to be the mission this kind of thing wrecks your chances of successbr br speaking of accents there were a couple more problems one being the striking modernity of boys accent which acted to dispel the feeling of being transported to another time more surprising was samantha mortons much lauded irish accent which was variable to say the least her voice meandered between strong north and soft south even in the voiceovers where i wouldve expected any such discrepancies to be picked upbr br however these are minor gripes compared to the motivation and actions of sarah she never seems at home with the english and almost instantly at home with her son and his tribe the dilemma between the life she knew and the life she if offered just seems like a nobrainer perhaps a lot has been lost in editing perhaps this was meant to be a three hour film or a mini series where these things couldve been fleshed out but i can only judge what ive seenbr br now the biggest problem sarahs morton relationship with doyle sutherland is incomprehensible the fact is that her affection for him is not conveyed in any way until her having to choose between him and her son the conflict she goes through at this point was frankly ridiculous and killed the movie for me br br as you may have guessed this movie didnt work at all for me but it is top notch to look at you really wont see anything more stunning in terms of scenery there are some good performances and my wife liked it
