i watched the 219 minute version and have to say that dollarfordollar it it probably one of the worst films ever now i am not saying its the worst film everbut if you look at a ratio of cost over how much an average person would enjoy it this is a very very bad filmbr br i would say that the single biggest factor making this a bad film is the writerdirector michael cimino rarely can so much blame be placed on a single person had he not been so selfindulgent a film just as bad could have easily been made at about 90 minutessaving the studio millions br br the film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue thats supposed to be set at harvard the scene is huge but completely without context you have no idea exactly what is occurring nor do you know why the students in particular john hurt are behaving so boorishly i find it very hard to imagine a commencement going like this in 1870and it looks a lot more like 1970 this is a half hour where you have no idea what is happening who the characters are or their motivations br br the next scene is 20 years later inexplicably the two harvard grads hurt and kris kristofferson are in wyoming so they went to the best school in america and now one is only a law man in the middle of no where and the other iswell what is john hurt in the film he just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk the prologue or a pathetic and pointless drunk who hangs out with murdererseven though he is apparently against them his entire character made no sense they never explained why he was a brit living in the middle of nowhere it was impossible to hide his accent why he bothered to come along with the hired army if he was so against their wicked plan nor why he would risk his life for a cause he didnt believe in at all as for kristofferson his excellent acting and better defined character made his character more believable though having him move to wyoming and risk his life for a prostitute made no sense at allbr br this brings up the worst aspect of heavens gate while the scenes are way too long and needed trimming the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard john hurt a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film jeff bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why in fact other than kristofferson isabelle huppert as a hooker with a heart of goldquite the clich√© and perhaps christopher walken everyone is completely onedimensional its hard to imagine a movie this long where you dont know or understand the characters br br much of the film also seems anachronistic who would have thought to have a giant roller rink constructed in the middle of no where in 1890 i am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the west would have been very very difficultand yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller skates and lumber arrived instead of food maybe if they hadnt spent a bazillion dollars building and frequenting the roller rink the farmers could have afforded to buy food and avoided this war over purloined cattle and whats with the guy on roller skates with the fiddle what did this have to do with a land war br br the most obvious problem you are left with is that its a film where very very little actually happens until the big battle late in the film there are lots of scenes of filth and flat nothingness so much nothingness that by the time the battle occurs many audience members would have left or are now so hostile to the film that its inevitable that nothing could salvage the filmbr br as for the final battle it was done reasonably well but had problems first this minor skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the dday invasion second while details of the actual events of the socalled johnson county war are a tad sketchy we do know that the characters played by huppert and kristofferson never actually were there as theyd both been hung before the battle third i cant believe that cimino actually killed animals throughout the filmespecially during the final battle while i am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in cinematic history watching and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve ciminos vision for the film is very sadbr br finally after the big battle we have an epilogue while it is blessedly short it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague we see kristofferson on a fancy yacht so we can assume that hes finally putting some of that harvard education to work for himself we also see a woman who appears to be one that kris looked at a couple times during the prologue most importantly nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome i read up on it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrongbr br overall to say the film is long and needed tons more editing was like saying wwii was a minor tiff well ive certainly seen a lot worse but if you factor in the cost of production i truly think it might just be one of the worst films in historybr br finally when a film has this much explicit nudity i warn parents however as no child could sit through this film even with a promise of sex the warning is not necessary
