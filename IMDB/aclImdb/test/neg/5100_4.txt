river queen attempts to pack a complicated sweeping historical narrative into just under two hours there are some breathtaking battle scenes and the wanganui scenery is beautifully captured however the film did suffer from some poor leads  samantha morton sarah especially came across as unconvincing there seemed to be an indecisiveness about how the role should be played  as a helpless waif tossed by fate or as a strong determined character with a clear view of her destiny kiefer sutherlands character  private doyle  seemed to be pointless and for the most part  unintelligible keifers irish brogue needs a little polishing on the other hand cliff curtis temuera morrison and rawiri pene as sarahs son boy were well rounded and believablebr br the last 20 minutes of river queen came across as particularly compressed and rushed it seemed as if they decided they had to tie up all the loose ends before 120 minutes were up eg how on earth did wiremu know how to find sarah and doyle no explanation and very unsatisfyingbr br i did go to this movie with an open mind i hadnt read or heard anything much apart from its troubled production what i experienced was a mish mash of new zealand history beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing
