when i first read about berlin am meer i didnt expect much but i thought with the right people the right locations the right music and fashion you could at least make a trivial movie about the hip berlin everyone seems to be talking about but eissler failed its so ridiculously unauthentic its a complete misrepresentation of what it is going on in berlins so called scene of course its not all about hippness but you should expect more from a movie thats being sold as the definite berlin moviebr br and apart from all the credibility stuff it really is a bad movie mediocre acting and a rather boring plot interestingly some of the actors have proved in other movies that they are actually quite talented so it really must be poor directing skillsbr br dont bother watching berlin am meer unless you are 17 come from some small town in western germany and want to move to the big city after you finished school then you might actually find it enjoyable and totally cool
