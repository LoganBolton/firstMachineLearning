from the brilliant mind that brought us the exorcistand cruising rampage is unfortunately more like the latter its an overall messy movie that has a major madefortv vibe going for it the whole film pretends to hinge on the question what if the boy next door was a serial killer but instead it winds up being an uninspired courtroom drama and meditation on the the insanity plea and death penalty that makes little sense the movie is very loosely based on the richard trenton chase case culling a few facts here and there to make a fake character and a different outcome one of the main points of the film seems to be that ending the life of a terminally braindead child and ending the life of a murderer are somehow analagous sometimes you just have to choose says the lead character yeah sometimes you have to choose to pull the plugon your tv
