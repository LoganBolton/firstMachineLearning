every once in awhile ill remember that ive actually seen this bizarre fiasco thats a cross between whatever happened to baby jane sunset boulevard the lana turner lsd movie the big cube and the manson murders which also took place in 1969 but maybe before this socalled movie was made there are some descriptions of the plot already here so i wont go into it but its worth noting that miriam hopkins plays a parody of herself a chattering egomaniacal fading actress perhaps she thought she was making a movie that would be as successful as one of the bette davis horrors the old gal hopkins never stopped working so you have to hand it to her she shows a little too much flesh in this movie something davis and crawford would never have done and theres a scene with miriam in the actual tacky hollywood boulevard christmas parade which must have been filmed xmas 1968br br gale sondergard is old old old its just shocking how wrinkled and awful she looks john garfield jr looks a bit like his father but not as interesting i think one of the three stooges is the tour guide at the beginning if its not one of the stooges its somebodybr br i was astounded to come across this thing in the form of a commercial videotape given to me by a friend who knows all about junk like this its amazing
