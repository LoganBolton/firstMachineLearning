that welles said was that hes been in decline his whole careerbr br there was an interesting story here unfortunately welles seemed completely incapable of telling it instead he was trying to tell a bunch of different stories about elmyr about clifford irving about his pompous view of critics and experts oh yeah and trying to jump start his current girlfriends career by giving her unneeded screen time oja honey when they told you to sleep with the director they didnt mean one washed up like a whale on a beach br br welles was probably trying to cash in with a bunch of footage of clifford irving as irving was becoming a household name with his role in the faked autobiography of howard hughes unfortunately it means the subject of his film elmyr didnt get the time he deserved and he was probably the more interesting storybr br the great tragedy of orson welles was that he peaked early and then spent the rest of his career sputtering finally doing wine commercials and awful documentaries
