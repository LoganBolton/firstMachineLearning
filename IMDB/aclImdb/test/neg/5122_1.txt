i give flashdance a lowest rating of 1 out of 10 because its nothing more than a series of music videos with a movie short surrounding the music videos in order to clock in as a feature length film since when does that count as film jennifer beals plays alex owens an aspiring 18yearold dancer who incomprehensibly has a job as a welder in a pittsburgh steel factory not a line of work most older women find their way into much less 18yearolds fresh out of high school meanwhile at night she works as an exotic dancer who never actually takes off her clothes in a greasy spoon bar called mawbys yet looking at the well choreographed and well polished dance routines the girls do every night at mawbys you would think they were working at the best casino on the las vegas stripbr br alex ends up having a predictable romance with her boss nick hurley michael nouri who is about twice her age after resisting nicks advances because going out with the boss isnt a good idea she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date alex and nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job which makes no sense given how it is likely to look to alexs coworkersbr br when beals isnt being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie her character spends most her time throwing temper tantrums alexs dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious pittsburgh conservatory of dance inexplicably when her bossboyfriend helps her get the audition shes been dreaming of shes throws one her tantrums she angrily tells nick she isnt doing the audition because of his intervention and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel this is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making thisbr br of course alex does eventually get her audition at the conservatory she puts on a dance routine before the conservatory board that is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the mtv generation oh yeah it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the mtv generationbr br i dont think i can judge whether or not beals can actually act well on the basis of what i saw in flashdance this is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written that i dont think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilitiesbr br you have to hand it to the makers of flashdance though this movie is proof that the poorest film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign in this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy rotation on mtv if they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that i cared about instead what we get are stock characters put in ridiculous scenes any viewer with a functioning brain cant take seriously a truly forgettable film
