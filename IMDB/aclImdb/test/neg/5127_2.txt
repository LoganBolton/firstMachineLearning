flashdance is one of those awful stupid movies that you actually kindof enjoy just because theyre so crap i just watched it on tv  my friend and i were amazed at how dopey it was its true that don simpson and the other producers came up with the idea of a fairly cheap lowbrow flick with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell a soundtrack of admitedly catchy pop so flashdance is an odd sort of pioneer the first mtv movie adrian lyne started out in advertising and it shows because flashdance is almost a commercial for itself youve already decided to watch it but the movie has this weird panicky undercurrent as though its frightened that you might change your mind at any moment it keeps selling itself to you over and over all the way through using slick commercialstyle editing and glossy closeups of jiggling breasts the story is wafer thin i honestly cant think of another film ive seen with less plot and it never makes much sense but its a very contrived calculating movie so it feels consistent people say its dated but flashdance was always rubbish viewers in the early 80s knew it was just cheesy ta but it does work in its own silly fashion theres soppy romance for the chickflick crowd and stacks of oily writhing female bodies for their dates all set to a pumping disco beat how could it fail it helps that the dialogue is pointless so you can grab a popcorn without missing anything major and if this sort of thing isnt your cup of tea you can always laugh at the interpretive dance on display the scene where a standin for jennifer beals convulsesdances on stage in front of a tv with a fan in it and a face full of white clown makeup had us in stitches a genuine guilty pleasure
