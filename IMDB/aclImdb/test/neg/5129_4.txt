spoilers beware flashdance is a fair movie in my opinion some things do confuse me about it eg jeanie asks alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing alex replies about 25 years isnt alex supposed to be 18 and some things do fascinate me about it i loved the spins overall though it intrigued me when this movie was made i wasnt even born i didnt really experience the eighties i was born in 85 and i have to wonder sometimes alex would just run in place a bit or throw herself all over not really dancing just banging in to things tossing her head back and waving her armswas this considered dancing back then if it was im not sure i couldve standed it the spins the flip the fluid movements were great but some of itmy neighbors toddler couldve done better also if alex is a welder during the day wouldnt she be tired after a hard days work when she doesnt go to work for nearly a week wouldnt she be laid off living in a warehousei can almost see it but not quite it doesnt seem right that shes a welder owns a warehouse house and is trying to get into ballet none of it really makes sense i shouldnt be too judgemental considering my own background but please maybe jennifer beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder i dont know but either way they couldve picked a better actress the actors were fine i even liked the romance you make your own decision but mine isrent it once dont see it againit isnt worth it
