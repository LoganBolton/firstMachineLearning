i think vampire movies usually are wicked even if the film itself isnt all that good i still like it cos its got vampires in it but this stinks it really does give vampire movies a bad namebr br for a start the cheapness really shows im not usually that bothered about low budget films  one of my favourite alltime movies is el mariachi which only cost 7000  but i hate this the actions a load of crap as well resorting to a stylish wobbling camera which gives you headachebr br theres not much more to say other than dont watch this i bought it for Â£150 as it was an exrental and i feel cheated out of my money even for that low price
