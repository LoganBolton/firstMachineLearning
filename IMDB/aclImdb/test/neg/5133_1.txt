i loved heavenly creatures and make it a point to catch it whenever it is onbr br so imagine my delight when i discovered love  suicide while browsing netflix echoing heavenly creatures an easy choice to the top of my queue it wentbr br i watched it last made myself comfy and waited what i thought was some crappy preview of a stoned high school students prank film project i laughed out loud once or twice thinking that just lowered the bar of straight to video turned out to be the movie horrible acting amateur direction weak dialog i usually enjoy low budget films there is something tangible and real about them because they cannot afford the superficial stuff to distract from the meat the acting the direction the plot the story i would liken it to a student who hasnt studied for an exam goes in knowing he is going to fail and just puts his head on the desk and sleepsbr br in someone elses hands the plot would have serious potentialbr br do not expect magic or even a cult classics like say divines polyester or showgirls at least there you learn to expect bad actingbr br love  suicide went from bad to worse to the worst movie i have ever seen
