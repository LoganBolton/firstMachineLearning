yeah i made it all the way to the end it was pretty hard thoughbr br sometimes i was wondering if there was even a director on set the actingwell i dont even know what to say i thought the girl who played emily tried her best with the boring sometimes wacky and sometimes predictable dialog br br i know that it was low budget but the hollow sound and the lighting unfortunately made it look and sound like a 100minutelong audition tape br br im not even going to talk about the endingbr br the best thing about the movie was the musicbr br that being said i do not recommend this movie to anyone even for lesbians who dont have many movies to watch overall this is nothing to waste your time on if youre looking for a sad lesbian themed movie check out the childrens hour lost and delirious or high art those will all leave you depressed and gloomy but you wont have to suffer cinematic hell in the process
