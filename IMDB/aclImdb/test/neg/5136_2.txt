this movie has good intentions at least in the message dont be afraid no matter how tough it can be fear will kill you in the end its a good message but the container is so flawed that the message gets squashed by bad acting complete lack of credibility in the feelings dialog thats delivered as if it were read out loud stereotypes instead of breathing living peoplebr br it abuses from effects such as slowmotion to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in the acting and thus a lack of emotional forcebr br the suicidal part of it still reminds me of a lowbudget film from the pre90s when lesbians seemed to have at least on celluloid an utter incapacity of live good happy lives and a tendency to get caught in overthetop dramas that often involved separation death or prison br br had it focused on the rewards of living life according to how we feel it and not according to how others think we should live it it would have being less dramatic more inspiring but it doesnt it focuses of pain on loss and leaves the message at just a theoretical idealbr br i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection br br if youre looking for a really good movie that talks about overcoming fear and daring to live what you feel go back to the magnificent desert hearts even better read the novel
