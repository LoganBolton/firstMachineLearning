i watched this movie so that you dont have to i have great respect for kris kristofferson but what was he thinking he did this for scale br br at least the films title practices truth in advertising since people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film adding to the confusion kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he wasnt sure if genevieve bujolds character really existed this does not bode well for the viewer being able to follow the storybr br the making of feature was far more interesting than the movie itself it explores the difficulty cobbling together funding for an indie even as the film is being shotbr br to its credit this movie is visually pleasing and doesnt in any way look like a movie made with just slightly over 1m too bad the money wasnt spent on a better project
