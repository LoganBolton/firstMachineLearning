ill say one thing for herman usa it will probably always play well to minnesota audiences i cant imagine that theres another place in the world where a reference to the fast life of bemidji or a line like i knew there was something wrong with iowa guys would bring down the house i actually quite enjoyed the first hour or so basically a bunch of lonely country boys take out a personals ad and find their town beset with willing female suitors is suitors a genderspecific word it aint progressive to be sure but its sorta charming in its own right pity that the filmmakers felt the need to tack on a contrived subplot about a conniving golddigger and her violent husband overall its just too cloying for its own good but youve got to give some props to a film with the guts to give a guy with kevin chamberlins build a nude love scene i will always applaud the depiction of people who dont meet the usual standards of beauty as sexual caring human beings but thats not enough to redeem herman usa to paraphrase jello biafra its nostalgia for an age that never existed
