honestly people who gave this movie a ten would have given 100 for pulp fiction this is the level that we are dealing with herebr br the movie isnt bad but no way is it like omg the best movie since pulp fiction some people have incredibly low expectations for movies even those of indie variety personally i found my interest in the movie waned after the halfhour mark the plot defies logic and belief you have got to hear the part about why the wife did what she did in order to save her husband yeah right i guarantee that you would walk out of the theatre thinking hmm now that doesnt make sense at all this is one movie in which you really need to suspend all logic and beliefbr br those who said that the music score is good were probably listening to their mp3 players it absolutely killed the movie in some partsbr br in conclusion watch the movie only if you have nothing particular important to do i give this a three because there is one long sex sequence in the motel which is decent
