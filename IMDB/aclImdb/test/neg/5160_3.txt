i shouldve realised it was a sign of things to come when the trailer for this film bored mebr br having watched several indie films on the strength of the reviews on here and subsequently finding that my view is completely opposite to those other reviewers i began wondering if its possible i am watching completely different films from these people or are they perhaps friendsfamily etc of the film makers trying to big up their work hmmmbr br are you interested in seeing an amateurs homage to pulp fiction and 1114 except done with worse actors a silly score undermines various scenes and unbelievable jumps in logic if not then skip this filmbr br here is my open letter to two of the players in this filmbr br alfonso morgan please please please stop trying to be samuel l jackon a la pulp fiction noone can do what he does as well as he doesbr br director please come up with something original it does you a disservice to churn out this stuff pretending to be quentin tarantinobr br simply dire and i really cannot see how anyone could say this is a good film it is a disgrace that people have somehow managed to put a score of 85 on this the same as films like pulp fiction or goodfellas it is nowhere near these movies a 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating i give it a 3
