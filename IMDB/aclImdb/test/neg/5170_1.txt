there is no doubt that the kokoda trail depicts a truly great event in australian military history the brave defence of australia against the cruel barbaric japanese armyhowver this film fails to take into account the story of the fuzzy wuzzys or the new guinea natives that the australians used to help them carry out there military operations the film also fails to give a credible account of the australian soldier and his behaviour in this event it is more like an uninformed contemporary view of what is was likebr br again the australian film industry has failed to give this important chapter in australias history the film it deserved this is film making at its worst with arbitrary cinematography  bad scripting and dialogue  no character development and clich√© jungle warfare scenesbr br it fails to imbue the audience in any meaningful perspective other than the japanese army were ruthless and cruel murderers of an illequipped and badly trained group of australians fighting in a junglebr br the film failed as most australian films do to attract a significant australian audience in fact they stayed away in drovesbr br i am not going to join the usual parochial garbage of saying its great because its an australian film i say either do a great job or just leave it to some one who knows how this government funded film is just another failure by australias wealthy and spoilt rich kidsbr br i am giving it zero stars because its an insult to the descendants of these truly great australians and their enormous sacrifice what a shameful waste and disrespect and i know this review will provoke more negativity from the movie show crew and most reviewers but i have a right to my opinion and thats what australians fought for our freedom and that includes freedom of speech and the right to express an opinion
