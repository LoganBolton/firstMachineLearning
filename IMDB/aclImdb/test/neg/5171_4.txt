first off ill give this movie a low scoring 4 out of 10 it was nothing more than a wannabe film i felt very let down watching this film i was lead to people it would be more drama and more facts about the true story its based on instead i spent over an hour watching middle aged mean break the law and take drugsbr br its abit like football factory but with no real storyline and not a good ending after watching the film i was left wondering what was that film all about if you like films with no real storyline and a lot of drug taking and swearing then this is the film for youbr br im a big fan of mob and gangster movies but this film did not live up to the hype i can see where the writer was trying to go with the film but it never reached its destinationone of the worst british films that i have ever watched if only the movie had more of a storyline this would have bad an excellent movie
