rise of the footsoldier follows the unrelentingly cruel journey of gangster carlton leach and his associates through drugs violence sex violence guns violence and did i mention violencebr br protagonist carlton leach ricci harnett member of the icf inner city firm a group of football hooligans turned professional gangsters guides the audience through the events leading to the 1995 range rover killings in which three gang members fell victim to particularly vicious professional hits leachs success as a doorman and talent for locating aptly violent friends to control unruly punters at a local nightclub launches him into the company of notorious drug dealers and gangsters profitably benefiting from the 80s90s rave scene and drug culturebr br opening with brutally realistic shots of the dead men the viewer is left thirsty to understand what happened but left wholly unsatisfied the next 2 hours meander through a series of countless character introductions each of these basically establishes yet another typical hard man shows him assaulting usually undeserving victims before probably coming to an even nastier end what little emotional understanding the audience is allowed to form for a few of the characters for example a family man blamed for missing drugs is quickly destroyed when they are either anticlimactically killed or their storyline left unresolved the hints of a plot introduced in the beginning are inadequately concluded with vague impressions of how the murders occurred as the events are slotted into place with little reward for persevering with the hazy muddle of previous events br br this film has been made with a standard formula in mind for an audience who prefer violence and ard nut slang to an actual storyline rise of the footsoldier borrows too much from football factory leaving out the good bits demonstrating no moral ramifications of hooligan subculture or establishing empathy with the protagonist the violence although brilliantly shot seems excessive and implausible because no one is around long enough for the audience to form an emotional attachment the implication that the gangs are untouchable by the police is fair enough but machetewielding doormen regularly committing blatant murder in public places pushes the imagination of even the most willing viewer the audience are left bewildered as to the relevance of many key events and developed characters that had no knock on effect on the eventual conclusion attempted grittyrealism is further destroyed with a substance called truth serum which the turkish mafia use to coax honest answers from unwilling individuals this is not the genre in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs and renders the interrogation almost absurdbr br the actual scenes of violence before becoming repetitive hold some tension spliced with rapid flashes of colour or the end of a film reel seamlessly choreographed brawls coupled with obligatory but effective shaky handheld camera work saves the film but unfortunately the plot or lack there of limits it to a niche demographicbr br in essence the events this film is based on arent deservedly represented and an adequately sequential storyline is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and an unoriginal plot this film has a place in the market but if you like a bit of brain with your brutality this one isnt for you br br httpwwwobsessedwithfilmcom
