after a while i realized it was just my iq slowly dropping frostbite is one of those pathetic movies where no one and i mean no one is even trying i rooted for the dorky hero to die inside that trashcan how did he even manage to fit in there anyway traci lords the queen of b movies was horribly unfunny and ripped me and my friends off by not showing her boobs a single timebr br the characters though i use that term loosely are people so exaggerated and onedimensional they might as well have used cardboard cutouts the jokes i use this term loosely as well are simply hilarious a guys fart causes an earthquake roflcopter our hero gets a butt acupuncture by traci lords oh god i cant breathe the blind guy uses the f word repeatedly this is too much br br say what you want about the acting but i thought adam grimes did a pretty good job at playing a mentally challenged snowboarder apart from that the sole source of entertainment value here is boobs i think i counted three maybe four pairs throughout the entire film scattered over maybe five minutes of screen time thats five minutes worth watching out of 83 minutes of unfunny trash dont watch this watch barb wire with pamela anderson  at least there was plenty of nudity and action in that trashy flickr26
