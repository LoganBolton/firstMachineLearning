about 20 minutes into this lame excuse for a movie i realized it reminded me of one of those annoying people at work whore always telling really lame jokes or doing extremely unfunny things because they think its funny and are trying to entertain everyone br br this film is billed as starring traci lords shes not that bad of an actress but her lines arent funny and shes not the starbr br the acting is some of the most godawful ive ever seen except for lords the girl who plays casey and maybe the colonelwho seems oddly out of place i cant imagine why a retired military colonel would want to start a snowboarding academy do those even existbr br the budget wouldve been better spent coaxing these women into doing a full length porn feature br br freddy got fingered currently has a 35 score frostbite has a 27 im baffled these two movies are within a 10 to each other fgf is the godfather compared to this garbagebr br 110 stars
