this must be one of the most annoying arrogant poser films ive ever seen what a waste of budget and actors angelopoulos has reached new levels of pretentiousness it is clear there is virtually no plot even if this part of greek history is material for great movies he simply had some supposedly symbolic actually shambolic scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them death is the main theme and is repeated ad nauseam along with litanies processions and the like which should only be a vehicle for the movie but unfortunately it is the movie itself a totally incoherent result which can only leave you saying huh or oh dear every two minutes br br there is no character development at all nada zilch im usually complaining about some movies having twodimensional characters but oh boy he managed to create onedimensional characters this is irritating for us and degrading for some of the actors he even managed to make one of my favourite greek actors giorgos armenis seem wooden br br and going to the core of angelopoulos filmmaking no were not idiots we do not want chewed food please someone tell this guy symbolism has to be subtle theo do you really underestimate your audience so much or youre simply incompetent personally i think he tried to make a greek underground no matter how he tries he cant reach kusturicabr br only saving grace photography costumes and the music
