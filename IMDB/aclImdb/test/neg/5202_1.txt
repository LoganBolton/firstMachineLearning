this is an awful movie from just about every point of view since much has been already pointed out in previous reviews let me just focus on serbs and delta force guys in this moviebr br 1 the uniforms that serbs wear are not serbian and helmets are wrong toobr br 2 the actors who play serbs are not speaking serbian not even a language close to serbian unlike in behind enemy lines where the czech actors did their best to speak the language and add at least a bit of credibility to the moviebr br 3 the graybearded serbian general looks and acts like a moron firing his gun whenever us soldiers call his name br br  us soldier gravic give upbr br  graybearded moronic general fires his ak47br br  us soldier gravic come outbr br  gbmg fires his ak47br br  us soldier gravic youre surroundedbr br  gbmg fires his ak47br br  prop guy excuse me mr graybearded moronic general see were out of blanks and i sent the boy to buy some more but hes not back yetbr br  gbmg clickbr br 4 since when does the army issue ak47s to the delta force i guess they couldnt find enough working m4s in bulgaria but there were plenty of old ak47s and practice blanks  maybe they should have went for some airsofts they are cheaper and wouldnt have hurt the credibility of the movie anywaybr br 5 in the scene where a df officer is hanging on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist he is holding his finger on the trigger all the time no sane person with any weapons training or just plain common sense would ever do that i guess the actor figured that his coolness level increases the longer he holds the gun that way br br this movie is such an insult to common sense
