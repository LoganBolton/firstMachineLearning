as a huge fan of the original operation delta force i thought id pick this film up i figured it couldnt be too bad however heres a list of things i learnt from watching operation delta force 4 deep faultbr br  the delta force despite being the elite in american armed forces are mostly mildlyoverweight men in their late 30s and early 40sbr br  the delta force despite being the elite in american armed forces carry standard police issue pistols or ak47s on their most important missionsbr br  the delta force despite being the elite in american armed forces havent learnt that during stealth missions wearing bright red ski jumpers and running around in open spaces arent exactly going to keep you out of sightbr br  when you drop a molotov cocktail into a tank it explodes externally like a grenadebr br  when you get hit by tank fire you can run away although the smoke caused may present minor difficulties for breathingbr br  you can die from one standard gun shot but you can also live despite being hit multiple times by a sniper rifle and a few times by an ak47br br  in handtohand combat members of the delta force despite being the elite in american armed forces are regularly pummeled by railroad attendantsbr br  if bad guys are approaching you while on a slowmoving train theres nothing to worry about  between the 4 of them they cant manage to figure out how to get an automatic weapon to fire automatically let alone hit anyone from 5 metres 16 feet with at least 50 attempts between thembr br  if youre short on actors just recycle them  the bad guy from operation delta force 1 plays a good guy called mac in operation delta force 4 and the guy who played mac in operation delta force 3 now plays skip lang a different good guybr br  its not ok for the delta force to shoot an unarmed terrorist even if hes attempting to reload his weapon to kill youbr br  grenades explode on impact with the ground when thrown by members of the delta force when thrown by nondelta force personnel they explode at exactly the point where the delta force members have thrown the grenades back at the bad guysbr br  tanks can drive faster than standard trucksbr br  militias and personal armies use the exact same chopper that the un used in operation delta force 1br br  when a chopper arrives a bad guy in that chopper cannot see you if you lie facedownbr br  shooting someone multiple times in the chest will cause minor damage stabbing that person in the knee will kill them inside 5 secondsbr br  the delta force steal cars from old people to get around when in foreign countries because the us military do not provide them with any means of transport this may also explain why they caught public transportbr br as you can see this is not really the finest moment in filmmaking but its good for a laugh
