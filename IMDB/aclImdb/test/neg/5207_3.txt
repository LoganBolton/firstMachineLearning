im a big time horror fan and i bought this movie from all the hype it was getting on the message boards well let me tell you i dont know whom was giving it all the hype but let me speak on a few thingsbr br first of all this film is not a lot of things it is not scary not suspenseful not overly gory not overly sick except for one season maybe not beautifully scored at allbr br the premise of the movie is that a couple flee to a small island in greece because they have done a little naughtiness in london we dont even know what they did but it is presumed that they killed someone br br spoiler alertbr br the male lead kills a few people out of his perversion of cleansing the island of perverts oddly enough the killings are cheap the characters are cheaper and the effects suckbr br there is one part when he rapes a goat because his wife wont give him any in the morning but even that is done without any care for how it is shot br br end of spoilersbr br the end of the movie is about the only thing that isnt totally predictable i especially enjoyed when the herder farts on the husband anyway if you can rent this and have 2 hours to waste go ahead its nothing better than a processed cheese sandwich on moldy breadbr br 310
