my friends and i are always on the lookout for chuck norris films to just bash and make fun of one of our favorites so far is lonewolf i went to a walmart christmas shopping and i came across this movie in the 599 bin i had to get it i had high hopes for this movie and although being absolutely hilarious at times we agreed that bells of innocence is the worst movie weve ever seen made produced thought up etc who the hell would think this is a good idea not only is it confusing at times but the acting is just hard to watch the man who plays oren has acting i can compare to my own vomit and chuck took a dive on this one hes not the greatest actor but this was terrible and what kind of names are oren conrad and jux jux come on people if you honestly thought this movie was at all watchable great for you because it was hard for me and i seriously had a headache and stomach pains after watching it im telling you now if you havent seen this movie dont for the love of god please do not subject yourself to such a horrible 90 minutes of your life
