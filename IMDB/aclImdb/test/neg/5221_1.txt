normally i dont like chuck norris films i appreciate his work as a martial artist and his fight scenes are usually fairly wellchoreographed chuck is undeniably one of the martial arts greats so in my local used bookstore i found a film i hadnt seen before and took it homebr br while the acting in this movie was worse than most chuch norris films i was hoping to see at least one fight scene i quickly began to realize that this wasnt a typical chuch norris film rather it was a christian film destined to illustrate the good will win out paradigmbr br there is really nothing on the packaging to indicate that this is a christian film with the exception of the label  goodtimes entertainment which i had never heard of before ill certainly keep that in mind the next time i see a film from that companybr br i dont have a problem with christianity  i do have a problem with sneaky proselytizing if someone is going to make a religious film at least have the good sense to indicate to the viewer that such is what they will get the only redeeming part about the exercise is that i spent only 325 to spend 97 minutes to watch a great martial artist not fight at least it was during suppertime and i spent some of that cooking and eatingbr br in short if youre looking for a mediocre martial arts film and not hoping for much dont bother with this film because it doesnt even offer that
