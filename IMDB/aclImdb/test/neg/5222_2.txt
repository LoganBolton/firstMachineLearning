ok im 26 so ive been thru all the action heroes 80s hype and chuck norris along with seagal van damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood heroes fighting the bad guys shooting dozens of bullets from one round only i saw the advert of this movie on tv a couple of days ago  chuck norris was throwing some fireballs from his fingers whoa that is a mustsee crappy movie i said and indeed it was only a lot lot worse it is very difficult to see all the movie  stuffed with some religious thoughts ridiculous zombielike monsters who serve satan all the idea of a plot set in some forgotten community which represent whole mankind  it is a load of christian fundamentalists wet dreamsbr br ive nothing against christianity even in the movies but this one lacks taste it lacks almost everything that connects with a common sense cmon chuck norris playing an angel whose job is to look after little town where satan lives the whole plot is so damn straight and boring not mentioning its silliness yes its not stupidity anymore were talking silliness like like a retarded childs joke make altogether terrible movie made as far as i suppose for elder people very much devoted to catholic church because young viewers laugh at almost every scene technically its incorrect the fx are worse than the ones youve seen in early 90s in tv series the plot seems very stupid actors could be easily exchanged to cardboard stands not mentioning the music which as far as ive heard was played on a childish toy piano ive seen a lot of movies even the worst ones the ones from the imdb bottom list like space mutiny or manos  hands of fate but believe me nothing compares to this ridiculous terrible horribly acted quasimovie which brings some students prank movies to my mind rather than regular production avoid it at all cost avoid it theres even nothing to laugh at chuck norris has officially finished his movie career
