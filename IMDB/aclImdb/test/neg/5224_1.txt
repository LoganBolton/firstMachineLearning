this is quite possible the worst movie ever made i know people talk about how horrible ed wood movies were plan 9 but this movie makes plan 9 look amazingbr br chuck norris makes a cameo for what reason i have no idea perhaps to ruin his movie career aside from chuck norris the movies cast consists of extras in daytime soaps and mike norris thats right chucks sonbr br this director doesnt even have a resume and i have no idea where the plot or screenplay originated this mustve been green lit by a horrible southern baptist minister that somehow had a 3rd cousin that owned a studio which im sure has since been shut downbr br i dont really know what else to say about this movie i would like to give you a plot summary but im lost there is something about jesus and satan some eternal battle other than that there are indians and a bunch of freaky kids that dont know how to act theyre just awkward and should not be on camera i dont know what was going on most of the time but i know the movie was a great laugh mike norris pushes his daughter on her bike into the street somehow but in the shot hes in the middle of the park so somehow she learns to ride her bike with speed equivalent to that of the flash and gets hit by a car or bus i dont know but shes dead this is actually the funniest scene in the movie i know that sounds sick but once you see mike raise his hands in victory and then hold his head and scream in terror youll understand it doesnt show the daughter getting hit or anything you just have to assume she got hit by some vehicle but the movies not clear so maybe it was completely unrelated and she died from cancer anyway after that the movie gets really confusing and i have no idea what really happens i am a christian and i have no idea why this movie was made i dont see any value for this movie in a religious or nonreligious sector this is probably the first thing they show students in filmmaking 101 this is what you dont want to dobr br just see it youll hate it and me for suggesting that you see it
