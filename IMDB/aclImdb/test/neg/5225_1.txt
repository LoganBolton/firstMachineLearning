i gave this movie a rating of 1 because it is by far the worst movie ive ever seen in my life this movie was made in 2003 and ive seen movies made in the 60s with better special effects i wish i could go into detail but words cant describe how crappy this movie was i could have done better with a home video camera and 20 i pray that chuck norris never makes a movie again now if you think im downing this movie because it has a christian theme youre wrong i like the fact that il chuck decided to make a movie that at least attempted to make god look good but why would he make poor viewers like me suffer through such a crappy movie this whole film can be summed up in 3 words re damn diculous
