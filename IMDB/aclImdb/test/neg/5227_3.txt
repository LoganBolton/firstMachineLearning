i am a fan of ed harris work and i really had high expectations about this film having so good actors as harris and von sydow is always a big advantage for a director but if the script is bad what can you do i really think that needful things is the worst movie of harris filmography and that getting involved with it was a huge mistake anyway ive seen much worse movies in my life but needful things was a disappointment because of the waste of acting talent the story as an overall seems too unbelievable and fake i dont know if that is because of the book cause i havent read it but if the script was so bad i cant see the reason for filming it maybe it was the commercial success of kings books or the need for lowquality movies for the vhs era of the 90s whatever the reason was though this movie was a very bad choice for anyone involved
