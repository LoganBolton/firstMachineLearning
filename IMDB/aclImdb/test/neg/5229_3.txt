this movie is based on a stephen king novel in which mysterious new shopkeeper leland gaunt max von sydow offers each citizen of castle rock the item he or she most desires  but there is a heavy price to be paid for these transactions local sheriff alan pangborn ed harris is soon forced to deal with a variety of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstancesbr br below average for stephen king cinema i can see why some people would think it was boring it plods along without offering genuine scares and forces the viewer to spend time yet again with a bunch of repulsive losers whose hatred of each other is spookybr br i do enjoy the novel and dont believe that this lackluster movie does it justice there are too many unfortunate changes from book to screenbr br von sydow makes gaunt much too charming were supposed to be scared of gaunt at the right times not amused by him i also hate it that the sheriffs primary deputy ray mckinnon is written and portrayed as such an annoying barney fifetype moron star ed harris looks as if he was forced into doing this picture by his agent but professional that he is he really sinks his teeth into his dialog bonnie bedelia as pangborns love interest polly and amanda plummer in one of her standard mentally unbalanced roles come the closest to creating characters who are likablebr br yet it is also foul and meanspiritedbr br although ill be darned if it didnt feel a little cathartic watching a bunch of unlikable movie characters tear each other to pieces the climax has some good explosionsbr br i often give movies a better rating than they probably deserve but in this case i feel i should really be honest and just say 310
