okay i just had to sound off on this one like a tremendous mentalgimp ive just sat through this film in its entiretybr br youll note that the trivia section of imdb points out that portions of the raising of the 747 were borrowed from airport 1977 this really doesnt scratch the surface virtually all exterior shots of the plane skimming the ocean landing in sinking and even the atrest shots are borrowed from airport 77 all of the raising shots are pulled from 77 including most of the interior flooding clips with the exception of dennis weavers drowning i couldnt help but wonder if olivia dehavilland might come floating by at any moment or maybe a dead tom sullivan another eyeroller dennis weavers name in this film is stevens which is to compensate for the fact that airport 77s plane is owned by the stevens corporation headed by jimmie stewart of coursebr br this is a veritable calvalcade of actors who dont work much or at least havent worked in a while which might have been the first clue that it was going to be a real stinkerbr br ive rated this film a 2  its quite worthy of a 1 but if this film cant offer any other redeeming quality at least somebody helped coolio max caulfield nicolle eggert and dennis weaver make their car payments that month
