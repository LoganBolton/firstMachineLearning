star rating  the works  just misses the mark  that little bit in between  lagging behind  the pits br br based on another of stephen kings lengthy novellas this takes place in the sleepy little new england town of castle rock also the name of the films production company where a new antiques store the titular needful things has opened the owner and proprietor leland gaunt max von sydow hides you might say a devilish secret theres an item in his store that everyone in the little town wantsa small cash price upfront is first required before a far more sinister price is asked for as suspicion hate and madness tear the town apart it falls to police chief alan pangborn ed harris to restore order and save the town from a terrifying endbr br i read the novel of needful things earlier this year and was eager to watch the movie adaptation again to compare them like that was going to be any contest but it had been deleted on video and dvd and i couldnt find anywhere to rent it from so i was happy when i finally found it in a flea market whilst on a shopping tripbr br its one of the cruelest ironies that king novels are generally the best to read but when they get adapted to screen nine times out of ten they are complete junk as is the case here the material that makes his books great simply doesnt translate into a movie script very well for some reason and i suppose theres always the question why bother watching this when i could be reading the book again instead br br i appreciate that some are simply too lengthy ie it the stand to be made into a complete screen work with all the situations and characters included but theres no reason this one couldnt have included all the material from the book as a result a lot of key characters from the book ie ace merrill are not included at all and we have some terrible character development that means we dont care about the characters that are involved since they are so stripped of depth and motivation for example we have one character from the book danforth keaton who murders his wife toward the end yet we were shown no buildup to hint at any reason that he didnt get along with or hated her and so it has no impact when it happens unlike in the book where there was a lot of depth invested and it really involved you to find out what happened to the characters involved all the material in the script to fill in the cracks if you like is really stupid and corny and the typically goofy stuff that gets included in king adaptations like thisbr br most of the films problems are that it deviates so far away from the book but theres also some terrible acting from a cast that obviously cant feel for the daft material theyre being asked to perform in the 90s a lot of kings work started skipping the cinema and just being made into madefortvvideo territory rubbish like this must surely hint at why
