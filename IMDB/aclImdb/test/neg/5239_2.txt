i like christophe lambert as an actor he has played in several good movies highlander subway greystoke  but i cant even think he has played in that movie the story is nearly nothing the special effects are very bad and the actors also to resume the movie i have only one thing to say  its the first time that i go to watch a movie and want to leave after 10 minutes
