without doubt this is the worst movie ive ever seenbr br poor acting poor script poor direction and poor productionbr br why did they even bother this entire movie was total nonsense suspension of disbelief can only carry so far but this pushes the limits completelybr br for a movie with no humour content the audience laughed disturbingly often
