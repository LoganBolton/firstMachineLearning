another bmovie for teenagers based mainly on cgieffects industrial soundtrack and some medieval imagery its a pitty that the legend for beowulf is used in such uninspired manner i am a fan of christopher lambert but i have to admit that he is getting worse as an actor and his movies too rent it if you are teenager only
