good technomusic accompanying medieval swordplay also the movie looks sleeker than most bmovies but lets face it quake or doom has more atmospherebr br bad unintelligent plot no acting and totally unbelievable universe i am usually able to see the potential of even very bad movies heck i love a good bmovie like split second and the likes but this one has has nothing but boredom and clich√© to offer totally predictable from start to end oh and i forgot the lousy special effects they look more like an old playstation game than anything out of myth the use of a classic poem to sell this sucker offends mebr br conclusion quite simply boring if you want to see lara croft buy the game its way sexier
