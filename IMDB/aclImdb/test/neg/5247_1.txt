beowulf is like a very bad game  no characters no story no real dialogues bad fights  its probably the worst movie in the history of cinema its deadly boring a lost of time im really sorry for christophe lambert who visibly doesnt know how to choose a role if someone suggests you to see beowulf believe me  run like mad
