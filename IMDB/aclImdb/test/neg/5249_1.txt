this movie is painful thats probably the best way to describe it its 93 minutes of your life that you will never be able to get back well actually its more like 86 minutes because there is no way anyone would want to sit through the credits in this stinking pile of dog feces immediately you can tell the movie is from the producer of mortal kombat due to its thumping and annoying techno soundtrack this drains the few laughably enjoyable moments this movie can give you the rest is drained by the completely uninteresting and annoying characters the freddie prinze jr school of acting acting abilities of all involved including the miscast christopher lambert and the nonexistant directing did i leave anything out of course i did lets not forget about the suicideinducing script with its unitentionally  funny dialogue oh yes and let us also talk about how they shamed the original poem with this sad and useless futuristicmedieval translation the costumes and weapons were those giant pizza cutters i kept seeing are just plain stupid thats the best way i can describe them and the last culprit of the night is the always awful cgi when will filmmakers learn that cgi sucks when will we see the wonderful effects used in the 80s probably never but films like this and star wars episode 1 the phantom menace make us wish that they would bring them back in closing avoid this movie like the newest freddie prinze jr movie then again if you like freddie prinze jr movies then you deserve to sit through this horrid excuse for filmmaking
