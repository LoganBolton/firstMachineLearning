bulletproof is quite clearly a disposable film the kind where bullet riddled good guys and bad guys are splatted everywhere so much so that you really arent supposed to see them as human the yawns between the lines from wayans and sandler are extensive indeed they try hard but  alas and alack persona itself does not a good film make jimmy caan plays a nifty villain but hes always had that redneck edge at the ready my favorites scene is the repeated clips of a tv ad in which caan reveals the virtues of america can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in every garage aside from that its a buddy movie with guns for brains pass on this one
