this film has a really weird mixture of genres  toilet humour and action in one it doesnt really pull it off  it should have stuck to one genre the best thing i can say about the movie is that the dog in it is cutebr br the most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the film when moses sandler and carter wayans decide to stop off at a hunting lodgemotel im not quite sure what the point of this sequence is  it just seems gratuitous in the extreme the proprietor of the hunting lodge charlie is a very nerdy looking guy for some reason moses starts a conversation with charlie about porno jacking off homosexual sex sex in a threesome charlies photo of his wife appears to be charlie dressed in drag there is no reason for this really juvenile dialogue and scene anyway the whole scene seems to be directed to the moment when a naked moses ends up with carters gun up his butt and charlie sees them through the window it all reeks of school boy humour about homosexuality  horrified and titillated all at the same time  which i dont find funny at allbr br i have a friend who is always raving about adam sandler movies this is the first one ive seen  after this im not sure i want to see any morebr br btw this is my husbands account  hes seen happy gilmore and he tells me its quite good  maybe i should give sandler just one more chancebr br countess skogg
