wellbr br first of all as many reviewers have pointed out  this is a rip off of the martin cahill story  first represented by the bbc and by the john boorman film the general  which is a great film and far far superior to this onebr br speaking as a native british person the supporting cast to kevin spacey was really good in terms of british and irish acting talent especially peter mullan  but it was totally wasted the characters were cp and as for kevin spacey  didnt come across as a loveable rogue but as nothing really substantial or significantbr br not a lot to redeem this film the best bits are the gags and tricks nicked from the other films it rips off compare notes on this film and the general  id be interested to see what others thinkbr br
