kevin spacey is my favorite actor of all time he is without a doubt on others lists as well when it comes to great actors he even pulled off a good irish accent in ordinary decent criminal as well but kevin spacey as a mafia leader or even a burglar im not so sure he could go that far the movie to me just didnt make any sense and the some of the story just didnt feel solved to mebr br i know once again that imdb is going to make me write ten more lines but im not so sure on what i could say about this movie because i am still trying to figure it out silly isnt it but im pretty sure that more than a few of you imdb users have been in the same predicament as i am in right now where you just want to say a line or two about a movie but now you have to do ten lines wow that should do it d br br 310
