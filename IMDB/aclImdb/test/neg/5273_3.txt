kevin spacey is without a doubt one of the best actors of the 90s after his performances in the usual suspect se7en and american beauty you expect more and more from him that is why ordinary decent criminal is a huge disappointmentbr br michael lynch is the most artful criminal in dublin who is never in a bad mood his next heist becomes an obsession when his partners start questioning michaels ability to plan everything perfectly although this is the only thing he does when he isnt playing good father at homebr br i guess its partly my fault for not paying enough attention to the thousand plot details which sadly turn out to be the essence of the film i gave the movie a chance by calling it a parody and well parodies are always funny no matter what they spoof or how they do it so it wasnt after all a complete parody on purpose its just a different con movie that desperately tries to be funny and failsbr br unlike some of his colleagues ordinary decent criminal depends too much on story development and logical continuity forgetting whats the main reason the viewer has picked this kind of movie  to be entertained this is definitely not entertainment it includes one of the most ridiculous scenes ever  the introduction of michaels two wives i dont know whether its some kind of a mindless metaphor or strange dark humor but the chicks are sisters remember spaceys character has kidsbr br ordinary decent criminal is complex and confusing you are not waiting for a funny scene instead you carefully follow the dialog because there is a big possibility of losing yourself into the boring pale universe the film has inhabitedbr br lets go back to spacey i wonder in what condition he has been signing for that movie its not miscasting but something much worse an insult to his work in american beauty released an year before ordinary decent criminal the character michael is eccentric and talkative spacey is almost pathetic at times the only cure for this is thinking of lester burnham and roger kintbr br writer gerrard stembridge should definitely reconsider his screen writing abilities and be more objective this time because the dialog is very weak and the scenes are often pointless and we are still talking about a comedybr br ordinary decent criminal is a really bad crime comedy which does not deserve your attention
