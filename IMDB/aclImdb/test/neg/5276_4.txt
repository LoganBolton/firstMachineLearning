the german regionalbroadcaststation wdr has shown both the general and odc on saturday ive seen the general and i thought it wasnt very bad but not very good too but yesterday ive seen odc and i switched it off after about an hour although kevin spacey was the main actor the movie was totally confusing and seems restless the general told the story straight and ordered but odc just wanted to be cool there is a reference on the guy ritchie movies lock stock and two smoking barrels and snatch but doesnt have the coolness of these moviesbr br so in the end i would rate it 3 of 10
