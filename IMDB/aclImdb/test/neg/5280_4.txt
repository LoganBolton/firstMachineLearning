stupid horror film about five 20 somethings 3 guys 2 girls going to this place in the middle of nowhere what they dont know is dr chopper and his female assistants attack and kill anybody who ventures in their woods they use their body parts for some experimentsor something also five college girls and two lesbians are thrown in to be killed off and show some cleavagebr br pretty desperate the story is confusing and boring the gore is laughably fake dr chopper and his assistants overact terribly theres some dreadful black humor in here and people just stand around while their friends are being attacked or just stand there and let the people kill thembr br this was pretty insulting there are a few pluses a twist an hour in was pretty good and the five young actors are actually good chase hoyt is great as reese butch hansen is ok as jimmy ashley mccarthy is also good as tamara and robert adamson has his moments as nicholas best of all is chesley crisp as jessicashe was excellent some of the dramatic scenes between these five were wellacted and interesting unfortunately the dialogue wasnt really there for them im giving it a 4 for their performancesbut nothing else here is worth mentioning hopefully these actors will get roles worthy of them
