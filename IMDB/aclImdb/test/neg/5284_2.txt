i paid 200 for this piece of crap i want my money back it is a d grade horror movie that isnt so groovybr br there are many many floors in this film including the acting the lack of actual horror the lack of nudity which besides the starting nurse porno outfit and the still breathing nude corpse flash there is nonebr br the sound track maybe is the best thing because it has some upbeat sorta guitar riffstracksbr br there are your usual typical characters the jock the jocks woman the nerdy guy who looks more like a jock the rookie copranger who has the biggest gap in his teeth i wanted to slip a few dollar coins into that gapor go for a field goal the mysterious fella and the pure girlbr br the make up was pitiful with side views of dr chopper showing a clear make up lineand natural skin tones the cover art to the dvd is clearly photoshopenhanced to make the cover more enticing as dr chopper looks like an old plopper the scraggy women that hang around dr chopper are not explained and or look convincing like the rest of this moviebr br the plot twist was very predictable and the abundance of bad looking fake limbs was laughable what did they think um throw some limbs around and some fake blood and you have a horror filmbr br dr chopper himself is the most stupid character created ive seen in a while though original i believe that the creator of this film was strained for ideas and possibly tried to use the rhyme doctor and chopper bike and thought bingo ill make a crappy movie about thatbr br ive seen worse before but this is just plain bad everything about it is bad the lack of suspensethe lack of actual horror or character development the lack of a decent storyline the only thing good about this film was when it finished this film doesnt fall into the category Ã¯ts so bad its good for me eitherbr br overall 210 the directorwritereditor should know better
