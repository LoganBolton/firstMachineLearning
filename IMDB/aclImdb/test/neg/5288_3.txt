dr chopper starts shortly after teenager nicholas robert adamson mum has died he is still cut up about it but every cloud has a silver lining  in this case it appears that his mum owns a log cabin at lake tatonka the self proclaimed friendly place for happy people that she didnt tell him about so nicholas together with his girlfriend jessica chelsey crisp  three friends jimmy butch hansen reese chase hoyt  tamara ashley mccarthy head out there for a fun weekend unfortunately things dont go according to plan the cabin turns out to be little more than a run down shed  their neighbours turn out to be dr chopper ed brigadier  his two nurses who go around killing anyone they meet to use them in horrible experimentsbr br going straighttovideodvd dr chopper was edited  directed by lewis schoenburn  this film seems to be having a hard time here on the imdb with some pretty harsh reviews while i think dr chopper as a horror film is pretty worthless i dont think some of the criticism ive read is entirely justified the script which takes itself very seriously is credited to ian holt whether he likes it or not who has a role in the film as detective crocker according to the imdb cast list although i cant remember any character of that name maybe he was one of the cops at the start anyway the basic story is alright i suppose although its a tad dull  lasts for too long its typical slasher fare with some sort of evil character running around bumping off our annoying american teen cast you know the drill by now besides some brief  undeveloped nonsense about dr chopper using body parts to replenish his own deteriorating body theres not much story here  the script seems to exist solely to invent situations for girls to take their tops off theres the inevitable sex scenes theres a sequence where some girls have to complete a sorority house initiation topless  theres even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothing oh  when i say topless i mean they arent wearing any tops but they all keep their bras on so you may want to bear in mind there isnt any actual full frontal nudity in dr chopper at all so there you have it really its an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted is populated with poor clich√©d dumb characters that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes  girls in bras to be honest i expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe im just being pickybr br director schoenburn does ok actually this is by no means the worst looking film ive seen although it still looks cheap theres no style here i didnt think it was scary  theres no atmosphere either the gore is restrained  restricted to some dead bodies  severed limbs theres nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effects dr chopper is also one of those films where character decisions  motivations are ridiculousbr br technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like someones front room  the two nurses outfits at the start look like stripper outfits the acting is alright it could have better but ive certainly seen worsebr br dr chopper indeed features a doctor who rides around on a chopper motorbike but unfortunately that just isnt enough to satisfy me despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace
