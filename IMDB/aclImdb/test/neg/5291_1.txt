if there was justice in the cinematic universe director lewis schoenbrun would never be allowed to set foot on a movie set again it would seem inconceivable that anyone who spent two full decades in an editing room where ls started his movie career could be so utterly devoid of any sense of pacing or dramatic staging but this film is damning evidencebr br as bad as it is it is fascinatingly so from the opening scene where a nurse is clad in a costume appropriate only for a porno film or a skit on a mexican variety show the viewer is compelled to see just how low it can go the answer isnt far away as in the next scene we move to a funeral parlor where the next stunning fashion statement comes in a sexy offtheshoulders black dress worn by one of the mournersbr br aggressively inappropriate costuming isnt the films only flaw the dialog is a treat for connoisseurs of bad writing you turn my tears into wine is a sample gem the actor deserves an oscar for delivering that one with a straight facebr br the director reinforces every cheeseball scene with what is possibly the schmaltziest soundtrack score ever recorded which veers from embarrassingly maudlin in the dialog scenes to cheesy groovebox wannabe rocknroll in transitional scenesbr br the script introduces characters with no rhyme or reason and story beats are doled out as if with a broken ladlebr br lets not forget this is a horror film though our characters find themselves in a forest wherein lurks dr chopper and his two scary henchwomen who are supposed to be some kind of frankencreatures but look exactly like valley girls with fake blood dabbed beneath their supercut shags ive honestly seen scarier makeup on eightyearolds out trickortreating on halloweenbr br and again we get a whiff of the costume designers malodorous handiwork as valley ghoul one prances around in a pseudovictorian polyblend smock while her buddy wears a nondescript ensemble that might have been almost fashionable in less hip corners of the 1980sbr br dr chopper makes the big fashion statement though looking like a crisco cowboy who got lost in the woods on his big black harley clad from head to toe in zippered black sm leatherbr br if this sounds intriguing by all means check it out there is plenty of sidesplitting and belabored dialog like the precious elephants graveyard scene or the intellectual discourse on ginsburgbr br to be fair the cinematography is good considering what was put before the camera and the actors strive with wildly extreme results to make something from a scrap heap of clich√©s and inanities you do have to wonder if they were really really stupid or just blindly desperate not to walk off the set after catching one glimpse of the ridiculouslooking villains with their 99 cent store weapons
