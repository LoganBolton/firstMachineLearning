i enjoyed the beautiful scenery in this movie the first time i saw it when i was 9  dunderklumpen is kind of cute for kiddies in a corny way it reminded me of hrpuffinstuff on sat mornings its swedish backdrops make it easy on the eyes  dont expect older kids to be interested as the live actionanimation is way behind the times and most older kids will get boredthis is definitely an under 10 age set movie and a nice bit of memories for those of us who were little kids in 1974
