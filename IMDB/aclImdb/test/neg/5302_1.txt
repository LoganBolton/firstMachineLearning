although i think the reviewers who hated this movie have encapsulated exactly what it does wrong everything i had to add my two cents if youd like a long version of how terrible this movie is please read the review by coinlightningbr br heres the short version shameless use of the actors names to propel the plot as opposed to using their talent no one brought their a game to this blatant commercialism i guess pepsi can afford to stick an advertisement  or 40  into a movie now and a plot  that was so convoluted with rock star clich√©s that it was totally ridiculousbr br let me put it to you this way    i was thinking of waynes world the whole time i was watching this movie but i wasnt laughing anytime you try to throw in steven tyler aerosmith to help your movie plot along youve got serious problemsbr br please warn your friends and family  this movie sucks
