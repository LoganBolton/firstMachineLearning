this movie was an embarrassment ulma thurman looked like she had some kind of disease and john travolta looked like he was walking in his sleep i was expecting this to be a soso sequel to get shorty not a halfbaked remake of the exact same movie except that some of the characters have different names and clothesbr br i would not recommend this to movie to my worst enemy i feel like i was ripped off and hollywood has once again tricked me into seeing another horrible sequel  i also suffered through alien vs predatorbr br the best thing that i can say about this movie is that it has my vote for the worst movie of 2005
