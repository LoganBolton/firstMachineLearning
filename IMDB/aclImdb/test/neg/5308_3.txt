if pulp fiction and get shorty didnt exist this might be an ok filmwhen i say this i mean that nothing from this film is its own unless its another bit of terrible dialogue or a cliché full sceneall the lines like i wont say more than i have to if that from get shorty seem to appear in this rubbish sequel all the cameos like steven tylers are acted terribly and are not needed and as for christina milian man dont get me startedsadly some of the coolest actors and actresses like john travolta and uma thurman seem like they are trying to be down with the kids and hip and have nearly ruined there reputation because of this film and frankly i think the best acting is from the rock who plays alongside one of my least favourite actors vince vaughnthe man tries to be funny throughout with him taking the mickey of how apparently rappers talkcedric the entertainer and andre 3000 play another terrible double act i personally think the background actors were better than cedric and andre and the only funny part of the acting of cedricandre and the rest of there gang do is the way there trousers are down to there knees so you can clearly see there boxers and the only reason i find this funny is because lots of people actually do thatso in conclusion this film tries to be funny and fails miserably it doesnt have any new material comedy or coolness throughout as it copies every other film and finally the only reason you should see it is if you want to compare how bad it is to its brilliant predecessor get shortyoh yes i forgot to mention there is a big cliché at the end
