i rarely give ratings less than 5 but in this instance i must weigh in elmore leonard is a great writer with many wonderful complex books original characters crisp dialogue invigorating plot twists films based on his books go way back to hombre paul newman mr majestyk bronson and out of sight clooney  lopez among others even when done soso the films at least have some measure of story essence coming through this one  it is simply not a worthy addition to the catalogbr br the acting is bad i do not know why because these are very capable people here and the story is handled with stupidity the characters are rearranged the chemistry is missing the actors and actresses are miscastbr br since elmore leonard is a really great story teller i would hope that anyone who does not know his work would be dissuaded from reading his books because they saw this disappointing rendition of one of his storiesbr br the story is a sequel to get shorty if you have not seen that film do not watch this if you have seen get shorty do not proceed to thisbr br i saw be cool a few years back and tonight have been revisiting the vid the first time must not have made such a negative impression because i had forgotten how dismal this sequel wasbr br fortunately i think no less of those who appeared in this film for having done so they probably expected something more get shorty was original and great fun travolta i nearly always like but he is so much better in tarantinos pulp fiction and in the preceding get shorty he was clearly unable to enjoy whatever was going on herebr br and i hear freaky deakyanother elmore leonard book is in preproduction for 2008 release hopefully they can pull it offbr br read the books they are almost all great
