two things are always signs that youre going to be watching a bad movie br br 1  if youre instantly reminded of other movies like the terminator hardware or blade runner during the title sequence br br 2  if theres a death during a sex scene straight after the title sequencebr br theres actually a third warning sign and thats a caption indicating lazy exposition warning the poor ignorant naive audience of the dangers of corporate greed  guess what  cyborg 2 starts with a caption warning us of corporate greed in the future  followed by a title sequence that reminded me of the terminator  hardware and blade runner followed by a death during a sex scene  hey you dont suppose ill be watching a bad movie by any chance  br br as you can guess this is a bad movie  its basically a series of action scenes written around a thread bare plot of a cyborg on the run from a greedy corporate company  its badly written  directed and acted and most especially its badly lit which means its very difficult to see whats happening on screen  though im not entirely sure this is actually a bad thing  the only interest to be had is that its the film debut of angelina jolie who plays the cyborg on the run and who says the prophetic line  theyre lovely  i wonder if theyre real   which is something i ask myself whenever i see one of her movies
