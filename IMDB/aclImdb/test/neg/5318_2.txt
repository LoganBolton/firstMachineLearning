this was painful recently given away as a free dvd with a british newspaper this britishbelgian coproduction from 1977 couldve fooled me it looks ten years older than that at least is quite deservedly obscure and if you make it past the halfhour mark consider yourself a trouper the combining of animation and live action is ropey at best and downright dreadful at worst which makes you wonder why it was decided to even attempt making the film in this manner when clearly the technology wasnt really there harris is no more than a human prop and the animation is some of the most flat and lifeless ive seen with the obligatory trippy moments especially where the animation of the brainiactype subtracto character is involved that rendered countless cartoon features from the late sixties onward instantly dated the screenplay by don black provides a convincing argument for the usually resilient lyricist to stick to what he does best and the pace is so slow that even the very young will be bored as for adults stick to jonathan swifts original novel
