peter hunt started out as a very gifted film editor and got his first stab at directing when he helmed the james bond film on her majestys secret service considered by many bond fans to be the best of the series other titles in his filmography include epic scale adventure movies like gold and shout at the devil both adapted from wilbur smith novels gullivers travels is an odd one on his list of films it seems strange that a director of hunts style and expertise would choose to direct a film of this kind a halflive actionhalfanimated retelling of jonathan swifts classic satire the film looked twenty years out of date even when it was made and in all honesty it simply doesnt work and theres not a damn thing that hunt with his usual eye for fastpaced action or star richard harris who can usually enliven the most stilted of roles can do to rescue this onebr br lemuel gulliver richard harris is a brilliant medical student living in 17th century bristol his father norman shelley wants him to go to london to make his fortune but gulliver prefers the idea of receiving rather less pay but a heck of a lot more adventure as a ships surgeon aboard a ship called the antelope during a voyage the antelope is blown off course during a storm and hits a reef the ship sinks and everyone is lost apart from gulliver who finds himself washed ashore in the kingdom of lilliput when he comes round gulliver finds that the strange land where he has washed ashore is populated by incredibly small humans no taller than his toe to them he looks like a giant they persuade gulliver to help them in a war against another race of tiny people who live on an adjacent island but gulliver doesnt like being manipulated for purposes of war and devastation so he makes plans to escapebr br harris is left to carry the entire film here his first couple of scenes involve other actors but once he is shipwrecked in lilliput he spends the rest of the film striding over kneehigh sets and acting alongside his animated counterparts the idea of mixing live action and animation was not new at the time but it certainly hadnt been done a lot a few disney movies like song of the south so dear to my heart and petes dragon had tampered with the idea but it was still pretty much in its infancy gullivers travels is not an especially wellanimated film but the scenes showing interaction between harris and his cartoon costars are at least competently done occasionally the film tries to be true to its satirical origins theres one scene where we learn that lilliput has gone to war with its neighbour because of eggs   and the point seems to be that wars can begin over the most ridiculous of things but at its heart this is very much a kids film and the satirical overtones are barely dwelled upon everyone involved has done better things during their career  gullivers travels might fill an otherwise empty afternoon but apart from that it is a forgettable and underwhelming experience
