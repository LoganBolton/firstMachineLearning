cybrog 2glass shadow stars elias koteas as colton hicks rhymes with kicks a karate instructor who helps a cash jolie escape from pinwheel her creators who look to detonate her and destroy a rival company along the way billy drago and karen shepherd show up to displace the duo while jack palance is there to deliver guidance to the duo on the run one of the things that is quite shocking about the cyborg franchise is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and off beat actors in the cast the original had jeanclaude van damme and dayle haddon dont know her well she was in a bunch of 70s pornos this one has jack palance elias koteasbilly drago and angelina jolie the third one has william katt zach galligan and malcom mcdowell okay so cyborg 3s cast isnt that impressive ive never seen cyborg 3 but i did see this on scifi channel and must admit i wasnt impressed actually strike that cyborg 2 is an often lovely looking movie its shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye however cyborg 1 was the same way indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye unfortunately like the first this one doesnt have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or texture most of the ideas are taken from blade runner and max headroom so for various reasons the movie doesnt have much to offer beyond its look another aspect is the terrible acting karen shepherd and billy drago are absolutely terrible and angelina jolie isnt much better elias koteas and jack palance come off fine but seriously palance is playing a cyborg warrior and koteas is a karate instructor i guess on the positive side you cant accuse michael schroeder of not being ambitious with casting still the movie is dull and i for one lost interest in the story fifteen minutes in also why did they tie it in with cyborg anyway it has nothing to do with its predecessor which this manages to be worse thanbr br  out of 4bad
