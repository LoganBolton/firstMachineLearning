i had watched this on italian tv as a kid and recall being fond of it – in view of its mixing liveaction with animation however it was universally panned at the time…and catching up with it again after all these years i have to admit that the critics were right br br what must have seemed wondrous to a childs eyes is actually very poorly done not to mention boring for a fantasyadventure fatally both star exangry young man richard harris and director action expert hunt are illsuited to the material at least michel legrands score with lyrics provided by scriptwriter don black is serviceable – if not exactly inspired by the way a number of wellknown personalities are featured among the voice artists on this britishbelgian coproduction julian glover bessie love murray melvin robert rietty vladek sheybal graham stark and this being his last film work michael batesbr br while the essential plot points of jonathan swifts classic novel giant gulliver becomes the pawn in a war between the little people of two neighboring countries and on escaping ends up in a land of real giants do emerge here its done on a strictly kiddie level with stereotyped characters though thankfully little intrusion of the comicromantic variety – which renders the whole venture somewhat pointless outside of its intrinsically experimental nature since max and dave fleischer had already done a splendid featurelength cartoon version of the book way back in 1939
