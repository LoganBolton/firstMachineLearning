just once i would like to see koontzs work given to a decent screenwriter director and producer just oncebr br this is a good attempt by jean leclerc and chris sarandon and an even better attempt by victoria tennant but everything else is pure unadulterated garbage the screenwriter should be shot for bastardizing koontzs work this way and the directorpleasebr br the story is a wellwritten story but the screenplay is quite dull unbelievable and horribly executed the only elements which work are the performances by leclerc sarandon and tennantbr br on a personal note i really wanted this to work i adore koontzs novels but they have never given them the attention backing and talent they deserve if they put the same money into koontzs work that they shovel by the barrelsfull into kings koontz would quickly rise above but alas without powerful people who believe in his work i fear he will never get the chancebr br as an adaptation to the novel this movie was a total suckfest as a stand alone movie it wasnt that bad though extremely weak in many places with huge plot holes and terrible stiff unprofessional dialog which never should have made it to the final cut this movie failed miserably to live up to its potential had they followed the original work by koontz a bit more closely and invested a decent amount of production money this could have been a far better endeavorbr br however all i can manage to see in this is how good it could have been and wasntbr br it rates a 4310 frombr br the fiend
