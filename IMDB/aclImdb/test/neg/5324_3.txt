i actually saw the movie before i read the book when i saw the movie i was upset because i wondered why dean koontz had made such a bad bookmovie the movie was confusing and didnt have a flow at all it was choppy and made me want to throw a rock at the tv i couldnt connect with the characters at all so i didnt care about what happened to themnormally i love the characters because i can relate to their personality or problems then i read the book and loved it i often reread the book and the movie is collecting dust i wish someone would make a koontz movie that follows the plot of his books then the movies wouldnt suck so much do not watch this movie unless you need to waste money
