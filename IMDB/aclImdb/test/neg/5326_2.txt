one of the dumbest movies in the history of cinema wait i take that back this movie cant be included in any category related to cinema it belongs in categories like waste turds or similar categories ironically its even about two garbagemen the movie is men at work a lightweight crime comedy starring the estevez sheen brothers from 1990 setting aside the asinine and implausible plot line bad acting bad dialogue poorly executed stunts and slapstick continuity errors and high rate of noname actors never to be seen again all in all it was a pretty bad movie anyway at its core i mean it was the kind of movie that might be good for one thing you can watch it about 200 times learn every line and in a campy kind of way repeat them back and forth in public with your wasted friends thus securing your status as the biggest dorks in your tenth grade classbr br to make matters worse i actually submitted an imdb trivia entry along with this bad review to the movies imdb web page if only because i spotted a silly little punk music joke that apparently nobody else spotted yetabout the butthole surfer statue im so conflicted about why i should even waste my time submitting what looks like a supportive trivia note when what i really want to do is blow up emilios acting career no wait hes already done that himself thanks dude im so glad i wasted only time on this not real money for that matter can i maybe have at least one tenth of their budget anyone other than this director emilio could have made two or three much better movies with just what they spent blowing up cars carefully placing bikiniclad bimbos in the background and beating up useless extras henchmen in hazmat suits id mention emilios writing credit but it would be a stretch to call this screenplay writing  its more like crayonscrawled cartoon ideas and charlie sheen if youre reading this i assume maw must have been made during the part of your career in which you were a cokedup hookerloving hollywood brat who had not grown up yet oops sorry i guess that part of your life isnt over yet get well soon you half a man such a promising talent so wastedÂ… oh look theres that word again
