i thought i had seen this film before as the plot summary sounded familiar however when i watched it one afternoon in need of some mindlessbutamusing entertainment i didnt recognise anything  if i had seen it before i must have blocked the horror of it from my memorybr br this film is dreadful and it shows its age in fact it looks older than it is more like a mid80s moronic comedy whilst i am a fan of toilet humour and can see the funny side of many things this is comedy at its most puerile and homophobic the plot is as thin as a supermodel which wouldnt bother me if only the film were funnybr br there is only one amusing line in the whole film spoken by the character louis looks like somebody threw away a perfectly good white boy in fact louis is the only likable character and thats not saying much james and carl are the type of irritating immature men that a sensible woman would run a mile from their practical jokes about as humorous as the war in iraq the character of susan wilkins is colourless looks like julia roberts but lacks her charisma and there is zero chemistry between her and carl  though it may be unfair to blame the actress as i dont know what she could have done with such a poorly written part and the villain is neither funny nor scary nor memorablebr br there is good trash and bad trash this is trash that definitely should not be recycled
