writerdirector emilio estevez shows a definite lack of talent here with this unredeemable supposed comedy the script is completely hopeless let alone the fact that it is unoriginal and badly worked the comedy just does not work when estevez isnt using poor taste sex jokes he is borrowing used gags and redoing them very poorly you would think the teaming of estevez and brother charlie sheen would be coolbutit isntbr br the entire cast is uninspired and unfunny never managing to raise a laugh and barely coaxing a smile from their audience do yourself a favour and leave this one on the video shelfbr br thursday june 25 1992  video
