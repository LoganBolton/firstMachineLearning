this movie is a cyborg in and of itself half nonsensehalf lifetime original moviebr br as a cyborg this movie has but one objective to make you wish that you had spent the duration of the film in a dark room punching yourself in the testiclesbr br unlike many people i did not rent this movie because of angelina jolieill explain why i rented it shortly i am not a big fan of ms jolies though i will say that her performance was stellar her blank stare and robotic acting really did have me believing that she was an android hooker if anyone has a clip of her on inside the actors studio explaining how she prepared for this role please send it my way ill make sure to use it when i try james lipton for crimes against integritybr br so what drove me to rent this movie one would think that it was the hope of seeing angelina jolies nipples but it wasnt no the reason behind this rental rested solely on one of the images on the cover of the dvd that of jack palances face half of his face was robotic when i saw that i imagined legions of palances slowly marching through a fiery wasteland laying waste to any humans that were foolish enough to resist in my minds eye every member of this unholy army of palances had a red glowing eye a red glowing eye that looked at humans and saw only meat they were to be the architects of obliviona cold steely apocalypsea nightmare from which humanity would never awaken its a beautiful image that i will cherish till the end of my yearsbr br like most things in my life the actual movie did not live up to my expectations no there was only one jack palance and the only visible cybernetic enhancements that he had were located on his legs sadly those enhancements didnt really enhance anything that is unless you count walking like a polio victim as a super power at least their was a scene where jackgrinning like a triggerhappy alzheimers patientgot to shoot the hell out of some people i was waiting for him to yell im damn tired of paying too much for prescription medication unfortunately any outbursts of geriatric rage were few and far betweenbr br what the movie did have an abundance of was a poorly developed love story about a manelias koteas aka poor mans de niro and a cyborgangelina jolie aka demon spawn of john voigt oh man can the love between a romeo of flesh and a juliet of silicon ever be able to last it can if you follow jack palances simple advice you have to taste each others timebr br yeah im not sure what that means however i am sure that i do not want jack palance to be the one to explain it to me i sure as heck dont want him to show me as an experiment i suggest that you ask your significant other if heshe thinks that we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to taste each others time
