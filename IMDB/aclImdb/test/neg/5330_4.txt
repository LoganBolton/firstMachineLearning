i was duped into watching this by the many friendly reviews here boy are they way off mark to give this 9 to 10 points and call it one of the best movies of the 1990ies is just unjustifiable the big problem here is lack of pace and a paperthin plot its like slapstick on prozac everything trundles along predictably and listlessly the plot is weak to begin with  two garbage men peep on their foxy neighbour witness a murder and unravel a waste disposal conspiracy  and the movie never manages to go much further there are some amusing situations and decent acting but thats not anywhere near enough to save this jalopy of a moviebr br its simply a comedy that doesnt get its fat ass off the ground so why waste your time
