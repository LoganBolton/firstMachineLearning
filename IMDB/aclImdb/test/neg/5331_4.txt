this is one of those movies that i watch every time its on not because i like it but because its so bad i cant take my eyes off it like battlefield earth or 3000 miles to graceland the first time i watched i kept waiting and waiting and waiting to laugh and didnt get my chance until about 34 of the way through the movie when they strip the harassing cops to their undies and handcuff them in the park in a unflattering position beyond that the jokes arent funny the characters arent funny their mishaps and missteps arent funnyadd it up its not a very funny movie not even at a slapstick level and whats with the reggae soundtrack its a movie about two white garbagemen and the music is all reggae seems out of place dont it if you like a good trainwreck this is for you if you like a good comedy look elsewhere
