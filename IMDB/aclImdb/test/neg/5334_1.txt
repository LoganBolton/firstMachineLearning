try not to see this one i thought it was going to be good because im a fan of cheesy 80s films and ive enjoyed quite a bit of linnea quigleys work i was wrong i should have said no and watched gigli instead which is probably a far better film i guess my biggest problem with this film was its attempt at humor nothing about it was funny or even close to funny the acting is bad even for the queen of cheesy 80s films there is no story just random clips i guess i shouldnt hate it so much because it was just made as a fun and silly piece but i didnt have any fun and i wasnt entertained once i even had to fast forward to the ending to get through all of the crap im sorry but i dont find zombies doing aerobics funny
