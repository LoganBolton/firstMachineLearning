maureen ohara is always beautiful and appealing here she plays an actress terminally ill we dont know with whatit is a bit of a precursor to love story in that respectbr br william bendix is good as is most of the supporting cast john payne is meant to be grieving but he seems to sleepwalking the girl who plays the child he and ohara adopts does her best with a contrived plot device of course adopt an orphan she will live on after the passing of your wife its a sweet movie but it doesnt feel sincerei was hoping to be moved i was by oharas gentle performance but i dont like to feel manipulated
