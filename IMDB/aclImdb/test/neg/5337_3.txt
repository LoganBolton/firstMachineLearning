oh noes one of these attack of the japanese ghost girl movies i dont even remember how many ive seen maybe it sells but not to me not scary at all the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these also the pulling of the kid i have seen that pulled under scene so many times in so many horror movies cellphone scene is also nothing new the dramaticness of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked i mean it lacked all dramaticness ok this is for kids 1416 who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique well let me tell you theres a million of you d this is one of them 310 ive seen worse but you wont be missing anything by not seeing this
