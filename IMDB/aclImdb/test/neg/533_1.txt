as a scifi and casual angelina jolie fan i thought this obviously lowbudget movie might be worth a look maybe it had a few scenes or a storyline that would make up for all its other faults plus it might be interesting to watch angelina as she was embarking on her starbound careerbr br oh how wrong i was one thing i learned  at 18 angelina jolie couldnt act so to make her comfortable the producers cast this entire movie with people who couldnt act seeing this jack palance who can actually act decided to overact watching 10 minutes of this happen is enough to burn your eyes outbr br to the horrible acting and overacting add a nonsensical script insipid dialog bottomofthebarrel cinematography in fact add bottomofthebarrel everythingbr br the story features angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate overlords as an assassin she escapes the corporate hq with the help of her combat instructor the corporation sends bounty hunters after them stupid stuff happens the end i would tell you more but i didnt want to waste my life watching this dreckbr br i implore you  this is not worth watching its not even worth thinking about watching save yourself the pain and move on
