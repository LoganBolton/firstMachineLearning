well it is a monogram quickie from the dreaded period of the 40s when poverty row studios put out a good many horror films that are almost unimaginably dull so i was expecting the worst br br the story concerns a doctor who has been working on a way to restore life to the dead through the use of a room full of nonutilitarian electrical devices which spark nicely there is a dogs heart hanging under a bell jar and twitching fitfully which we are informed is proof that his method is perfectedbr br a brief discussion of the metaphysical implications and mention of an important plot point precede the inevitable death of a young man who is revived in a rather undramatic sequence  undramatic even with the sparks the important plot point is that a convicted murderer is being executed just at midnight which turns out to be exactly when the young man is revived it is no surprise that the young man is very different after his experience apparently amnesiac and with a strange desire to visit the haunts of the underworld and become acquainted with certain gangstersbr br its hard to explain why this all is not completely unwatchable but perhaps it suffices to say that its mildly interesting and contains several murders and a couple of interesting characters towards the end it even begins to move along with a bit of real tension and a confrontation that is downright hitchcockian spoilerbr br i have to warn of a very very bad ending a tagged on unnecessary pain in the ass sorta ending after the plot resolves rather effectivelybr br you know the sort of thing its all a dream never happened
