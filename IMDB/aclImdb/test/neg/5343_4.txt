as a writing teacher there are two ending i never allow my students to use then i woke up and then i got run over by a truck i am now going to add then i got a bump on the head i feel its utterly unfair to use these tricks to cover up a lack of imagination the whole issue of transmigration could have been handled with some intelligence and craft yet in this film they either couldnt or wouldnt do that im not saying its totally worthless but it is so predictable in its progress except for the stupid ending there are even gangsters who go to the police to get help from this guy they should have done him in immediately its just a forgettable borderline horrorsci fi film with nothing new to offer
