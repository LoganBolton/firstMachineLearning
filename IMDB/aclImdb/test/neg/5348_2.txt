so many great actors so little worth watching but with a script that misses so much of what made the book special i dont hold it against anyone on screen though flawed the book was one of grishams only that i truly liked especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town a slightly different world to a coastal urbanite such as myself i also loved the matteroffactness naturalness of what occurs in the book in the movie characters are given a nobility of personality that seemed so stilted the villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional but as with so much of joel schumachers work genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection so preachy stilted and superficial about so horrendous a tragedy i wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right
