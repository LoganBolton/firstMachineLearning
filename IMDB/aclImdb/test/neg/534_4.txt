its a kinder gentler cyborg movie with a love story awww its not as bad as it sounds the action when it is there is decent and jack palance elias koteas and angelina jolie are always dependable its the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible jean claude van damme film or is that the capper to the masters of the universe trilogy im still confused about that either way there was really no need for this movie what was there a need for angelina jolie she may play an assassin robot that can explodes midcoitus but what a way to go and even though this is her first movie she still has the presence that made her an award winner
