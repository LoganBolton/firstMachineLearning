i have not read a time to kill by john grisham and perhaps that would have helped understand the film better but perhaps not i hear this is the most faithful grisham adaption yet and if that is true i can see why so many publishers turned down the novel when grisham introduced it as his first workbr br a time to kill is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once it wants to be a suspenseful crowdpleasing thriller and at the same time a film dedicated to exploring certain social and moral questions lets face it those two types of films do not go together in hollywood which is why dead man walking had to be made independentlybr br the story involves a young lawyer named jake matthew mcconaughy out to defend a black man named carl samuel l jackson from murdering two hillbillies that brutally raped his young daughter the day before the rapists trial carl hid in a closet in the courthouse and when the rapists were brought through the building he charged out and shot both of them dead to help out with the defense jack accepts the help of a former law student sandra bullock who proves that her role in this film was totally unnecessary and put in the film only for marketing purposesbr br meanwhile one of the rapists kid brother kiefer sutherland was angered that a black man killed his brother and decided to act out a revenge all of this leads to a shooting in front of the courthouse a kidnapping a brutal beating and race riot ill admit that all of this held my attention greatly throughout the film in addition to the courtroom scenes what i later objected to was the films handling of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plotbr br the main question that the film constantly asks over and over again is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury sure they can but that doesnt mean that the man has to be acquitted in order for the trial to be fair this film however doesnt seem to think so besides that there several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences for example there is an unknown character called mickey mouse who is a member of the klan and for reasons unknown is helping the members of the defense team escape from serious dangers of the other members of the klan after bullock is kidnapped by sutherland and company and left for dead in the wilderness this unknown person comes and saves herand we never find out who he is and why he is helping out the people he should be terrorizingbr br and speaking of the sutherland characters reign of terror its amazing how witless the police and the bullock character are in stopping him throughout the film theres a scene when sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot jake as he comes out shooting one of the guards instead now youd think since there are dozens of police around it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper no such luck from what we could see no one seemed to even care that a sniper was still on the loose even after bullock was rescued by mickey mouse she never ever mentioned who her kidnapper was nor was it even questioned why was this simple the sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continual suspense although logically he should have been out of the picturebr br besides bullocks character there another thankless character he is jakes assistant played by oliver platt there seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movieto supply a number of oneliners for the audience in my opinion oneliners show a major weakness in serious films when used it demonstrates that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audiences attention and so use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining filmbr br but enough of the films many minor problems what about the films message here it is clear that carl is indeed guilty of murder we saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter the lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity etc that caused him to kill in desperation jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he recounts the rape in detail as part of his closing arguement after describing everything that took place he adds on one final linethe girl is white we then see members of the jury with tears in their eyesbr br in the very next scene a girl comes out yelling hes free hes free wait a minute do juries base their verdicts on their emotions or on the facts most of all why werent there any scenes that showed the jury deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions worn off ill tell you why they couldnt show the delibertion because no jury could acquit a man of such a crime no matter how much the defenses closing arguements touched their hearts what is the message that someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to thembr br this film should have had the courage to say that murder is not ok in this situation because in reality there would not be an acquittal but since dollars were at stake the filmmakers were more concerned about sparing the audiences feelings than they were about presenting a responsible message if people start killing as a form of revenge the makers of this film should be held responsible what a socially irresponsible film this is
