first things first  though i believe joel schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often as here downright bad the lions share of the blame for this ugly travesty of a film must go to john grisham whose novel this is based onbr br set at an undetermined point in time the 50s the 70s now the film opens with the rape and murder of a child by rednecks so caricatured that their purpose seems to be to reassure racists that at least were not that bad cut to the bad guys arriving at the courthouse when the girls father samuel l jackson fearful they will get off on some technicality guns them down in cold blood before the trial br br the setting is a deep south that probably never existed  the few black characters live in shacks and seem to pick cotton the dyedinthewool racists kiefer sutherland is a cartoon version of a klansman are laughable in their villainy the setpiece is the trial for the defence are the good guys  a milquetoast lawyer played by matthew mcconaughey as though in a coma his assistant played by sandra bullocks breasts she doesnt seem to serve any other narrative purpose and donald sutherland as the requisite drunklawyerwhosobersuptofightthegoodfight for the prosecution kevin spacey goes through the motions of being demon spawn while in the town at large crosses are burned witness are intimidated and the local citizens dont seem to care br br some of the reviews here claim the film immoral since surely samuel jackson is a killer and should trust to the forces of the law rather than get off on a feeble hearttugging piece of oratory by matthew mcconaughey to be honest objectionable though the underlying message vigilante justice is good might be everything about the movie stinks the characterizations are pitiful the acting leaden the direction plodding the screenplay and the dialogue almost verging on parody peter menzies lush 50s technicolor cinematography is pretty but derivative br br and it goes on for nearly two and a half hours br br whats left to say this is a waste of 141 minutes of anyones life it is tedious vacuous and hammy and almost as an afterthought it is morally repugnant
