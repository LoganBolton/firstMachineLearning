a time to kill is based on john grishams first novel the one he wrote before he was famous and the one that didnt skyrocket him to fame that would be accomplished by the firm thats why this movie didnt get made until much later after grisham was off churning out meaningless books with the movie dollar signs fresh in his head unlike most of those this book was actually about something it had meat it had weight and it had heartbr br but it also had a fatal flaw and this fatal flaw gets translated into the movie namely a time to kill sets you upbr br here we have a black man jackson on trial for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10yearold daughter we have an underdog lawyer mcconaughey battling the big bad system to save his client and oh by the way the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in mississippi complete with hooded kkk men burning crossesbr br in other words were supposed to sympathize with carl lee hailey were supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her were supposed to feel the injustice of a system where a racist allwhite jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge a brutal crime were supposed feel like were standing alongside the people chanting free carl leebr br but the racism issue is a smokescreen and the whole thing is contrived carl lee hailey was a vigilante yes there were mitigating circumstances for what he did but the fact remains that he wasnt innocent this would have been true no matter what his skin colour or the skin colour of the assailants of his daughter the judge the jury or anyone elsebr br and whats so heavyhanded about this film is that it paints anyone who believes carl lee should have been convicted is a racist the message seems to be that if you believe that the law shouldnt be taken into peoples own hands then you might as well be burning crosses on a lawn somewhere wearing a hoodbr br this isnt the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this and it wont be the last as a movie a time to kill stays pretty faithful to the book and the acting isnt half bad but it played the hand it had been dealt really even a good cast cant elevate bad source material
