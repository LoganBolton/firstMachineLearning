this show was rushed and relied heavily on surprise cuts to commercials when it came back from commercial the noise or surprise was something simple like a mouse this is a pure ripoff of ghost hunters and it attempts to go beyond them and fails miserably also what is with the directors log thing is this star trek it just ruins the novelty of this show which wore off quick the only reason its been watched is that people want to laugh at the pure anticlimatic nature of it they never find anything and most likely never will funnily enough they always point out something that is the thing they are hunting and guess what its the local radio stations tower light that is blinking red
