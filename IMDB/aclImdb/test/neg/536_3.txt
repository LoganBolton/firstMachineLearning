this movie stinks majorly the only reason i gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming its total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings this is by far the worse anime that came out of japan i cant believe they actually put their names on this garbage what a rip off selling this thing for 20 if you havent seen this dont bother if you have i pity you
