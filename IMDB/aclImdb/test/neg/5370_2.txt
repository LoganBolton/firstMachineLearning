this show paranormal state has an almost blairwitch project feel to it as in youre watching a documentary thats actually just a scripted movie made to look and feel like a documentarybr br my biggest problem with the show is their go to outside advisers of the warrens who were made famous for their investigations of the amityville murders which were shown to be completely fraudulent just based upon the police reports of the familys deaths such as the eldest daughter actually having been involved in the entire thing to the point of possibly even helping with some of the deaths then theres the way they constantly jump to blaming demons for everything not to mention how haughty the group is about what cases they take they dont want to help those who need it most they just want the weirdest cases that will get them the most press and attentionbr br theyre complete frauds plain and simple
