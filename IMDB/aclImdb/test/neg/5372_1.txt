when this show first aired i will admit to being intrigued by the premise and the setting with an open mind i watched the first two episodes and naturally dismissed it as being destined to run for a halfseason at most i happened to be watching ae recently and witnessed an ad for this garbage and i could barely contain my surprise i truly hope people are watching this for a laugh and not taking it seriously the characters are truly some of the most ridiculous and outright laughable on television scripted or otherwise its obviously generating ratings so i must give the creators credit for establishing and maintaining a fanbase but i seriously hope no one is watching this under any pretense of seriousness
