dear scifi channel how have you been how was your summer ive been ok but i feel like our relationship isnt the same anymore and were growing apart i dont understand why you dont love me anymore ive just finished watching your scifi channel original skeleton man and once again youve shown a blatant lack of respect for my feelings by killing off every hot girl in this movie i mean i understand that youre just in this for instant gratification all you care about is producing a movie where people get sliced and diced by a homicidal indian spiritcreaturelegendwhatever so you really dont have time to put some thought and effort into anything else  like finding a costume for skeleton man that doesnt make him like the gay lover of skeletor from heman seriously his robe looks like a satin blanket sheet and his skull is smooth as a babys behind he almost looks like a killer halloweencostumefora6yearold as he marches through the wilderness on a homicidal rampage so we throw you a bone because were not looking for oscarwinning performances intriguing plot or realistic character reactions to the situations at hand because we realize that even though michael rooker caspar van diem and all the girls are supposed to be trained special ops agents they are all mysteriously transformed into keystone kops who cant shoot or see straight whenever skeleton man appears and we also fully expect that nothing  bullets explosions electrocution nothing  can kill skeleton man until there is one minute left in the movie and we need to find a way to tie things up neatly we expect to see blood and guts but you have a knack for taking the least attractive actress in the entire cast and making her the only female who survives and quite honestly i think you do it just to antagonize me because this movie as silly as it is has the potential to be a sobaditsgood classic and just killing off all the hotties ruins everything  and forces me to lower its rating all i ask is that once just once you take my feelings into account and let the sexiest girls survive the movie please
