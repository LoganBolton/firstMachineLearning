like many this dung heap caught my eye while i was channel surfing its a horror film set in the woods it has a stupid title but hey michael rooker is in it and he has been a part of some great horror flicks i know he wouldnt steer me wrong ugh the most insulting part of this is that i actually watched it i see director johnny martin is a stuntman well this stunt simply sucks and how he got some of the actors to do this watery bowel movement is the biggest mystery of all i can understand casper van dien but shame on you mr rooker your good name in the horror community has been forever tarnished and your agent should be fired immediately im sure this nugget of fecal matter is available on dvd but if you enjoy the 99 cent menu at mcdonalds youd get more for your money there
