this may contain spoilersbr br where to start on this particular empty wasteland well it would have been nice if they actually had a plot acting talent decent dialog suspense humor hey even gratuitous sex would have helped this flick unfortunately there was only a lot of gore even that wasnt done well shooting automatic weapons and missingbr br there seemed to be no reason to attach the basic premise a native american cursed to protect the bodies of the tribe he murdered with his being tracked down by a federal special ops team who dressed in civvies most of the time involved violating one of the basic rules of conduct in a horror movie separating from the group so you can be picked off one by one youd think this team would know better especially because they are actually the third team sent to investigate the other two teams disappearing without a trace when they finally realize theyre being picked off they make one of several stands and fire their weapons only to hit the trees a whole lot tree shot scene repeats endlessly in this movie to save moneybr br when theyre not shooting trees theyre tracking this spirit who leaves no trail who knows how theyre tracking it and spouting a lot of macho bs by the way did i mention that most of this team are women interesting listening to them talk tough not very entertaining but interestingbr br all in all you can find better movies in the bargain bin at kmart
