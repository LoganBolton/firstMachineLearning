well ok ive seen wrath of the ninjabr br it isnt something that i would recommend to people who arent seriously into japanese fighting movies this is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie with a complex plot its about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 swords of sorcery i saw the subtitled version not recommended by the way its easy to miss something and i didnt really keep up with it all it had some good scenes tough but in general it wasnt much to my liking
