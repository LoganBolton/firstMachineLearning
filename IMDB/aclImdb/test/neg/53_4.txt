i dont get it the teenage leads in horror star supposedly all are devoted horror fans yet when their favorite idol conrad radzoff passes away they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful stuff with it like discodancing it around the house and throw food leftovers at it that doesnt sound like something real horror fans would do now does it im a big horror fan and i immensely idolize departed icons like vincent price peter cushing and boris karloff but it would never come to my mind to ridicule their memory no wonder conrad comes back from the dead  admittedly after a séance  to wipe them all off the face of the earth mr radzoff already wasnt known for his friendliness in life since he occasionally killed the directors that disagreed with his visions and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego even inside his tomb there are video messages to petrify possible visitors and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he also enjoys the murdering business outside his film sets horror star aka frightmare and body snatchers is a pretty lame 80s horror flick but there are a handful of cheesy  gory highlights to enjoy the film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot since no one  not even a film school student  is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually think hell get away with it and there are too many tedious moments to struggle through conrads videospeeches from beyond the grave are overly talkative and definitely undermine the tension but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasingly inventive one teenager enjoys the experience of getting cremated alive and another one jeffrey combs in one of his first roles loses his head in a delightful decapitation sequence in the absolute messiest sequence a poor girl head is crushed by a coffin writerdirector norman thaddeus vane wanted to bring homage to vintage horror cinema and he obviously how to make film look sinister the locations and scenery are great but vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with a proper continuity and editingjob the acting performances are overall decent with ferdy mayne imitating christopher lee and jeffrey combs delivering the most memorable roles horror star can hardly be called a mustsee or even a good film but its worth tracking down in case youre an admirer of enthusiastically made bhorror
