as i write this no user reviews are in yet but there are 17 votes with a 48 average so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments i didnt notice any and even if i had i dont think i could have stopped rolling my eyes for long enough to appreciate thembr br a common debate among movie buffs is whether major mistakes in science police tactics and the like so common in b movies should detract significantly from ones enjoyment i tend to fall into the yes thats a reasonable reaction camp  especially when the mistakes are central to the plot with this movie i look forward to reading how anyone can defend this mess they completely botch pretty much every aspect of military tactics and strategy police tactics weapons science folklore common sense and human behavior outside of b movies that is in short i cant think of any nontrivial thing they got rightbr br any movie would have its work cut out for it when its central premise is a supernatural spirit impervious to all small arms able to disappear into another dimension at will and yet apparently vulnerable to simply a bigger explosion they dont make ghosts like they used to combine this premise with every detail being wrong and you have a memorably bad movie
