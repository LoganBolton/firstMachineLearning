my wife and i enjoy bad science fiction movies some movies are so bad they are good mansquito was one of those that one was bad but it had some redeeming qualities it makes you wonder how a self respecting actor approaches lines like hey mansquitobr br this one is so bad it has now taken its place as our standard for bad it isnt just a bad movie it really stinks there was the coed strike force the indian that rode around in a black cloak and used a sword for crying out loud he shot down a helicopter with an arrow br br we tried to laugh at this movie but there were no points at which it didnt rise above pitiful we couldnt come up with any redeeming features except for one those were the words the endbr br there seemed to be no plot no character development and no point to the movie someone in hollywood needs to be fired
