to be honest the movie was so horrible that i loved it never in my life have a seen such a terrible movie i was in shock i mean i dont even know what to saybr br the characters couldnt even keep their own guns one minute a guy had an m16 and his friend had an mp5 then in the next scene they switched guns dont ask trust me i know my gunsand i will never understand how they got from a place that looked like vietnam to an arizona highway to my backyard and then to a chemical plant in california that is what i took from itbr br why would you be afraid of a guy in a halloween mask wearing a trash bag for a cape and shot plastic arrows at you how is that frightening i wanted to swallow arsenic halfway through the movie i love how the skeleton man randomly decided to go on a killing spree at that particular day but hey whoever made this movie should be shot in the knees and fed to a mound of fire antsbr br good day
