where to start some guy has some indian pot that hes cleaning and suddenly skeletor attacks he hits a woman in the neck with an axe she falls down but then gets up and is apparently uninjured she runs into the woods and it turns out theres the basement of a shopping center out there in the woods she meets a utility worker and skeletor attacks again luckily like any good utility worker hes got a gun and shoots at the guy doesnt work everything starts on firebr br cut to some people walking through the woods even though theyve been hiking together for some time they sit down and introduce themselves to each other wouldnt they have probably done that when they first met anyhow theyre undercover delta team members undercover i suppose because that way they dont have to pay to dress them in uniforms the cute girls are various things such as a sniper school instructor and oh i cant remember the rest it doesnt matter eventually they all take their guns out and immediately start aiming them at various things  anyhow they meet an old indian who is sitting out in the woods he wants beans you know like pork and beans he mumbles some stuff i can only assume that its the premise of the movie i relied on having heard the premise from the commercials because you cant really understand anything he saysbr br so they walk around the woods some more all the dialogue is a load of quasimilitary macho bs i mean all of it as in every single word like this reminds me of when we were in kabul or this reminds me of when we were in laos skeletor attacks again let me give you a rundown of a basic attack one of the female characters is crouched behind a tree and she aims her gun at the approaching guy on the horse for some reason she doesnt fire but yells several times for someone else then as skeletor approaches she jumps out from behind the tree so that skeletor can stick her with his spear then everybody starts shooting the bullets cause sparks to fly from the trees apparently the folks who made this movie never shot a tree with a bullet they dont make sparksbr br then casper van diem is all of a sudden driving a semitruck trying to run over skeletor he misses and the truck slides to a stop van diem is injured apparently he slid across the seat and bumped his hip on the window crank or something so he crawls out of the truck and it explodes later hes in the woods dying and everybody says a bunch of quasimilitary macho bs they meet a couple guys in the woods and blow their undercover status by immediately identifying themselves as being from the army they beat on the guys for some reason then they go awaybr br some other stuff happens people mumble the camera shakes etcbr br i think it comes to an end eventuallybr br my theory is that the scifi channel is getting a little annoyed with everyone bashing their movies so they put this out to remind us all how bad movies can really be like you think our movies are bad well you havent seen bad heres bad okay now that weve got that out of the way the rest of our movies are pretty good in comparison rightbr br well its just a theory
