this was so bad i want god to give me an extra two hours of life having had to sit through itbr br first off the acting was uniformly bad there was barely a plot unless shaggy dog story with a guy in a rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog countsbr br the editing was was all over the place and the slowmo shots of the gore red corn syrup flying through the airdoubtless flung using a spoon got irritating after the tenth time and infuriating after the hundredth timebr br i like michael rooker hes done some good work this was not good this was less than good and by that i mean that it sucked hardbr br for gods sake dont watch this movie
