one of the worst movies i saw in the 90s id often use it as a benchmark when viewing other films at least it wasnt as bad as caro diario three absolutely pointless segments all featuring the director playing himself  and hes not that interesting a whole segment about this hypochondriac going to the doctor another that features him riding around the countryside on his scooter for three interesting minutes and another fifteen torturous onesbr br the only redeeming factor was that the scooter scene was set to keith jarretts koln concert prompted me to go home and rediscover that marvelous album the best thing you can say about the directoractoregotist is that hes got great taste in music
