tandem is an odd slice in the japanese pink genreas it has the requisite sexscenes and misogynistic tone that is all but required for these types of filmsbut also throws in a disjointed dramadarkcomedy storyline that seems like itd have been better suited for a different type of film br br the film starts with two lone guys at a restauranteach daydreaming about a previous sexual encounter one is a mutual subway groping the other a pretty typical for this type of film semirape scenario the two pervs meet and start talking after one lends the other a cigarette they hang out for an evening and talk a bit about their respective sex lives the film is intercut with flashback scenes of both of the mens interactions with the women that are central in their lives the two men have a falling out and the film ends on a weird but predictable note br br i really dont know what to make of tandem it sorta comes off as a softcore odd couple type of antibuddyfilm but doesnt really explore the subjectmatter to any satisfying degree theres also not much of the typical extreme sleaziness often so prevalent in these types of filmsso i cant really figure out what the point was i also cant quite tell if the film was supposed to be funny depressing or both  i think that tandem could have had some potential as a more serious drama film with a darkcomedy edge but as a softcore sex film that tries to be too smart for its own goodit just doesnt work   cant say i hated this onebut cant say theres anything notable about it either 410
