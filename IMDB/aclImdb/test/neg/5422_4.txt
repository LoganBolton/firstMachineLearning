i bought this movie for a couple of dollars at a clearance warehouse sale one day when just looking around the cover looked pretty good in colour but the movie is bw i wish they wouldnt try to trap us with coloured covers on bw movies but its a common thing to look out forbr br when i watched it i was pleasantly surprised it turned out to be better than i expected i was disappointed that it was a bw but the effects are pretty good certainly better than say invaders from mars which has crappy effects and it is great to see john banner in something else apart from hogans heroesbr br overall this movie isnt too bad for a b grade and certainly worth the two dollars from a nostalgia point of view it isnt my favourite scifi but its not my worst either its ok
