theres not really that much wrong with crash of the moons basically its a few episodes of rocky jones space ranger merged into a film it is extremely dated however winkys treatment of vena is a good example of this one has to remember that it was geared to be shown to children in the 1950s in this respect it succeeds if you like childrens scifi from the 1950s go ahead and take a look at it youll see john banner in a presgt schultz role he does a pretty good job in it all in all id give it a 6 out of 10 not great but not bad
