i cant say i was surprised at this atrocity when i watched it a couple months or weeks ago cant remember i saw it as a two part episode of zoey 101 because thats how they showed it here in canadabr br i was incredibly annoyed at the makeover a nerd thing its just an example of how unaccepting unappreciating superficial negative biased and stereotypical the people in the entertainment business is and frankly im extremely peeved it wasnt at all funny a nerd is a stereotype and it makes people very offendedbr br secondly the people in zoey 101 dont have real problems logan has a big house he has a famous dad he has everything and zoey is rich too they never have to deal with the things that todays tweens and teens have to do deal with such as peer pressure and stereotype problems also the actors are horrific jamie lynn spears doesnt deserve to be in a television show as successful as zoey 101 what is wrong with the world she doesnt have any talent as an actor in fact shes worse than britney the chase and zoey thing was incredibly predictable i mean how could the show go on with zoey and chase dating what other problems could they possibly have except for the fact that chase doesnt get the girl he wants everything is perfect the absolute worse 48 minutes of my television watching life ever 010 and thats being generous
