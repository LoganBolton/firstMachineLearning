oh god why is it that nickelodeon has such a hard time producing even a halfdecent movie i mean this movie might have been good but it wasbr br a too short b rather superficial stereotypical and insulting to some c ultimately pointlessbr br first of all the dress up the nerd to look cool thing was very consumerist very superficial very pointless and very insulting it has the stereotypical nerdsstupid faces glasses never kissed vacations with his mom etc well maybe the reason that guy has never kissed a girl is because hes gay does that mean that all gays are nerds and whats wrong with being friends with your motherbr br the worst part by far was the ending the whole drama of the movie revolved around zoey finding out chase loved her and blah blah blah and then when chase finally decided to tell her br br a he didnt tell her in person because right as he was about to the typical distraction came along b he tried to text message her but her pda fell into a fountain and died before she got the messagebr br the endbr br how lame is that i mean why is it that cartoonists just cant change anything in the series so many of us would like to see these two get together why cant we see it i mean are the producers really that uncreative that they cant think up new problems to go with changes in the series so they have to stick with the same plot and outlines and make as many episodes as they can just using those after a while it gets dull and frustratingbr br i wanted to see some actual romance in here darn itbr br okay im done with my rant
