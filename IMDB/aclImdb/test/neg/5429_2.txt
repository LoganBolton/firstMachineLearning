this is one of crichtons best books the characters of karen ross peter elliot munro and amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting complex and fastpaced throughout this impressive novelbr br and about 998 percent of that got lost in the film seriously the screenplay and the directing were horrendous and clearly done by people who could not fathom what was good about the novel i cant fault the actors because frankly they never had a chance to make this turkey live up to crichtons original work i know good novels especially those with a science fiction edge are hard to bring to the screen in a way that lives up to the original but this may be the absolute worst disparity in quality between novel and screen adaptation ever the book is really really good the movie is just dreadful
