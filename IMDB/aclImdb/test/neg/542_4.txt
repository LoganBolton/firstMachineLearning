first of all i just wanna say that im a very big naruto fan i love the anime and the manga stories also the first movie just confirmed that naruto is all about great fun great action great story  but then came the 2nd movie i was very hyped because the first movie turned out great but it didnt satisfy me one bit the story was lame action wasnt all that great especially compared to the anime series same goes for the quality of animation i found it very poorly could the story get any lamer any  wheres the kyuubi of naruto  not once does he turn demon i mean  come on  my advice is see the series  until episode 140  then its just fillers  and then read the manga because thats still great ignore this movie and hope for something better in the futurebr br all and all i gave it a 4 just because its naruto
