this was a highlyhyped movie prior to its release but turned out to be a dud i never talked to one person who ever liked this movie i agree i didnt like it either perhaps one big reason it wasnt a box office success was that it had nothing but unappealing characters in the storybr br for awhile there  i dont know if this is still true  i hadnt any movie in which laura linney or dylan walsh played anything but annoying charactersbr br that and a stupid story make this film a big disappointment especially considering that big buildup did the filmmakers with dialog this dumb really think this was going to be a hit
