i love bad movies showgirls plan 9 from outerspace so on and this movie fits right in dont believe anyone who tells you this is good film its downright awful tim currys accent moves from german to portuguese to hungarian theres a person in a gorilla suit who is supposed to be able to communicate using a glove that interprets the apes sign language there is a scene with a killer hippo that moves around a river like a great white shark there are people hopping up and down mt kilimanjaro as if there were escalators installed on it this thing is laughably ridiculous so ridiculous i was rolling on the floor it is totally implausible i loved every minute of it
