congo is based on the bestselling novel by michael crichton which i thought lacked crichtons usual charm smart characters and punch well sorry to say but the same goes for the filmbr br heres the plotbr br greed is bad this simple morality tale cautions a megalomaniacal ceo joe don baker sends his son into the dangerous african congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitter or is it laser weapons when contact is lost with his son and the team his daughterinlaw laura linney a former cia operative and computerfreak is sent after them on her quest she is accompanied by geewhiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters including a mercenary ernie hudson a researcher with a talking gorilla dylan walsh and a a nutty indianajonestype looking for king solomons mines tim curry after some narrow escapes from surfacetoair missiles and some african wildlife they all discover that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfallbr br  the actors in this movie were not talented dylan walsh acts like a pathetic crybaby especially at the end ernie hudson is unconvincing is it no wonder he went on to star in tv films and laura linney is nothing special i think i can safely say the only talented actors in this film had very small roles joe don baker and tim curry an always enjoyable actor although sometimes scarred for life by constantly being reminded of his rocky horror picture daysbr br  this movie also had some other problems including awful direction style cheesy dialogue and a justplainboring plot which was completely hashed when compared to crichtons novelbr br  not even stan winstons creature effects could save this movie from being a disaster i am deeply disappointed in this movie there was not even a campy quality to redeem itself with it was just plain awful cheesy boring and ridiculous and proves to be one of the worst crichton booktofilm productionsbr br 25 stars br br john ulmer
