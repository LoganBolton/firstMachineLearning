id give this film a zero if i could how anyone could rate it any higher is beyond me until i saw rollerball this was my pick for worst film ever from a major studio with a real budget claiming mangler 2 or leprechaun in the hood as the worst ever isnt really saying much those are supposed to be badbr br tim currys mom must have needed surgery or something for him to agree to this nonsensical garbage im really not sure what happened here the novel was great the director frank marshall had a solid track record with alive and arachnophobia perhaps they should have changed the title to africa the cast was good and the budget was there youd think someone would have bothered to read the scriptbr br youd be better off watching battlefield earth again than wasting your time with congo makes you long for the return of mst3k
