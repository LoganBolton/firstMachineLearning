as an avid cinema goer i felt that whilst i was ranking my favourite movies i felt it only fair to rank my most hated filmsbr br im afraid i really have nothing positive to say about this movie it is in fact one of only two films that i have ever walked out on in fairness i went back and watched the movie again to give it another chance and sat through it only to wish that i should have stayed awaybr br the sad thing is the movie has a really decent cast and crewbut then even the brightest stars in hollywood cant bring a dead duck of a script to lifebr br stay awaysave yourself from this truly woeful film 110
