poorly acted and poorly directed congo unsuccessfully tries to recreate the feeling of jurassic park but the truth is the book wasnt all that great either still the movies first problem is that tim currys character was added the second problem is that the talking arm was added the main problem though is that the cast members dont create realistic characters i guarantee that this movie will not make you think that there are killer gorillas anywhere on earth also starring laura linney happy birthday laura dylan walsh ernie hudson grant heslov joe don baker james karen and bruce campbell im guessing that they dont wish to emphasize this movie in their resumes
