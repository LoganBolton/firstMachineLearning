its hard to tell if this hambrained bmovie adventure is a spoof a homage or just plain bungled but it doesnt work whichever way you look at it based on michael crichtons soso novel its a nutty mixture of lost cities giant hippos monster monkeys naff visual effects and corny dialogue the first thing that scuppers this tosh is the gorilla that can communicate in sign language and needless to say the film doesnt get any better from that point on making all this old rope somewhat worthwhile are tim curry turning in a feverish slice of ham and sporting a bizarre accent that defies identification and ernie hudson who also seems to know that this is all a load of old rubbish
