i wish it were last dumb thriller but thrillers are like that they are like children numerous illogical and often annoying they want so desperately to be taken seriously but what is there to take seriously about a childs behaviour or a thrillers plot having seen this particular child  i mean thriller  i understand why reviewers refer to it as a hitchcockian thriller they might as well have called it idiotic for thats what hitchcockian means in the movie dictionary look it up if you dont believe me even the soundtrack is oldschool hollywood which is a mistake it doesnt fit a late 70s film and makes it look phony besides how dare they steal de palmas idea of stealing from hitchcock the story is absurd scheiders wife is killed and her killers are never an issue instead first his former employers follow him around and later decide to kill him why do they decide to kill him no explanation perhaps because the fbi is a dark dark organization xfiles which is very triggerhappy about knocking off its former employees for pensionfunds reasons or perhaps because its fashionable to want to kill scheider in this movie everyone seems to be after him and while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to figure out the mystery by logically assuming that there is a major conspiracy in reality the killer is janet margolin yes the woman occupying scheiders living quarters the one that briefly hinted she was depraved why does she go after scheider at precisely a time when his wife was murdered and he is feeling paranoid  and followed by his own exemployers  and not a few years earlier or few years after the wifes murder a pure hitchcockian look it up again in the dictionary in case you forgot what it means coincidence and how about that brilliant motive of hers her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a freshofftheboat 15 yearold virgin in ny and then syphilisized by a bunch of horny jewish men one of whom  tahdah  is scheiders grandfather as a result margolin has been playing a hooker in her spare time among other things in order to kill off all the descendants of the men who so cruelly syphilisized her oncevirginal grandmother how hitchcockian look it up is that the finale then shamelessly rips off the mount rushmore scene from north by northwest except that the loveinterest is a killer and she doesnt get savedbr br the movie also offers some dubiousoffkilter dialog and some notso great acting check out the silly and obvious way in which napier follows scheider at the cemetery lets also not forget the moronic plotdevice of napier reaching for his jacket and holding his hand very suspiciously  but it wasnt a gun how brilliant napier in the tower now theres another string of illogical behavioural patterns j demme was is and always will be a director without style without flair and the man who directed philadelphia lets give him another oscar
