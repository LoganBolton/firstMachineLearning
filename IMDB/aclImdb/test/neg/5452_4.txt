aalcc informs us that 14yearolds can be pretty obnoxious and vicious to those who dont know that the film performs a public service otherwise its a lot of flashy videography with little or no reason for being i will allow that the camerawork is sometimes striking but also that it can be madly selfindulgent at other times the actors occupy screen space and screen time but do not compute as compelling human beings i suppose the email that flashes across the screen throughout means that you have to figure out which character has which moniker but i simply couldnt tell enough differences to do so and really didnt care anyway
