the basic story idea of enchanted april is excellenttwo very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an italian villa for a month to further defray costs they get two other strangers to come along what makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacationin particular showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life unfortunately this good idea is totally spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film ann harding plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous her doeeyed expression and vacant stares really make you wonder if this isnt a zombie movie or shes just meant to be an idiot and to make it worse reginald owen plays a character so obnoxious and bombastic that i was very close to turning off the filmhe was that awful and unbelievable i noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10which is very very difficult to understand sure the film has great ambiance and a good plot but these two glaringly silly performances cannot be overlooked as they undermine the rest of the picture sorry but this film was aching for a remake
