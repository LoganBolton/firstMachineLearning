i was also disappointed with this movie for starters the things that happen to him dont seem too terrible to me sorry male chauvinist pov as is pointedly said by one of the lady captors most men would pay to be in your position to which he replies but this is not my choice ok ok fair point so how bad was it really please let us know but now the kicker he does not let anyone know until after the movieend unseen not his girlfriend not is mentor not the police not anyone in stead he comes up with the brilliant plan of fckng every girl he knows so he may recognize the tattoo or something of one of his captors i thought hed just had enough unpleasant sex during the 12 days of his captivity isnt it time to take a little break from all that for me his to put it mildly ill advised actions broke the suspension of disbelief of the movie i took out a book while watching the last half hour out of the corner of my eye
