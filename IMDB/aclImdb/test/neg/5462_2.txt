i have to agree with what many of the other reviewers concluded a subject which could have been thoughtprovoking and shed light on a reversed doublestandard failed miserablybr br rape being a crime of violence and forced abusive control the scenes here were for the most part pathetic it would have been a better idea to cover short glimpses of what was happening and let the audience imagine the deed and the victims laugh with the cops when he aborted his police complaint seemed as genuine as that of the cops no awkwardness no hesitance to merely join in i dont know if this was bad acting and or bad directing but someone missed the point entirely as for his halfaed supposed search for his attackers pathetic they should have skipped most of the sex scenes  another monumental failure in themselves and had him meet colin friels when he first went to the police the story could have then been drawn forth with good dialog and the occasional flashback  and saved by the superior acting and presence colin friels  the only reason i watched this movie  brings to any project he doesbr br the only concrete revelation of this movie is it was crap
