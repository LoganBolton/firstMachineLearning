sure i like some indie films a lot actually i dont always understand them and thats okay not all of them were meant to be understood especially by mainly mainstream people like me im probably showing my ignorance but im still puzzled why book of revelation is called that i love those endofworld stories and the only thing i could see similar to the end of the world and this film was the torture it took to get through this im not talking about the subject matter perhaps ive been subdued from all the other tortureporn ive seen it was just the incredibly slow story one hour 15 minute material stretched for nearly two hours major spoilers lie ahead heteroman dancer gets abducted seduced and raped six ways from sunday or in this case 12 days by three hooded women upon his release after his somewhat distraught dancergirlfriend barely flinches other than dropping a glass after wondering which she missed more him or the cigarettes she originally sent him for upon abduction still in a state of reasonable shock he refuses to talk and she goes on to work without so much a hug as if nothing happened and he takes a well needed shower problem as much as hes tormented through the flashbacks to his uh attacks hes as equally aroused granted i havent been bound and used as a plaything but i doubt i would really be in the mood oh i forgot and how does he try and solve this crime sleep with as many women as he can to try and spot the birthmarks or tats the criminals had i see where theyre going with it Â– show a gang rape from the male pov fine twist notwithstanding you could never feel for this guy only saving grace was the good acting of the lifetimetv dancercancer instructor but even she couldnt save the film
