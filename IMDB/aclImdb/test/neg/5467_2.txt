many questions arise about the making of this film the first of which is why make a film that plays out as little more than an awkward female fantasy its one thing to leave an audience with issues to discuss about a films intent its something entirely different to go into the process of writing a script which fails to adequately address real human issues before they are rendered on the screenbr br why the outrageously melodramatic and often comical soundtrack why the excessive and frequently clunky dialogue why is the lead characters girlfriend one of the hooded abductors what purpose is there to turning the lead characters freedom from abduction into a joke by having him complete his mission this is a classic little aussie film moment resort to quirky comedy at the most inappropriate moment why so many scenes where absolutely nothing happens this accounts for approximately 15 minutes of the film which is at least 30 minutes too long why if a man is imprisoned for so many days does he not endeavor to make a serious attempt at escapebr br the director who cowrote the script has failed on many counts to deliver a satisfactory story br br dave garver australia
