while walking to buy cigarettes the professional dancer daniel tom long is abducted and forced to have kinky sex along many days by three hooded women when he is released the director of his company isabel greta scacchi has already replaced him in the play and his girlfriend gives a cold reception to him the disturbed and humiliated daniel leaves the dance company and travels obsessed to seek out the abductors daniel has sex with many women that he suspects that might be the kidnappers br br the book of revelation is a weird movie with a promising beginning that loses the initial power and becomes a sort of too long erotic soap opera or softporn chic the production is classy the cover of the dvd is awesome but the characters are not welldeveloped and the trauma of daniel seems to be excessive since most of the men would fantasize with the dreamsituation that he was submitted  to become sexual object of three sexy women the melodramatic development with the illness of isabel does not add any value to the plot the open conclusion is very disappointing and there are no explanations for the motive of the women or the title it is very clear that the screenplay about a mans feelings was written by a woman it was good to see the still beautiful greta scacchi again and her makeup in the end is impressive there is a saying in portuguese that could be translated to english as follows if the rape is inevitable relax and come daniel should have done this and spared me of watching almost two hours of a pointless story my vote is four br br title brazil o livro das revelações the book of revelations
