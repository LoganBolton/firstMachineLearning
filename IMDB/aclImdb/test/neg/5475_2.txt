my my my peter cushing and donald pleasance must have been desperate for work to have lent their talents to this turkey a horribly muddled story about satanism in modern day greece land of the minotaur aka the devils men is a misfire on moreorless every level imaginable it has precious few scares always a slight flaw for a horror movie dont you think weak performances countless scenes where characters foolishly wander off alone or turn down the opportunity to remain in the safety of a group and some rather irritating editing techniques which add nothing whatsoever to the proceedings i got prematurely excited at the prospect of cushing and pleasance working together 17 years after the flesh and the fiends  but this film isnt worth getting remotely excited about its a huge letdown and rather an embarrassment for its much worthier leadsbr br in a remote region of greece outsiders such as tourists and archaeologists keep going missing and local priest father roche donald pleasance suspects that something sinister is afoot he writes to his friend new york private eye milo kaye costas skouras asking him to fly out to greece to help him get to the bottom of the mystery in the meantime three more visitors  beth vanna reville ian nikos verlekis and tom robert behling who are all personal friends of father roche  go missing while snooping around nearby greek ruins milo eventually arrives in greece but is initially dubious about father roches beliefs that the missing people have been snatched for satanic sacrifices milo and father roche are also joined by laurie luan peters the girlfriend of missing man tom together they uncover the activities of a minoan devilworshipping cult headed by creepy carpathian exile baron corofax peter cushing these crazed cultists have been busily sacrificing their victims to a statue of the minotaur furthermore they seemingly cannot be killed by normal means so father roche has to use a variety of religious artifacts in his fight against thembr br land of the minotaur should have been much better than it actually is the plot is so wacky and improbable that it has all the hallmarks of an enjoyably goofy cultcamp favourite but the handling is just awful director costas carayiannis has no idea how to link the narrative together cohesively so the whole thing progresses like it was being made up on a daytoday basis he also has no idea how to coax convincing performances from his cast so they are left to embarrass themselves in either dreadfully hammy pleasance cushing or dreadfully amateurish skouras peters performances whats worse is that the narrative makes no sense why would father roche seek help from a private eye who is utterly flippant about his beliefs how does roche know that the sacrifices only occur during a full moon how can the minotaur statue speak why is one one of the sacrificial victims instructed during a vision to stab father roche only to herself be stabbed a few scenes later before getting a chance to carry it out and  most baffling of all  why does father roche drag milo halfway around the world to help him when all he needs is a crucifix and and some holy water to dispose of the bad guys these questions  and more  will pop into your mind during land of the minotaur but alas there are no answers to be had frustrating dumb and disappointing
