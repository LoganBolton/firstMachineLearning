this should have been a moody gritty movie which lingered in the memory as an exposition of relationship where the dominant personality only survives because the personality being dominated sees no hope of changebr br the acting was intense and skillful the dialogue worked but the movie was irritatingly ineffective too many distance shots that suggested lack of focus rather than a broader picture poor flow the first 5 minutes could have been missed out altogetherbr br i suspect that with a different edit this movie could have been compellingbr br in its current form it is flat formless and tremendously disappointing
