this could have been the best game ever but the game makers just screwed up after 3 assassinations and the ending this is a combination of prince of persia hitman gta and age of empires ii saladinbr br yes these four games mentioned above are considered to be one of the greatest games ever madebr br you combine the four and you get this game it has all the good aspects of the four games like acrobatic skills stealth assassinations open world and the history for the first 3 assassinations you feel this game is greatest but after the third things seem to get so repetitive that you only hope for the game to endbr br i have played this on a pc and the pc version is horrible with glitches and the stupid side missions are senselessbr br my advice to all this is a good game but get it either for the xbox360 or ps3 dont get it for the pcbr br lastly this game came from the creators of prince of persia surely the producer is hot but the game is not hot and it is not better than the four games mentioned above
