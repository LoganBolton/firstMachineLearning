this game was terrible i think they worked too hard on the visuals and didnt do much with the gameplay which is the most important part i mean the visuals look incredible but is the game really fun no i mean its like hey lets jump off buildings and all im doing is holding up and ax the game play just isnt there and i dont agree with what ubisoft did because they had this hot girl the producer of the game jade raymond and they were like ok weve got this hot girl lets pimp her and if you go to gaming websites youre not gonna see gameplay stuff of assassins creed youll see her face with a microphone and itll be like we interviewed jade raymond about her favorite cookies its like man shut the fk up who cares apparentlya lot of people do because they bought the game and like iti mean compare this game with super mario galaxy a wii game that really doesnt abuse the wii remote but still is very innovative and delivers in the most important part gameplay they were able to do a bit of everything with mario galaxy the graphics were still stunning the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded amazing and thats a game that deserves game of the year not assassins creed man it doesnt even deserve to even be a nominee for game of the year the hype around this game where it was like oh its the next generation of gamingreally i think not so let me get this straight here because i think the people liking this game are only liking it because theyre jade fans so ill tell you guys jade will not make out with you or anything if you love or defend this game if you want a real game on the ps3 get uncharted drakes fortune if you want a real game for the xbox 360 get call of duty 4 and a ton of other games too and if you want a real game just in all the systems get super mario galaxy i know this comment will be hated by many but seriously pressing two buttons for doing all this cool stuff is that really a fun game the only reason why other games make it more complicated is because after itll end up being more innovative and fun and this game just isnt itbr br 1310 a living hell
