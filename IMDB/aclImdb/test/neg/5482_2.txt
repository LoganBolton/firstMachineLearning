its 2 stars only because they put a lot of work in making this game look good i played plenty of good and bad games and i think this game has the dullest story i was ever forced to listen the best thing they could have done is to let you skip the conversations but no you must listen to them talking for 10 minutes and just continue doing the same things over and over again climb the building save the citizen go kill some dude its all the same ubisoft should really hire someone with some imaginationbr br im a huge fan of prince of persia series first 3 the story was good and you wanted to know what happens next all the time i dont even hate prince of persia 4 but i think anyone who was in charge of developing the story for assassins creed should be banned to write another thing for the rest of his lifebr br boring story and same missions over and over again if just one of these two things was good the game would be worth playing
