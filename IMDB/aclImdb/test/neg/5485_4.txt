this is my first almodavar film ill confess we chose it mainly because we knew this had the enticing prospect of antonio banderas in gay sex scenesbr br unfortunately that is about all that this film has to recommend it i consider myself a fairly sophisticated viewer i like european films art films and i am generally able to recognize a quality film even if it is not to my particular tastebr br but this film was a complete blank to me the plot was ridiculous the characters lifeless the box called it a hilarious comedy but i didnt laugh once loosly and awkwardly constructed with a lot of pointless dialogue i dont get this at all it seems like an amateurish effort can someone enlighten me
