i liked all the lilo and stitch movies the tv series werent that great but i put my opinions of the series aside when i watched this movie and i must say it was badbr br one thing i found disappointing was the animation yes you heard it the animation i found its quality greatly degraded since the first movie its quality was only as high as the tv series something which i did not expect at all if youre looking for eye candy dont expect anything much here also the animation failed to portray any serious moods even in the supposed sad scenes i didnt feel anything for the character another downgrade from the first moviebr br the next was the absolutely horrible voice acting i found it very very unconvincing and wondered why disney with all its riches and glory couldnt afford voice actors with real talent the voice actors skill were just as annoying as the one in the series i tolerated the one in the series because hey who wouldnt be tired out when made to voice act for so many episodes heck i dont even know how many episodes there are theoretically there are 624 but i just cant believe that however i thought that the voice acting would improve in the movie and i was put down in the face by the truth that what they could do in the series was already their bestbr br next was the horrible script it was cheesy beyond redemption and the writers just try too hard they try to put some jokes in but i just found them annoying maybe it wasnt the voice acting but the cheesy dialogues that ruined the sound section on the upside the soundtrack wasnt too bad and matched the mood quite well br br fourthly was the problem with the storyline i predicted everything and the storyline was what made the characters so unoriginal and unlikeable all of a sudden you have the aliens get new positions and responsibilities inouter space after the initial hype they realize that they actually didnt like it and miss their old life br br meanwhile the evil villain gets broken out of jail after a very action packed action scene and breaks in to jumbaas lab to steal his experiment the experiment was then cloned into 100 others and the hamster wants to conquer earth when the main characters find out they try to stop the evil hamster but gets confronted in some cheesy final showdown against the experiment and owns him in an extremely lame excuse for trying to make the series to look cool the characters then give up their new privileges and return to earth to resume their life seriously how many other movies has used that ending already the that storyline was extremely short and formulaic so dont expect too much from itbr br so disney has failed in sound graphics and storyline the only charm of the series was the original characters and how they managed to retain the feel of the characters but even that wasnt able to save the movie i tried to like it i really did but i give it a rating of 410 another disney failure
