the story is a turnofthecentury troupe of actors along with producers and theatreowners have very complicated relationships a resident playwright has written a psychological drama he wants to get a good production on stage but cant unless he convinces a pariticular reviewer to revisit the production and give a positive review if his production does not go on then the troupe will put on the doll house recently written by ibsen many different relationships among the principals are explored none of them interesting but the involvement of the characters with one another lead to giving the play by the resident playwrght a second shotbr br this movie is purely an excuse for the director and his friends to get together and put on a movie the story lines are incoherent to anyone who isnt a buddy of one of the stars the only reason i didnt leave the theatre after about a half hour is that a fat lady was resting a full meal atop her stomach at the end of my row
