i dont mind the odd artsy film but when they are larded with arcane symbolism and murky dialogue and when its obvious they were done for the filmmakers ego rather than the viewers benefit i get upset im not a stupid person yet i simply didnt understand what this film was trying to say or do film is a magnificent form of human communication why do some filmmakers use it instead for obfuscation
