while im normally a big fan of john turturros work as an actor and director illuminata is a great disappointment although the film has some charming moments overall it falls flat worst of all the film is confusing where is the movie set italy or an italian troupe in new york why bother making a historical film if it fails to convey a setting if you want to see a wellmade inspiring historical film also about theater go see tim robbins the cradle will rock this movie has many pluses including a fine performance by john turturro
