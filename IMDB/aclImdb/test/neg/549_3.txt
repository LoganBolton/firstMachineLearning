i had been delighted to find that tcm was showing this as i love the 1992 version with josie lawrence jim broadbent joan plowrightthis film had a luminous ann harding a wonderful performance by frank morgan but others acting made the film more of a farce then the wonderful unfolding that the later film reginald owens arbuthnot is painful to watch and you cant understand why his wife adores him i found out after watching the film that it was based on the stage play where the 1992 film is based on the book the original film also felt like it was a snippet of a larger piece and felt incomplete too bad it was such a letdown
