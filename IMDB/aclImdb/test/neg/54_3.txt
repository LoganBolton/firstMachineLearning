1983s frightmare is an odd little film the director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic 30s40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the thenexploding 80s slasher genre it isnt totally successful mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints and the lessthanprofessional caliber of its cast of young actors but it still has its moments mostly due to the classy performance classier than the movie deserves by the late german actor ferdinand mayne who plays an aging old time horror movie star ala vincent price named conrad ratzoff at the beginning of the movie we meet the hasbeen horror star as hes shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol conrad is a bit of a hoitytoity prima donna jerkoff just when you think he couldnt be any more unlikable the commercial director berates conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death nice huh conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die still feisty even at deaths door he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself conrad is then laid to rest in true hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket which will play personal video messages from conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respectsbr br it is at this point that the kids from the college horror movie society decide to pay conrads grave an after hours visit breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party not exactly my idea of fun but hey these are characters in an 80s horror film logic has no place here the college kids spend the evening having dinner with conrads body seated in a place of honor posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it before parking conrad and his coffin in the attic planning to return him to his crypt in the morning in the meantime mrs ratzoff distraught over the theft of her husbands body has called in a psychic friend to try and reach conrad through a seance you can pretty much figure out the rest from here since conrad wasnt a very nice guy in life its not much of a stretch to assume that he wont be any friendlier in death psychic lady makes contact with conrad and he reawakens in predictably ticked off fashion then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students ridiculously huge house picking off the young grave robbers one by one this is where the movie falls apart endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying hello is anyone there are intercut with occasional bursts of violence we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene which is the highlight of the movie before the last two survivors finally figure out way later than any semiintelligent people would have figured out the same thingbut again were in an 80s horror film that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get conrads body back to its crypt where it belongs the sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than musicthunder moans and groans howls etc that becomes severely annoying after a whilebr br i cant really recommend frightmare to anyone who didnt grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the 80s modern horror fans will doubtlessly find frightmare incredibly slow moving and goofy if you came of age in that magical decade however you may get a blast of nostalgia from frightmare fans of jeffrey reanimator combs may also want to check it out as the future dr west appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film studentsbr br i will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the eastwestdvd label paired with roy wards vault of horror and sold at dollar stores because the print quality is terrible im told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at troma which seems appropriate if youre a troma kind of person then frightmare will be right up your alley
