this film had a lot of potential  its a great story and has the potential to be very creepy but of course tim burton doesnt really do creepy films he does wacky cartoonish films and i usually like tim burtons stuff but i thought this film was really weak the best thing about the film and it is actually worth seeing just for this was the art direction  the film has an amazing intangible quality to it the script was not good it was boring in parts and confusing in other parts and there was no building of characters i never really cared that people were having their heads lopped off by a headless being i thought johnny depp had a good thing going with his approach to the character but given that the script was weak he couldnt go too far with it  and i was very irritated by the attempts at a slight accent on his and christina riccis partsbr br anyway it is sadly not a great film and not worth seeing unless you are interested in the art direction
