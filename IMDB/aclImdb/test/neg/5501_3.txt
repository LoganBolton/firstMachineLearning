several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this film first the scenery and special effects are incredible  the best and if everything else worked as well its austere presence might have made it a great filmbr br but as soon as the actors open their mouths you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your den watching a movie the story itself is full of clech√© and melodrama and the dialogue is some of the worst ive ever seen and as if that werent bad enough they made a fool out of the protagonist and in my experience you dont want to do that unless the film is a comedybr br bottom line i had a hard time getting into it and i wouldnt recommend it
