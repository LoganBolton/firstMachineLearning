the original review i had planned for this movie was perhaps a little overharsh so ill preface with the good sleepy hollow is a perfectly acceptable beerandpizza or sleepover movie the kind you watch with a good group of people when the mood is light and noones really focusing on the movie the visual elements are beautiful and it is kinda fun in parts but horror my friends it is not i made the mistake of watching it expecting something to shiver at with all the lights off if this is your intention send me a personal message and ill offer you a list of alternate recommendations thats a serious offer by the way true horror fans deserve better now my complaints complete with spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers why bother even making a movie based on a classic story if youre not even going to attempt to stay true to the sense feel tone or theme of the original listen carefully between the lines of illwritten dialogue and youll hear the slow churn of washington irving rolling over in his grave i will even accept the bigcity detective bit but ricci drawing wardinghexes around the bed come now not only is there nothing even vaguely like this in the legend of sleepy hollow but its historical bunk i dont care what neopagan axe you have to grind but in the 18th century witchcraft meant selling your soul to the devil in exchange for diabolical powers this whole fluffy whitewitch goddessworship anitharmnone approach to witchcraft dates back historically about as far as the british invasion parties interested in real oldschool pagan practices are referred to james frazers the golden bough if you dont believe me this creates such a discordant element thrown into the context of the film that the very framework of the sleepy hollow legend is shattered so we wind up with a totally different story altogether if that was burtons idea i wish hed warned us in advance also i wish hed come up with a better story than the rather pedestrian one witnessed here and he might as well have dropped the irving pretensions altogether and at any rate the movie isnt scary not once not at all the warped tree came close but was more than counterbalanced by the laughable effect of the hessians farcecomedy bellowing and finally yes i too wanted christina ricci for christmas but god clearly never meant her to be a blonde
