i cant help thinking that this is francos hamage to the marquis de sades one thousand days of sodom people in this case women abducted to serve as slaves to a privileged elite check kinky sex check torture including whipping check victims chosen at random to be killed checkbr br thank goodness franco didnt go the whole hog and introduce cinema audiences to the delights of coprology and indeed coprophagy another perversion that crops up repeatedly in de sades tediously long and disgusting sagabr br i rather hoped that this film would fall into the so bad its good category but even the acres of naked flesh and numerous sexual encounters didnt make up for the dismal dialogue dreadful acting elusive plot and  just to put the tin hat on it  dubbing and english subtitles a belt and braces approach missing from the womens costumes the alsation gave a very professional performance thoughbr br of course i could be wrong about the de sade angle after all i failed to realise that the actor playing the head warden at the prison was a transsexual i must pay more attention to the size of peoples hands in futurebr br according to another reviewer the film was banned in the uk well it clearly isnt any more though i fancy that the nippleneedling scene was cut to satisfy the censors on the dvd i watched it was only clearly visible on the spanish trailer which in case youre wondering i watched to compare it with the english onebr br the dvd also features an interview with jess franco though youll need better spanish than mine to understand it unless im much mistaken its neither dubbed nor subtitled and it points out that the person sodomising the character played by franco is ajita wilson disguised using a moustache kind of ironic given that she had had the requisite appendage surgically removed
