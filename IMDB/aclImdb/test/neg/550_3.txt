the final installment in the karate kid series is predictable poorly acted and so bad it borders on the enjoyable but not quite its just bad in this installment ralph macchios karate kid is absent already having been in one too many of the episodes the new kid played by hillary swank is the teenage granddaughter of one of mr miyogis wwii buddies her parents are recently deceased and her grandmother is unsuccessfully trying to raise this young hellion in steps mr miyogi to set things right true to formula there is a group of neofascist bullies called the alpha troopers that must be put in their place and a new karate move called the praying mantis as i said before this movie is a mess and should be avoided
