truly awful obviously an attempt to cash in on the star wars craze but theres no excuse for this insipid piece of garbage the storyline gets lost before the middle the characters are forgettable and the kid is such a nontalent that all he does is pose for the camera an alien planet they land on is actually the naval stockyards in long beach california br br this movie actually made me physically ill watching itbr br roger corman has made some good some bad movies in his career but theres no excuse for this one br br 010  imdb wont let you score a zero
