as several posters have hinted this is a sorry star wars ripoff now if youre going to rip off star wars at least do it right battlestar galactica did and there were a few other space operas that didnt do a bad job of it but this is definitely not one of them david mendenhall the juvenile lead actually isnt too bad though he goes overboard on the cute factor every so often vince edwards hasnt improved much as an actor since his ben casey days if anything hes even more wooden than he was ten the other performances are nothing to write home about either even worse are the special effects the best you can say about them is that theyre lousy its glaringly obvious that the aliens are simply actors wearing rubber masks with a little foam or latex slopped on them and the battle scenes between edwards raiders and the aliens are poorly staged and badly shot a very weak effort from roger corman skip it
