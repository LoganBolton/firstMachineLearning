it took me a few years to hunt down this title a major staple of my childhood almost every trip to the video shop id pick out space raiders and watch it three times every time my mother rented it for me it was i suppose my star warsbr br its a shame then that its such a stinker my memories were so hazy that it offered nothing in terms of nostalgia so i had to take it at face value a crew of space pirates accidentally kidnap a pretty annoying little kid and spend the rest of the movie trying to get him homebr br aimed squarely at the undertens its got unwelcome slapstick very shoddy costumes and makeup recycled special effects wobbly sets and poor acting but even with the unintentional comedy its no fun to see it as an adult where i can pick out not just the technical faults but wonder at how spectacularly the writer and director managed to botch an endless stream of nobrainer funpowerful moments that have been seen in a million other scifi movies and in the hands of anyone remotely competent should have been successfulbr br i imagine as a kid i probably found it quite empowering  there are lots of i cant do this im just a kid sure you can kiddo you just have to trytype exchanges the kid drinks beer etc but even by low budget 1983 scifi standards this ones pretty awful with a real snoozer of a finale
