if there were an epa for film then this movie would get their most sincere approval if we all recycled our stuff to this degree wed never run out of anythingbr br funny how i was reminded of this movie when i first saw starwars i the phantom menace at least lucas didnt recycle his old footagebr br this is a dud but its a nice dud cute in spots i liked when the kid said damn rocks and if you like explosions even recycled ones you will get your fillbr br actually for an obviously no budget film it makes out fairly well acting is weak but there is a little characterisation here and there story is predictable but will lead you along anyhowbr br this is an everybody chases the kid type of movie which probably will appeal mostly to younger audiences i gave this one a 2 out of 10br br i dug up my old vhs copy of this film i dont think its on dvd
