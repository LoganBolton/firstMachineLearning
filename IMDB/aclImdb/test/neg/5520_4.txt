oddly enough its fred macmurray who plays the more screwy part in this screwball comedy carole lombard shows a fine performance combining lighter moments with and undercurrent of drama and seriousnessbr br as usual fred macmurray remains a mystery to me the camera is no fan of his hes not that attractive and he doesnt have the style and panache to pull off this very cary grantlike rolebr br ralph bellamy is excellent as the kind friend coming back to life through his relationship with lombards character one can only wonder why her character wouldnt want his gentle reassuring love instead of the almost certain doom of macmurrays ineptness but thats hollywoodbr br the picture almost works but misses the mark primarily due to macmurrays performance it wouldve been lovely to see grant or even clark gable in his role lombard and bellamy are largely believable and likable macmurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him at arms length
