happy days was produced and broadcast from the mid1970s to the early 1980s and seems to get more ridiculous with age at the time of its broadcast most viewers who grew up in the 1950s were in middle age with families and the scenes at mels diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them the fonz was of course the coolest of the cool although the actor henry wrinkler to this day has never learned how to ride a motorcycle richie cunningham was the allamerican blondhaired kid who would probably be elected student body president potsie was richies best friendthe star of the show has to have a best friend i guess and ralph malph was the bumbling sidekick to the fonz if not the entire group i loved it when the fonz would beat up on poor ralph malph and there was mel the middleaged lug who ran mels diner and of course who could forget the appearance of mork was this really the 1950s ironically films produced during the 1950s such as rebel without a cause and the wild one have gotten better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show which was produced 20 years after the period it portraysbr br unfortunately the tv show happy days is not in the same league as rebel without a cause or american graffitti for that matter happy days may have captured some aspects of the 1950s with its burger diner juke boxes cool cars and tacky plaid shirts but it is more a nostalgic idealism done strictly for laughs rather than an honest portrayal american graffitti had something to say about young americans in the 1950s whereas happy days seemed more about what middleaged people of the 1970s wished the 1950s had been like the result was a kind of watered down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the 1950s happy days is at best a comedyfantasy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950s as its backdrop as pointed out by another reviewer the allamerican kid richie cunningham would probably have been chastised for befriending the likes of a dropout like fonzie and mel would probably forbid fonzie from entering his dinerbr br a quick history happy days was originally a pilot called love in the happy days that was rejected for broadcast comedy pilots that had themes concerning sex and romance that did not make it to pilot airing sometimes appeared on the infrequently broadcast show love american style which was often aired in place of baseball games that had rained out or other unexpected programming cancellations andor alterations in short love american style was a throwaway show that contained all these oneepisode comedy pilots that never made it to a slotted debut love in the happy days did appear as a love american style show sometime in the early 1970s but at the time tv executives could not foresee how a show about 1950s young people would be popular particularly during the heyday of comedy shows centering around middleaged people such as the mary tyler moore show and its subsequent spinoffs such rhoda the bob newhart show and all in the family how things have changed since now most tv sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most shows about middleaged people like the plague br br subsequently one of the young stars of love in the happy days a child actor from the andy griffith show named ron howard got the chance to star in a film about young people taking place in 1959 called american graffitti directed by the relatively unknown george lucas whose previous thx 1138 had bombed miserably at the box office even when it was premiered to movie executives again the studios could not see how a movie about young people in the 1950s could become popular because it didnt fit with what had been popular in the past although they didnt realize that much of the moviegoing audience had been young in the 1950s as everyone knows the movie was a huge hit and studio executives recognized that they had completely misjudged their audience somewhere during the theatrical run of american graffitti tv executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was a lot like american graffitti they brought it back with the original cast plus henry wrinkler as the fonz retitled it happy days and the rest is tv history as it became one of the most popular shows of the 1970sbr br happy days now seems ridiculous the characters are flat and cardboard never being more or less than what they superficially are the issues they deal with are trivial and their reactions appear mindless and even silly nowadays the character of the fonz seems to be a caricature of well the fonz was the idea to be a kind of parody of marlon brandos character in the wild one looking on the show with fresh eyes i feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the 1950s with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining instead the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick bucks this is definitely a show that has not withstood the test of time american graffitti has many of the outward appearances of happy days but it had an edge it had an honesty about the characters and their issues happy days took the look of american graffitti but failed to take its heart
