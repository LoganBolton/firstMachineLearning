the problem with making a movie like this though is that the finale the cr√®medelacreme of the movie the battle between the two soupedup ships must be done well disappointingly this scene in ironclads is obviously done completely with little model ships in an overgrown tub theres no tension little explanation of what exactly is going on and what the timeframe is of the standoffbr br the film takes quite a few liberties with the surrounding story as all true stories do when converted to a movie such as the union traitor and most notably that of betty stuart madsen a virginia bellebr br it resorts to making a possiblydecent movie involving an interesting story on the ironclads to preaching about the evils of slavery it was out of place in this historical drama and was a cheap ploy to bring in the women viewers it only succeeded in lessening the positives about the film
