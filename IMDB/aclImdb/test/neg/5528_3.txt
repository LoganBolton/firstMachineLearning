but memorable because it includes an actor i actually recognize james horan is by these types of movies standards lawrence olivier hes given some decent performances on stuff like highlander and various star treks so its kind of amusing if mildly depressing watching him degrade himself here okay yeah theres a plot horans character and his wife are fighting hes having an affair with a movie reviewer while trying to do his masterpiece film and their guest decides to enjoy the wonders of stripping but watching horan is really the only enjoyment to be found here
