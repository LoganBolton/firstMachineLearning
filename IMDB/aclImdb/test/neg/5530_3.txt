im so glad i only got this movie for 5 anime is expensive no doubt about that ive had my eye on this one for awhile and finally i saw it on sale i grabbed it immediately and took it home only to hang my head in disappointment this movie sucked ive heard people talk about how gory and violent this movie is its really not that gory or violent ive watched it three times and i think ive wasted enough of my life on this the demons get a point for being unique and kinda cool at times the sex gets a point since its almost nonstop the horny old man gets halfapoint for being horny and still having the sex drive and the main character whos name ive erased from my mind gets halfapoint for the cool design of his gun i saw major connections between this movie and demon city shinjuku both have same style animation thats obvious because of the director both have lame soundtracks which suck like the antichrist and both have terrible endings avoid this movie unless youre into anime sex
