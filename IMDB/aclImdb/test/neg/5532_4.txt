this is a very interesting acquaintance twofisted tales contains three foolish and childish episodes  genre isnt actually horror or action more like something in between wheres the suspence wheres the fun wheres the common sense definitely not in here but if you dont expect to get it you dont necessarily miss itbr br first segment is called showdown its a violent absurd western i failed to understand the whole idea of it king of the road is a stupid story starring brad pitt at the time of twofisted tales he was just a pretty face who really didnt know how to act yet luckily he learned the skill later and now hes a fantastic talented actor  one of the big ones of the younger generation story is almost ok in all of its stupidness final episode yellow is the only segment thats almost entirely successful its foolish but funny we have to thank kirk douglas for thatbr br this movie is something to watch when you sit in an easy chair and eat popcorn i should know thats what i did if you loved tales from the crypt youll love twofisted tales too because basically its all the same i understand these three episodes are actually extremely rare piece of art and very difficult to find anywhere i have the whole package on vhs but i dont think its a big privilege youll have to be a fanatic brad pitt fan to search it out otherwise dont bother its not worth the effort silly crap
