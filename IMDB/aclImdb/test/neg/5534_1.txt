i was quite excited when i saw this film in competition at the montreal film festival along with elephant and a few others i thought the issue of american gun violenceculture would be treated intelligently and in a fashion compelling for filmgoers the pressrelease promised in not so many words a red violin for the gunviolence crowd something to make us ponder our nrashootemup mindset in this countrybr br after waiting until after 915 to be seated for a 9am screening what technical difficulties they would have encountered is beyond me we were finally let into the venue to see the film on dv where did the advertised 35mm print go i think i just answered my first questionbr br the result is an abhorrent mess we get the gun in a vignette with the most unrealistic biker i have ever seen and i do know more than a few the film then lapses into irrelevant character development only because the characters are either a stereotyped b losers c stereotyped losers andor d racial caricatures it takes another 30 minutes to get to the plot movement and once we are there we wish for the inane conversations between the couples andor the bikers and pawn brokersbr br the film finds its conclusion but not without leaving any clich√© untried i didnt care for the whitetrash characters who came in contact with the gun and the depiction of the minority characters should have the naacp crying foul immediately all these people would chase after a gun because they are at the bottom of the societal trashheap and would look for an opportunity wherever it was found placing the action a level up would have at least provided some soulsearching on the part of the charactersbr br the biggest problem is the promise unfulfilled the plot outline was great in the hands of a pt anderson or gus van zandt it could have been a powerful piece but due either to bad screenplay direction or both the thing is an unmitigated mess that needs to be ignored at all costsbr br my bigger question is who at the mff thought this was competition material better bury this on showtime at 3ambr br art blose
