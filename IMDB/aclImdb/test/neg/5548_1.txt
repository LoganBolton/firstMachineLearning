well this stripped my nerves raw they got that right i first rented this movie back in the 80s when my friend opened a video store that carried every rare movie he could find he also carried all the shock horror and exploitation movies he could dig up and i went through almost of all them previously i had seen blood feast and 2000 maniacs and the wizard of gore they were gruesome especially for the time period and the wizard of gore got pretty nasty the goregore girls however was the one i remember as being the most disgustingly gorybr br i rented it on dvd a little while ago because i wanted to hear the commentary and thought it might have some cool dancing and clothes i forgot that it was made in the early 70s so fashion had kind of gone downhill by then i also realized this was a movie i didnt really need to see more than once it had amusing parts but gaaaah it was much more disgusting than i remembered im very jaded to movie gore but a couple of times i just got too grossed out and had to look away this wasnt a good choice of movie to put on dvd all crisp and cleaned up with better sound and picture quality the commentary is amusing in parts and interesting i think hg said the budget was 610000 maybe hg lewis wasnt feeling well that day but he sounded tired overall and also had the nerve to get offended when the interviewer from something wild compared him to ed wood jr sorry pal but youre not exactly martin scorsese yourselfbr br the extremely thin plot is about a series of murders of topless gogo dancers in strip clubs a cute reporter and a really unattractive private detective team up sort ofhe cant seem to stand her to try to solve the crimes henny youngman owns a strip club a bunch of really ugly murders happenbr br im going to apologize in advance because i dont want to sound like i need to lighten up but this movie was so misogynistic it ped me off more than company of men mainly because the main characters and the directors extreme dislike for females and the audience just oozes from every frame its not just the murders the highly unattractive detective goes out of his way to treat the female reporter like dog dirt at every opportunity for no apparent reason hes not exactly a threat to george clooney like i said and she still follows him around like a puppy she faints upon seeing a horribly mutilated body and he looks distastefully at her then pours cold soda from a can onto her face to wake her up later he calls the police to report the crime nono hurryshe just seems to havelost face this guy is the hero you can imagine how the other characters feel about women i could go on and on but you get the idea please note that i am making this movie sound much more politically correct and much more fun than it actually isbr br most of the cast are the type of actors you pray will never take their clothes off not too easy on the eyes so dont watch the movie just to see the nudity unless youre not too picky the gogo dancers all look like they desperately want to have the scene end so they can get their 10 or whatever the going rate hg paid them was and get their drug fix ok its not quite that bad there was one dancer that looked like she might have been a pro and also one other cool dancer with a huge afro that didnt look as miserable as the rest but still not too thrilled the only slightly entertaining things were a couple moments of brief unintentional humor such as when a policemen in charge at a murder scene angrily yells get outta here before i have you all arrested not to a bunch of reporters but to some other policeman calmly going about their work they mutter and stroll off though henny youngman is kind of funny though like lewis says he said his lines so fast that they almost needed subtitles im sure he was trying to get the whole day over in a hurry so he could get paid and get the hell out of there though he doesnt look like he minded watching some naked chicksbr br might be worth seeing just out of morbid curiosity for the era the movie was made it was probably the most gruesome thing on film at the time or if youre really big hg lewis fan and find him or lowbudget filmmaking by anyone fascinating otherwise if youve seen it once youve seen it and can move on to other disgusting but much more entertaining lowbudget movies from the early 70sthis movie doesnt even come close to say pink flamingos when it comes to the skipthepopcorn factor if youve never seen an hg lewis movie i recommend you try blood feast first instead youll have a much better timebr br
