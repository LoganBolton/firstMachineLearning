i debated quite a bit over what rating to give this one because its my least favorite herschell gordon lewis film so far other than the gruesome twosome but it has the best acting ive seen in a lewis film however we all know thats not saying much once the movie was done i was happy because it felt like i had been sitting through a 4 hour movie though it was only 82 minutes long im trying to see all of hgls films and thats probably the only reason to see this onebr br the gore is good as usual the one thing that herschell seemed to get right the acting is just as bad as usual with one exception that exception is frank kress now would i say that hes a good actor no way but hes good compared to everyone else the story is boring and flat and goes no where and by the end i didnt care what happened just so long as it ended i know this is a cult classic but i didnt enjoy it very much at all i hope you will
