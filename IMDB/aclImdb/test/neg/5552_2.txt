i love camp movies believe me and the usual technicolorian gore of gordon lewis dont bother me at all but this is just one of his most stupid movies even more than blood feast im not kidding the gore gore girls is about a mad person who kills a lot of gore  gore girls of a night club a detective and a reporter tries to find out the big secret maybe the performances here are slightly better than the usual average acting hg lewis films but that is not saying much the camera work is even dreadfulbr br but at least is kind of watchable with the go go girls acting  you going to pass a good time with it and the killings are just absurd in a very very bad way a girl is killed with a wooden hammer punching in her butt  and just dont let me talk about what it does with the nipples you going to laugh like anyone with this but the better of all this mess is a scene that i only love of its campness the gogo girl before being attacked by a lot of feminists dancing in a very american way though is important to note that this was one of the first films that got an x rating because of its violencebr br only if you want lo laugh and pass a good time but only with a lot a lot of beers
