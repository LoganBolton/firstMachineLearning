aside from frank kress who played abraham gentry an appearance by henny youngman and the last seconds of the movie there really wasnt anything particularly good about this film why it is currently rated 53 and adored by some reviewers is beyond methe film is 9944 crapand exactly what i would have expected from director hershell gordon lewis in the 1960s and 70s lewis was known for making a string of incredibly low budget exploitation films such as blood feast and monster a gogo however in recent years hes been christened the father of gore and he has many many fansfans who ignore the ineptitude of his work and only focus on how groundbreaking some of his films were but apart from the liberal use of fake blood and real guts at heart his films are pure crapand dont believe scores of 9 and 10 for his films this would be like putting a velvet elvis painting in the louvrebr br the film is about a string of very grisly murders that happen to strippers when i say gruesome its very bloody and sick for 1972though by todays standards the special effects look amazingly lame so while some very deviant and cruel murders happen in the film id rather not explain themthey are from a pretty sick mind and show a particularly sick disregard for women at least they wont nauseate you because they were done so poorly its obvious that in many cases they are cutting apart rubber dolls and mannequins but to have them doing some of the sick acts even if unrealistic is pretty nasty and shows a lot of misogynybr br the only hope in the film as the police are all idiots is a guy named abraham gentrywhose mannerisms and style of speech are very close to the stock actor david lochary from the early john waters films while his acting is bad he is so flamboyant and funny that he kept my interest he could be pretty funny and oddly this is the only film he ever made it was also odd that so many women wanted himespecially because they just didnt seem like his typebr br as for the rest of the folks in the film they are cretins and idiots who could not act in fact i was kind of hoping more would be killedthey really had it coming none of their acting was the least bit believable and apparently the director never reshot a single sceneas most of the scenes in the film were worse than any of the ones in ed woods masterpiece plan 9 from outer space in fact for many of the women in the film the only prerequisite for their appearing in the film is that they be willing to take off their clothes now i know this will sound pretty mean but most of them were incredibly unattractive and looked like drug addicts who strip to get their next fix when these ladies take off their clothes men in the crowd give them money to put it back on wowhenny youngman should have said that in the film but considering lewis budgets these were probably the best actresses he could getbr br overall a sleazy bucket of bile that manages to be worse than most of the directors other filmsand thats saying a lot its violent yet dumb antiwomen treating them like meat and things to be mutilated and is thoroughly incompetent from start to finish
