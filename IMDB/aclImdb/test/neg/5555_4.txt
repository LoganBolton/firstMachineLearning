some might remember if having seen the film juno a scene where ellen page has a moment of praise for dario argentos suspiria her favorite horror film jason batemans character then asks if shes ever seen a herschel gordon lewis film and to wit he has a copy of a movie i forget which at the moment and shows it to her at the time i saw juno i had seen suspiria and a few argento films but not lewis now i can see that its not just another one of diablo codys popculture in references but something that actually is an indicator on the tastes of the characters and maybe more subjectively how to judge them based on their tastes in other words herschel gordon lewiss reputation is maintained some many years after he ended making his gore films  and its that of a schlockmeister no more no less actually lessbr br its interesting then to take argento as a basis of comparison because both filmmakers approach at least in the case of the gore gore girls and well any given argento picture similar material where argento is extraordinarily conscious about his craft getting an audience wrapped up in whatever little story there is by the power of the movement of camera and music and style lewis takes the easy route to get at an audience which is with an immature script and putting it lightly lackluster direction the gore gore girls reveals a filmmaker who isnt interested in entertaining his audience in an actual compelling way as a horror film but as a sideshow or a brothel he cant direct actors worth a damn he lights like its a porno movie and for every one possibly clever or funny oneliner theres ten that either totally stink or are too clever by half or not clever nearly enoughbr br that being said perhaps as the best substantive thing to say about the gore gore girls a mystery movie about a detective 2nd rate sherlock holmes guy played by somewhat amusing frank kress and a newspaper reporter dummie amy farrell investigating a series of murders of gogo dancers is that it serves as the template for countless more tromastyle pictures perhaps this is faint praise however and really the best thing that can truly be said is that henny youngman take my wife please has a few scenes and steals every one of them without having to try much its sad since it could be the kind of picture that could entertain on an awesomelybad level but even on that score one may laugh more out of embarrassment for the production some of the actors ie that guy who plays the cop my god than out of some guilty pleasure enjoymentbr br even the gore itself is somewhat of a letdown at first one thinks that lewis is at least delivering on this end showing these women being murdered in crazy and vicious and exaggerated ways but with the killings it all goes on longer than necessary i dont mean this in terms of shock value for that its fine but there needs to be something else to really make it stick that showing womens faces dissected and eyes gouged is fine if youre 12 and seeing this as one of youre first horror films it becomes dare i say it dull dangerously dull for such a daring socalled moviebr br this was lewiss last film until 30 years later an apparently worthy swan song came with a sequel to a film he made earlier brought him out of his retirement from movies and job in writing books on how to make it in business however whatever experience he had coming up to this one doesnt show its not a failure but it could have been and its just simply schlock take it or leave it
