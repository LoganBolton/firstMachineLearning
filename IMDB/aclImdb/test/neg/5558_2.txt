of course all this nonsense begs the question does a genre as selfreferential as the teen comedy really need another parody movie the woeful scary movie i and ii took the formula about as far as it could go  not another teen movie really doesnt have anything either intelligent or shockingly excessive to addbr br the plot essentially based on fairyfloss teenflic shes all that walks a shaky line between parody and homage john hughes high school everything from american beauty to varsity blues is mined for references the result is ultimately an unfulfilling viewer experience the downside of giving us a carbon copy plot of shes all that is that we all know where its going anyway and if we didnt then the jokes would be meaninglessbr br theres extremely little to recommend here the token grossout scene an erupting toilet seems badly out of place here amongst all the feelgood references there are moments of humour  the song is funny enough and the odd good line is send the audiences way it stinks dont watch it
