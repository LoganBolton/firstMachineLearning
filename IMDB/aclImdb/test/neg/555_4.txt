i can accept the fact this was the next karate kid so ralph macchio can be happily retired from the series and while hillary swank is great for the rolethe plot to the movie is just dreadfulbr br mr miyagis old buddy from world war 2 dies leaving his widow to take care of her rebellious granddaughter when her parents die in an accident the girl has no discipline yet is the hero because the local rotcwhich ill explain in a minute has it out to get her you know the drillmiyagi takes her under his wing and in the end they beat the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever afterbr br its hokey its cheesy its the 90sbut thats not even the long and the short of it my first case of huh is why is there a military division in high school i thought that stuff went out in the 1960s especially in a public school as much as michael ironside kicks booty in his role as the main heel since when is military involved in a high school my next gripe is that during the prom scene the militants bungee jump to scare the crap out of peoplewhy the thing i noticed throughout all 4 movies was at the very end the heels suddenly turn face after all the nonsense they put the main character through billy in part 1 sato in part 2 kreese in part 3 this movie is no different after ned and cronies basically sabotage the senior prom blow up erics car and threaten hillary swank the whole movieironside tells them to beat her up and theyre like umno if youre gonna do pathetic face turns at least make sure the characters havent done anything too over the top such as blowing up a hot rodbr br as for the rest of the love plot between eric and hillary swankcorny but nothing to melodramatic which is a breath of fresh air from the garbage ralph macchio pulled in the first 3 moviesbr br i will say for its own movie after watching the first 3 movies i can accept it being more or less a spin offbut i cant accept the whole military thing way too uncommon for it to be taken seriously now if ironside and crew was a wrestlingfootball team and he was the coach that would have been more believablebr br ironside and morita deliver the goods swank is okthe rest are the same as anything the one highlight is when they blow up the hot rod that was cool 4 out of 10
