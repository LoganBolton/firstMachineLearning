yes absolutely dreadful and this coming from someone who loves bad movies  but theres a limit i enjoy all sorts of horrorsuspense films and have seen some wonderful work from european film makers broceliande is sadly not among those those wonderful pieces of filmmaking the camera work is worse than amateurish not the fashionable shaky mtv cameraman needs ritalin type of camera work so many filmmakers use to camouflage their lack of talent this is simply bad frame composition and terrible image composition the acting is farcical when it is not entirely twodimensional the dialogues are stilted and unnatural  even more so than your usual runofthemill horrorsuspense film delving into pseudomysticism i think that what put me off the most was the horribly choreographed fight scenes at the end of the film these were bad to the point of being ludicrous ive seen what a small budget can do and it can do wonders this was just bad filmmaking very very sad
