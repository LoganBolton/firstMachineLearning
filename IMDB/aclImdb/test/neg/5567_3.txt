in the early 00s production companies had a shortlived craze for supernatural genre movies in france after the crimson rivers and brotherhood of the wolf turned out to be hits so several movies were greenlit or saved from their directtovideo fate however france as opposed to the us uk or italy has little tradition of fantasy bmovies and it turned out quickly that samouraïs bloody mallory or the crimson rivers sequel were illadvised attempts at recreating a kind of magic that had never existed in french cinema in the first place as they flopped producers have gone back to their usual fare derivative farces or the umpteenth selfreferential tribute to french new wave by a former critic from les cahiers du cinémabr br brocéliande could only have been greenlit during this short window as it serves no other discernible purpose its your bythebook slasher movie mixed with vague mythological element and horror references and youll find bimboesque female characters a french university looking like a us campus and plot twists so lazy you dont even care because you had guessed it by yourself an hour before even before the movie startedbr br these elements make all the fun of a 70s or a 80s bmovie and you expect them in a 70s or 80s movie however were not in the 80s anymore and nobody warned director doug headline as this tribute to the slasher movie genre is nothing more than a derivative slasher movie headline himself is no rookie and has been writing as a critic about this kind of pictures since the early 80s but as a first time director he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes brocéliande a borebr br when you put together clichés from a movie subcategory and hand them to a skilled and inventive director such as wes craven or quentin tarantino you get a scream or a death proof movies that are imitations from old guilty pleasures but also magnify these clichés and add a great deal to them thats called talent and thats why you cant confuse these recent movies with their original inspirations shot decades agobr br brocéliande takes the lazy path and only reproduces the worst elements from past movies unfortunately for the male viewer the gratuitous nudity is mostly missing there are very strong similarities presumably unintentional between the plot of brocéliande and the reviled halloween 3 season of the witch as both deal with supernatural druidic evil rituals and some silly attempt at taking over the world on halloween night as even the plot of halloween 3 makes more sense than this one it means that something seriously wrong went with brocéliande
