i really wanted to like this movie because it is refreshingly different from the hordes of everyday horror movie clones and i appreciate that the filmmakers are trying for something original unfortunately the plot just didnt hold together and none of the characters were likable enough for me to really care about them or their fatesbr br visually the toybox was pretty interesting the director took a lot of somewhat risky moves like adding in little bits of flashlooking animation in parts and really cheesing up some of the special effects such as the light from a certain amulet sometimes this worked and sometimes it didnt but he deserves kudos for the attempt and the cinematography was generally of high qualitybr br unfortunately when this same approach of throwing lots of things at the wall to see what sticks was applied to the plot the results were not very good the film never really finds a tone that it likes moving schizophrenically from black comedy to family soap opera to 80s witchcraft flick to childhood nostalgia to embattledfamily slasher taken on their own bits and pieces of each of these elements work fairly well but nothing ever coheres into a satisfying whole besides that large bits of the plot are never really explained im not one who likes to have everything spoonfed to me and i like movies that leave things up to the audience to decide but the parts that are left out from the toybox just seem like they either ran out of money before they could explain them or they didnt really think things through to begin withbr br i look forward to the directors next project since i think there is a lot of talent lurking under the surface here but i cant really recommend the toybox on its own merits
