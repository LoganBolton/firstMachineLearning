i carefully checked if theres another movie named as this one and there isnt  but i really dont think we all saw the same movie  theres no way  how can you vote more than 1 for this movie  the idea of this movie lets say its acceptable oh and the acting of dan gordon chris is quite good but those are the only two things acceptable in this project the others are awful  its a very delicate word to describe the acting of the other actors the directing the so said special effects even the way that the crew was filming  i dont even like the way that the camera operators were moving to record the scenes  this may be the most miserable film ive ever seen i really dont remember a movie lower than this one maybe there is but i dont think so ehh whats done its done thats the movie and theres too late for anyone to change anything ive voted 1 but my realistic vote starts with a  minus in front
