predator island starts as six friends eric tom dahl chris dan gordon along with heather iris mcquillangrace kim iana baker  denise melissa roby get invited to spend sometime on kevins michael wrann fathers boat partying in the open sea what could go wrong with such a super sounding idea well for starters a big green meteorite could crash into the sea near your boat  an alien lifeforce could emerge from it  try to kill all of you then again thats just a ridiculously stupid idea isnt itbr br coedited written  directed by steven castle i thought predator island was crap  its a simple  straight forward as that really the script is of the worst kind you know the sort of abomination thats full of highly annoying teenage characters who do  say the most stupid things its full of clich√©s  is utterly predictable it makes nexttono sense things just suddenly happen without any build up or explanation its boring even at only 70 odd minutes  it has virtually no entertainment value whatsoever not even unintentional laugh value the film doesnt really have much of what i would call a plot theres no explanation given as to why or how this alien creature can take over peoples minds or why it can be selective in the sense that one moment the person will be normal the next when the story calls for it  with no apparent cause they suddenly get green glowing eyes  a sudden urge to turn cannibal theres not enough horror in it the socalled action scenes are pitiful  i really dont want to waste another second thinking about predator island let alone wasting my precious energy typing these wordsbr br director castle doesnt do anything to make this thing watchable  the special effects are absolutely terrible this alien creature dude wouldnt even get into a 50s scifi film the filmmakers even play some blooper footage over the end credits but this has to be the least funny collection of mistakes ever i mean they cant even get it wrong right if you know what i mean forget about any decent gore as there isnt any theres a bit of cannibalism  some intestines placed on the unfortunate actors stomach so another unfortunate actor can pick them up  pretend to eat thembr br with a supposed budget of about 150000 i have to concede that the filmmakers were working on a seriously low budget thats still no excuse for making such a poor film the whole thing looks very cheap  the acting is pretty badbr br predator island is crap im sorry but thats the way it is  i just fail to see what anyone would get out of it in my humble opinion this probably one to avoid
