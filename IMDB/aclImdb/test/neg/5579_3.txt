from the opening shot of the meteor falling towards earth you know youre in for something specialbr br this is an ultralow budget shot on video movie about a group of teens stranded on a lighthouse island with some monsters the story is unremarkable and nothing you havent seen a thousand times before the acting isnt great but isnt completely horrible however the special effects  of which there are a good deal  are laughable at best in fact if you can read this sentence chances are better than 50 that you could do a more credible job creating the video explosion and compositing effects in this movie than the filmmakersbr br the movies saving grace  if youre in the mood for a grade z turkey of a film  is that theres always something happening and it never gets boring and if you like making fun of bad movies with your friends you might just find this worth a dollar rentalbr br and i must say i appreciated the opening joke that is the dumbest name for an island ive ever heard probably the best moment in the movie
