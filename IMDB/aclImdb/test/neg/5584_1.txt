the positive reviews on this page are planted by the filmmakers and their friends this film is amateurish in terms of direction acting in fact in every aspect if the imdb are gonna allow filmmakers to dictate what is written about their films then that is a very sad thing this film has a marketable premise but it is absolutely horrifically madebr br film is subjective so everyone has their own opinion but this film is on a par with the work of ed wood but without any of the charm to think otherwise shows bad taste of the highest orderbr br this is not a personal thing i dont know anyone associated with the film im just a film lover who feels that the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate and therefore i felt the need to address the balance and give a more accurate view of the film its very poorly made and the direction is below even filmmaking by the numbers the acting is the worse ever committed to film the best thing about this film is the poster and dvd cover art beyond that its not worth the time
