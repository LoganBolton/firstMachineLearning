im sorry elo fans but i was disappointed with this concert at the cbs television city in los angeles its decent musicwise but the presentation is simply boring  bigtime most of the songs sound the same and lead singerwriter jeff lynne is about as animated as a store mannequin he has a pleasant voice but he isnt much to watch he just stands in one spot and sings for an hour and 40 minutes the songs all sound like 1970s1980s bubblegum stuff pleasant but not excitingbr br lynn is accompanied by a very pretty woman rosie vela but she isnt too animated either the only song  out of 23  that creates any excitement is the last one roll over beethoven now if only some of the other 22 songs had that excitement to them this could have been a much better concert dvd
