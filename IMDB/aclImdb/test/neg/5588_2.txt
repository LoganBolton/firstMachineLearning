wow whats this on the video rental stores shelf in front of me nothing other than a questionable sequel to 8mm it wasnt a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this moviebr br basically from the plot outline verbatim an american diplomat david huxley and his fiancée tish harrington venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute risa the entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city the mystery is solved when in the end tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and essentially later on in the story her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter endbr br i didnt like how this had nothing to do with the original 8mm at all the only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was the fact that david ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene otherwise its a totally different movie it made for a lousy love story even before the end is known which makes the ending more of a possibility because i didnt believe the words coming out of davids mouth the whole time but we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in troublebr br there were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the shocking moments of the film which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this hellish sex debauchery i counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown even the menu screen on the dvd is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the dvd seem totally provocativebr br david was no heroic person throughout the film you could guess he was the main problem long before the end the actors who played each role were all new to me which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting respect there were plot holes how did david and richard finally impress tishs father by getting the lease they wanted when david was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute there were cheesy technology moments like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a joaquin phoenix knockoff to play this character the tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete bs too because it wasnt even about a last breath nobody really dies but they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowherebut that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 34 long moviebr br go rent and maybe buy the original its one of joel schumachers better and more original films it has everything better about it from this film i wouldnt recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges
