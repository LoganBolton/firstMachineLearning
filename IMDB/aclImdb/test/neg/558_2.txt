i had been avoiding this movie for sometimebecause i viewed it as an unneccesary installment to a series that should have only had 2 parts but after reading some fairly favorable reviewsfrom some imdb watchersi spent 150 and rented it at my local video store need i go furtherwhen i saythis was a buck50 lost this movie is one of the 10 worst movies i have ever seen first offi realize that noone wanted to see a 33 year old macchio in this filmbut why couldnt they have had miyagi read a letter or something from danielsanmaybe explaining what happened to danielhell they could have at least made a quick mention of daniel or something but noand to compund the already bad scriptthey added those stupid monksi thought monks take a vow of silenceguess these yapping monks dont take their vows seriouslyhehehe the training the girl went through in the movie was hurried and stupidand the paramilitary group of young maleswere a confusing concept to say the leastthis was far from even being a martial arts moviewith the girl only fighting briefly in the final sceneand then she didnt even come close to getting hit even onceby the male fighting hergive me a breakshe would have gotten hit at least oncei guess the writers and directors thought it would be to shocking to see a girl get punched by a male in this one i could go on and onbut basicallyill end by saying that this movie was just so badeven the girl they chose wasnt nice to even look atshe was sorta butch lookingi can only think of a handful of movies that i have sit throughthat compare to just how bad this flick wasdont waste your time on this one
