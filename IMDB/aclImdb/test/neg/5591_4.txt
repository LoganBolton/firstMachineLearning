this is another one of those movies i just knew i would hate but it ended up not being as bad as one would expectbr br it has a lot of ta in it and even the dvd menu is chocked full of womens breast the first few scenes of the movie has a lot of sex and nudity and i was beginning to think there would be no story at all just exploiting nudity for the sake of making money off a popular prequel 8mmbr br as i continued to watch there was just more sex and nudity and main characters that i could care less about but then the story started to unfold and i started to see a point to it all and it was a tad betterbr br it is about a man whos fiancé is the daughter of an ambasador and they all have a promising future until nude photos of a menage a trois sex act shows up and blackmail is in the senders cards the man and his fiancé must now get to the bottom of who sent the pics and how to shut them upbr br the movie first of all is nothing to do with part 1 it doesnt even have anything to do with 8mms its about a sex video though so i can see the similarities as small as they may bebr br the acting is neither good nor bad its just nobodies playing parts anybody could do the films production value is middle of the road and its pure drama yawnbr br i did enjoy going along for the ride getting to the bottom of the blackmailers motives i was anticipating answers which is way more than i could say for the first one which i consider garbage this movie has some nice twists too which are always welcomedbr br its not great and it is very slow started but it does ultimately entertain i wasnt on the edge of my seat and i wont rave to my friends that this is a must see but hey if you watch a lot of movies and always seek something new this might entertain you for 90 minutes
