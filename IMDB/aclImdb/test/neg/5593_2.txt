why was this film made what were the creators of this thinking the first 8mm film at least had a plot that made sense and was potentially interesting the first film was about the snuff film industry this sequel is about hold on the porno industry yes as if the snuff film industry an industry in which people are supposedly killed on film for entertainment were at all in the same league with the adult film industry an industry in which people film other people engaging in unstimulated sex acts and situations for eroticism the idea alone should warn you about how poorly conceived the idea for this film alone is it isnt helped by a lack of plot character acting direction script logic theme or even sound design this is a remarkably boring film that never once held my attention literally nothing works why would a mystery thriller film about the porno industry involving assassination and betrayal work anyway i dont have much of an interest in adult films but i certainly have watched them before why would somebody make a film about the evils of it and that they would make it in a sequel to a film about snuff movies i dont even know if there is an industry involved in snuff film making but i hope it doesnt the idea of a snuff film alone is horrific and only people who are truly sick and bad would be a part of it i dont think that the adult film industry revolves around murder and torture im pretty sure that a lot of people make pornographic films for good intentions rather than to hurt and kill people it is never okay to hurt another human being the adult film industry isnt about hurting people its about creating films that are to me a diversion and a waste of time what is this film trying to say it doesnt work
