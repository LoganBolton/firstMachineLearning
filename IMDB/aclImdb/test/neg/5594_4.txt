first off the first thing that came to my mind after i finished this film last night was why the title of 8mm 2 because i saw the first one obviously and what did this have to do with the first movies plot the only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porno industry and that wasnt even needed in the plot because after you see the ending that i will not spoil it just didnt make any sensebr br a diplomat and his fianc√©e are in hungary and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area shes very attractive so when they see her at a club they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy threesome but things get extremely intense when the diplomat is mailed pictures of them all having the affair fearing that it might go public and jeopardize his career they pay off the guy who sent the pictures the diplomat freaks out and kills the guy leading into a murder case he and his fiacee decide to find the girl they had the affair with but things just get deeper and darker as they go further into what they got themselves intobr br what could have been an alright thriller turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie which was sad like i said the title really has nothing to do with the first one so dont fall for it its just a sexual thriller that makes no sense but its good for those nights alone because quite frankly this is one of those films where its so close to porn that it might as well be labeled as soft corebr br 410
