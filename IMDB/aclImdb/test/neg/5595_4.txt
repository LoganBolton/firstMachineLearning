1st watched 292008 4 out of 10dirjs cardone sexual political thriller that doesnt really succeed in any of these areas very well except early on where there are some interesting softcore scenes the movie starts off portraying a couple exploring their sexual fantasies amidst their work environments or wherever and whatever suits their fancy the couple takes an excursion to a retreat and bathhouse where they run into a woman thats willing to be a part of a threesome and fulfill some of their fantasies at this point we only know that this couple is well off but we dont know until they return that the fiancé is part of a welltodo political family the man hopes to be on the rise to the point of possibly getting a congressional seat after the marriage they then receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit pictures of their encounter at the bath house and their qwest begins as to how and why they were filmed who sent the package what they want and how to clear their names before any of this gets out this qwest becomes an obsession that leads them deeper into seedier worlds and takes a lot of their time to the point where their friends  family wonder what theyre doing all day and why they look rundown all the time this movie is interesting at times but drifts into ridiculousness as they personally seek out the problem instead of getting the police involved early on because of their pride this mistake of course keeps the movie going the performances are fine despite the noname cast but the lunacy of the situation overrides and the movie starts to become hohum about ½ the way through and of course they throw in a twist at the end that defies and challenges everything that happened prioras is the norm these days when they dont know what else to do to spice up the movie this doesnt help this movie one bit though
