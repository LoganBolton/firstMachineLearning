after seeing the movie in a class of mine and having a talk with the filmmaker i found out exactly why the film bombed the way it did the creators of the movie had no intention to call the film 8mm 2 originally the film was called the velvet side of hell but was changed at the last minute by sony pictures to 8mm 2 without letting the filmmakers have any say in the matter by doing that it screwed them out of theatrical releases and doomed it to a straight to video release with minimal advertisingbr br again this is from the filmmakers mouths not mine so i really cant say what is truth and what is hypebr br if you look at the film as velvet side of hell it isnt that bad it isnt great but it is not god awful it would basically just be a bmovie that likes to show boobs but as a sequel to 8mm the film fails terribly
