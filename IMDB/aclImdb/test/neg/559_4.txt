i thought this movie was going to be a disgrace to the series after all part 3 didnt measure up to part 2 and this one doesnt have daniel sawn miyagis humour wasnt quite as witty in this one as in part 3 but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watchingbr br the girls part was pretty good shes a lost teenager who needs direction i find the plot a little hard to believe that the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of mr miyagi a man she just met of course he was a friend of her brotherbr br i did appreciate the monastery one might think from some of my other reviews that i wouldnt have liked the dancing monks but i thought it was amusing it showed that they know how to have some fun now if these were monks in ancient china dancing to popmusic that would have been another matterbr br probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldnt kill a bug miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid nations trying to destroy each other is stupid but having respect for all life is not stupid miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as wellbr br i give this movie a 4 out of 10 sure there were some things i liked about it it wasnt as funny as part three and no character could ever live up to sato in part 2 this movie has no rewatch value i cant imagine watching it again but it is worth seeing once
