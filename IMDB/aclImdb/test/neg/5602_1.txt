decoteau has to be one of the worst directors working today in any genre and it has nothing to do with his movies usually containing homoerotism and having guys run around in their matching boxer briefs remember anyone in tight black underwear is satanic and evil and want to suck out your bloodsoul such deep symbolism here i just sat through the sisterhood to give him his fair shakes i try to watch every horror movie i can and this one had barbara from beyond reanimator crampton in it i had previously been sucked in to the world of decoteau thanks to linnea quigley adrienne barbeau and several other actresses i likebr br lemme tell you what about the sisterhood like the other reviewer pointed out the supposed plot involves lesbian vampires on a college campus but never has a parade of hot young babes actresses if you want running around dressed in bras panties and bikinis been so boring the movie has no plot no gore no nudity and the dialog is ridiculous and seems like they made it up as they go along parts are put in slowmotion and repeated many times to push the running time up about ten minutes of this one consists of characters just walking around on campus oh the excitement that looks more like a hotel resort than any college ive ever been to and the acting is the absolute worst the only thing these girls do well is lean forward and bend over to show off their bodies the cast were so devoid of talent that id be shocked to see any of them get a oneday walkon role on passions in the future ditto for the guys yeah decoteau squeezed more hot guys in underwear in this one too guys who should be in some kmart brochure instead of trying to act do these people actually have to audition or just show up in daves office and take their clothes off i think the answer is obviousbr br i am willing to give any movie a chance if 1 its intelligently written well directed original and competently acted or hell even ambitious and stylish or 2 it is chock full of gore nudity assorted trashiness andor its unintentionally hilarious david decoteaus movies deliver none of that and they do it on betterthanusual production values for directtovideo flicks what a waste so what is the appeal especially with the advent of porn of the soft and hardcore variety thats easily accessible to anyone with a computer i simply cannot answer thatbr br decoteau is a gay horror director and could use his resources to put a unique spin on the genre instead he produces mindnumbing drivel without an ounce of talent or intelligence shining through ironically when you think about it his films are anything but progay they actually make homosexuality seem seedy secretive and sinister the obviously gay characters in his films are always trying to corrupt seduce andor kill off the innocent sexuallyconfused leads theres no shading here to make things interesting the protagonists are naive and seldom prove themselves to be strong assertive or confident in who they are i would understand this plotting if jerry falwell fred phelps or dr laura starting making directtovideo horror films but from a gay director it just goes to show that he puts almost no thought into these beefcake cheesefests
