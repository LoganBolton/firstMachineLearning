i watched this out of curiosity i enjoyed stargate sg1 and ive watched many of the other tv shows and movies that the principal characters have worked onbr br my expectations werent high so i was surprised to be so monstrously disappointedbr br the acting throughout is appalling and the script is worse br br zero research into the bad science that is spouted throughout the movie or into martial arts which several cast members engage in throughout the movie despite clearly having no martial arts training baton twirling does not a warrior make training makes the already implausible plot even less credible the same weapon carried by michael shanks when shot at the side of a mountain causes extreme damage but when shot indoors at the wall made of wicker creates a small fireworks effect without damaging the wicker structure  ok i suppose michael shanks fans will be sued to seeing that in stargate sg1 where a staff weapon creates either a surface burn on a main character or blasts a hole in a section of castle wall as required but still a bad cgi snake god eats one of the faithful in the way a dog would eat  snakes just dont behave like thatbr br the basic premise of an amazonian warrior cult on a distant planet is silly at best matriarchal societies have always been based on a lack of understanding that men are required in the process of propagating the species  for instance the picts who didnt figure out the role of men in sexual reproduction until the ninth century  at which time the balance of power moved from the women to the men they carry technological weapons and demonstrate some knowledge of science  particularly of medicine so the idea that a matriarchal society could exist with this level of scientific knowledge is based purely on the original authors wet dream of course the few references to stellar science made in this movie demonstrate that the author knew nothing about that either except for a few keywords that he must have heard in other movies still it could have been done better  like she in 1965 for instance which showed matriarchal society with a certain reverence far more believably and even after 45 years it seems fresher than this fetid exercise in stupidity marching a few women around in armour pouting aggressively and spitting out their lines like a kiddie looking for a fight in a nightclub come on then ill do ya style seems to be oversimplifying the complexities of a matriarchal culturebr br the cultural references are so simple  all hail the snake mother pretty much sums it all up even the tiniest hamlet shows more cultural variation br br there is nothing clever thoughtprovoking interesting visually exciting or remotely entertaining about this movie the soundtrack is of similar qualitybr br i can only assume that the few overlycharitable positive reviews this movie has received are from blinkered michael shanks fans who will give a thumbs up to anything hes involved in dont be fooled low budgets are not a reason for a film to fail  cheap b movies can be brilliant this isnt one of them and theres no reason to inflict this movie on yourself
