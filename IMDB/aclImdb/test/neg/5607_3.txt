rutger hower fans dont be fooled  he only plays a cameo in this movie and thats it this movie loses an extra point for that scam i think rutger hower has a total of about 2 very short scenes and 2 very short voiceoversbr br the female lead for this film is way above this poor material in looks and talentshes great this movie is a dog and shes wasted on it the story is of a lawyer hoping for that partnership one day at the firm getting suckered into having to cart the boss niece across country they have several encounters on the road with various oddballs and that is the vehicle for a variety of skits and the dude that played napoleon dynamite is thrown in the mix as a side character for good measurebr br this is a roadtrip where extreme circumstances put our repressed hero to the test and he slowly winds up loosening up a little bit by the end of the movie ah isnt love grand yadda yaddabr br only watch this film if you want to see a hot chick be annoying to a dork in a truck for an hour and half
