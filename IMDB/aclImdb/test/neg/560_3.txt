young spinster who doesnt associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day nervous and overlypolite to hide her own sexual insecurities she is most pleased when the boy makes himself to home in her guest bedroombut not so happy when he begins sneaking out the window at night sandy dennis is not a hapless actress but why she was attracted to these sadsack roles i guess well never know based on a book by richard miles and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could get this lurid material not only attracted dennis but also director robert altman whose work is static at best the narrative seems almost a sexreversal of the collector a tag which may have sold the filmrights but which doesnt turn out to be a good idea cinematically even the films best sequence dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner doesnt quite come off with sandy acting both ill and indignant whose idea was this plan michael burns is quite good as the kid who uses this frumpy pastysick woman just for her comfy digs but hes handled too bashfully by altman with lots of strategicallyplaced towels and fleshcolored undies altman clearly wasnt ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point sandy dennis has a handful of very good scenes she doesnt chatter away mindlessly here she thinks before she speaks and shes alarmingly careful in her actions unfortunately the role itself is a bummer with an apparent slide into mental deterioration which seems to happen offscreen as such the abrupt finale is maddening and the overall results tepid 12 from
