rutger hauer helps along a film that basically can be summed up in the young person finding themselves category and rather obviously so so it needs a lot of helpbr br the beginning holds a lot more promise of a film that could turn into michael clayton or stranger than fiction its too bad because i really got hooked into the beginning then like the opening soundtrack it went from great and intriguing to basically nowherebr br its fun enough with plenty of curiosities and interesting characters acted well im sure that will be enough for many people the problem is it all feels contrived and empty which ironically is supposed to be the main discovery for the characters self realization not the film itself its not a self aware film but that the character is supposed to recognize his own life is contrived and empty
