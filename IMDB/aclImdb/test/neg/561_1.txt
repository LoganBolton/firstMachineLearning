the screenplay is the worst part of this film as it lurches from one premise to the next missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible this film is confusing because the audience doesnt know what the story is i had no problem with the lowproduction values and the acting wasnt great but this is telly so it was fine i dont mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take but having such a nonsensical screenplay is completely unnecessary did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash avoid this at all costsbr br the prologue in particular was so poorly written it needed a voiceover to fill in all the details that had been left out the prologue was rushed it wasnt clear what was happening ie the russian revolution was reduced to some riots are happening in petersburg with the next scene being soldiers arresting them i know the basic history of the revolution so i could fill in the details those pesky communists the prologue is best ignoredbr br this could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is it sets up this premise in the asylum it could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film no gone the film assumes she is who she says she is even though there is still no empirical evidence it sets up a melodramatic romance a love so strong itll believe anything she says okay a soppy romance no because it makes no sense the love interest seems like a crazed and incidentally sleazy lunatic bursting out in wild gestures this also doesnt work because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end they never got married and she returned to america the love story collapses despite there being plenty of love scenes i was never convinced of the reason that they were in love i find romcom romances more convincing despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that theyve even spent any time with each otherbr br it could have been a thrillertype thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is and she struggles to prove her identity no the court case is summed up rather than dealt with the bizarre voice over comes back again to fill in the details of a better filmbr br the funniest thing to consider is what really happened anna anderson was a loony who went to america and married another loony and they did crazy things together throughout her life she had bouts of lunatic behaviour none of this in the film either theres a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a one flew over the cuckoos nexttwelve monkeystype informant thankfully she vanishes having brought nothing to the story
