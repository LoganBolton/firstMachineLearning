another film to punish us for the crime of enjoying pulp fictionbr br if you like watching people get killed by machine gun fire for an hour and a half thisll probably fit the bill fans of the debut episode of aeon flux wherein the title character slays literally thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers singlehandedly will really go for itbr br otherwise its not exactly a clever movie in fact all it is is an excuse for a bunch of young people to act rude and shoot people sometimes an entire scene goes by and the only thing that happens is you guessed it someone gets shot or to spice things up twenty people get shot first theyre just sitting there the next minute theyre sitting there dead yahoobr br rough plot a young american goes to paris an american in paris get it hires a prostitute the ethereal julie delpy gets in touch with some old french buddies one of which has aids they plan and attempt a bank heist of course movie convention states that no bank robberies on film go off wo a hitch and this hitch takes up about threequarters of the running time its like dog day afternoon without the sidney lumets wit patience or humanity while at the bank things go wrong surprise and the parisian with aids goes wacko with his uzi several hundred times no spoilers here but suffice to say that youre at such an emotional distance from these characters that its not likely youll care who lives and who dies by the end of the filmbr br some have called it stylish perhaps it is but its someone elses style its a movie thats already been done and killing zoe is trapped by convention nowhere in the course of the movie does the director roger avary cowinner of the pulp fiction screenplay oscar do anything really original stylish funky or outrageous unless you consider the fact that no movie that has taken place inside a bank has had such a high body count there isnt anything else to set this one apart from the multitude
