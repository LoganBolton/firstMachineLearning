what an atrocity i am not one to demand total verisimilitude from a movie but the plot and screenplay of killing zoe are so artless that i found myself wincing through the entire mercifully short ninety minutes of the filmbr br readers of these reviews will by now have figured out the plot zoe a call girl who falls in love with american safecracker zed is also an employee at the bank that zed will help rob in a highstakes bastille day heistbr br the film strains ones credibility from the getgo zed and zoes night of magic is highly prosaic and zoes claims to have experienced the orgasm of a lifetime would seem to reflect the screenwriters lingering teenage fantasies more than any actual onscreen chemistry zeds complete indifference when his friend eric throws zoe out of the hotel room hardly sets the stage for their later strong attachmentbr br in act two erics band of bohemiansdrugaddled losers leading a marginal life of petty crimeprepare for their big heist with a night on the town here roger avarys main goal seems to be to prove that he knows something about drugs a secondary thread involves convincing us by endless repetition that eric is really really glad to see his old friend zed again really glad erics devilmaycare overthetop flamboyance and affection for zed isnt even remotely believablecheck out for example his phony bemusement at discovering a dead cat in his apartment building development of the characters who will accompany us through the rest of the film is an afterthoughtbr br the heist is a disasterunderstandable since the plan is laughable and the criminals are complete amateurs this is where avary continues to pay tribute to his idol quentin tarantino by showing that he can be more violent than violent in reality though hes just more boring than boring to build up the excitement there is an extra security guard hidden inside the main safe this was boring in video games and its boring nowbr br zoe is taken hostage during the heist but despite our expectation that shell play a pivotal role she just sits pretty or more precisely avary fails to do anything with her in literally the last five minutes she springs to life breaks the hostage situation and saves the grateful but still dazed zed from suffering any consequences of his crime why she doesnt mind his involvement in the crimeor why she gives a damn about him at allis impossible to tell after all shes had no chance to see that hes any more decent than the rest of the gangbr br throughout the dialogue is stilted and phony much of it is in french as a native speaker i can certify that it doesnt ring even remotely true erics sugarysweet discourse rapidly alternating with toughguy boasting is meant to be at turns charming and scary but is instead just grating meanwhile his scaredycat accomplices are more scoobydoo than thomas crown when eric is gunned down in a ludicrous example of excessive force we can all breathe a sigh of relief like the bank hostages we will soon be freed from this miserable ordeal
