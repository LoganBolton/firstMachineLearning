let freedom ring was probably made with the best of intentions but it sends out a curious mixed message in the final productbr br the folks at a western town where the railroad is coming through are overwhelmed by the arrival of immigrant railroad workers working on the railroad being financed by robber baron edward arnold there are a few ranchers and farmers whose land stands in the railroads path and these folks are dealt with summarily by arnolds hired men one man who wont give in is lionel barrymore whose son is coming home from harvard a lawyer and ready to take up the ranchers causebr br only nelson eddy decides the best way to fight is to go zorro on the bad guys but other than charles butterworth no one knows hes the wasp a very interesting choice of names by the way br br what arnolds done is used the tried and true methods of the political bosses of the east getting the immigrants to vote nelsons idea is simple if the immigrants only knew the truth about what a bad guy arnold is theyll vote with the original settlers and knock out the alien urban political machine in their midst he kidnaps newspaper editor raymond walburn and takes him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributedbr br the railroad workers are a real mixed bunch of immigrants not the irish working west or the chinese working east as history has it its a real united nations working on arnolds railroad the workers are kept in line by foreman victor mclaglen and nelson has the unenviable task of beating some sense into him like john wayne did in the quiet manbr br of all the films that starred jeanette and nelson and they certainly have come down in history as a duo this was the worst of what they did at mgm nelson is about to be hanged along with barrymore for crimes that are undefined at best but certainly nothing worth being hung for and virginia bruce who plays the nelsons girlfriend saves the day with a rendition of my country tis of thee that the immigrants join in with in the face of a revolt by his paid for immigrant voters arnold quite rationally packs up and leaves town to build his railroad somewhere elsebr br i kid you not thats the ending here just what is the message vote with the settlers and lose your jobs with arnold but somehow youll get by here br br i do wonder some times if 20 years from after the incidents of this film take place and the town as settled into a sleepy backwater of the west while some towns where the railroad has come through that are now cities that the good citizens of that town havent rethought about what nelson eddy did if they did theyre probably running him out on a railbr br nelson is of course in good voice and has a variety of concert and popular pieces to sing including a ballad to the immigrants written by sigmund romberg where else but here the song is a heartfelt tribute from an immigrant who did make good in his adopted country too bad it didnt have a better venuebr br the almost platinum blonde virginia bruce im sure is dubbed here and im sure jeanette macdonald was just as happy she wasnt accompanying nelson on this trip west
