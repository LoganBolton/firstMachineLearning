the man with bogarts face sets it self up to mine the viewers nostalgia for the late 30slate 40s film era it fails miserably for several reasons first sacchi while looking reasonably like bogart and even speaking like him on occassion and using his mannerisms completely lacks any of bogarts charisma or acting ability this is really apparent whenever sacchi is not clearly imitating a scene from one of bogarts films second the film does not have the first rate character actors bogart was able to work with there are no peter lorres or sydney greenstreets in this one folks sure we are treated to performances by victor buaeno olivia hussey and george raft amongst others but they just arent of the same caliber or arent given enough screen time or are miscast third the attempts at modern humor all fall through all of the underwear jokes having marlowe almost never remove that damn hat and trench coat even though bogart would have etc just arent funny and really pull down this film fourth ive never heard a goofier theme song this side of mitchell finally the films false reverence for bogart and other classic actors work is truly irritating bogart almost never played a straight hero on those occasions he was a hero he played complicated characters this movie makes bogart out to be a triggerhappy moralistic dogooder while this may have been true about some film characters bogarts characters rarely fit that bill its movies like this that make people unexposed to the cinema of the past think that all of it is hokey good guy beats the bad guys and gets the girl crap with low production values
