as im listening to my parents watch this after i gave up 10 minutes into the film they have absolutely no idea what is going on when charles dickens stared into the camera i half expected him to turn into a demon yes he looked like one unfortunately that didnt happenbr br this movie had various reasons i did not finish it one it was unbearably slow i mean seriously it was sloww you can only understand 10 of what is said and the characters were poorly introducedbr br if you have an english accent and you like a lottt of talking no action terrible acting cheesy laughs and the same musicsound effects played over and over and over then this is the movie for youbr br 110  completely horriblebr br avoid at all costs
