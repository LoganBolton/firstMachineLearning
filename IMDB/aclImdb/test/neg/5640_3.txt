its no wonder this was free with the mail on sunday slow going poor acting and filming camera flare near start of movie is not even artistic  straight to video but not in this case why not recoup some of your film production costs by releasing it free with a uk sunday newspaper at least this way you get a captive audience and recover some costsbr br i have not given this film a 1 out of 10 due to the effort to pull some old actors out their shell it was nice to see some old faces vanessa redgravethis ant no blow Â–up but vinnie jones as a lead and i think he was better in gone in 60 seconds when he did not speakbr br this film is dropping in ratings every dayi think this will find its true mark at the 34 out of 10in the very near future
