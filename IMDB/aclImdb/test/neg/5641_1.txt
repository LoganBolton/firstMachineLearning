the only riddle in this film was how it ever got made the british film industry needs to make films people actually want to watch and not look to get taxpayers money ala bbc to keep luvvies in their life style they have been accustomed to with doing nothing for itbr br the film was every thing wrong with british films it relied on stereotypes it had to be about a london were people were either posh and corrupt gangsters luvvies or gawd blimey jellied eel types the story script was just pathetically weak to the extent when the police man pulled out his phone and the ring tone was the sweeney  theme i just expected it the whole film was a happy shopper sweeney  minder rip offbr br the priceless manuscript i noted got left behind and lost on a few occasions and is something even i with my limited street wiseness wouldnt carry around in my breast pocket every where to the beach and fights etc saying that vinnie jones is likable which is about the only thing in the film poor blokebr br when derek jacobi walked into the water at the end because he was dickens oh my god what a load of crap and i am being positive here
