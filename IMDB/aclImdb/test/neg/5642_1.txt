it doesnt surprise me that the makers of this hopeless movie couldnt find a uk distributor and then had to release it as a free dvd with a sunday newspaper the distributors could clearly see what the filmmakers and the sunday newspaper couldnt that this was one movie that just wasnt going to recoup its costsbr br since its a thriller about riddles it would have helped if theyd picked a lead actor who could enunciate properly rather than the mumbling vinnie jones who appears to pronounce riddle as riell and it would have helped if the dialogue hadnt been swamped by noisy locations or scenes flooded with distracting and inappropriate music the plot is ludicrous the lost charles dickens story supposedly helps our hero solve a series of modern murders but so would a copy of herges adventures of tintin since the link between dickens and jones is more nonexistent than tenuous and we have the ridiculous premise that a wouldbe investigative journalist who lays his hands on a previously undiscovered dickens manuscript would take several days to read it just so that flashbacks to dickens can continue to be played throughout the movie as if they had some connection to it which they dont i mean if you found a new dickens manuscript wouldnt you just go somewhere quiet and read it  the film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become mandatory since the sixth sense but in this case it doesnt so much surprise you as insult your intelligence if the film is suddenly going to turn supernatural at the twelfth hour then revealing that vinnie jones is a robot might have been more acceptable it might not have seemed so turgid if the film had been stylish but it isnt and in several places it appears decidedly amateur theres a scene where a table is laid with a 60s jumpcut technique but they havent made sure that the person actually laying the table is completely out of frame between the cuts consequently you can see things changing at the edge of frame when youre really supposed to be watching things changing at the centre of frame a good rule in moviemaking is if you dont understand how to do a technique then try something elsebr br the real riddle is why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie in the first place
