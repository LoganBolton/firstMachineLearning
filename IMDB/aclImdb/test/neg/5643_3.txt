i could not believe the original rating i found when i looked up this film 95 unfortunately it looks like i am not alonebr br the film is slow and boring really one of the sad things is that if the film had been given a realistic rating of around 5 or 6 then the expectation would not have been so highbr br unfortunately this was not the case so when watching the film and seeing the poor story and acting i am left giving it a 310 scorebr br vinnie jones is superb in lock stock and also snatch and he plays a great hard man however he should stick to this role its a bit like when stallone and schwarzenegger have done comedy films they just dont workbr br neither can he play lead actor he plays better as supporting or otherwise when he plays lead his acting talents are too in view and shown up as not really very good mean machine is another good example of this
