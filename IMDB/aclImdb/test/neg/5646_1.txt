ever notice how so many really bad films attract so many 1010 votes not much of a riddle how that happens but this is not much of a film there are two ways of looking at it being given away in the mail on sundaybr br 1 its free so you cant complain about it to much 2 its free so it cant be much goodbr br my vote is number 2 the free dvd in the sunday papers things is a recent trend and some great old movies have been given away theyre ones that have been out for ages and have made most of the money theyll ever make so its a case of anything else is a bonus its the last stop for old films not the first for new ones so you can guess how bad this must be to skip tv and dvd rentalbr br the plus points are that vinnie jones does try hard and derek jacobi is good as dickens the minus points are a longer list trying isnt the same as succeeding for poor vinnie and jacobis other tramp character is talkative ham thats gone off the story is very weak the dickens story does not have anything to do with the films murders and feels like another movie slapped onto the script to make people think its a british dan brown without the religion the supporting cast are either there for the money vanessa redgrave must be really hard up or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers it is also very very long for what it isbr br vinnie taking his priceless dickens story with him in his jacket pocket everywhere is good for a couple of laughs but thats it not funny and very not good even for free
