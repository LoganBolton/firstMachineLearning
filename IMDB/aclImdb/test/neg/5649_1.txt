what more can i add this is without doubt one of the worst films ive ever seen terrible acting a daft script tediously slow pace  even visible microphones dangling from the top of the screen i could go on but i really cant be bothered i watched this for 90 minutes before the sense of losing the will to live became too great for mebr br i can only assume that the first set of comments and votes were from people associated with the promotion of this insult to british filmmakingbr br and worst still i had to buy the mail on sunday to get it  the only reason the dvd hasnt now been redeployed as a coaster is that it now takes pride of place in my top 10 worst films ever collectionbr br definitely one to be avoided
