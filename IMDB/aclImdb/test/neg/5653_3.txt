miranda cosgrove is known for her debut in school of rock with jack black and her role as megan in the show drake and josh and she has become a fan favorite amongst the nickelodeon public so it isnt a surprise that dan schneider would create a show just for her unfortunately it ends up being as bad as if not worse than the amanda showbr br icarly is about three friends carly sam and freddie who have become idols in the junior high community through a webcam show called icarly carly and sam are the hosts and freddie shoots and puts it up on the internet carly also has an older brother named spencer acted by the hilarious jerry trainor who is known for his work in drake and josh as crazy stevebr br well let me tell you this dont believe the 83 out of 10 this show received because it is pathetic in nearly every aspect dan schneider probably went through about 5 minutes of studying teenage interests because all i see is him saying ipod iphone ihome aha teenagers love anything beginning with i and a majority of gigs that were used in drake and josh if not then they are just really dry and forced jokes that dont even count on a generousity chuckle such as you want me to turn up the ac to 60 degrees no we want you to turn it up to 60 pickles not only that but if you look closely nearly all the sets in the shows were used in drake and josh and neds declassified that were simply spitandpolished with random stuff to try and make it look differentbr br the scenes where the show is showing a broadcast of the icarly network is just as terrible as the entire series itself the dialogue in them is atrociously bad which may be accepted by some since it is just two friends playing around in front of a camera but whats the deal with the really odd humorless antics they do like random dancing and it just gets worse from therebr br in terms of acting miranda and jennette arent at their best by far nathan kress who played freddie isnt believable at times but he does an okay job the person who really steals the show is the humorous prowess of jerry trainor who fits in his protective older brother role very well and his wideeyed loudmouthed acting can make for some pretty funny segments too bad they arent frequent because that might have given the show an extra star in my opinionbr br dan schneider must have made this show for the sole purpose of giving miranda cosgrove her own cableborn playground to hop around and spew unfunny jokes and pathetic cuecard lines in every direction because everyone else has exceptional talent buried underneath the poorlydone script and weightless acting dan schneider did a great job with drake and josh so its a real disappointment that icarly is such a failure jerry trainors acting saved this show from a 1 out of 10 rating but he alone cant save icarly from being as horrible as it is
