first of all id like to say i am a teenager so this is all marketed towards me and i can safely say that icarly very poor programing and the fact that its accepted among both genders baffles me it contains some of the worst attempts at comedy ive ever witnessed with mediocre acting to boot the supposed humor within the show is all based on saying someones lines again with poor sarcasm poor sarcasm saying bad oneliners and well you get the picture also i should mention that i do still watch spongebob which i know ill get a negative backlash for but thats quality programming with some honestly funny moments in it less we forget something icarlys missing wit the shows about a young girl carly putting on a webshow with her friends which i can say is without a doubt a nicer version of the internet thats fine but the shows justwell not funny at all as previously stated if this is what childrens programming has come to today parents show them something thats actually funny spongebob or roccos modern life would workbr br also compared to its brothering show drake  josh its terrible which was implied seriously please watch something worthwhile even for a childrens show its poor
