i watched the halloween episodeoh my god i wanted to die the acting was just awful the lines were uttered with absolutely no conviction its a bad idea for a show as well i mean who would watch some web show like that in real life miranda cosgrove was great in a supporting role in drake and josh but doesnt have the force of character to anchor her own show im even more upset because her leaving is a major reason why drake and josh ended she was approached with her own showshe jumped ship on drake and josh they then decided that maybe they would do a thing with drake and josh moving to college thereby explaining the loss of meagan as a character but drake had already had thoughts of moving on to bigger and better things and he figured if miranda did it why couldnt he the best part of the show was the theme song a catchy good tune in a mire of mediocrity of course drake bell was dubbing mirandas voice for the whole thing and wrote the tune
