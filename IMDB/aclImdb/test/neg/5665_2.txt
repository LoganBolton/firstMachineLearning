out of boredom and vast curiosity i decided to check this show out today since my four year old niece loves it i should have known that it was a show that only a four year old could like the show was pretty badbr br first of all the show just wasnt funny the laugh track went off at the most inappropriate times which was very annoying especially since none of the jokes were funny the laugh track went off at some point when the one kid whos the cameraman said im going to go polish my lense how the hell is that funny the parts in it like meat drumming that were supposed to be funny was just stupid to anyone whos over the age of elevenbr br now i have a feeling that four year olds are not the target audience however since i have a four year old niece who watches it this sort of thing concerned me while i was watching it it doesnt show very good behavior in the episode i was watching it shows sam stealing carlys sandwich and pushing her down to the ground just so carly can stand up and do the same thing back to her i would not want to see my niece acting that rude i also dont like the idea of two young girls having a web show where they give out personal information if this was real there would be freaks all over herbr br this show would probably be good and funny to someone whos eleven or younger but anyone older than that just stay away from it ill give this two stars since i guess i can see how it can be funny to a kid
