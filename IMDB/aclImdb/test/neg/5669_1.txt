if you think hannah montana or the suite life are at the bottom of tween sitcoms then youve obviously never watched icarly icarly is without a doubt the worst show ive ever seen from the lifeless acting to the low budget sets the show reeks of cheapness like last weeks chinese takeout left to simmer in your overheated carbr br the show revolves around a pretty perky and supposed to be funny girl named carly as she and her friends make a live web show called icarly carly lives alone with her older brother who seriously needs some counseling or something because hes a few cells short of a brainbr br the plots of the shows are highly ludicrous and unbearably annoying but having to watch carly and her friend sam do their little icarly showwithininashow is even worse they basically show weird pictures and stick things up their nose as the laughtrack plays over and over i mean seriously every two seconds the laugh track seems to come on for no reasonbr br so whats the point of this review you may ask just to ridicule icarly well yeah but im also warning you to beware of this show because seriously if i had to choose between watching icarly and barney no questions about it id choose barney
