i loved the first 15 minutes and i loved some of the dialogue in the tribunalwhich proved to be the best showcase for the directors aheadofitstime method acting techniquebut this movie ultimately disappoints even when viewed purely as a metaphor of the oppressoroppressed dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the us government and its more disobedient citizens it still lacks punch and believability and ultimately left me looking at my watch hoping the obvious ending would happen alreadybr br and for the record despite rampant rumors to the contrary this movie has never been banned in the us i cant comment on the rumors of uk censorship but im suspicious hollywood refused to distribute it after its initial film festival showing and i am more than willing to believe the nixon government had some influence on this decision however the fact that it never appeared on american television is merely a reflection of this mediums rather careful and advertisingdriven fashion of doing business as for the present you can have your very own copy of the dvd delivered to your door via amazon in a few days
