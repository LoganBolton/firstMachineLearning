i no words no words can describe this i will try for the sake of those few brave people who stick knives into their toasters after watching this showbr br this cosgrove person her acting is like watching a female gorilla dance upon the nest of highly agitated insects perhaps i exaggerate however i have a feeling that the description fits a regular day of writing this showbr br the characters in this repulsive pile of raw sewage are as useless as a small piece of space rock that flies into the sun on any day of the week though heart attacks have not been experienced while watching them act like fools on the cheaply built sets i have no doubt that it will happen eventuallybr br the main plot of this belches loudly into the faces of the actors is that of a foolish girl who hosts a live weekly webcast on the creatively titled icarlycom with her brainless friends one of which owns equipment that the producers of this show probably couldnt afford her legal guardian is some kind of moron who is apparently her older brotherbr br i havent watched all of this show for fear of developing cancer or perhaps a cold but some of the plot points i have seen involve the brother getting stuck in an elevator the doorman of the apartment almost dieing and the worlds fattest priest coming for a visit no reallybr br avoid this if you are over the age of unborn or if you have a history of joining mysterious cults due to mental trauma if you do decide to watch it laugh when the laughtrack tells you to as this will drown out the repetitive noise that will eventually put you in a coma if you listen to it for too long br br the show receives a one star rating because the imdb inexplicably has not adopted the use of negative numbers
