look ive practically lost all hope in nickelodeon after watching their newest hit the naked brothers band show and icarly is no exception if you havent noticed icarly is now the 1 hit tween sitcom on television right now after hearing this i decided to watch a few episodes myself to see what the hype was about i have one word to describe this show in generaleffortless i cannot believe that dan schneider would go this low and make something this crappy its horrible let me give you the detailsbr br the icarly cast starts out with a girl by the name of carly shay played by miranda cosgrove carly unfortunately throughout the episodes doesnt really have a personality so to speak of i guess shes supposed to be the average girl in the showbecause a lot of people have an army veteran for a dad an artist for a brother and a popular teen web show taped and produced with thousands of dollars of equipment and to say the most about miranda her acting is pathetic she sounds like a 3 year old girl with tourettes syndrome on a sugarhigh half the time br br next we have sam puckettgood god where do they get these names played by jennette mccurdy sam is the cohost of carlys web showwait a minute if sam hosts the show with carly shouldnt the show be called icarly and sam i bet sam feels like shes been ripped offsam is supposed to be the bully in the castyeah because every girl bully wears girly skintight shirts and pants with blonde hair extentions she also i think is supposed to be a tomboy too i would find this a little funny but its her cliché puns that ruin it the give me a bucket of fried chicken pun is overused way too much give this girl a script and give her a coffee because dont get me wrong jennettes acting is okay but throughout half the episodes she looks like shes about ready to fall asleep br br next we have freddie benson played by nathan kress freddie is the technical producer for carly and sams show theres not much to say about freddie other than the fact that hes a techno geek and has a crush on carly which never works out here we go again with the clichés does it not stop nathans acting is also okay but seems to get excessive sometimes hes too boring br br lastly and my most favorite we have spencer shay played by jerry trainor let me make this perfectly clear if it werent for him this dirt cluster of a show would be mud spencer is the one who keeps the show alive spencer is the older brother of carly if you had a little 5 year old who was both on a caffeine high and constipated you would have this character summed up spencer also earns money from being an artisthmmm i wonder you would think that a professional artist would make promising sculptures yeah i just love sarcasm his art is pretty much utter crap i mean what kind of sculpture name is merry sniffmus what thats about as much creativity as a hillary clinton speech on drugs its stupid br br the plot settings and morals are effortless bags of poop these shows are now telling kids that stealing lying and being an asshole to your parents is a good thing if these are the kinds of awful crappy shows that theyre throwing at kids these days then i dont want to take part in watching any of them this is biggest piece of crap ive ever watched on tv bar none nickelodeon im through with you end of story 110
