beats me how people can describe this adolescent exercise as film noir true theres a gun  a bottle  a dame  the lead is a private eye but that aint what makes the genre folks this thing plays like reheated tv cop show stuff  lots of bloody beating  lousy continuity  with a dash of chinatown memories thrown in pretty hard to watch beyond the first 10 minutes you want contemporary feel watch anything by john dahl
