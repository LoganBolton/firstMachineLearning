this show was an amazing fresh  innovative idea in the 70s when it first aired the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant but things dropped off after that by 1990 the show was not really funny anymore and its continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is todaybr br its truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen the writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad  if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guesthosts this show probably wouldnt still be on the air i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that handselected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity i felt i must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success as it is now the show is just awful i cant believe its still on the air
