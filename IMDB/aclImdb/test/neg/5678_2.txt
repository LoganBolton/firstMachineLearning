i was a huge snl fan back in the days of chevy chase john belushi dan ackroyd gilda radner and many other memorable stars but every time ive tried to watch it in the past more than ten years ive been very disappointed and sometimes even disgusted with it ten years ago i believed the show couldnt possibly survive since it had become so utterly bereft of the sort of humor i could understand and yet it kept plugging along which ive always found dismaying wondering how in the world anyone could possibly find its lame humor at all funny whenever ive tuned in over the past decade ive never once been glad that i did indeed ive always been annoyed at myself for staying up and wasting my time for me the absolute low point came several years ago when a popular young male actor i liked a lot was the guest host at one point that night he played a big star perhaps himself and in the skit the character mongo i think played by chris kattan again i think ended up in the backseat of a car with him what followed was mongo being forced up and down and up and down on the actors lap with him screaming hysterically as he was presumably sodomized the audience was laughing their heads off and im shaking my head amazed that they could find that remotely funny amazed that nbc would even broadcast such a thing in the years since then ive repeatedly tried to approach the show with an open mind hoping that it might regain the sly sense of humor i adored for so many years but up until just a week ago for me it hasnt done so not even close one exception during the 2008 presidential campaign i thought that tina fey was fantastic and she was the one performer who kept me tuning in but those sarah palin skits while hysterical were still not enough to save the rest of the 90 minutes and i would always regret not turning it off as soon as i heard the familiar its saturday night
