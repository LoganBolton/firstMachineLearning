first i have to say that i dont like since fiction movies at all so much but there are some movies i liked really this is one of the others  ive the same opinion like some mostothers here the film is still going on in my back but the few effects are really not enough to watch the whole timei think what they have done well are the animated sceneries with 3 suns and 4 moons but its the only i liked there are no intelligent dialogs are there but its a great film for everybody who loves lara croft or some other girls in hotpants br br for the directors  stop to try again please
