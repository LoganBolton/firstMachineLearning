id never heard of zero budget auteur neil johnson before seeing battlespace on dvd at hollywood video a few minutes into the movie i realize this isnt a bad thing like many straight to video scifi movies this is a film dominated largely by overused bad special effects and a constant parade of pretentious scifi concepts that fail to create a storybr br viewers are tortured with a religious sounding text introduction then a spoken introduction followed by a narration by the main characters daughter to me this seemed like a smoke screen to mask a film with militantly ugly visuals and zero character emphasis some people on here seem all too ready to take this film seriously and swallowed its seemingly new age messages hook line and sinker these favorable reviews must come from the same kind of people who can delude themselves into thinking that things like battlefield earth was a brilliant movie or that shasta is just as good as cokebr br those who were lured in by the cheesy cover art can look forward to lousy acting in small doses spaced with long blocks of people not talking rotten computer animated effects in extra large doses and irritating talking computers what you wont get is excitement emotional stimulation memorable dialogue or a good storybr br battlespace is impenetrable bull and the constant irritant of the narration proves it real science fiction hell real filmmaking is about characters and their dialogue not special effects and dull predictions this is right down there with similar direct to video scifi like clone and recon 2022 if the boredom of strange horizons and alien visitor is something you seek out by all means watch the crap out of this if you enjoy good storytelling and hate fake lens flares youre better off with a real movie
