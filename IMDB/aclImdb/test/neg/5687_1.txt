i knew it would be a bad movie when i rented it but i hoped for a good bad movie oh well had fun making fun of the endless sand trudging eating camel dung well actually eggplant and weird grimacing acting from i think it was about five actors the dvd needs a directors commentary so that i can find out what he was thinkingor if he was at all i cant believe they actually went to england austrialia and wherever to film thiscould have been done anywhere would have been better if they had managed to get her naked the best line of the movie he waiting for his upgrades yup still waiting now that was funny if anyone had more than 3 pages of dialog beyond the narratorshut up already then ill watch it again
