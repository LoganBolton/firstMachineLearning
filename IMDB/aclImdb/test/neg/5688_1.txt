the film begins with a 30 minute explanation about the war the human cyborgs battles history and then dumps 2 actors into a gravel pit they run around this gravel pitdesert area for about an hour shooting at each other thats it must have cost about Â£1000 to make with change avoidbr br marks out of ten acting 9 sets 1 costumes 9 direction 50 production 1 titled intro 4br br i think to improve this film would be to lose the commentary let the watcher decide whats going on remove some of the awful cgi add some techno rave music to it they might just rescue it
