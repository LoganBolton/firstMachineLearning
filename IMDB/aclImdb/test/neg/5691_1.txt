in a world where humans can live forever you spend the entire movie wishing they would die first off if you insist on watching this movie do two things first put it on mute dont worry you miss a plot hell they dont even talk for the first 70 min of an 87 min movie after putting on mute you must now hit fast forward till the main chick dies dont worry even if your paying attention you wont know why or how she died once you get to the good part take it of mute oh how will you know the good part wait for an elevator scene with two morons in space suits with wwii weapons these weapons wont seem like much till you realize that the first protagonist had a laser tag pistol and a bandoleer of co2 cartridges the only remnants of a plot take place between a glowing ball and a semi hot chick who looks like she was attacked by wolverine after listening to the plot you will wish they went back to not talking of the four people that are in this movie none of them can remotely act not even a little bit you will have better luck witnessing acting at a kindergarten theaterbr br to comment on the special on the special effects let me just say wow no really you will spend the entire movie saying to your self where did this movies 18 million dollar budget go seriously it will leave you in aw of the magnitude of ineptness the best sets are basically windows wallpaper backgrounds the ships are basically flying wrenches wait some are barges that kinda look like whales  i have never heard so many made up words in my whole life they have buttons on their wristlarge pedometers that can put them in fight mode and super runing mode makes them super blurry this will seriously drain their power reserves but they find bits of wires to chew on to regain their strength the explosions were less impressive than my fourth of july i only had sparklersbr br so the plot as far as i can figure goes something like this mother is a space ship captain and goes to the desert for a while rides a rocket dies then her daughter 6000 years in the future  no i am not exaggerating recalls her mothers memories through some sort of capsule anyways they jabber on for another 10 min and then the cause a big bang yes the same big bang that started our solar system its explained how she goes back in time or something it does not really matter it happened i guess roll credits seriously the whole script was mercifully on one sheet of paper unless that actually detailed any of the dreadfully fight scenesbr br after watching the credits i have now laughed more than i did the entire movie the jobs the created like catering supervisor galactius sarcophagus and then the special thanks to george lucas was just the bestbr br i really wasnt expecting that much for a movie i paid 99 cents for but seriously some body owes me for this most frequent comment heard after the movie i want my life back you have to admire that some but put time and effort in to this movie but seriously why
