today i had a real craving for a scifi movie and so i decided to check out battlespace sadly that was one of my biggest mistakes this yearbr br i see that the director neil johnson has directed over 500 music videos and i suggest he goes back to that music videos are a perfectly good form of entertainment and not everybody can cut it making moviesbr br the worst part of this movie is probably the voice over and that says a lot since the special effects are appalling at times voice over didnt work in blade runner and it doesnt work here the first hour or so is spent watching the main character walk through the desert while her daughter tells the story i think the story could have made a great movie but not like thisbr br the second worst part are the effects they are simply bad and they dont blend into the rest of the picture at all so you simply dont believe in them and absolutely all the frames in the movie has been filtered and not in a good way filtering used as an effect is good 90 minutes of it badbr br and what is it with all the gadgets talking all the time and not shutting up if i had used technology like that i would have gone mad i was just waiting for the guns to blurt out with i am awfully sorry but i seem to have run out of ammunition no stay away this movie is just not worth the time
