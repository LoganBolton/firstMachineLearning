i am willing to tolerate almost anything in a scifi movie but this was almost intolerable while a few of the special effects are very cool landscapes this is no battlespace rather a disjointed weird motherdaughter relationship with scifi concepts thrown in the acting wooden framing and shooting kindergarten film school and with handtohand combat scenes funnier than any hong kong chopsocky movie this film bores the plot line is convoluted and the devices used to move the plot along narrator unexplained scene jumps and plenty of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that writer cum director is not a good idea save your love of scifi for something else instead of losing a bit of it here
