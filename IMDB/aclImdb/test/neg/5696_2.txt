so its a space movie but its low budget you ask what about the effects the effects are at times good and at times really really bad i mean bad and notice i started with the effectsbr br theres a story here but its told in what i think is the wrong order i dont mean a tarantino style wrong order i mean its told in a completely nonsensical arrangement most of its about a mother in the future because you know its scifi as told by her daughter which is mostly exposition done in narrative from the daughters perspective only once youre through the first hour and hear paul darrows voice as a computer do you realize how much more tolerable the constant narrative would have been if hed read it this narrative is so constant and inclusive that the actors on screen hardly say a word for the first hourbr br theres also a lesson here for you up and coming filmmakers if youre not doing 2001 and want to have some action this one does then please hire a good fight choreographer otherwise your fights will look like well whats in battlespace and notice the title has the word battle in it ughbr br i think this might be the classic scenario of trying to make a movie based on nothing more than a concept and some effects my biggest surprise is seeing the imdb listing this film as costing 18 million when you compare it to something like primer which did better with a budget of a few thousand you realize in low budget filmmaking its all about the story i wasnt expecting much  but i was still disappointed two out of ten stars
