normallyi would say i loved this movienot for actingalthough that was oknot for the scriptwhich was sosothe reason i would have normally loved this movie is for the intense actionwhich starts from the get go and doesnt end until the final credits rollbutthe problem with this movieand i felt it was a big problemwas the horrible cgiit looks like they ran out of money and couldnt complete the the effects shots a lot of the effects look lime they are in their very roughest formsince it is obvious they didnt have enough money to finish the moviethey should not have released iti actual found the effects insultingit seems obvious they didnt care about making a decent end product for the consumerif it werent for thati would give this movie a much higher ratingmy vote for air panic is a 310
