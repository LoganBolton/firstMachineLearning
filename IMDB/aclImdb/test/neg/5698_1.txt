it amazes me that someone would actually consider spending some money on a movie like this really lets forget for a second that the plot doesnt even give a single hint of originality most of the movies today are based on other movies stories so a simple lack of originality is not that big a deal br br but i can hardly believe that none of the guys involved in the movie had never even got on a plane before shooting this because lets be honest that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous to be sincere i think a 6yearsold child with a fake camera could have come up with something technically much more believable some examples followingbr br the scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane when they have to turn them on again the guy on the radio says something like ok push the 1 and 2 buttons on the dashboard now those are not buttons they should not be pushed they should actually be pulled up and toward the pilot thats something only planeaddicted would know you say wrong the next scene you can see their fingers pushing the buttons and of course the so called buttons dont move at all not even a single millimeter and note that i havent even mentioned the fact that aircraft engines are not like cars engine that you just turn the key and the magic happens you have to do quite a complicated procedure to turn them on come on guys you could have faked the movements at least not to mention the hilarious final impact where the plane crashes against every single thing along the runway light poles along the runway what where they thinking and the wings dont even get ripped off it happened to me too once except the plane was made of lego what about the flight attendant shes actually so skilled that she perfectly knows where the aux 1 and aux 2 fuses are in the middle of the wires behind the cockpit should we mention then the guy that can drive an ambulance and fly a plane behind the ambulance using his computer and how did he turn the other airplane engines onbr br really i could go on hours with this stuff this is the dumbest movie ive ever come across and im including garbage like alone in the dark and other stuff in the list want to do yourself a favor dont watch it
