i rented this movie because i love kristanna loken and ive watched her on many tv shows and since shes having her 15 minutes of fame nowadays with her new t3 movie i wanted to check out what other movies she has been inbr br shes just ok in terms of acting not good and not bad either she makes up for everything by being extremely gorgeous yummmmmbr br rodney rowland was quite a surprise as the hero he provided the only solid good acting in the movie hes a very good actor and should probably be an action starbr br besides kristanna being ok and rodney being really good everything else about this movie is garbage in its purest formbr br a computer hacker hacks into the system of a plane from the ground and using a joystick he tries to slam the plane into a nuclear power plant  or something and of course there are the heroes who stand in his way and ruin his gamebr br this is one of the worst scripts i have ever seen and no wonder it was a low budget flickbr br whats shocking is that this movie was made in 2001 and it has way too many similarities to the september 11th tragediesbr br why do they make movies like this in the first placebr br panic   one star a waste of too good actors also a waste of time also known as air panic
