i liked most of the dialogue i liked the cast i thought it was well acted i particularly enjoyed ellen degeneres perfect deadpan performancebr br what didnt work for me was 1 the drawnout affair with the younger man too long too seemingly out of character for helen 2 the seemingly endless cinematic cliches mostly visual but including interminable voiced over rereadings of the love letter itself its contents should have a mystery 3 a young woman feministscholar and ironically a fireworks scene no wonder this reminded me of that horrid how to make an american quilt movie 4 the bumbling gotcha cop who smells dope everywhere no cliche there either and 5 a nauseatingly romanticized small town settingbr br i would have preferred the film to more persuasively explore the source of or even glorify helens bitterness to have included much more of degeneres character to have eliminated or reduced the various intergenerational artifices and to be a little less uncritical of small town lifebr br had it been developed as a play first those criticisms might have been addressed before committing the material to this film which unfortunately is decidedly mediocre
