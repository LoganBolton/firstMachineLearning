if this is not heavily featured on every list of what not to watch it should only be because those keeping that particular list are not aware of its existence which as long as that remains so is the acceptable alternative im not kidding you this is a bad movie joseph meeker returns from the dead with various vague undefined supernatural powers the most employed of which would seem to be appearing in new increasingly comicallooking and ridiculousand never scary or creepy in general when this goes for the latter of those it winds up just being bizarre and attempts at the former just dont work period outfits and stereotypesarchetypes and he is portrayed by david keithwhom i respect in well at least daredevil doing a more often than not terribly inconsistentwhich could also have to do with script and often over the top performance a character or two have personalities so unbelievably irritating that theyre painful to watch the editing thinks its considerably more clever than it really isand what on earth was with the red tint for the flashbacks cinematography oh dear framing coverage effective use of anglethat one could be attributed some to editing too perhaps please guys stop me when i say something youve ever heard about the existence of as far as the technical side goes this is a pretty lousy excuse for something more worthwhile to put in the projector than unexposed film but why stop there the plot is just poor the basic ideas been done and its been done so much better than thisthe crow would be one the way its told is gimmicky and while there is some explanation behind the flashbacks it still doesnt satisfy pacing is about nonexistent the lead is distinctly unlikeable and theres more personality in a barn door not to mention that those are also considerably less wooden kelly perine and thomas ian nicholas what in the name of all that is good and justpun intended are you doing in this perine you were already funny before this on the drew carey show nicholas well i havent seen you in anything preceding american pie but if nothing else you were funny later on and in those productions the amusement was intentional dialog is the less said the better language is unrestrained and tends to be stupid the violence is shoddily done and they dont even seem to care to try to hide ithinting at it might have been the smarter strategy characters dont get me started why spend so much energy on portraying unexciting at times utterly illogical events the more you think about this the worse it gets its not even passable as a bad horror flick or a b movieit may very well pass through the rest of the alphabet and go further still it couldnt scare you on the scariest day of your life if it had an electrified scaring machine i recommend this only to people who want to disprove how bad this is and dont say i didnt warn ya 110
