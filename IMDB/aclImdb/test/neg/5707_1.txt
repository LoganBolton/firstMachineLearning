the main character is a whiny irresponsible study of how to throw yourself a pity party she loses it at the drop of a hat acts pathetic is schizophrenic and left me wondering why on earth she doesnt understand why these friends of hers havent called her in three years get a clue sister  youre a juvenile mess i couldnt stand her or the friends i never felt connected to any of the characters to make the entire movie even more unbearable someone went far out of their way to put the worlds most hideous collection of crocheted and knitted hats in existence on film for all of eternity this alone should warrant someone be put on wardrobe probation for a decadebr br the acting wasnt awful but not really believable either and in the end the only thing that i did care about was the two hours im never going to get back dont waste your time  go catch up on a dentist appointment instead
