this is highgloss softporn a boring soap opera concentrating on one thing sex they actually made sex boring sad to say because i defy you to watch this casually and tell me what the storyline was what this is is an excuse for kim bassinger to show off her great body and for mickey rourke to smirk a lot thats it rourkes smugness is so bad its sickening and bassinger despite the great figure looks cheap more than beautifulbr br kudos to the photographer for some nice closeup shots and some wonderful color but the story is so weak  no character development and no plot  its unable to compensate lets face it this movie was made for only reason  to titillate male viewers on that level it probably succeeded if i recall its why i gave it a look being a fan of bassingers looks but i actually expected a story toobr br those trying to pass this off as arty and something deeper than soft porn are only fooling themselves
