its nice to see julie andrews trying a straight dramatic role heresomething she hadnt done in awhilebut her character of judithwise they didnt try to pass her off as a judyhas the old refined manners and tomboyish hairstyle of yore and andrews enacts grownup as any other actress would interpret frigid its a surprisingly bland drama set in barbados involving omar sharifnot the liveliest leading man aroundnot even in 1974hoping to make andrews a spy while also slowly leading her into the proverbial bedroom unmemorable outing does have some camp value the james bondlike credits at the beginning are a cheesy hoot as for julie shes quiet and contemplative but that doesnt do much for the audience or for the film blake edwards paces the freakin thing like a funeral  from
