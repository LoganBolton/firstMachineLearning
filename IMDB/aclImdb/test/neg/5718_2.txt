after a long hard night being partied away at the walkabout in islington i needed a pickmeup my throat hurt my wallet was empty and i ended up chatting to a drug addict at a busstop trying to sell me some petrol today i watched red sonja and i can honestly say that i felt much better last night than i do right now brigitte nielsen leads a bunch of asskicking warriors in various shapes and sizes to recover a green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained yep its that goodbr br red sonja isnt in a genre known for great films until peter jackson came along with a certain oscarwinning trilogy in fact the best swordsandsorcery film i could think of before lord of the rings was george lucass kiddiefriendly willow perhaps in view of this one should go a little easy on this film but i cant  its poorly written badly acted with the exception of paul smith whos just average and dreadfully put together the film is as convincing as an episode of the flintstones with costumes and scenery seemingly lifted straight outta bedrock considering the comicbook source material it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies why sonja insists on saving the most annoying kid in this world or that one is bewildering his personality seems to flick from spoilt brat to polite gentleman at the flick of a switch schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the motions a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in the terminatorbr br its simple to kick a film when youre down but the fact remains that this is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination when nielsen mourns the death of her sister and schwarzenegger tenderly places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then blurts out in that distinctive germanic accent shes dead then you know youre in for a rough ride a few smiles were raised at inappropriate points such as the priestesses of a temple who when sent plunging to their deaths in a hole in the ground seemed to enjoy the experience  at least judging from the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place if you have to watch an eighties fantasy film that wasnt porn watch willow but never take that as a ringing endorsement for the real thing take yourself to your local multiplex and show peter jackson what a great job he did with lord of the rings trust me 11 oscars really does mean its a great film  unlike bloody titanic
