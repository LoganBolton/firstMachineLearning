 when dubbed into another language lets face it neither nielsen nor schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialog and given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a looseloose situation any type of voiceover is sure to be an improvement and it actually is  at least in the german versionbr br but that is only a minor point the acting is bad the speeded up combat sequences are pathetic nielsen couldnt use her sword to fight her way out of a wet paper bag this becomes painfully obvious when compared to the fluidity of motion exhibited by the kid who has had some martial arts training no doubt and to the athleticism shown off by sandahl bergmanbr br schwarzenegger does his conan thing  nothing new herebr br some of the visuals are nice ill have to grant that the dragon skeleton bridge looks cool but more often than not the plaster is all too evidentbr br overall the movie isnt worth seeing even conan the destroyer is better than this although only marginally i would have much rather seen bergman as red sonja as she was originally supposed to be but i doubt that that could have saved this movie  oh wellbr br 310
