this in my opinion is a very poor movie that advertises arnold schwarzenegger as starring despite him being the costar only to sell more copies obviously taking influence from the similarly themed conan movies this film fails to prove as enjoyable and eventually fails to entertain at allbr br bridgette neilsen stars as sonja a beautiful woman who has been given unbelievable strength by a ghostly figure after her village was pillaged her family killed and she herself raped by the soldiers of queen gedran sandahl bergman gedran is a tyrant queen who wants control over the barbaric world and seeks out a talisman protected by sonjas sister to do it after discovering what has happened sonja sets out for revenge and at the same time she must save the world from the wrath of gedran kalidor schwarzenegger the master of the talisman sets out to protect her whether she wants him there or notbr br the first major problem with this movie is the beginning the events leading up to the point where sonja receives her powers could have easily made a good ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable film however the beginnings are rushed into what seems like a quick oneminute previously on segment from a television show had they actually made these events part of the story and cut out some of the filler later on they may have been able to start redeeming this movie but unfortunately they didnt i wonder why director richard fleischer has only currently directed two movies since red sonjabr br this film also features some of the most annoying characters in history like tarn ernie reyes jr who is a stupid character and just adds an over abundance of camp to the movie which sometimes works but in this case fails miserably he was quite obviously written into the movie for some comic relief but with the overall absurdity of the film anyway this was another costly mistake for red sonjabr br for all its faults there were some good fight scenes involving both neilsen and arnie which are worth noting but these are nowhere enough to save this turkey the acting is about as good as it gets for movies of this quality and even arnie didnt seem too bothered about his performance i dont recommend this film at all to me its a waste of an hour and a half my rating for red sonja  310
