it is sad that schwarzenegger was the best thing about this production especially considering the fact that he had not yet come into his own and was still as stiff as cardboard in his dialog deliverybr br actually this isnt as bad as some critics say but it isnt good either it is amusing and does play like a poor country cousin of the conan line making it a conflicted uneven poor work and speaking of poor the quality is terrible due to the era in which this was filmed but that is not the only reasonbr br the story herein is inferior even to the conan line but moreover it loses itself in the red sonja must be dominated by big strong schwarzenegger ploy and entirely forgets its purpose if it ever had onebr br its entertaining but in a lowbudget guiltypleasure b kind of waybr br it rates a 4210 frombr br the fiend
