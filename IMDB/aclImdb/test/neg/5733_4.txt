have just seen this film for the first time after purchasing it on dvdbr br it comes across as a cheap attempt to cash in on the two conan moviesbr br unfortunately this film didnt appear to have the same budget as the conan films and hence some of the sets and effects arent as flash and some scenes seem hurried br br nielsen is ok to look at but unfortunately she couldnt act if a gun was put to her head br br arnies supporting role looked like it was done as a favor to director fleischer who also directed conan the destroyer maybe arnie wasnt confident that he would go on to headline films like predator total recall t2 etcbr br some of the female guardians of the talisman early in the film looked like they were struggling to lift their swords and the looks on their faces suggested they were having great fun making this film i couldnt be so jovial if i was fighting for my lifebr br all this aside this film required very little concentration to watch and was mildly entertaining ive seen a lot worse two stars
