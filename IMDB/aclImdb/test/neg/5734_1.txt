in the mid1970s my nyc apt building was finally wired for cabletv and since showtime instead of hbo was the only premium channel offered showing recent movies i signed up for it being a writer and nightowl by nature i soon discovered the channel was showing movies late at night and until the wee hours of the morning id never even heard ofmost of them american independent films and foreign films that had never been given a us theatrical release many of them had recognizable star casts and respectable directors and thanks to showtime i discovered many firstrate films i and other showtime subscribers would never else have had the opportunity to see most of these cinematic mongrels were indeed dogs but often so bad they were unintentionally hilarious one night showtime unveiled a little italianmade gem called redneck filmed in 1972 given a limited european release in 1973 even though the movie had never been released in the us the mpaa rating was listed as an r since the director was one sylvio narizzano the director who made his name with the glorious georgy girl and the three leads were mark oliver lester fabio testi and telly savalas i decided to give it a try and found myself nailed to my tv screen in disbelief for 89 minutes as i recall savalas and testi played two criminals the former a raging maniac who in one stomachchurning scene casually sent a german family to their deaths by nudging their trailer off a cliff thereby plunging to the wilderness depths below so far so bad then out of nowhere testi as the nice psycho and lester all of 14 when the movie was made are seen both nude in a mens room testi sneaking peeks at the kids body while shaving and poor confused lester fixated on closeups of testis naked butt as a notyetjaded member of the movie industry and a cardcarrying liberal i was as much against censorship then as i am today the entire movie made me queasy and being the early 70s when i thoughtid seen everything in the anythinggoes movies of that liberated eraincluding the uncut version of altmans that cold day in the park a real jawdropper until it was trimmed for an r rating and would have spelled the end for altmans career had he not next come up with something called mash i still wonder if anyone else except me ever saw redneck and was appalled as i was trashing the actors and moviegoing audiences is joy maladjusted filmmakers have been merrily indulging in since the beginning of time but leeringly exploiting a highly respected and talented child actor mr lester at a time when he was beginning to make the difficult transaction from child to adult actor and im sure his film offers had thereby dwindled to meretricious junk like redneckmr narizzano you should be hanging your head in shame incidentally i was soon to make friends with actors who had appeared in narizzanos future undistinguished efforts they both despised him surprise
