sdiner82 had clearly not seen the film in decades and his memory is appalling his attempts to paint the mark lester shaving scene as suspect are utterly erroneous as are his incorrect comments about the bad guy sneaking peeks at the kids body lester is clothed for the entire time the man is in the room and the man barely gives him a glancebr br the scene is a crude attempt to show lesters innocent curiosity about the mans bodybr br like everything in this film its badly done but nothing morebr br even sdiner82s comments about savalas character who casually sent a german family to their deaths by nudging their trailer off a cliff is nonsense it was a single woman she was already dead and she was in a carbr br i suggest that sdiner82s review says far far more about his own far from liberal mindset than it does about this valueless filmbr br the only reason i even bothered to look it up was out of curiosity to see if it was made before or after kojakbr br the film is a worthless piece of 70s trash but sdiner82s review of it is the worst kind of slander he wraps up his review in pseudointellectual facts but the only fact is that he is plain wrong on almost every factual matter he discussesbr br i can only assume that sdiner82 saw exactly what he looked for which is disturbing now he can return to burning copies of catcher in the rye
