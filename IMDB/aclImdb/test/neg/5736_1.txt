i know a lot of people would claim certain films as the worst of all time but i think redneck stakes a claim for this prize a combination of quite dreadful acting from both mark lester and telly savales and plot progression that defies beliefbr br on telly saveles was he drunk when he acted in this he seems to play a slurring laughing lunatic with no sense of conviction maybe he mixed his medication with his whiskey i dont knowbr br on mark lester a performance more wooden than a carpenters workshop his clipped british tones dont belong in this film and his transformation from sheltered teenager to gangsters apprentice in 24 hours is mad and the strip scene with mosquito does not have any relevance to the plot at all perhaps the director likes this sort of thingbr br plot logic when memphis and mosquito ambush the car at the beginning why doesnt mark lesters mother do or say anything to get her son out of the car before the loonies drive it off she just lets them all go without saying a word on the other hand redneck has to be seen  you wont believe how bad it is otherwise
