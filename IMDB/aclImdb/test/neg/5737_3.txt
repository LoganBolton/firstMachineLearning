definitely not your typical polizia redneck just never worked for me the movie tells the story of a jewel heist gone wrong and a young boy who is inadvertently kidnapped in the process in their attempt to get away the robbers leave a bloody trail of death in their wake as they hatch a plan to ransom the boy the plan is never carried off as the robbers are more intent on getting to france and the boy is intent on staying with them while i could cite a number of problems i had with the movie ill focus on the most obvious  the character memphis played by telly savalas from his work in the dirty dozen and kelleys heroes to other italian films like crime boss to his most remembered role as kojak savalas was a winner ive always thought of him as one ubercool customer unfortunately savalas is almost unwatchable in redneck did the director turn on the camera and instruct him to act as psychotic as possible it might not have been too bad had his actions been done within the context of a plot i cared about but here he seems to be acting bizarre for sake of being bizarre its appears to be random lunacy and whats with that accent savalas might have been a lot of things but southern isnt one of them he sounds completely ridiculous even attempting the accent beyond that i found little of interest in the rest of the movie as i indicated the plot never drew me in i just didnt care about what was going on and the notion that the boy is so quickly attracted to the criminal lifestyle doesnt ring true as for the other actors mark lester is almost as bad as savalas and the usually reliable franco nero isnt a whole lot better three name actors and not a good performance between them to make matters worse i believe the director filmed many of the night scenes with nothing more than the glow from his watch to light the shots i couldnt tell what was going on characters i hate a plot i dont care about and a production values that failed  little wonder ive given redneck a 310
