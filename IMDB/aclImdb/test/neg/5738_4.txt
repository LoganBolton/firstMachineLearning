i actually went into this film with some expectations not because i thought the film sounded particularly good but because im a fan of italian exploitation flicks and with a cast that sees franco nero and telly savalas starring alongside oliver twist i figured it had to be interesting at least wellredneck does have one or two positive things going on but for the most part its a dull lifeless film that is as ridiculous as it is pointless the plot simply focuses on two criminals nero and savalas who kidnap a young kid oliver the twist in the tale is that the kid realises that hed have more fun if he gets accepted into the gang telly savalas and franco nero are two actors that have proved they can carry a film on their own on numerous occasions and they do have some memorable moments in this film  although really for all the wrong reasons savalas in particular gives a silly portrayal of the bad criminal the plot doesnt flow badly but since nothing interesting happens thats not really a positive point and doesnt save from the film from being mediocre overall i cant recommend this film it may appeal to some for its cult value but it didnt do anything for me
