i like vampire movies i like bmovies i love b vampire movies but this one has nearly nothing going for it some of the acting is horrible especially by 3 of the male leads the story is not particular interesting at a relative short 88 minutes it still seems too long and youll find yourself fastforwarding quite a bit there are an awful lot of kungfu vampire attacks sound cool it isnt when its done on a low budget it gets repetitive very quickly there is some minor blood and gore nothing to get excited about there some good wire work where you can see the wires it has some good landscapes being filmed in puerto rico br br not worth the rental
