slayer starts in the south american rain forest where captain hawk casper van dien  his men are attacked by a bunch of vampires they barely manage to escape with their lives jump forward six months later  hawk is called to see colonel weaver lynda carter who informs him there has been other reported sightings of vampires  that his exwife  her goddaughter dr laurie williams jennifer odell has gone out there on an expedition to study beetles worried she asks hawk to take a squad of soldiers back to south america  officially provide back up to captain grieves kevin grevioux  his men while at the same time unofficially look for laurie  not get killed by the vampires who have decided to venture out of the caves  into the civilised worldbr br edited written  directed by kevin vanhook this is yet another poorly made scifi channel original which just isnt very good in any respect the humourless script has nothing going for it as far as i could see its one of those modern vampire films which decides to pick  choose the traditional vampire film lore rules it wants to use like these vampires can be killed with stakes through the heart  have fangs but at the same time can freely walk around in sunlight  they dont sleep in coffins the film moves along at a reasonable pace but its all very dull bland  lifeless the story is poor  just rather stupid the characters are terrible the dialogue is forgettable  theres very little here to recommend slayer also tries to have some sort of ecological message as the head vampire claims they are only starting to kill human beings because of their systematic destruction of the rain forest where they have lived in secret for centuries unfortunately theres no conviction there  is more like a throwaway line to fill the time than a serious statement there isnt enough exploitation content  is a rather unsatisfying way to spend 90 minutes of your time the makers dont even do anything with the jungle setting hell i didnt expect predator 1987 but i hoped for a bit more than thisbr br director vanhook has made several horror films all of which i have seen have been equally poor im sorry but he does nothing here  turns in a throughly forgettable looking  feeling film theres no atmosphere or tension  as for genuine scares forget about it the gore is restrained there are some bitten necks  a bit of spraying blood but its nothing we havent seen before or has much impact theres also a huge vampire monster creature at the end but it doesnt look that impressive  it gets itself killed far too easilybr br with a supposed budget of about 2000000 this actually had a decent sized amount of money spent on it but its still a rubbish film its reasonably well made but nothing special or memorable the acting sucks im sorry but thats the way i saw itbr br slayer is yet another poor stupid  boring madefortv scifi channel rubbish that i simply cant recommend not to be confused with the rather fine one time british video nasty gore film the slayer 1982 which is 100 times better than this so track that down  watch that instead
