this is about some vampires who can run around out in the sunlight that are causing some problems down in south america casper van dien is sent in with his team of commandos to investigate the movie opens with van dien  co walking through the jungle and theres this huge black guy who just absolutely positively cannot act he speaks all his lines as if hes reading them off the cuecards for the very first time his voice is also so low that well its positively hilarious great way to get the movie started anyhow they run into some of our vampires shoot them this causes them to appear to die for about 20 seconds and then of course they come back to life van dien notices that one of them was impaled across a tree limb and yells to his buddies to kill them with wood the stunt work must be seen to be believed  the vampires are on wires that pull them up trees which is supposed to make them look like they can climb really easily but it just makes them look like theyre bouncing around on bungee cords or somethingbr br yeahanyhow later on the huge black dude is down in south america with some guys van dien not included and theyre attacked by more vampires its really too bad these guys never heard of a crossbow because it would seem to be the perfect weapon to kill the little bloodsuckers with but instead they use big old wooden stakes that they try to impale the vampires with by hand the big black dude ends up getting captured and he eventually becomes some big powerful vampire leader van dien ends up battling him later on it doesnt help that all through the movie everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire they are knocked out for 20 seconds or so which would enable a person to stick a stake in them fairly easily they just try to stick stakes in them in the middle of handtohand combat yeah not exactly brilliant tacticsbr br theres a hot babe remember veronica from the lost world tv show yes its her who also happens to be walking around in the middle of vampire county on some sort of research mission and she also just happens to be van diens exwife hey what are the odds its a shame shes not in the movie a whole lot more than she is will her and casper get back together in the end will van dien defeat the huge black dude who cant act will the circus performer vampires make you laugh through all the numerous action scenes will we hear the three stooges music when somebody does something funny has even lynda carter forgotten how to act in her small cameo shes more convincing in her sleep number bed commercials these questions and more will will be answered if you make it all the way to the end of the moviebr br i dont know it might score some points on the so bad its good scale but thats about it eh its a bunch of goofs running around in the jungle i guess its kind of entertaining
