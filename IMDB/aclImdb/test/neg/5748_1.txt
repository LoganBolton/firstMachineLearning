first off i would like to make it clear that i voluntarily subject myself to the viewing of terrible movies i have seen what i thought were the worst of the worst in my mind movies could not get any worse than the likes of debs leprechaun 6 back 2 tha hood and terror storm until i saw this moviebr br the pirate movie without any exaggeration is the worst movie in the world i was informed prior to watching that the movie was indeed awful but i did not believe the allegations believe me when i tell you that this movie is simply an abomination to filmbr br it starts out with a 3 minute clip of a boat of pirates apparently in the middle of a battle with themselves the end splashes across the screen unfortunately it is not the actual end of the movie the movie is about an unpopular awkwardly nerdy girl named mabel who carries around a ghetto blaster and is attracted to ambiguously homosexual pirate boys she drowns and has a overly drawn out hallucination in which she stars as a scantily dressed skank who falls in love with frederic who happens to have just crawled out of the ocean he might actually be homosexual the pirate king has a ruby and diamond studded codpiece it honks and squeaks when he squeezes itbr br there is singing in this movie you might have the impression that this is a hilarious musical it isnt trust me they are the worst songs that youve ever heard and by the end of the first original tune you will be searching for objects to pierce your eardrums withbr br there are references to other movies in here by references of course i mean obvious ripoffs the inclusion of indiana jones inspector clouseau and the lightsaber were in fact antihilariousbr br the dialogue is in its better moments painful to hear the direction is flat out awful and at one point you can see the stunt pad in the scene which isnt very well hidden at allbr br in conclusion if there is even the shadow of curiosity in your mind about this movie get rid of it there are times when people want to see how bad something really is but this movie is not worth it put it completely out of your mind and never think about it again if you cherish your mental capacity then i beg of you never ever watch this movie
