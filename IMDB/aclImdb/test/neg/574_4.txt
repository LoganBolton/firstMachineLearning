the love letter is one of those movies that could have been really clever but they wasted it focusing on a letter wreaking havoc in a small town the movie has an allstar cast with nothing to do tom selleck and alice drummond had so recently costarred in the superhilarious in  out also about an upset in a small town in which they were both great but here they look as though theyre getting drug all over the place i cant tell what the people behind the camera are trying to do here if anything but they sure didnt accomplish anything how tragic that a potential laugh riot got so sorrowfully wasted
