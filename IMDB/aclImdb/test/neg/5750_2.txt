well now that all of the director productions companys friends and relations have posted their shill reviews after seeing this at various festivals i guess its time to show reviews written by people who actually paid 10 bucks to see itbr br like the directors dear jesse the only other one of his films i have seen loggerheads suffers from a lack of focus and too many ideas crammed into an indie budget i swear this guy might have better luck doing miniseries i kept waiting for the various plot threads to come together but they only intercepted at points blatantly forshadowed in a way obvious to all but the most dense viewer it was like watching a season of lifetime madefortv movies crammed into one long did i say looong sketch on the old carol burnett show maybe an enterprising male suitor could take his girlfriend to see this and then exclaim heyremember all of the chick flicks we went to last yearthe one about the adoptive motherthe one about the gay guythe one about the christian housewife we went to three chick flicks last year so now we have to go see terminator 4 i guess one has to do anything to cast a familiar actor to get funding but what oh what is bonnie hunt doing in this flick she isnt exactly known as a dramatic actress and this attempted performance wont be sending mr oscar to her door i mean speaking of lifetime original movies wasnt valerie bertinelli or farah fawcett available ms hunt has always come off to me as cold maybe she should have played the other mom i wish i would have chosen capote to fill my weekly gaythemed indie allowanceoh well maybe next week i think there is a good reason why capote is playing at tons of theatres all over the nyc area and this one is playing at only one let the distributors faith in this flick assure to to run in the opposite direction if you dont trust this review
