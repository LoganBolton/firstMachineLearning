at the beginning of loggerheads were introduced to three pairs of seemingly unrelated characters to make matters even more confusing were informed via titles on the screen that the action is taking place in three separate time lines between the years 1999 and 2001 it takes a great deal of time but eventually we come to see how the three pairs are related mark austin a young man in his 20s gay and hiv positive is estranged from his conservative parents elizabeth and rev robert austin br br mark is now a drifter and arrives in kure beach north carolina a seaside town where he meets george sensitively played by michael kelly a gay motel owner and they eventually become involved with each other meanwhile marks birth mother grace played by bonnie hunt has come to the point in her life where she has decided to find the son she gave up for adoption when she was 17 similarly marks adoptive mother also has decided to track her estranged son as she misses him despite the misgivings of her homophobic minister husbandbr br loggerheads were told is based on a true story and that perhaps is its achilles heel directorwriter tim kirkman tries too hard to create scenes fraught with dramatic tension where there is very little to be found take mark and georgeÂ—theyre both sensitive souls who have little to disagree about theres some slight tension when grace faces off against an adoption agency director who is forbidden by law to give her any information about her lost son as well as a slight conflict with her mother who denies that she disapproved of her when she became pregnant as a teenager no sparks fly either between elizabeth and robert since the good reverend has adamantly insisted from the beginning that he has no intention of reconciling with his son br br loggerheads is similar to brokeback mountain in that the gay couple are the good guys and the straight males for example the kure beach cop and the reverend are the baddies the biggest letdown of the movie is that there is no interaction and hence no dramatic conflict between mark and either one of his mothers mark is already dead before either the birth or adoptive mother has a chance to reconcile with him br br kirkmans theme is both a plea for tolerance and an exhortation for family members to express their heartfelt feelings before its too late kirkmans sentiments are for the most part wellintentioned but they do not make for good drama loggerheads moves along at a snails pace without providing any new revelations or suspense regarding such topics as aids adoption and homophobia ultimately loggerheads fails due to a lack of originality
