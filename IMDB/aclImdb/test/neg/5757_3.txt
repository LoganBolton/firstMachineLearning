director and fx man john carl buechler doesnt have to do much in order to terrify me the sight of his name in the credits alone is enough to strike fear into my heartbr br his lamentable straighttovideo output in the 80s sat on the bottom shelf of the horror section at my local rental shop twenty years later and his dvds occupy the same space it seems that the more things change the more they stay the same you can rely on old jcb to serve up dreck whatever the format and regardless of advances in moviemaking technologybr br in this contemptible offering a bunch of friends travel to a remote town where they discover the secret treasure hoard of jeremiah stone aka the fortyninerÂ—an evil claimjumping cannibalistic miner who caused havoc in the mid1800s before his death jeremiah cursed anyone who should find his gold and its not long before the pickaxe wielding killer is back bumping off the hapless treasure seekersbr br with its dreadful script unimpressive makeup effects and scoobydoo style villain the curse of the fortyniner is par for the course for buechler only genre stalwarts keren black richard lynch and john phillip law lend this movie any credibility whatsoever with the rest of the cast giving performances ranging from bad to awful although ill forgive alexandra ford who is a complete hottiebr br even fans of bad schlock horror will be disappointed since most of the women keep their clothes on and a lot of the deaths occur offscreen which is probably not such a bad thing since the onscreen deaths are patheticbr br the curse of the fortyniner is another in a long list of duds for john carl
