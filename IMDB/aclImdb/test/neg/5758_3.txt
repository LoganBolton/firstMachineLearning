this was bad enough i really hope that there is no sequel maybe that is giving away part of the plot to let you know that it is open to the possibility but no it really isntbr br there is really not at all special about this movie well the special effect were fairly good but nothing to write home aboutbr br there were some hot babes in her especially elina madison and alexandra ford but nothing to see folks pg13 definitely not an r that also tells you the slasher aspects were less than spectacular the shovel to the head was the only thing that was unusualbr br tame scare fare
