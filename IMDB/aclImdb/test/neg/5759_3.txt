my mate and i chose to watch this obvious piece of junk purely based on its tagline after nearly 30 years of lousy and rudimentary teen slashers i cant believe that only just now some nerdy horror brainiac come up with the brilliantly witty slogan they axed for it other than that miners massacre is just as random annoying and forgettable as all the rest out there perhaps even more the script contains all the typical clichés and features all the dreadfully stereotypic characters you wish a horrible and painful death to the gore effects are computer engineered and thus beyond pitiable and the obligatory big stars karen black john philip law and richard lynch are entirely wasted in spite of their top billing cursed mines and abandoned ghost towns form an ideal horror setting  the creators of my bloody valentine already figured that out in the early 80s  but his dull film simply hasnt got any innovative ideas or even remotely surprising elements to offer bunch of greedy twentysomething losers which refer to themselves as friends even though they clearly cant stand each other desecrate an ancient mine in search of the gold that is allegedly hidden there of course they unwarily resurrect the zombie miner this way and he just 150 years of rest in order to prepare for a massive teen massacre yay the cast is exceptionally irritating in this one the girls all have impressive racks but refuse to show anything instead they all prefer endless whining and the taking of needless risks the dimwitted blokes clearly just serve as screen fillers in her barely five minutes of playtime karen black still manages to make an utter fool out of herself by depicting the most prototypic and hysterical local nut woman ever the zombie has a stupid and very unconvincing face but he looks okay and reasonably menacing when shown in the distant shadow of the moonlight whilst swinging around his pickaxe since the best thing about miners massacre concerns the aforementioned tagline and you can read that on the box in the video store itself theres very little else to recommend here director john carl buechler scored a few modest hits during the eighties like notably the original troll and a fair friday the 13th sequel but its obviously time to retire now
