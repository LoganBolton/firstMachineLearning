a group of friends discover gold deep inside an old mine but by taking the gold and thinking theyve hit it big they awaken a long dead miner whos hell bent on protecting his treasure miners massacre is a chintzy bhorror movie in the extreme youve got all your familiar clichés your group of intellectuallyimpaired teenagers characters going off on their own to investigate strange noises a few popscares the mysterious sheriff the old lady who everyone thinks is nuts played by topbilled karen black no less and so on nevertheless its done in an amusing nonpretentious fashion that makes the film mindlessly entertaining in a so bad its good kind of way the characters and dialog are what youd expect from this type of filmfamiliar routine and unoriginal the actors all do a decent job though consideringive actually seen biggerbudget films of its type with worse acting i know what you did last summer anyone and add a bit of credibility to the film itself the villain in this film the 49er is obviously derived from the creeper from jeepers creepers all the way down to the brown overcoat the hat and the long white hair like the creeper he never talks and is buttugly to boot the gore is somewhat disappointing in my opinion there are a couple of fairly gruesome moments but too much is offscreen and the death scenes are often laughable spoiler ahead theres one truly hilarious moment where a girl gets decapitated by the said villain and to achieve this effect the filmmakers hid the actresss body beneath the villains coat with her head poking out and put some fake blood on her neck seriously you could see the outline of her shoulders i think they could have done a little better there even if the budget was low and im sure it was but still the special effects are cheap but sufficiently effective and for the most part moderately well done for a lowbudget film either the effects guys or the director seem to have a thing for explosions and fire almost every scene towards the end of the film has at least a couple of characters being burn to death always filmed in slow motion or something exploding be it a car or an old mine cave seriously hasnt anyone ever heard the term stop drop and rollbr br miners massacre or curse of the fortyniner what ever you want to call it is cheesy and dumb albeit entertaining and as long as you dont have expectations through the roof youll be sufficiently entertained br br im feeling generous so ill give it a 410
