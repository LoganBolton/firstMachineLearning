let me start out by saying i love horror movies big budget low budget big name actors no name actors it doesnt matter and when it comes to judging movies i am very forgiving this movie however is pretty badbr br the actors show little or no emotion when delivering their lines and the acting is worse than many lower budget horror flicks ive seen as the actors get killed off you could care less there is very little gore i have no idea what film other reviewers watched when they say there is good gore in this one because there isnt and the special effects are substandard at best they steal so much from so many better horror movies jeepers creepers friday the 13th leprachaun and it still doesnt helpbr br luckily i saw this on showtime and didnt have to actually pay any extra money to see it or waste a spot in my netflix queue on it there are so many better horror movies out there and i recommend you see those instead of this big letdown
