and believe me thats a pretty stunning accomplishment take jolly roger massacre at cutters cove change the killer from a pirate to a prospector change his obsession from buried treasure to old gold and his color from puke green to deep blue you now have miners massacre the problem is at least jolly roger was entertaining enough  albeit in a sobaditsgood way  to keep you watching it for the whole two hours theres no stripjointmurder scene or any bizarre killings i cant tell you how many times i lost interest in miners massacre and started doing dishes or cleaning around the condo and the ending is absolutely silly the 49er dude just randomly reappears out of nowhere to kill the local sheriff while the lead actor and actress are sitting in the sheriffs cruiser screaming a truly horrible movie
