seeing the cover of this before i watched it my expectations werent high especially since it was amongst those other crappy horror movies at blockbuster alongside films like juniorbr br alright not only does this movie have the brainless stereotypical characters the rich douche bag the bitch the sheriff the localer that knows whats going wrong in the town and so forth but has such godawful dialogue acting directing and cg effects the jeremiah stone dude was hilarious spoiler ill never understand why he bit his finger off out of nowhere when he was holding that chick up hostagebr br the premise for the movie is just as atrocious as the other flaws from what i could get from it jeremiah stone was a gold digger during the gold rush and a notorious outlaw he had a crapload of gold spoiler and put a curse on anyone who went after his gold before he was gunned down by the locals after he killed some girl but not only did he survive he bit off his own finger and ran off so present day a group of clueless morons find out about this gold mine and of course they are warned by locals about the curse of the fortyniner and what do they do as expected ignored the warnings and greedily sought for the gold they get the gold and all sorts of st goes on thankfully spoiler the bitch gets her head cut offbr br thats about it looking at the cover of the film you can tell what kind of movie its going to be its just so terrible its hilariousbr br 1 12 stars out of 5
