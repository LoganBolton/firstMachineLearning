seen this one in a sneak preview yesterday and must say it was terrible after the credits i thought hey with this cast itll probably be pretty good didnt at all turn out that way br br lame predictable groaners terribly simply drawn characters maybe except a little ms laras and an ending one could foresee 10 minutes into the movie and worst of all it misused a delicate theme handicapped persons for low level and mostly tasteless jokes without ever touching anything but the surface of the issue the handicapped person the film sympathises with the most is the one who is just faking it what kind of message is that and the film doesnt have a thought through ending at all it basically comes down to i love you doesnt matter that you acted like a prickbr br to sum it up great cast that must have been terribly bored to sign up for a terrible flick
