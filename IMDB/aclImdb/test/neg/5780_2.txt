alexandra maria lara a very beautiful and enticing woman but not a good actress in all the films ive seen her in she appears to me as the exact same character whether it be in the downfall nackt vom suchen und finden der liebe and now wo ist fred she always is plays the young goodhearted woman who is a little naive and doesnt know how to handle the things happening to her she disposes of a repertoire of probably five different facial expressions that she works with abundantly i personally have a hard time believing that she could play a mysterious and slightly obnoxious character because it just isnt in here so shes typecast as the nice girl next door which she is but once again she aint up to snuff when it comes to acting til schweiger same thing the film downright stupid as it was an american movie it would have been a great role for adam sandler who i dont like either i wasnt offended by the fact that this is a film with handicapped people in it i just thought that the jokes resulting from this werent funny at all i chuckled twice or three times but when i was halfway through it i was just bored and annoyed and wanted this flick to end
