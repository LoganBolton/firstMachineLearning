this movie is absolutely terrible definately a bullt story and even worse acting too bad charlie sheen is involved in something like this since he is a decent actor and has done a couple of really good moviesbr br the special effects are ateamstandard with the classical car gets shot and then flips over with a little fireball under the hoodbr br of course the enemy are portrayed as total idiots and die as fast as they can say die evil americansbr br unless braindead movies are you game dont spend 113minutes of your life on this rubbish pick up the platoon or apocalypse now instead
