the contemporary chapter of the us navys elite underwater demolition team is called to do whatever they want apparentlybr br charlie sheen was made an officer already the storyline is unbelievable michael biehn is his immediate co but he keeps charlie on a rather long leash and one of the guys pays for it early on by getting killed thanks to charlies patented stupidity the rest of the team spends their spare time committing courtsmartial offenses mostly an exercise in random gunfire and paperthin ethics these particular seals might be better suited to serving as crashtest dummiesbr br some good action scenes counter the goofy proceedings
