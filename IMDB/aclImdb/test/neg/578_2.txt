divorced single mom in picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows it to spur into action her dormant love life pet project for actresscoproducer kate capshaw who gives a warm nicelymodulated lead performance yet this story is so slim and the direction and editing so erratic that a faint dissatisfaction creeps in initially capshaws helen envisions several of her friends reading the love letter to her an interesting visual joke but the first person they do this ploy with is ellen degeneres who doesnt play a lesbian but who comes off as one because of this gimmick different ideas are flayed about in the hopes that one would stick and the continuity is extremely choppy supporting cast including tom selleck and tom everett scott who mostly acts with his shirt off is very good but they cant save the final act which is disappointing lowkeyed in a quirky pleasant way but it is blandly goodnatured nothing more 12 from
