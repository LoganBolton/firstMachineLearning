as a ca resident id like to see the jackholes who were shutting down the electricity plants to raise the prices get some jail time too br br i thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces while they stuck to how enron rose and crashed i found it really interesting however when the movie focused on its antibush slant it made me wonder if they were really being accurate br br its fine to point out any connection the republicans had to enron but the monster was created while clinton was president the ca energy crisis happened under daviss watch both were in office during enrons abuses but neither are held accountable in any way rather many minutes are spent on how bush was friends with lay so what lay played golf with clinton and spent the night in the lincoln bedroom why are democrats given such a free pass in this film i think most politicians are a waste of our taxpayer money so im not partial to either party but i hate feeling like im subject to someones political agenda when i watch a documentary yes politicians deserve some blame but i really doubt that the only guilty ones have rs after their names i found no value in portraying the bushs as kaylovers when democrats received just as much enron campaign money as republicans did like i said it weakens the rest of the film for me because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts they lay out
