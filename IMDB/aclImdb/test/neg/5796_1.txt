sadly this movie did have potential with such a willing cast but everything was so poorly thought out and poorly executed i dont think ive ever seen any film where every scene just falls flat with a loud thud as it did here also i dont think ive ever seen a stoner sex comedy that didnt provide at least one laugh but this vortex of pain provided nothing but groans and misery the last time i was this stunned at how unfunny a comedy can be was with the awful big mommas house scene after scene these movies will turn your brain into jelly silly and stupid can sometimes be funny but here silly and stupid are used as a torture device against the viewer an absolute rockbottom dud
