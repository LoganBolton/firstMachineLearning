if a movie has an unimaginative hackneyed story and bland characters it needs to make up for it by being really really funny you can get away with a lot if youre funny but while there are a few amusing moments scattered here and there in grandmas boy they are so far and few between that they cannot begin to make up for the hack work the film displays in such abundancebr br the movie certainly doesnt aim to surprise anyone when alex hides marijuana in his grandmas house in a tea tin you know whats going to happen later on and it does the movie appears to have been written by a committee who did a study of mediocre comedies and grabbed any gag that appeared in more than one of thembr br the most interesting thing about the movie is its somewhat unusual setting the game takes place in a video game development company which should be an interesting source for some clever comedy but dont be fooled this is not a movie about video game developers this is basically a college frat house movie in which all the frat boys have been shoved into a big room to play video gamesbr br the way the movie completely fails to think through its setting and use it for original laughs can be seen in the character of jp jp is i think moreorless conspired by the creator of doom john carmack at least inspired to the extent that hes an odd genius who makes gamesbr br in the movie jp is a weird obnoxious geek who is despised and jeered by the company game testers that makes no sense at all if you are one of the most significant people in the history of video games as jp is supposed to be then even if youre quirky and obnoxious people will still admire and respect you on some level if stephen hawking is obnoxious his associates still arent going to make jun of him to his facebr br also game testers are just as likely to be geeks as jp but in the movie they are basically frat boys its a fun normal guys against the obnoxious dweebs movie and while that formula has worked very occasionally in the past it is absurd in the setting of a game company if you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie you dont simply cram in all the conventions of movies from different settings into that one unless youre a hackbr br about two thirds of the way through the movie i gave up something happened that i knew would result in a series of painfully predictable events and i realized i hadnt actually laughed at anything for the last half hour anyway so i stopped although i did fast forward just to make sure i was right that they would follow the most predictable clich√©s which they didbr br normally if a movies bad i just say its bad and then run out of things to say but this movie is such a phenomenally shoddy production that it deserves a long diatribebr br shame on the movie for luring a good actress like linda cardellini into it then surrounding her with talentless nobodies ill give the movie 1 point for giving shirley jones the chance to be the antishirley partridge though
