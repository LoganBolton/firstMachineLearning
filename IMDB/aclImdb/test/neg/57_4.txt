generally speaking i dont make negative comments on here but since this is a festival piece i dont want you to waste your time when you could see something else that might not be playing againbr br i thought the actors were pretty bad for instance they totally didnt play off each other rather they waited to recite their lines which were pretty poor to begin with the dialogue sounded really forced norman or whatever his name tried or so it would appear to be witty and biting in the lines he chose but just fell really shortbr br after words he asked if anyone saw the ending coming and some people were all yea and he all but called them liars look there were so many clues the biggest being a briefcase full of cash for a 500 an hour whore i mean the john gave her at least 20gs tell tale sign now no you couldnt see exactly what was going to happen but by the time the twist actually occurred i for one didnt even care i was just glad to get out of there i asked him which draft he shot and he said 81 maybe next time he will wait to shoot til 153 cause this needed a lot of workbr br but he seemed like a fairly nice guy he is making his own films hell probably get better and i hope he does not in a snotty way either i mean it i wish him luck just remember this is just my opinion
