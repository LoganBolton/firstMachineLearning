first of all id like to say that i really enjoyed this movie however that said i cant say that it was a good movie i went into the theatre with pretty low expectations something ive learned to do im glad i did because the plot and development wasnt stellar the jokes were lowgrade humor but i was in the right mindset to enjoy thembr br i wasnt the only one in fact the entire theatre was laughing out loud i didnt hear anyone complain after the movie came to a close i even saw one guy fall out of his chair laughing but again i have to warn you grandmas boy is not a topquality film it is a funny albeit lowbrow movie and if you go with the right mindset youll really enjoy it oh and dont take kids to it
