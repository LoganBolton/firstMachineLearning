call me old fashioned but i like movies with plots i thought stoner comedy was just a way to more specifically describe a comedy in which lots of weed is smoked and the people watching it are more apt to enjoy it high grandmas boy however has decided this is a fullblown niche and that stoners represent a piece of the comedy pie that need to be reached apparently allen covert star and producer and the happy madison gang were right but that doesnt make grandmas boy any less boring and unfunny they might be completely stoned  but the characters are mostly halfbakedbr br alex covert a longtime supporting player for adam sandler firsttime star is a mid30s professional video game tester whose roommate has gotten them evicted he could look for a new apartment but then we dont have a movie after trying a couple friends he ends up living with good ole grandma lilly doris roberts of everybody loves raymond she wakes him up a 6 am and has him do chores and soon hes falling asleep on the job and so the new video game sequel might not get done on deadlinebr br like most people alex deals with his frustration and eradicates boredom by either playing video games or getting high or both his friendscoworkers all do the same thing most of them are virgins that live at home in addition to loving video games theyre all awkward and all with the exception of nick swardson and joel moore only at times their characters arent funny funny if youre blazed  sure i suppose but i cant say from experiencebr br maybe all we loser guys like is getting high playing video games and awkwardly ogling women with specific attention on their breasts but even so it shouldnt be the driving force of an entire film neither should old women getting high on accident saw that one coming or being the but of grossout sex jokes  but thats what happens when a film isnt about anything no conflict occurs until the last 20 minutes outside of the slight problems of being out of pot alex trying to get the hot girl linda cardellini to like him and the guys scrambling to finish their levels for the video game deadlinebr br characters can be the saving grace for these meandering stoner flicks but aside from a lovable doris roberts the aforementioned swardson as the virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them his roommates and joel moores skill at making robot noises theres little character ingenuity covert is a runofthemill main character with no comedic dimensions his dealer friend dante is an inept actor and waste of screen time and jonah hill and kevin nealon are written so far into the periphery it doesnt matterbr br if you like movies about nothing and watching them in a state of mind and body that enhance that nothingness grandmas boy will likely be just what youre looking for those who need a little more talent and wit to get on board with a comedy will be left unaffected the most i can say for grandmas boy is that its watchable despite its pointlessness it wont feel like a total waste of time but youll wish you did do drugs so you could at least have made the most of the hour and a halfbr br steven cbr br visit my site at wwwmoviemusereviewscom
