creating a comedy is like walking a pretty thin tightrope it either works or it does not grandmas boy is one of those movies that does not work it may have a few very funny parts but for the majority its just a terribly unfunny comedy from the usual supporting characters in adam sandler films sans sandler himself hes just a producerbr br alex allen covert is a game tester hes 35 and is the best tester and game player at his otherwise kidfilled workplace he ends up getting his apartment and his stuff taken from him for not paying the bills as it turns out his roommate had just been spending the rent money on philipino hookers and not paying the landlord desperate he moves in with his grandmother lilly doris roberts of everybody loves raymond and her two roommatesbr br thats the basic plot of the film thrown in with subplots about a hot new girl named samantha linda cardelli unrecognizable from her days as velma in scooby doo trying to get the testers to complete a new game as fast as they can a robotlike game creating prodigy jp joel moore who works with alex and wears much of the same clothes as neo in the matrix and of course all sorts of sex and drug related jokes thats itbr br the problem with the film besides the fact that the real conflict in the film occurs and is resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the film is that it just is not funny it is totally mindnumbingly boring and only sparingly funny nothing really happens at all no emotion no real sense of direction and a whole ton of intense swearing you find yourself maybe laughing at a few funny quips that the actors say but otherwise sit in complete boredom wishing you had not even bothered with the film how this film was greenlit and how fox thought it could make money will always remain a mystery to mebr br theres just no entertainment value to come from it none of the actors are actually putting in good performances they are just acting like idiots for the camera and hoping for the best stoner comedy has been done before multiple times and on occasion actually works harold and kumar go to white castle and dazed and confused come to mind here it just makes for making the film even less funny than it is already the random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of bare breasts really does not make the film any better eitherbr br other than a few funny oneliners this movie should just be outright missed altogether its not very funny the entire plot is silly its boring and it just makes for one horrendous film avoid it like the plaguebr br 1510
