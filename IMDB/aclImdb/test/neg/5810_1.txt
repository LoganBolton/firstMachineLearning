its hard to know exactly what to say about this ever so bland and dull little film the story is predictable when not completely laughable its all a matter of dutiful gestures which as presented here carry absolutely no conviction yes the mgm production values are gorgeous and yes ms lamarr was exquisitely beautiful but she and the great spencer tracy have absolutely no chemistry together  and thats the only thing that would have made this parade of cliches at all effective its my understanding that this movie received poor reviews when it was originally released the passage of time has not improved it
