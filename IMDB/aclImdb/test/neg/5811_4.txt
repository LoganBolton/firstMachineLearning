i fully agree with the previous reviewer theres no chemistry between spencer tracy and hedy lamarr and the focus of the film is on their relationship hedy lamarr isnt at her best and spencer tracy appears to be naive simple and overlyhopeful  both in love and life an idealist role that played out best in boys town if you can make it through the ridiculous crowd scene by the train stationwhoaits rather slapstick and not worthy of any actor in the cast not the best acting on anybodys part miscast and mismatched story is empty and various and disenfranchised input is apparent hedy lamarr is her absolutely stunning herself which is truly the best part of the film spencer tracy cant match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe and the film doesnt come off as believable for at least that reason
