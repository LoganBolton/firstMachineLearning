i found this gem in a rack the local video rental store had of tapes which are exchanged among various rental outlets the man who skied down everest hmm never heard about it the box reads of some japanese fellow who always wanted to ski down everest and actually did it sounds interesting i rented it as expected it was documentary style the first part can be summarized so i always wanted to ski down mount everest this is followed by some footage of preparation for the event lots of preparation footage ok i suppose it takes a lot of preparation then we are treated to a protracted piece on the skier yuichiro miuras philosophy on life etc more filler follows and i begin to wonder where the skiing fits in to this show more preparation is shown and they begin to make the trip to the mountain more philosophy is shown at last they arrive at the mountain and maybe perhaps he will get around to skiing down the friggin thing lots of climbing footage later there is a description of the parachute device intended to slow miuras speed on the steep slope finally he straps on the skis and gets ready to gobr br hes off he skis about twenty feet and his skis shoot out from under him he deploys the parachute and tumbles in an inglorious bundle for some distance down the mountain and thats that end of story what the heck was thatbr br ok i can buy that he always wanted to ski down everest made extensive preparations and actually tried it with camera crew in tow it didnt work and he ended up tumbling down and almost killing himself so what egregious hubris would inspire the man to release a film of it and call it skiing down everest perhaps the titlethe man whos feet shot out from under him and he slid on his ass down everest was just too long for the tape box
