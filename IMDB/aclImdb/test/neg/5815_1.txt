i saw this film when it came out let me see nowthis guy who had earlier skied down mount fuji manages to accumulate the funding and hire personnel to document what sounds on the surface like a bold and daring actto ski down the worlds highest peak welland here comes the spoilerwhat happens see after a large crew of people manage to help him get near the topand a life is lost in the bargainhe gets on his skis manages to make it down a very very short way at which point his parachute opensand thats that and instead of burning the footage to hide this amazingly anticlimactic ending to an embarrassing debacle the guy goes ahead and releases it spoiler ends i do admire the amazing courage and effort it must have taken the film crew to get some of the stunning shots they got another spoileroh yes one of the sherpas is killed by falling into a crevasse the narrator who is quoting the daredevil skier casually remarks that according to the sherpa religion since this mans body cannot be recovered his soul will roam the world forever and never know rest is it worth it the narrator muses yes he answersbecause it served the purpose of letting this clown ski down everest i cant remember ever seeing a more meretricious piece of celluloid this is one to miss at all costs
