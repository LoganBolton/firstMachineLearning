may contain spoilers sadly lou costellos last film has the distinction of being slightly better than abbott  costellos last movie together dance with me henry this movie isnt all in all outright terrible it is an amusing career misfire dorothy provine is nice to look at and makes the movie somewhat bearable you cant blame lou costello for this because a major studio released it which meant somebody had to give it the green light in my opinion lou costello was getting over problems of his own losing his son a few years earlier and the unwarranted attacks from the irs if you look at the last 34 abbott  costello movies you can notice the magic was gone check out dance with me henry now thats a painful movie to watch
