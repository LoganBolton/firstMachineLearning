thank god this has not been renewed by itvbr br this series while popular god knows why has a very simple  look ive found another body behind the flowersbushestreeswherever they are working  for the sixteenth time this series plot the dialogue is so simple its as though this has been written for children  talking down to the viewer and explaining every plot pointbr br they just happen to be around when someone does something out the ordinary  and noone notices thembr br every time they look into and investigate someones murder they get in the way of everyone else  messing up the lives of all  including those completely innocentbr br they break and enter into peoples homes stealing items and evidence even firearms being nosey and getting into peoples lives spying on them and going through their stuff they never apologise never get caught or arrested and if they do they can talk their way out of it even though another character who does the same gets put in prisonbr br they always come up trumps now i know that this is an easy going series but i think that realistically this should not have made it past the first few episodes put simply its unrealisticbr br i think that they have found enough bodies in the undergrowth both here and on the continent where they are every other week so i do hope it never comes backbr br itv should get some action on the screen instead of all the years of humdrum  someones been murdered at the village fair  again type series
