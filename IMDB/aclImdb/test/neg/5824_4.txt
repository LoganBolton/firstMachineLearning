i think purvis starts out to do a gay gone with the wind if so sorry tag it didnt happen it also didnt happen as a gay sexploitation flick i guess im confused what are we trying to do here much as id like to i simply cant get to where i care even a little about these characters this movie is effective in capturing a taste of the decadence that lives in the south it does nothing to explain enlighten or advance my understanding of a gay relationship or the conflict the protagonist seems to be grappling with
