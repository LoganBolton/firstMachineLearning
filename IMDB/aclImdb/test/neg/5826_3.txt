first of i should point out that i used to love winnie the pooh as a child and i really enjoyed the tigger movie even though i am in my 20sbr br but this movie was so bad i was ashamed to have been a fan in my youthbr br ok ok i know this is a movie for kids and isnt aimed at people like me anyway but this is my thoughts on the movie for other people of my agebr br the main downfall in this film is the heffalump itself it has to be the most annoying character i have seen in a childs movie possibly even more annoying then the young child in monsters inc it has the most annoying voice and prattles around singing stupid things and making even more stupid comments i know pooh movies arent exactly high brow but this was insulting to even a 2 year olds intelligencebr br secondly  where was the story previous pooh outings had a least a point to the story yes i can see this was about accepting people who are different to you into your hearts  but really it ended and i felt like i had watched a 5 minute cartoon on kids tvbr br i dont have children of my own but when i do i fully intend to show them quality childrens movies like the tigger movie toy story and finding nemo even though they are too childish for me these days i can see how they would be of great appeal to young children not so with this appalling attempt at a moviebr br oh and one more thing  not enough eeyore he should have his own movie
