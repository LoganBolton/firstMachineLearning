all in all this is a movie for kids we saw it tonight and my child loved it at one point my kids excitement was so great that sitting was impossible however i am a great fan of aa milnes books which are very subtle and hide a wry intelligence behind the childlike quality of its leading characters this film was not subtle it seems a shame that disney cannot see the benefit of making movies from more of the stories contained in those pages although perhaps it doesnt have the permission to use them i found myself wishing the theater was replaying winniethepooh and tigger too instead the characters voices were very good i was only really bothered by kanga the music however was twice as loud in parts than the dialog and incongruous to the filmbr br as for the story it was a bit preachy and militant in tone overall i was disappointed but i would go again just to see the same excitement on my childs facebr br i liked lumpys laugh
