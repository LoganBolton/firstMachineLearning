everyonce in a while4kids brings new shows to its company for the past few years they brought pure gold like kirby right back at ya or mew mew power but recenetly 4kids has been off catdog is one of the examplesbr br its hard to write a negative comment without bashing the show but in truth weekenders is pure garbage it revolves around a group who with an over active brain the catch though is anything he thinks up comes bad it may sound good on paper but after watching it youll realize how far from good this show isbr br the pizza guy is an extremely dumb character hes very 1dimensional theres really not much to him hes hyperactive end of story though many feel all the character are a rip off of the south park i think just the contrary mechazawa from cromartie highschool is an interesting character and hes able to make me laugh tino fail to do either of the twobr br the cast for the show isnt any better like tinos mom they suffer from lack of character they only stick to one characteristic and thats it the only redeeming quality is the fact that the show can cause you to smirk whether its that the scene may actually be funny or you may just smirk because how stupid it isbr br thje weekenders is a very crappy show from disney4kids though it does seem to love some fans it should really be left to the kids
