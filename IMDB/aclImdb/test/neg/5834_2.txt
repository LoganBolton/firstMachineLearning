its a space flick or at least i think it is you got halfnaked female prisoners in a space prison and a monster on a space station using a virus to infect humanity through sexy encounters its friggin hilarious the acting is so bad that space nuts looks like an emmy award winning film the story is simple space prisoner gets chance to reduce sentence by investigating a space station that lost contact with humanity she finds a doctor experimenting with women and a angry of alien she fights them so on and so forth its a movie worth seeing it just to wet your pants with laughter if you like real scifi flicks its a nono but its a great mood setter for the amateur film maker because i can guarantee their film is better than this
