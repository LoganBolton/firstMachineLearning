i challenge you to watch this film and deny the above statement that is if you can stop looking at her practically flawless face she also does a bit of fighting and a bit of shooting but not nearly as much as i was hoping for the film is extremely slowmoving and lowbudgeted though at least they tried to find an excuse for the spaceship being so underpopulated nearly the entire crew is on suspended animation and the ship moves on auto pilot and the heroine doesnt rescue any of them or bring anything useful back home it seems that tricking that evil lady into traveling through space was the only part of her mission that couldnt be more easily accomplished by the missiles that blow up the ship at the end there are also some long but rather tame softcore scenes and a couple of alienripoff monsters that kill about 2 people 12 out of 4
