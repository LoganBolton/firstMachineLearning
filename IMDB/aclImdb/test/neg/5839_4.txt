im no slouch at finding redeeming social value whatever book or film people want to suppress from huck finnheart of darkness to i dont know deep throat or the latest hostage beheading i sincerely wish they wouldnt im not a lover of porn or of violenceasentertainment but what of them i chance upon i tend to see camera angles cuts pans lighting rhythms nearly to the exclusion of fear or titillation sometimes even missing filmmakers or actors intent even from footage that reasonable people may argue should never have existed i always imagine theres something to learn i wonder more at how a film does than about what it does maybe thats wrong of me wiser but harder than deconstructing unpleasant cinema might be to see cuts pans etc at one with and inseparable from no matter what content i ask myself what horror filmmakers and church architects have in common add in political filmmakers fascist and not all manipulate with light space and sound in order to alter perception and mood how different are their goals how different are the goals of those who film real atrocities for use as propaganda br br when the original all night long anl trilogy appeared on my shelf i left it unwatched for nearly year curiosity had made me buy it i sampled a few minutes of 1 the day it arrived up to the awkwardly soundeffected street corner stabbing that seems really an attack on film viewers sensibility found it inept but effective id have to come back to it certainly but didnt relish the prospect clearly this wasnt the sublime horror of kairo cure angel dust lain the rawer but still traditionally framed horror of the first evil dead trap the overtly political work of koji wakamatsu or even the brilliant crudity of early cronenbergbr br maybe that word attack is key matsumura attacks not his characters but his viewers i cant watch these at this point in history without thinking of both abu garib some of which i think i recall was evidenced on video and the hostage videos but also about godards torturers in le petit soldat to whom atrocity is just a job a fraction of a persons workday and then theres the prolonged northern california news story whose details i barely remember but cant entirely forget because it too entails cinema a duo of serial killers notorious if suggestion isnt playing games with my memory for having videotaped themselves torturing victimsbr br all three anl entries are revenge cinema vigilante exercises but im attaching these notes anl3 because its the most ambitious and may constitute a turning point for director matsumura i havent seen the entries that followed anl3 through the first two offerings i imagined a camera fallen into the hands of one of those fringe kids from middle or grammar school who obsessively draw war scenes or other atrocities or as if one of matsumuras revengecrazed characters had turned writerdirector anyone watching these who hasnt seen michael powells peeping tom would do well to see it but anl3 seems to aspire to mainstream matsumuras protagonist grows carnivorous plants allowing for some typically japanese cool closeup nature shots theres also for the first time a matsumura film a traditionally erotic sequence kikuos female boss sneaks up and begins to caress him while hes peeping at the love hotels customers kikou finds himself unhappily sandwiched between hes a middleman voyeur the brief thrill comes from the layers of voyeurism theres even a philosophicalpoetic garbage sifter a garbage voyeur who somehow makes me think of the poem repeated in wakamatsus notatallwhatitsoundslike go go secondtime virginbr br im getting nowhere with this and its getting in the way of my commenting other films cant escape the suspicion that a few years on ill walk into a matsumura retrospective at my local film archive maybe hosted by some learned character whos caught onto something im missingbr br how much does it matter whether the director is or simply gets his lethally muddled protagonists does he even have to understand them maybe a directors job is just to spew it out then let critics sociologists and the rest of us hash things out maybe directorial or artistic responsibility is a bogus notionbr br my final struggle with this thing had me wondering what on earth a woman thinks watching these overwhelmingly male exercises we put women through this over and over from star wars to et cetera and et cetera and on and on and on and on but is anything quite as maleskewed as the all night longs
