a good example of the differences between american and foreign cinema can be seen in a film i recently watched on television indecent proposalbr br indecent proposals two protagonists david and diane murphy are played woody harrelson and demi moore im not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they were not acting well but why we should care so much whether these two stay together was beyond me love affection playfulness attraction  none of these materialized on screen in their interactions togetherbr br since i knew that eventually robert redford would show up it was clear from the beginning that the good part the meat of the movie would be the scenes between him and demi moore poor woody harrelson just could not muster any emotion at all for the film he seemed to be holding back preoccupied with his receding hairlinebr br ok so fast forward what idiots these two diane and david are for thinking they can win back the 50000 they owe by gambling no acting faux pas there just hideously bad lazy unforgivable writing of course they lose all their money surprised i know i wasnt enter robert redford john gage in the film  a romantic perhaps emotionally frigid man an updated gatsby a very good role and though not a great great actor next to those two redford looks like olivier he immediately falls in love and lust with diane and we the viewers for once feel it this is how to love a woman not davids way trading gum mouth to mouth with diane on a slimy pier did i see that right as gage redford wears a suit and tie in every scene yes its meant to instruct the seemingly brain dead audience that here is a rich man but he also looks damn good and by this point the brain dead audience appreciates it other wardrobe symbolism includes davids nowironed shirts at the end of the film signifying resolve getting it together after a long interlude of forlorn wrinkled shirt wearingbr br and what is it with california garden parties as depicted in hollywood movies suddenly everyone appears british complete with lacy dresses three piece suits for the men hats hats and of course the parasol yes diane her transformation to rich mans fiancée now complete is there at the auction daintily twirling a parasol though she insisted that she couldnt be bought she succumbed at last to the sexual tension here is where the film branches off into pure americana i mean of course david and diane will end up together my question is why diane was bored with david why not let her ride the robert redford wave and i mean for a good long while how can she pull herself out of the sexualromantic thrall of this sexy older man so easily just because woody harrelson brings his receding hairline to the garden party sits himself down and looks demi moore in the eyes thats just not how it goes he was so weakbr br but we must have our happy ending we have to swallow the moral lesson were not sophisticated enough yet to have it otherwise director lyn tried to make a fatal attraction for the juvie set the youngunsbr br in addition to garden parties in which theres nary an suv tee shirt or baseball cap in sight such films also feature a reliable public transportation system that connects farflung california cities and municipalities how else to symbolize the return to middle class or working class life
