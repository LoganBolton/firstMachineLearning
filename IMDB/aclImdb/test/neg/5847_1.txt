demi and woody are married but theyre poor they meet robert redford and hes really rich he takes a fancy to demi and since hes a gambling man he makes the couple an indecent proposal one million dollars for a night with the little womanbr br at this point you need watch no more of the film because you can put the details together in your sleep of course demi is going to accept the offer if she doesnt theres no first half of the movie of course it will affect demi and woodys marriage if it doesnt theres no second half of the movie and of course everything will turn out okay by the time the credits roll if it doesnt theres no happy ending for the sake of box officebr br the absolute best thing you can say about indecent proposal is that demi moore looks good in a black dress as for the rest the script is incompetent the direction amateurish the performances negligible i suspect redford moore and harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned do themand more importantly yourselfa favor unless some one offers you a million miss itbr br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
