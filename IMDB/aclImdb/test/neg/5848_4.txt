spoilers throughoutbr br not good the movie differed completely from the booknot that the book was exactly a classic but it really was very goodbr br i guess demi moore was ok actually i dont really remember to much about her performance one way or the other however the big disappointment wasnt with ms moorebr br why did whoever did the rewrite decide to suddenly make the millionaire have a heart im referring to him as the millionaire because he also had a different name in the movie then the book versionjust another changebr br people who didnt read the book obviously wont know anythings different but in the book version this guy is much more ruthless as well as complex overall he is also fascinating the fact that such a big change was made in the movie alters the whole plot it was almost like seeing a completely different moviebr br i know many movies vary widely from the books but i also thought redfords character was a bit of a wimp this isnt redfords faulthes a great actor and could have played ruthless well but without those qualities he becomes just another dazzled man in love hence the story becomes just another clich√© love story involving 1 woman and 2 men that wasnt really the point of the bookbr br this could have been a lot better even if i hadnt read the book version i wouldnt have liked this all that much but changing so much around definitely takes it for me a few points down
