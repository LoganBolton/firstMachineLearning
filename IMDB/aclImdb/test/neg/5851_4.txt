the commercials for rat race made it look too juvenile for me to enjoy but since my boyfriend adores this movie and the soundtrack i finally relented and watched it with him tonight i make him watch david lynch films and all sorts of obscure indie stuff i recently forced urbania on him so i felt i owed him an innocuous hollywood productbr br i didnt want to hurt his feelings so i saved my bitching for yalls yeah rat race has its moments but a great deal of it irritated me lets start at the beginning rat race was marketed as a family film so i was a little surprised to discover that the first scene centered around a porno movie i can hear it now mommy what does afro whores mean this scene has no purpose in this movie other than to cram some naughtiness into a pg13 moviebr br and while were still on the segments in the casino its pretty convenient that all the characters happened to play within the same time frame the slots that held the gold coins what would have happened if they didnt would those millionaire gamblers just sit around and wait and how did they get those gold coins in the slots in the first placebr br but im belaboring a plot point thats necessary for the movie to exist so ill press on about whoopi and her longlost daughter theyre meeting for the very first time yet throughout their whole ordeal they dont discuss with each other anything about themselves why make their relationship such a presumably complicated one couldnt they have just been say a mother and daughter on vacation together why the business concerning a longago adoption and why portray the daughter as a hard driving career woman chained to her cell phone who never again needs contact with her business did the screenplay just forget about this subplot and character traitbr br this illustrates the main weakness of this movie  the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable its exhausting when everyone is equally zany and with no identifying traits and another thing  the events arent plausible oh sure the characters can do some quirky things but the characters themselves have to be believable take the naked gun another jerry zucker movie for example frank drebin has some pretty exaggerated moments but everything he does is in theory possible in his world jane is also funny but its a different kind of funny which makes all the difference a character in rat race defying natural laws by leaping onto a speeding train destroys any plausibility the movie may have these clearly arent real people so why should i care about thembr br another problem i have with rat race is a moral one the characters obtain their modes of transport almost totally by theft i know i know this is just a silly comedy and the same actions didnt bother me fifteen years ago when i saw million dollar mystery but theres a lot of lawbreaking in rat race and it bothers me now and i wont delve into the whole airportsabotage sequence other than to wonder if the screenwriters didnt consider the reallife implications of such an action was that scene funny before 911br br ill skip over the distasteful bits concerning the heart the drugging of ones family and the nazis whose buildup and payoff worked better in an episode of seinfeld and move on to complain about the acting rowan atkinson started out annoying and ended insufferable i dont know when i liked a comical character less and the three oscar winners need new agents whoopi came off best but she didnt have much to work with loved the copper perm and purple lipstick though kathy bates part was shrill but mercifully brief cuba wasoh man cuba babe please fire your agent following instinct and chill factor this is your third strike be glad i havent seen pearl harbor or snow dogs  its time to give your 97 best supporting actor oscar back to its rightful owner edward norton for primal fear an actor of your stature has no business running halfnaked through the desert and being checked out by a transvestite lucille ball impersonator do you even read the scripts to your movies anymore or are you reaching into a bag and pulling your next project out at randombr br theres other small points that bother me how did grisham and the hooker get to the loot so fast but basically rat race amounts to little more than your basic batch of character types being hindered by arbitrary obstacles on their way to a rather underwhelming and inexplicable ending they give the money to charity what kind of ending is that yeah its the noble thing to do never mind the probability of crosspromotionlicensing whores smash mouth do they ever say no to selling out putting on a benefit concert in the middle of the new mexico desert but who would honestly do such a thing yes they say its the journey not the destination that makes a trip worthwhile but theres no journey without a destination if there was ever an example of a wrong happy ending this would be it what a bummer end to a movie that despite my nitpicking here i did enjoy parts of i confess to enjoying the bit with the cow and some of the lucy stuff along with the character with the tongue piercing  at first i thought his indecipherable speech would run me up a wall but he grew to be my favoritebr br but as far as my boyfriend knows i found rat race quite funny and charmingbr br
