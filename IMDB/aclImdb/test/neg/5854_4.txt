astroesque 2 outta 5 starsbr br i have no idea what the title is supposed even less of an idea of what is supposed to be going on in this movie half the time yet it still kept me sort of interested this is low low budget filmmaking along the lines of el mariachi filmed in 16mm and for what its worth the shots are very wellcomposed and visually stylish directed written by and starring comic book writerartist michael allred i guess its no surprise that the film looks good unfortunately some of the acting is beyond bad and the rest is competent at best allred himself comes off the best but only because he doesnt actually speak much he just strides around looking cool most of the time or running from crazed rednecks who are trying to kill him the sound is also pretty bad almost as if it was unfinished in places maybe they couldnt afford to pay for the music theyd planned to use strange vaguely sciencefictiony plot similar in tone to the man who fell to earth but most of the film boils down to a standard runfromthebadguys and killthembeforetheykillyou plot ultimately too oblique to be successful but not without interest for adventurous movie watchers
