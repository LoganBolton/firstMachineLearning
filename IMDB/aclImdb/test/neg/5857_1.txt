i saw this film last night a satire of the reality style programs that seem to be making the rounds at the momentbr br what can i say i absolutely hated it about as interesting as watching paint dry and with maybe one or two only slightly amusing momentsbr br maybe it had something to do with me definately not being a fan of the survivor and big brother type shows but if this had been a videodvd or if id been watching at the cinema on my own i would have definately not endured more than the first 5 minutesbr br
