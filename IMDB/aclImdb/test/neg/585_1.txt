terrible the only way i could even begin to consider it funny is if it made fun of itself amazing its about an ass that fights crime and he drinkssmokes how very funny its funny because where most people put things in their mouth he puts them in himself and now hes getting sexual service from some lady this show is so great that is what i would have to say if i liked the show though im sure you can see the obvious sarcasm ive noticed some people have been comparing this show to 12 oz mouse and squid billies why would you even try theres nothing to compare the other two shows actually have some decent character development in conclusion i hate assy mcgee i twinge at the name of it
