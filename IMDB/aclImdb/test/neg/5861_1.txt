spoilers ahead but that shouldnt matter since i hope you wont see this one anywaybr br if you planned to see this one i have to strongly advice you not to because this was one of the most wasted 1Â½ hours ive experiencedbr br first of all this is an complete ripoff of the great movie battle royale it is as stupid as watching any lame american tvshow like cops or candid camerabr br the plot are totally predictable one challenger pregnant and another is a nurse anyone doing some logic thinking understands in the beginning what should happen between thosebr br the concept is ripped as mentioned before and the movie lacks the violence necessary of making this movie enjoyable i mean the preggo shoots a guy in the back and no blood or not even any trace of the hit in the backbr br i could go on forever without finding anything good about it so take your money and get a copy of battle royale instead of watching this piece of crapbr br 1 out of 10 too bad i couldnt rate it lower almost makes scream 3 a masterpiece
