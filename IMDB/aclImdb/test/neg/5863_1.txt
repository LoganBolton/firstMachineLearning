this is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen  it has no good features at allbr br it looked as if it was made in about 20 minutes with the other time filled with title graphicsbr br the lead male transformed from deaths door to superman  eh you whatbr br other than that totally predictable and not at all interestingbr br i left the cinema feeling cheatedbr br needless to say i could not reccoemnd this film to anyone
