it is often hard to decide what the best film is that youve ever seen since this may vary by genre preferences for actorsactresses or even the mood youre in on a particular day having said that this movie is by far in my opinion the worst movie ive ever seen i thought the acting was terrible was there any the plot was just idiotic and the props were totally fakey could a lower budget production be created without being an amateur production i dont think so even the friends i watched the movie with agreed that it was the worst video we ever rented and to this day we still joke about the night we saw this movie
