wow well you know those shock things they use in hospitals to get your heart pumping again i needed one for my brain after watching this movie it literally took me almost 4 hrs in total to watch because i had to take a break and restart my brain to seminormal functionality every so often i mean this movie goes soooooo slooooow its ridiculous to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous they just dont talk and while talking isnt everything and i admit there were some scenes where only the music was necessary and the music is great that was probably the best part but then go listen to a symphony or something and forget about the movie so many people give this awesome reviews and for its time id say the special effects and filmography is quite good but as for the acting or lack thereof it just needed a little something more no shootem ups or sex etc profanity isnt even required but a little more emotion these guys were like stones just sitting there with long faces all in all if you need something to calm yourself down just play the movie dont even start at the beginning if youve seen it before just start anywhere lay down and relax itll put you right to sleep
