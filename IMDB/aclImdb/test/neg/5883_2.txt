i was expecting to this to be hilarious and it was mediocre at best the only funny character is believe it or not andy dick the timing was just horrible on most of the jokes  gags and the writing was bad i mean i know its supposed to be like blaxploitation but it just did work besides this whole genre has been beaten to death already with all the austin powers movies  undercover brother it just seems old it also just feels like a rip off from undercover brother which also wasnt hysterical but a lot funnier than this also for an comedyaction movie the direction was kind of bland i dont know if this is going to be released in theaters but it definatley is made for tv
