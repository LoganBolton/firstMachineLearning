this is an extremely competent movie technically the camera work and direction are excellent and the acting is fine as wellespecially the fine acting by daniel auteuil as the marquis i really thought there were no problems at all with these aspects of the film instead i was a bit annoyed by the way the marquis was portrayed as it didnt seem all that honest and seems to be a very revisionistic view of history in fact in recent years the marquis has undergone a bit of a transformation to a defender of freedom with great insight not the fat sadomasochist rapist he really was in a way this is highly reminiscent of the whitewash given in the people versus larry flintwhere these men are elevated to hero status even if you dont think that the marquis perversions werent all that bad they included rapes and extreme violence his portrayal in this film as a sexual social worker in this prison seems pretty silly instead of the violent and selfish sade he spends a lot of time carefully grooming a young virgin and slowly helps her to explore her own sensuality what a nice and kind man in fact now that i think about it this performance reminds me of the man maurice chavalier played in gigi but without the singinga cute older man who loves the ladies i strongly doubt the reallife marquis de sade would have recognized this character at allbr br the film surprisingly doesnt have a lot of nudity though what it does show is extremely explicit only a maniac would let their kids see this as this is a very adult drama its very wellmade and pretty entertainingjust not all that truthful the director admits that the film is largely fictional in the interview among the special features on the dvd i watched so go ahead and see the film if youd likeunderstanding it just isnt very good historically during the 18th century sexual libertines were quite accepted in france as they were pretty broadminded so despite what the movie implies it wasnt sex that was the issue it was the violence and rape that was and still is the problem
