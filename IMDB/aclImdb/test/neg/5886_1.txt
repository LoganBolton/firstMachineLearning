baby boom was bad enough basically making a series of every straight mans nightmare is worse yeah watched a few always made me feel better after a bad day it reminded me it could be worse guy was rich successful singlesmart man and dating celebs from singers to actresses then his screw up of a cousin dumps his biggest mistake on him in reality it would have been straight to foster care im sure this was definitely a chic series oh and whats all the wining about the baby change most the time its probably a doll besides at that age its nothing more than a prop anywaysbr br any case im glad it didnt last more than a year
