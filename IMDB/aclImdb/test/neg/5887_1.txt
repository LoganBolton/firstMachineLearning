at the least some of the sitcoms that churn endlessly out of the us are honestly bad this junk however portrays a heart warming parenty side to a clothes horse acting laughably learnt with glances and phrases delivered in the im so important and thin and beautiful fashion in the episode i just sat agog through someones job was at risk simply because a colleague had placed a phone call slagging her capabilities off   really this is the lowest of the low what kind of damage does this foist on the watching masses seeing only glitzy glampuss people parading around working utterly sick making when the titles rolled i thought oh well it provided jobs for the boys you know who you are
