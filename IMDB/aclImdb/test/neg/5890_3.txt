i just saw this movie last night and after reading all the reviews i expected a good emotional sports film what i got was something clichéd and boring yes i thought it was boring i saw the allstar getting hurt long before the game i figured maybe theyd wait for him to collapse until ya know the game before the big one but i guess the first game is good enoughbr br the parental relationships were also very clichéd with the dominating drunk father i will say mcgraw impressed me however and the boy who wants to stay and help his ailing motherbr br i especially liked the random girls melissa and maria who were in the movie for all of 5 minutes and placed there simply to get the football boys some action off the field i thought ok now how does this work into the plot again maybe i missed the point beyond well they play football in a town that loves it so the girls throw themselves at their feet pointbr br the sports action had some good points but most of it was so rushed i think the first game lasted longer than the montage of the entire playoffs and i wasnt so sure about the continuity of the windingdown clock in the final gamebr br i guess i could see this movie winning the espy for best sports film if it was the only one released honestly though i found it to be a boring movie full of people sickeninglyobsessed with the pigskin for a better football film see remember the titans
