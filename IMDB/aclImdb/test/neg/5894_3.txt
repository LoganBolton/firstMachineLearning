well never know the truth about 911 and this shoddy movie proves itbr br i recently watched a youtube report claiming there were no planes involved in the twin towers destruction that all the news programs were supposedly provided with sameangle shots of the towers from a mysterious source probably the gubmint and in that provided footage cgi planes were substituted for reallife missiles which actually hit the towersbr br its a compelling video and though i am not a wacko conspiracy theorist per se i am still not sure myself whether actual planes hit anything that day the towers the shanksville field the pentagon  because there is no plane wreckage available and what about those infamous black boxes none recovered a million other theories abound all of them courting a droplet of truth awash in an ocean of speculation but youll drown in malarkey before you find anything truthful or worth speculating about in the 911 commission report a nobudget movie that is trying to close the barn door after all the horses and jihadists have escapedbr br writerdirector leigh scott is obviously a concerned american citizen who wanted to enlighten audiences on what the 560page report might reveal it would help if his movie had actors instead of a guy who looks like david duchovny a chick who looks like gina gershon a guy who thinks hes russell crowe and another guy who im pretty sure is trying hard to be sean bean it would help if his camera operator didnt have parkinsons if the lighting director wasnt trying to save on electricity it would help if his editor didnt have attention deficit disorder or if the soundtrack wasnt some tuneless new world order esoterica and the looping should have probably been inserted when people were actually moving their mouthsbr br we cant even call this propaganda its too funny and by funny i mean unwatchablebr br you cant squeeze an issue this complex into a twohour film but leigh scott tries anyway including all those sexy catchphrases weve grown inured to bin ladens intent to attack purchasing weapons from somalia nonaggression agreement with iraq mussawi attending flight school weapons of mass destructionbr br the problem is we know its all retrospect so every discussion the concerned intelligence operatives have with each other reeks of fake hindsight all crammed into a neat conversation like contrived reverse engineering everything pertinent is mentioned succinctly so that we can shake our heads in wonder at how incompetently all these branches of government screwed upbr br theres a ludicrous interrogation scene with a lubricious bimbo beating up on a guy with tomato sauce on his face now  that would be considered torture if most guys didnt consider it a turnonbr br the tagline is what if the attack could have been stopped by this movies account  and we presume according to the commission report  the cia and other underground agencies were all set to capture bin laden and didnt everyone involved with the terrorism reports you mean you actually read these reports is so concerned we just want to slap them for their bad actingbr br yet the whole story goes so much deeper than the banal soundbytes the negligent ku bush klan foisted on the american people after 911 we now know that even capturing bin laden before the 911 attack would not have changed or achieved anything  the wheels were in motion with or without that taliban figurehead whose involvement was the possible figment of someones fevered imagination to unite america against a common enemy contrary to popular belief they didnt attack us as ron paul tried to elucidate it was a case of middle eastern blowback  they were so sick of america planting their infidel feet over there that they brought the war over here so though george w death likes to tout the nonsensical were fighting them over there so we wont have to fight them over here in reality because were over there the fight has been brought over here br br the 911 attack was not so much about the intricate planning of terrorists as it was the gross negligence of the bush administration who we know without the probing of commissions had all the intel from the clinton administration onwards information about terrorist cells reaching critical mass and their intent to cause chaos but the oil idiot of texas who refused to read his daily briefings and would rather vacation at his crawford ranch than spend one extra day at work abrogated the duty he swore an oath to perform  protect the american publicbr br and then the scum who called himself president used the attacks brought about by his negligence as a political hammer against his own dumbeddown countryfolk to score a second term shred the american constitution and take america into a fake war on the basis of a lie wmd with a country that had nothing to do with the 911 attacks strangely enough the movie never treads near the ku bush klan offering no opinion or judgment leigh scott wanting to remain neutral tell that to the raped and pillaged hundreds of thousands in the fake war on terror in iraqbr br out of pure coincidence i realized i was watching this dvd while wearing my bush lied thousands died tshirt
