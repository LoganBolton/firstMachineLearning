i tried lord help me how i tried but there are just some people almost incapable of creating quality brett ratner uwe boll britney spears and asylum to their credit the 911 commission report seems like an honest attempt by the company to advance into a more sophisticated state of storytelling and movie making but for all intents and purposes it comes off as another truly film in their gallery at the opening the disclaimer notifies audiences that all the names have been changed but the names of the terrorists remain relatively the same a man named mussaui attempts to learn how to fly a plane with a stone cold grimace that would instantly make anyone uneasy this undercover agent is able to learn how to fly on a small computer and you have to wonder not how he was able to get into this program so easily but on how these people didnt even ask questions because this scene is so farfetched in its presentation and the actor playing this man is extremely over the top and you can see that director scott attempts to mimic paul greengrass with a bright grainy photography thats followed by an awfully dizzying and irritating handheld direction that throughout the entire film attempts to take off from greengrasss gungho guerrilla filmmaking techniques br br you can sense scott emulating greengrasss technique for realism but it becomes rather lamebrained halfway in meanwhile the film comes off less a traffic take off and more a take off on law  order in which well have the disclaimer notifying us the names have been changed the logo almost reminiscent of the law  order logo and then ninety minutes of the actors pumping their chests and discussing politicsbr br neither of which are ever as compelling as it tries to be and then when the film seems as if its attempting to be an adult drama scott relies on his old failsafe the sex scene scotts new film looks like it really wants to be thought of as a low budget munich but its not and it manages to be underwhelming on every such occasion possible the 911 commission report falls flat and thats because its limited in its attempts to imitate other filmsbr br while i appreciate the ambition inherent behind the camera this new perspective of the events leading up to 911 is flat and dull hard as it may try to be a lowbudget munich its only really as entertaining as a normal dolph lundgren film youd find on cinemax
