i rented the dvd in a video store as an alternative to reading the report but its pretty much just more terrortainmentbr br while the film may present some info from the report in the drama youre taking the word of the producers  theres no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film not onebr br the acting all around is pretty bad  pretty much all of the stereotypes of hot shot bitchy foul mouthed government agents each thinking they know more than everyone else there may be some truth to it but it really has a bad hollywood stereotype smell to itbr br imdbs user community ratings  comments tend to be more right than wrong and i have started to glance at the ratings before renting whenever i canbr br i wish i had on this one
