i will never get back the three hours of life this film has stolen from mebr br the film is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process id love to know what they were on when this film was being madebr br its also the most historicallyinaccurate film in existence 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or predictions taking placebr br characters are unlikeable design is simplistic and everything just rambles on without any sense or logic to itbr br and the ending is probably the worst of it its supposed to be thoughtprovoking but the only thought that entered my mind is what the fk is going on br br id say for anyone looking for serious entertainment purposes avoid this film at all cost and choose a scifi movie that isnt stuck up its own
