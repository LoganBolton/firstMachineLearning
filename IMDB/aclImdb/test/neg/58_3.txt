that snarlbr br that scowlbr br the acts of random violencebr br the gutteral voicebr br the fetish wearbr br that shaven headbr br it can mean only one thingbr br grace jones is backbr br actually my sources tell me that the title role in blade wasnt played by the 1980s diva but by wesley snipesbr br all in all this is not an improvementbr br blade is an adaptation of a comic character somehow in the transfer from the simplistic twodimensional world of the printed page it has become even more simplistic and lost a couple of dimensionsbr br the plot is hackneyed almost beyond belief and adds nothing to the vampire genre in fact much like nosferatu it seems to suck the life out of the audience in brief upwardly mobile vampire wants to become more powerful but is opposed by blade halfhuman halfvampire all annoying it all climaxes with blade being put in a vampire juice press some bad martial arts and the most pitiful cgi since 1968br br blade has to be the least empathic character since dolph lundgrens punisher also a comic adaptation perhaps there is a trend here surely the audience is meant to be on the same side as the hero and whilst a vampire can be a tragic character this is not true of blade he is relentlessly cruel scornful and not a whole lot better than the bad guysbr br i assume that wesley snipes has an acting career purely so that everyone else can be compared favourably as he snarls his way through his movie you find yourself looking for a stake  even a ballpoint pen  anything to put blade in the grave br br as a piece of narcissism blade is pretty much unbeatable  we are treated to endless lingering shots of a gymfresh snipes for no reason whatsoever likewise no other actor is allowed any chance to give a reasonable performance the likes of steven dorff can act but they have to play second fiddle to snipes tedious performancebr br kris kristofferson used to appear in good movies here he is reduced to a sidekick that you just know isnt going to make it through to the final reel and what happens when blade finds out yes you guessed it he rushes to the scene to wreak his revenge in the villains giant underground lairbr br why cant worlddomination take place in a quiet country house they always go ahead in underground cathedrals that would have had albert speer wondering if they were a little grandiose a lot of these plans could be stopped right now if local councils paid more attention to plans for extending subbasements br br the rest of the movie is just as dull and unimaginative with nothing new to add to the genre vampires have been done to undeath and perhaps they should be laid to rest for a while  at least until someone can think of some way to make them interesting againbr br to finish there is a grace jones vampire movie its called vamp and its about ten times better than this
