this movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward attended by two orderlies the unconscious main character is heard in a voice over saying that the orderlies are gay the orderlies kiss i watched this in a dvd version and i have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny  it said comedy on the dvd case after all and it goes on like that had i seen this in a movie theater i probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny  and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isnt this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isntbr br brilliant brains can make anything funny people like ernst lubitsch billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact but you have to know the mechanics i suppose director and coscriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those mechanics he thinks that certain things simply are funny the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani levy cant not for me anywaybr br the main problem i have with this movie is that i cant see a reason behind the way the main characters behave i could not understand why the two brothers one an orthodox jew from west germany one a third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly disliked each other they are both rather bland characters their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other well one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin but even these incestuous relationships  if anything they are embarrassing  just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything betterbr br the acting is not bad udo semel i actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl a lighter version than of a venerable orthodox jew the direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe levy should stick to directing movies leaving the scriptwriting to someone else now i heard he did a comedy about hitler oi vai
