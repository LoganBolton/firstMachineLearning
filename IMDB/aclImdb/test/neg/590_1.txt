2001 is one of those movies where if you dont like it you are told that you dont get it and need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism youre told that you clearly have a slow attention span and just want to see sex explosions and have the plot handed to you on a platterbr br lets break down the movie shall we three minutes of blackness with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background then we get the opening credits a minute of fascinating shots of the savannah then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones cut to the first of many 20minute shots of ships doing things while the blue danube plays in the background a bunch of pointless dialogue and a group of moon scientists find another monolithbr br cut to a spaceship thats too long for the crew complementthree sleeping people two people named dave and frank who have only slightly more personality than the stiffs in hibernation and then theres hal the perfect supercomputer who runs the ship predictably he snaps and starts breaking the first law of robotics now this is something that has potential an evil coldly ruthless supermind who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move and what does he do he lets one guy float into space and turns off the hibernation machines so the three sleeping guys die leaving dave floating in a pod he simply uses the airlock puts on a spacesuit and turns hal offagonizingly slowly then apparently theres some psychedelic evolution at jupiterbr br heres the movie with the pauses taken out apes see monolith kill things scientists find moon monolith hal kills people hal dies dave gets a prerecorded message and evolves at jupiterbr br this is not me not getting it this is me being bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing sure its realistic but i find i have no reason to care no matter the message no movie can be good without being entertaining frankly every character could be replaced with keanu reeves and nothing would change
