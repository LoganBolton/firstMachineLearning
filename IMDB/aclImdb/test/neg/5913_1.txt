this is truly one of the worst movies ever madeand i dont mean in a sobaditsgood kind of way eddie murphy is a great comic and it is a testament to how bad this movie is that it nearly killed his career the writing and direction are inept the sets and staging about as imaginative as a brady bunch episode and the acting shows just how bad a great cast can be when they have absolutely nothing to work with if it werent for the costumeswhich aside from eddie murphys ego seem to account for the major part of the budgetyou would swear this thing was slapped together by a bunch of high schoolers wasted on peppermint schnapps that anyone could find this travesty in any way funny or entertaining is mindboggling its probably no coincidence that the misguided souls who are praising this stinker are barely literate but if your idea of hilarity is della reese getting her pinkie toe shot off then by all means put aside your drool cup and go rent this movie
