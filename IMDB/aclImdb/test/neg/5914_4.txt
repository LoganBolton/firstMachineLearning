by dane youssefbr br i was kind of looking forward to this one i enjoy eddie murphy and i love it when a star handmakes a vehicle for themselves or when someone who writes decides to mark their own directorial debut but when the stars head gets too big for the rest of his body theres always a danger of a bigbudgeted hollywood vanity productionbr br will the filmmaker keep it real or will he just waste amounts of money the studios ours and time the studios ours  his own patting himself on the back for an hour in a half sadly its the latter herebr br another thing i really like is when someone breathes new and fresh life into an exhausted and driedout genre none of that here the warring nightclub movies have become so wornthrough that even the parodies of it are dreary and done to death br br murphy does neither he does the most clichéd he plugs into a routine conventional formula gangster picture and plays it as seriously as if it were the godfather its like a script where the next draft they put in the jokes and the new ideas but it seems like someone with clout just looked at it and went no this is finebr br probably murphy he is credited all over this in the opening shot of beautiful white satin sheets his name headlines across the credits about five timesbr br the plot a young orphan saves pryors life and pryor adopts the little ragamuffin br br 20 years later pryors dump has become a firstclass hot spot theyre pulling down big money and a gangster wants their action hes even got a dirty cop in his employ but pryor comes up with a scheme a la the sting br br murphys screenplay plays like an unfinished firstdraft that nobody had the pair to call him on the actors arent really allowed to standout much if at all even the almighty murphy seems to be on autopilot br br pryor shows class and gentlemanly manners as sugar ray perhaps it would have been better to name his character brown sugar rayfurther evidence that this one needed a polish but everyone here is basically just on vacation br br the oscarnomination the movie received is richly deserved joe i tompkins best costume design but the production values are the only part that makes the 30s feel authentic br br some sets look somewhat fake but this is supposed to be a comedy of sorts its rare one movie gets nominated for both a razzie and an oscar unless its one of lucas new star wars chaptersbr br its 1938 and everyone is talking like its 1988 particularly the comedians this is a prehistoric white mans formula and with all these black comedians and satirists you expect them to skewer the genre or at least bring new life to it nope murphy is pretty much just coasting herebr br the great roger ebert summed it up perfectly when he remarked in his review murphy approaches his story more as a costume party in which everybody gets to look great while fumbling through a plot that has not been fresh since at least 1938 br br jasmine guy is perfectly cast and seems to be indulging herself in her role and michael lerner has all the looks evil and mannerisms of the prototypical mob boss down pat and there are moments where pryor gives you an idea of what a more interesting leader and authority figure would sound like he gives every scene hes in a feeling of dignitybr br would it have been too much to ask that della resse sing or at least quit embarrassing herself with all her kiss my ass talk br br and the late redd foxx doesnt get to leave much of a swan song here he has some backandforth with resse which could have been some great stuff nope murphy wastes another opportunity again herebr br murphys quick is charismatic and likable but those moments are few and far between for sure murphy has never looked better and never been duller his character made me laugh twice throughout the whole moviebr br stan shaws boxer with a horrible speech impediment isnt just painful and embarrassing its annoying theres more to comedy than simply showing something unpleasant you have to incorporate some kind of light touch and funny situation watching him strain even the some of the easiest words just makes us feel sorry for him and annoyed with murphybr br can murphy write a screenplay well there was raw but that was really standup material he wrote the outline for boomerang and coming to america for sure but her didnt have the last word there maybe a team of erlike script doctors couldve revived this onebr br murphys direction is so slow and quiet youd swear he was asleep at the wheel some of the time he has too many static shots and doesnt seem to know how to build and release suspense on some level i think quick is the real eddie murphy angry young hotheaded and ambitious but occasionally charming now if he were only funny sometimebr br theres a scene in which murphy has a femme fatale in bed who plans to make love with him and kill him you can probably guess how it turns out like everything else in the movie this could have been better but br br surprisingly murphy has not directed another movie since he got a razzie nomination and he no longer writes the finished draft for his films either he won the razzie for writing this br br its great to look at and the music is beautiful and there are a few really nice scenes but that just falls under the category of gems among all the junk not enough of thembr br couldve been shouldve been wasnt oh wellbr br by dane youssef
