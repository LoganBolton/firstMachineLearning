i did and i lost two and a half hours of my life that i can never regain againbr br i honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie and thats not because i cant appreciate art i love a good film with profound messages brilliant cinematography and great directingbr br this film just isnt one of thembr br my main complaint about this film is that its so horribly slowpaced to the point of boring its audience to death on the other hand sequences of dialog go by too quickly and theres not enough exposition to let people who havent read the book know whats going on my mother had mercy on me and explained everything before i watched it would it have killed them to hire a narrator at least for the beginning and the end br br let me break it down for you spoilers throughout br br for the first two minutes you are treated to a black screen with no music waiting for the actual movie to beginbr br for the following minute and a half you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes like the audience couldnt figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four timesbr br the next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys they fight see the monolith fight some more pommel things with a bone supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the monoliths singing not that you could tell if you hadnt read the bookbr br finally we get into space only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the blue danube waltz a pretty quicktempoed waltz as i understand yet here it feels absolutely agonizing at last we get some innocuous dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon we are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of blue danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with antigravitybr br next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station we get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows then were back outside traveling at a snails pace over the moon a second monolith is revealed again filling our ears with that horrible ringing i had no idea that was an actual piece of music the monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forwardbr br seven minutes of watching the ship to jupiter travel by this point in time my brains had turned into mush could it be moving any slower maybe its realistic to portray it as such but we still dont need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its realism let me tell you about this realism thing i cheered when the secondary astronaut character died not because im a sadist and like watching people die but because after five minutes i was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing im supposed to care about this character feel when he dies instead i found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it camebr br anyway now we get to the most interesting part of the filmthe part with hal forget dave the stickofwood protagonist the real star of the show is that coldly impersonal chillingly villainous ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer hes great and the open the pod bay doors sequence is wonderful but its too short and its not long before the director once again lapses into toolong goings onbr br four minutes for hal to die and die he does slowly painfully losing intelligence with every minute voice getting lower and slower singing daisy daisy all with a low and constant hissing that becomes just as annoying as the heavy breathingbr br seven minutes of flying colors as dave enters the monolith seven i could feel my brains melting and dripping out of my ears seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but some guys whacked out psychedelic version of space travel again with that thricecursed chorus we got the idea at the beginning of the sequence why drag it out so long unless he wanted to make lsd users go psychotic and have flashbacksbr br im not even going to try to explain the ending mostly because i dont quite get it myself supposedly hes in an alien research laboratory and theyre teaching him deep and profound things while he watches himself getting older and older and then they send him back to earth as some kind of cosmic celestial space baby none of this comes across in the film for all you know its just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever a lot of the movie felt that waybr br the first time i tried watching this movie i gave up halfway through the second time i suffered through this sore excuse for a film it was to help my sister time the sequences to see how long they lasted its that boringbr br call this crummy film art if you wish i wouldnt ive seen more interesting art in the local museum and i am never subjecting myself to this kind of suffering ever again
