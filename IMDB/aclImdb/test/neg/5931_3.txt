kudos to baxleys dp for making this look like a real movie the first time thats happened in this series with the notable exception of the fx scenes in moving closer to movie production values however it lost most of the entertainment value of the first two they were very much in the so bad theyre good category of horrendous film entertainment can an argument be made though that the believers were simply trying to make a generic action film with praying in it there are so many times in the film where they discard their own belief system as to be annoying if everything that happens is according to gods will and they are simply his instruments than the people who are infected with the virus have that happen as a part of his plan right apply that to every situation where someone of faith doesnt submit to gods will and you get a fairly hypocritical little movie from the director of action jackson
