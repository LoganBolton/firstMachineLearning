as with most viewers of this film im an avid reader of the books the first 2 films have buck ray and chloe as the main characters but in this the second sequel they play secondfiddle to louis gossett jrs presidential effort world at war is based on the meeting he has with buck in the book seriesbr br the problem is  this film is as awful as the first two amanda appears just from nowhere and suddenly has a significant part to play i wont reveal it in case anyone hasnt read the series other illogical parts feature i really really want cloud 10 to make a good left behind film but sadly this is similar in all the bad ways to the first 2
