if andrei tarkovsky had been a hack he would have directed mother and son instead of mirror this is the single most pretentious film made anywhere in the world i am convinced a son without a name takes care of his mother without a name they love each other i guess no they dont im sure these arent characters they arent even actors playing characters at least it could be pretty but even the nature seems ridiculously touched up and changed wherever it was necessary with a macintosh computer and could sokurov have come up with a technique as hackneyed as a distorted aspect ration you would have to have been born yesterday to buy this garbage 110
