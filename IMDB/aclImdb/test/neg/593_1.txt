i am completely into this type of story line but once the movie fired up i honestly said out loud  i just rented a two dollar budget christian pos the only thing i could find to like about this film was it has a descent story but it was awfully executed horrible actors horrible direction and producingbr br the director and producer need to go watch the cube before trying to pull off a movie in a single room there was absolutely nothing that kept you intrigued to the point that you didnt notice you were in the same room the entire movie horrible the two main actresses were very easy on the eyes and you could tell that was the director counting on to hold your attention but these two and their bios can speak to this are horrible in front of the camerabr br dont rent this unless you are blind because it might go up a few stars if you only listen to it
