midnight clear has a great premise a group of overeducated overly bright gis are sent out by incompetent leaders on a vague mission to patrol around an isolated farm house on the eve of the battle of the bulge the gis encounter a group of battleweary german regulars and it becomes clear that they dont want to fight anymorebr br therein lies the problem its really pretty simple if the germans want to surrender they do so and thats the end of the movie if the germans want to fight they do so and thats also the end of the movie so instead of doing either the gis and germans play games with each other even throwing snowballs at one point interesting for one or two scenes but it soon becomes very annoying after all these are germans the enemy nothing in this film makes me think they should not be either taken prisoner or shot the film does noting to make them more human in fact much of what the german characters did made me want to shoot them including one scene where the german officer refuses to deal with a jew or to surrender to a mere enlisted man why should i care about such characters just shoot them and lets move on to the battle of the bulge its much more interesting anywaybr br one good scene the gis are returning from a recon of the german position where they had the germans in their sights but did not fire while walking across a clearing they realize a group of germans have their mausers leveled at them the germans are about 100 yards away the gis then do something ive never seen any gis do in any sillywood movie they throw down their rifles and throw up their hands unusual as this may be in films it is an entirely sensible reaction to having a rifle aimed at you from that distance though it seems far in reality its pointblank range for those rifles ill lay odds that someone working on this film was a cruffler
