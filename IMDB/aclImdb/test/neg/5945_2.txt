my father insisted i should watch this film with him and i regret that i wasted my time watchingi want that approximate hour and a half back the funny little film concerns the elderly don ameche staying with his son tom selleck it turns out that ameche isnt just forgetful like hes been told but has dementia it seems a lot like alzheimers and because dad is so frequently out to lunch he gets into so much trouble again and againalmost like the adorable tyke from babys day out the problem though is that you know babys day out is all fantasy and the baby is going to be fine plus you arent laughing at the baby for having a deformity or illness but in this case you are being encouraged to laugh at a man who is slowly losing his mindand wheres the humor in that if this film had been more successful would the producers have then made films making fun or people with cerebral palsy or a flesheating virus there are a lot of people who should have felt ashamed at having made this film
