folks is a comedy about a man whose parents beg him to kill them because theyre going senile and want to be put out of their misery several times he tries to kill them and then changes his mind saving them from his deathtraps at the last minute and losing one of his body parts each time in the process the movie seems to hate its main character which makes it all the more painful to watch theres also the usual tackedon loveinterest and predictable endingbr br this movie was also the first time id seen tom selleck without a mustache and i remember his shaved upper lip looking weird and making me feel slightly slick but this might have been just because of the terrible premise and lame execution of the movie
