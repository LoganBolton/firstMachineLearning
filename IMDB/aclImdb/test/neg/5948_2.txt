in fact everyone responsible for this dreck ought to be whipped dragged and hung if this is what great eugene oniell drama is like i never want to be victim to viewing it ever again there are so many things wrong w this feature where does one begin first elmer bernsteins bombastic score is present thru out the entire film even in the quiet scenes where background music subtracts from the characters motivations second these characters are not pleasant people and while some reviewers might enjoy that i personally disliked every scene in which ives ate up the scenery but that was the way his characters was written to be disliked w loren it just never is made clear whether shes good or bad  and all her babbling about how shes going to change things back to the way they were before the baby arrives  well i saw what was coming clearly perkins is miscast and then he plays the role like a warmup for norman bates which he played two years later even wanting to take blame for the murder at the end hokey third this film is a studio soundstage production and it suffers because of it the story would have benefited from location shooting to develop a sense of place regarding the farm which all the main leads are fighting over as it is filmed theres no sense of value to the property because the film has a studio soundstage feel to it that isnt convincing this is a really awful film
