just finished watching this movie i couldnt imagine watching this on vhs as there were scenes where i needed the subtitles to hear through an accent or sound effect even though the scene itself was in englishbr br visually the movie is pretty appealing the few cg effects were very obvious insertions but the prostheticscreature effects werent bad not perfect but photography and editing which were pretty good made up for a lot acting was generally bad though how much of that can be blamed on the director i couldnt say having never seen any of the actors before the exception i think was m gomez uxia she stole every scene she had a part in and not just because of a very pretty face but there was something akin to an urgency to her performance that none of the others had the writing could have been a lot better  the plot was still unmistakably lovecraft and plenty of lovecraft details were written in but i personally could have done without most of the dialogue
