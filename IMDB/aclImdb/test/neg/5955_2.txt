there is a reason why the world forgot these creatures they are dull this is a hammer production which means that whoever made this movie should be struck with a hammer several times if possible  and where it most hurts most people put more thought into taking a dump than these idiots have put into making this moviebr br seriously nowÂ… the movie begins with some cavemen hunting an antelopething now antelopes must have evolved a lot from those prehistoric times because they actually attack and kill people here after that its time to meet the rest of the tribe more bearded men some fashionmodels and even a couple of very old greyhaired grannies and grandpas these old geezers obviously never heard about cave people not surpassing the age of 30 they refused to bow to the will of both logic and prehistorical records so they remain alive one of the cavemen isnt bearded he is cleanshaven not quite as cleanshaven as tarzan the lord of the humanoid cleanshaven ones roaming the jungle since childhood and without a razor but thereaboutsbr br what follows is the obligatory earthquakemoltenlava destruction sequence which causes a lot of our notsohairy friends to meet their doom it is interesting to note that before the earthquake the fashionmodels showed their breasts more after it they must have gotten shy or something because they covered their chests for a while maybe they were covered by ash so i mistakenly thought they were covered more action follows in the form of two fashionmodels wrestling in the sand the nextbest thing to female mudwrestling i suppose after a good deal of the desert has been crossed our blackhaired tribe meets  how else could it be  a blond tribe yawnbr br more spellbinding stuff follows there is that redhead fashionmodel who is bothered by seeing a caveteen kill a hedgehogthing there is also the scene of a woman dying at birth those cavefashionmodels are so frail eventually we get to meet an even darker haired and skinned tribe ie an evil tribe one of them becomes a wwf champion after he actually beats a huge bearthing in a wrestling bout 123 and its done the bear is the loser we also witness a jealous caveman miraculously recover from two major injuries first he gets stabbed with a big spear into the thigh yet he walks away from that as if it were but a scratch then he gets thrown off a cliff  onto a big rock  by the blond goodietwoshoes caveman yet he walks away from it as if he were thrown onto a giant sofa its unclear in the end whether he dies from falling off an even higher cliff or from that voodoo doll being crushed oh yes voodoo was used in prehistoric times by white tribes that live in the desert and whose females were fashionmodels its always important to learn from moviesbr br the message of the movie is as insightful as it is educational cave people liked to fight for local power and they loved their fashionmodels too as if any selfrespecting caveman would fight to be leader of such a sorry bunch
