where do i start the box should have been enough to keep me away from this attempt but id been taught early on not to judge a book or movie by its cover so i ignored the disgusting graphic quality of the box and rented it anyway but common sense should tell you that if they cant do a single still image properly then how dismal will the moving ones be later yeah they were pretty awfulbr br the actors in this flick appeared totally unaware they were being filmed as just any expression seemed to do fine regardless of the situation the characters were in or what they were reacting tobr br however a good story can offset the downfalls of low budget productions good dialog can carry a poorlyfunded attempt at times unfortunately this was not one of those times as the story was as weak and nonexistent as the other required elements of good cinemabr br there simply arent words for how bad this was br br perhaps you can get the idea from my rating of 2310 frombr br the fiend
