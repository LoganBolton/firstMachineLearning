evil behind you was created for a specific purpose in mind to shove the writerdirectors personal views on who either gets to walk on water or who gets to dance with the devil sadly it would seem that the creators were so focused on making their point that they took its power away completely by force feeding their point to the viewerthe way its message is presented almost reminds me of the stories ive heard of the spanish inquisition from one real christian to another avoid this like the plague fear tactics never work when trying to send this kind of messagebr br the acting was horriblethe selection of muslim terrorists was racist and unfairtheyre terrorists so they must be muslims the premise of this was good the story provided a great conduit for its message however it was the execution of these ideas that fell short making it very difficult to even separate the message from the messenger so to speakbr br youd be better off dusting off your old ghost dvd with mr swayze to better receive this message at least that movie didnt try to shove itself down your throat or if you like good christian movies with a powerful message try end of the spear
