this documentary was boring and quite stupidbr br i mean the documentary maker obviously does not even know what how darwinian evolution works it is a theory and the name is just plain dumb reading a college biology textbook could have told the documentary maker what darwinism really is darwinism is a good theory but evil if it is done as politicsbr br also there was no real evidence in this documentary just interviewing some people no expert testimonies and shady leadsbr br the documentary was also boring i mean it could have been edited down to 35 minutes and then it would have been lots betterbr br there are a lot better documentaries than this this was not worth watching you can get better information from wikipedia d dont waste your money and time
