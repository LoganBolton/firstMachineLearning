im sorry to say that but this is actually one of the worst documentaries i have ever seenbr br due to its name darwins nightmare i expected a documentary on problems relating to the nile perch in lake victoriabr br what i actually saw in this documentary is a loose accumulation of individual stories most of which have no relation to neither fish nor lake and for a large part you can hardly call them stories  its more like some accumulated scenes that lack a meaningful connectionbr br why does this movie waste time on  showing us nonrelevant information on the families of the russian pilots several minutes are wasted for example on their private digicam snapshots of wives and daughters  mourning the death of an african child who got bitten by a crocodile as if that could not have happened without the nile perch  showing us about 100 times how planes land and start at the airport  showing us strange religious events for several minutes  discussing in detail the life and death of a whore at the airport  talking to kids about their mothers fathers  what they work andor how they died well guess what some died of hiv  who would have guessed that those are just some examples i could go on for several pagesbr br this movie is absolutely unfocused and does not know at all what it wants to tell the viewer if you have never heard of africa and have no idea that this continent has socialhealthhivviolencewar problems then this movie might be right for you if you havent had your eyes closed for the last decades 90 of what this movie shows wont be new to you  and the way its presented here will try its best to make you fall asleepbr br perhaps my expectations on this movie were to high but i really didnt like it even though this is a topic that i would generally find interesting if this movie wants to show how the poverty is related to the nile perch than it perhaps should have spent some time on discussing that matter
