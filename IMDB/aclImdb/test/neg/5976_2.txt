movies like this give independent films a bad name this simply a boring compilation of vingettes with no structure whatsoever i wouldnt be surprised if the screenwriter was completely stoned if you want to see a good stoner comedy watch half baked its no awardwinner but at least it made me laugh the film was obviously made on a microbudget every scene either takes place in someones house someones apartment or some outdoor location if the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting i wouldve ignored the films budget like in the case of edward burns films but obviously thats not the case this time around br br i quote robert deniro from a bronx tale when i say theres nothing in the world worse than wasted talent everybody in the cast is talented luke wilson alicia witt brittany murphy jeremy sistoall talented performers and they all have been in much better movies the actors give it their all but they couldnt go too far with such a lame script the only scene i found interesting was jack blacks cameo where he sings a song about being in the woods and of course there was the brief strip club scene at the beginning which i also found appealing br br the characters are uninteresting and the story barely exists many movies are awful but at least you understand their intentions what was bongwaters intention the world will never know br br my score 2 out of 10
