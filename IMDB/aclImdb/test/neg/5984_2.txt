it starts out looking like it may be going somewhere then quickly leads the main characters into a threering circus of remarkable stupidity which permanently destroys any likability of the characters im a huge collector of stoner movies but this is something i would not consider a valid addition bong water is trash from the very deepest regions of the dumpster and i wouldnt be caught dead with this on my shelf im actually convinced this movie was created by a partnership for a drug free america if youre a jack black fan then i would say that you may think 5 minutes of the movies is ok because jack black continues his legacy of singing songs for retards i really cant say enough bad things about this movie
