shrieker is a full moon production i knew what to expect very little quality but i didnt expect this to be as painful as shrieker was to watchbr br its just awful bad acting confusing script and direction annoying characters i wanted to kill the whole thing was probably made in one week ive seen episodes of charmed that were more complex and convincing than this cheapiebr br it has the look and feel of an orphaned episode of a badly conceived tv series no one has ever seen it was a chore to watch and i could feel my mind getting dimmer and dimmer by the minute watching a movie shouldnt be this much hard work
