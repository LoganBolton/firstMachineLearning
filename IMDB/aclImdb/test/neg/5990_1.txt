i dont believe ive seen a horror movie this bad sincehell i dont believe ive ever seen a horror movie this bad the acting alone was enough to make one cringe the bad acting went way beyond horror film cheesy it was just plain awful and did you check out those god awful special effects when the demon which looked more like a cheaply constructed puppet came out of the wall i couldnt tell if i was supposed to be frightened or laughing my ass off as a huge fan of the horror genre this film was more than mildly disappointing i couldnt help but notice the director is from portland or which just happens to be my own hometown i must say im deeply ashamed if i could id give this film a negative 500
