sometimes full moon makes entertaining movies this isnt one of them full moon is like a lowkey troma their movies arent as violent or off the wall but theyre usually just as devoid of talent the acting in this movie isnt terrible but the script is pretty bad and overall its pretty boring and it doesnt even contain any nudity like many full moon movies to somewhat redeem it skip this one and go rent head of the family
