the creature yeah it and the movie it stars in hell would seem infinitely more frightening if the damned were forced to watch this for all eternity six college students shack up in a condemned hospital to save money and end up victims of an ancient monster who must claim five victims before it returns to the shadowy world from which it came other than having major logic and coherence problems plus the fact it appears to be unfinished this disaster is terribly acted written edited by jr bookwalter and directed and the makeup fx are almost nonexistent its also significantly shorter than it claims at only 80 minutes but im not complaining its the worst movie ive seen from executive producer charles bands full moon productions and boy is that badbr br to note i almost didnt bother with a review but this has gotten inexplicably good reviews on here and i figured a varying opinion was in order proceed with caution
