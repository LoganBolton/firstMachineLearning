i like the most of the full moon pictures so i ordered this movie from the usa because in germany you cant get it anywhere i thought it would be so nice and amusing like the subspecies or puppetmaster series because they were full of atmospherebr br i was glad when the movie finally arrivedbr br but after watching this cheesy movie i was very disappointed the actors  i think you cant even say actors are boring and untalented the story was a poor performance and even the set and the monster were very cheap and lousybr br i hope no one ever make a sequel or remake of this terrible movie
