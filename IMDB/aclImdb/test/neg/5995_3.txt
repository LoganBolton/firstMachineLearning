this should have rocked vh1 moved away from the traditional divas whitney houston celine dion etc that had made the 2003 show so stale sadly the move backfired the show had no mc keeping the show together queen latifah did a fantastic show at the 2003 divas the show kicked of with a horrific rendition of lady marmalade featuring patti labelle cyndi lauper and jessica simpson okay in the studio with some control they can all sound great br br however when they are competing with each other why it just sounds torturous jessica simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings that ive ever witnessed cyndi lauper also performed girl just wanna have fun that wasnt as bad but it was hardly impressive the worst was yet to come cyndi and patti labelle teamed up to perform cyndis hit time after time it was acoustic and didnt fit in with the rest of the show still it couldve been okay if they both hadnt insisted on squealing like mamed animals it was just direbr br debbie harry from blondie is always cool she has a style of her own and although maybe she cant compete vocally with a many of the divas although she certainly can sing very well debbie came out and performed blondies 1 hit rapture with some lovely vocals she really hit the notes perfectly she looked stunning rapper eve provided a new but sadly inferior rap it was good debbies next performance was a teamup with newcomer joss stone they performed the blondie hit one way or another i think joss misunderstood the style of the song and just shouted over debbie a rather sad bit was when debbie tried and failed to match her shouty style which spoiled it a bit she shouldve just let joss get on with her totally inappropriate warballing the whole of blondie performed this track the final track debbie performed was blondies massive hit call me it was pretty poor not debbies fault because you just couldnt hear her the sound was atrocious all the way through the showbr br joss stone also performed a few songs on her own they were quite well done ashanti also showed up to perform two inexplicable cover versions firstly she did diana ross im coming out and then chaka khans aint nobody she is not a diva she can sing to an extent but she has no presence whatsoever why not just get the real singers in chaka was even interviewed on the showbr br gladys knight showed up and did a medley it was very good she was probably the best bit of the show i dont know much about her other than she is a seasoned performer in las vegas and her experience and class really shone through patti labelle fitted in another performance this time her 80s hit new attitude it was the finale and it was okay but it was too little to late this was one big dud better luck next time vh1br br the version i saw was a heavily edited 55min version which was shown on vh1 in the uk if these were the best bits
