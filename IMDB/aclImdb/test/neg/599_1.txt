i would have given this less than a 1 rating if it were possible the entire film should have been left on the cuttingroom floor what a pathetic waste of time money and effort lets seeassemble the prettiest cast you can find which of course is in direct proportion to the amount of talent they lackthrow together the thinnest plot you can dig upand viola an abominable piece of trash that the director andor producer should be ashamed to put their name on how much worse can the horror genre get and dont use low budget as an excusei have seen many great lowbudget filmsin fact some of the best horror classics of all time were lowbudget if you dont have the talent and ingenuity to make a good horror film then for gods sake dont make one at all
