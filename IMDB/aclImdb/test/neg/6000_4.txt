thunderbolt is probably jackie chans worst movie since the protector in 1985 yes i know that nobody watches his movies for their stories but the plotting of this one is unusually lame even by his standards and while the fight choreography is up to his standards the fight scenes the whole two of them are ruined as others have mentioned by the frenetic distracting camerawork even the most serious jackie chan fans shouldnt really bother with this offensively haphazard stuntandplugfilled garbage anita yuens cute and perky performance is one of the few redeeming virtues for a good serious jackie movie i recommend crime story 12
