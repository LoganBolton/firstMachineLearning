i normally love jackie chan movies but this one was terrible there are only 2 or 3 fight scenes all of which are up to normal standard more or less the bad thing about this movie is it focuses a lot on car chasingracing the car chase isnt so bad though not as exciting as fighting but the car racing at the end is exceptionally boring basically it takes all of things that make a jackie chan film a jackie chan film and leaves out everything except jackie chan even the traditional outtakes at the end lack their usual humourbr br i suppose to a certain extent it was made worse by the fact i saw one of those horrible dubbed versions i usually try to see the subtitled versioni wish i could understand chinesebr br ive only seen one jackie film worse that this one and that was one of his early forays into hollywood films that didnt turn out so wellbr br avoid unless really curious or a lover of motor sports
