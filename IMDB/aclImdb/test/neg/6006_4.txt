this film truly was poor i went to the theatre expecting something exciting and instead was afforded the opportunity to hone my guess the next plot twist before it happens skills seriously the plot was written with an extra thick crayon so everyone could see nothing was truly shocking in fact even the gore was met with such complete suspension of belief that it really didnt add up to muchbr br the excessive wise cracking and cops talking shop at the crime scenes made it seem all the more phony and the scene where lamberts character is struggling with the clues and reaches his investigative epiphany goes to great lengths to indicate the level of intellect expected from the audience  littlebr br probably the most annoying aspect of the cinematography was the xfiles treatment every building in the film whether its the precinct building or a house at noon or a hospital was suffering from a lack of any discernible lighting not to mention a lack of patients in the case of the hospital i dont recall a single scene when someone flipped on a light switch it sure would have been nicebr br mr lambert really isnt an oscargrade actor so i suppose you have to take this film for what its worth in the end ive reached the conclusion that the only thing that would make this film seem more entertaining is to watch it after watching the warriors otherwise youre left with an effort that is dull and unoriginal and nowhere near the equal of films of the genre such as silence of the lambs
