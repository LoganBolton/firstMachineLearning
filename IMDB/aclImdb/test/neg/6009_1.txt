this is by far the worst hemingway adaptation ever rock hudson was badly miscast and entirely unbelievable as a hardbitten soldieradventurer drawn to war jennifer jones was far too old for her part and vittorio de sica seemed to think he was acting in some other movie altogether they tried to make a largescale epic out of a lowkey romantic novel and the result is terrible as if that were not enough the whole thing is so slow overlong and dated that it is practically unwatchable rock must have kicked himself for turning down sayonara and ben hur in order to make this ghastly crapbr br 010 to be avoided
