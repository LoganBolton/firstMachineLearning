i managed to avoid reading hemingway in college from what i could tell along with his reductivist verbiage he offered reductivist story lines this filmtransfiguration of af2a into a simplistic hoary belabored narrative does not disabuse me of my suspicions a guy who barely sees action on the european battlefield hudson falls in with a nurse jones and they conspire to spend time together hemingways big contribution to narrative was the romantic travelogue who knows what these two lovers have in common theyre so utterly generic the movie never even brings up the utter irresponsibility it takes to abandon the front in favor of a lovers adventure the two have a season on the alps straight out of a j crew catalog a number of better scenes are undermined by corny conventional melodrama elsewhere the movie keeps piling on tiny improbable unspecific details that fight the epic treatment the cavernous hospital that miss barkley works in is virtually empty so that no secondary plot line can possibly distract from the flimsy main story complicated it is not br br the camera work is better than average with some amazing location photography director charles vidor or maybe huston does striking things in the first hour with an onlocation widescreen camera there are no second unit copouts vidor shows massive panoramic tableaux pans over a line of hundreds of soldiers trooping through the mountains and then with a 90 degree swivel of his camera catches up with hudsons ambulance barreling down on him br br hudson looks great hes a better actor than he gets credit for but with unshaped material like this he can become very mechanical mercedes mccambridge plays a onedimensional shrew jennifer jones is puffy and miscast in the lackluster female lead the movie is best when shes off screen the love scenes are about as affecting as a coffee commercial
