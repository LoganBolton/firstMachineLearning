terrible adaptation of heminways low key love story an american soldier rock hudson falls in love with a british nurse jennifer jones in italy during world war 1 whats wrong with this virtually everything hudson is way out of his depth here he could be a good actor but not in this movie jones is far too old for her role shes 21 in the bookhere shes 38and looks it also her acting wavered between overdone and underdone they took a simple lowkey love story and blew it all out of proportion the film is fatally long a little over 150 minutes selfindulgent and padded to a ridiculous degree it seems producer david o selznick thought he was doing gone with the wind again some of the scenery is truly stunning even on a small tv screen but theres not enough of a story to match the images br br spoiler the ending where jones dies is supposed to be tragic but the bad acting and overblown theatrics had me fighting not to laugh br br to make matters worse actor vittorio de sica overacts to a truly embarrassing degree overblown selfindulgent badly cast and slow pretty terrible this was understandably a financial and critical bomb and ended selznicks career as a producer you might want to tune in for some of the scenery at the end but its really not worth it i give this a 3
