whats the point hasnt this been done before better and again why is werner herzog wasting his good talents and time with junk like this shouldnt he be shooting a movie somewherei mean a real movie br br it all felt fake from the beginning werner herzog would never have sought to make a film about the loch ness mythat least not on such a small scale surrounded by losersso the plot was not believable from the beginning the actors who are supposed to act like theyre not acting were obviously acting the story was not interesting the everyday people requisite in every mockumentary were invisible the personalities were stale the jokes were not funny the effects were unconvincing and the ending was nowhere to be seenbr br i just dont see the point its a fake movie about a fake movie hah hah perhaps if those who thought up such a movie sought to make one that mocked people who really were out to find a real nessie now that could have had some potential but herzog is not a believer and never claimed to be a mockumentary about the cryptozoologist crowd would have had so much more fuelbr br it was a miss
