when a killer calls has got to be the biggest ripoff released by asylum so far its about a sexy babysitter on duty who receives spooky calls from a creepy voice who asks her repeatedly have you checked the girl naturally she has the calls traced by the cops after having to perform some realistically unnecessary tasks  hanging up when he calls waiting ten seconds and dialing 57 sound familiar yeah thats why i rented it toobr br well it should and i hate to say it but this couldve been more entertaining than the bigscreen crapfest that was released around the same time if not for one fatal mistake  rather than revelling in bmovie ripoff glory it tried to do something original it tried to make the lead character sympathetic rather than having clichéd campy fun with her mind you this couldve worked with a talented actress but she wasnt sure she looked good and she screamed and cried but    oh well whateverbr br then came the horrific ending not horrific in that it was horrifying horrific in that it was boring the pacing up until that point about an hour in was campy clichéd and fun then it heads in another direction and it veers away from just another dumb fun slasher movie with a sexy teenage cast to a hostelesquire goreborefestbr br i guess this falls into the oh well whatever category the lead actress flubbed a line oh well whatever i dont feel like reshooting it we forgot to give the killer motivation oh well whatever i dont feel like rewriting it the pacing completely changes halfway through oh well whatever i dont feel like shaving fifteen minutes off continuity errors oh well whateverbr br if you like this kind of movie dumb cheesy predictable campy splatter movie with sexy cast then youll be fine up until the ending the ending is stupid its not fun its not scary its not campy or cheesy or quicklypaced in fact there was almost exactly five minutes of the character doing nothing but being tied up and thats not a spoiler because its on the back of the dvd and looking around at the stuff in the room then screaming and    whatever
