clubbed is yet another willthisdo entry into the brit fisticuffs genre and is sure to keep punters who arent expecting too much moderately entertained for ninety minutes after a few beers however for anyone seeking intelligent quality entertainment its really best avoidedbr br there are so many misnomers in the appalling script that even an actor of the calibre of colin salmon is left looking daft the action is set in the 1980s but its never clear why especially when they havent been able to pull off any convincing feel for that decade  it takes more than a few 80s soul records on the soundtrack the occasional zoot suit and a handful of 30yearold cars then we see central characters studying texts such as sun tzus the art of war and speaking about how violence should be a last resort while the same characters seem only too willing to start doling out punches with all the testosteronefuelled unthinking abandon of a bunch of chavs fighting over a bag of chipsbr br character development does not exist in clubbed nor does irony subtlety or pathos this is a film which trades on fond memories of guy richies early gangster films which despite their flaws certainly had much more wit better editing snappier dialogue and packed more emotional punch than this limp little saga theyre a decade old now anyway  isnt it time we moved on from trying to emulate them
