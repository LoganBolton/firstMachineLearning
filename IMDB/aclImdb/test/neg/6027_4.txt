in fact parts of it i liked a lot it had some interesting twists but it just left me with a been there seen that feeling after all of the saw movies granted the ending was different from a typical saw but lets face ita group of guys unknown to each other or so they believe tossed together in an abandoned chemical factorybr br but then it loses something theres no intensity theres poor group dynamic theres no sense of urgencybr br some nice twists at the end and definitely worth a watch if theres nothing else on your plate but it just left me emptyit passed the time but it didnt satisfy
