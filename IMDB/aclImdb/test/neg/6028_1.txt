i also have been a wife of an abusive husband even if in my situation the attacks were psychological not physical he presented a very respectable responsible and generous personality to anyone who saw us together which in contrast to myself resulted in having others treat me as dull and unstable initially i was so incredibly flattered that anybody like gus who worked in a bank and was handsomely confident would even give me the time of day and i fell completely headoverheels for the idea of him rather than the person he was if id had my head on straight and gotten to know him much better first theres no way id have married him however thats my mistake it wasnt my mistake to be abused i didnt deserve that nor did i see it coming until i was embroiled in the mind games criticism and isolation he acted like i had no business holding an opinion that differed from his own  actually he went further if i didnt agree he assumed i misunderstood and increasingly simplified his wording  by the time i finally lost my selfrespect i was incapable of recognizing the predicament i was in and i had to be jolted to reality by outside influence my dad said gus called me a bitch well  it was still a halfyear before the rage that began at that moment finally exploded and i packed some stuff while he was at work and i left  and it was still another several months before i could grasp the fact that i had been abused and that it wasnt my fault he was doing the things he did  so please anyone who assumes its the fault of the victim think if a puppy is kicked by a cruel owner when in an anxious situation it has an accident on the rug do you blame the puppy by the time the abuse in a relationship reaches an obvious violent level the target of abuse has been so wounded and depersonalized much like in nazi concentration camps that its nearly impossible to judge the circumstance accurately because by then the victim believes all the horrible things spewed by the abuser have a heart people labelling abuse victims as stupid morons is like kicking someone whos already terribly beaten  and this helps how
