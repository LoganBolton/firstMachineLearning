this is the worst war movie i have ever seen possibly the worst ever made i find it incredible that some people have actually rated it as a 10 it has a stunning lack of even rudimentary traces of realism almost every war movie cliche appears in this film and is done badly on the other hand i wouldnt have watched it to the end if it hadnt been so remarkably bad that it amused me
