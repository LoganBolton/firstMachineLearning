this movie is quite bad aggressive not played well not directed well seems low budget low qualityemotionaly weak and disconnected after watching earlier comments went to see it but if u try to compare it with apocalypse now platoon or any others ur really off the tracks this movie looks like a 60s old and purely made film with cast of grown neanderthals not to mention or actually do not paying attention to details like changing rounds low budget fireworks and all sorts of poorly filmed characteristic is watchable though if ud like to see it as an early development of the movies document not to go backbr br ps  afterall the guys are quite alright
