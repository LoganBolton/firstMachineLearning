i found this movie to be mostly a posit was low budgetbut that isnt the problemthe problem isthe movie is just lameit doesnt really make a lot of senseyesit does explain why things happenedbut thats not what i meanthere was just no reason for it allthe movie also moved very slowthe last ice age was quicker than thisalso i think they went overboard a bit in the killsi dont mean they were too grossbut the killer just seemed to spend too much time smashing his victim over the heador stabbing his victim maybe im being pettybut i just didnt like the moviethe whole thing seemed like a lower rate version of when a stranger calls and maybe that was the whole pointbut so whatfor me when a stranger kills is a 410
