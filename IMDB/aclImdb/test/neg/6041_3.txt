webs starts in chicago present day as four electricians dean richard grieco ray richard yearwood sheldon jeffrey douglas  junior jason jones are about to disconnect the electric to an unused building scheduled for demolition as they search for the relevant cables  stuff they come across a set of doors that according to the buildings blueprints shouldnt be there being nosey  all that they force the doors open to have a look  find a room full of computers  scientific machinery as they mess around with some buttons a portal to a parallel universe opens dean  junior accidentally fall in with ray  sheldon following soon after in search of their friends unfortunately theyve all ended up in an exact parallel earth that has been taken over by a mutant spider thing that either eats people or turns them into mutant soldiers with which she uses to protect herself  do whatever she wants them to really in a desperate bid for survival they team up with a few of the last remaining humans including the original inventor of the portal dr richard morelli colin fox who says that with the help of our electrician boys he might yeah might be able to build another portal to take them back homebr br edited  directed by david wu i thought webs was pretty crap its as simple  straight forward as that really the script by grenville case  robinson young is preposterous to say the least  has plot holes in it you could drive a tank through for instance is this film really trying to suggest that a few mutant spider things no bigger than a couple of people in size took over an entire world how did they do this if this parallel earth was the same as ours where the hell was the army the police all of our weapons a few fragile looking spider things against literally billions of humans the whole flawed stupid  downright naff concept constantly bugged me throughout the entire film lets not forget that there is a interdimensional portal to a parallel earth in the basement of most buildings that have sat there undisturbed for decades  remain in perfect working order right then theres the nuclear reactor the size of a briefcase the fact one electrician can make it work perfectly purely by accident as he randomly presses a few buttons in a room that probably had 100s spread over dozens of pieces of equipment  what about the wonderfully thoughtful guy who sets an explosive bobby trap in his base without telling anyone what if one of his mates had set it off  found themselves blown to pieces by their mates homemade bomb you wouldnt be best pleased would you what about food do they grow their own in little vegetable patches i could go on  on all day long about how flawed ill conceived  poorly written webs is but i cant be bothered the characters are clich√©d  annoying as is the film as a whole which obviously doesnt help the only half decent thing i can say about webs is that its short  it moves along at a fair pace but when all said  done its still crapbr br director wu has to take a large chunck of the blame here for a start the film looks cheap  the editing that he is credited with is terrible theres lots of annoying inappropriate slow motion shots that come from nowhere the action scenes are almost identical  become incredibly boring very quickly he uses that highly annoying quick cut technique along with a bit of the old jerky camera movement now i dont know about anyone else but i hate this editing style as it just looks a complete incoherent mess in fact i dont know a single person who does like this sort of thing  im puzzled as to why filmmakers think people do forget about any gore just a few shotgun wounds to the spider zombie soldier guys  they dont have red blood anyway so it doesnt relate to reality in my mindbr br webs was madefortv the american scifi channel i think  it looks every bit as cheap low budget  rushed as you would expect its all so bland forgettable flat  dull the special effects are far from special  the spider thing lacks imagination when finally revealed the acting was ok considering everything else was so poor  i still cant believe the sweater grieco was wearing in thisbr br webs is crap i cant really say anything good about it other than ive sat through worse films  thats the sole reason im not giving it 1 star  a quick glance at the imdb user ratings for webs confirms what i already knew in that it has more 1 votes than any other  there is very good reason why
