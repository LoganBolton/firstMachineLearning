i had seen this movie just days before halloween 2004 i noticed it around lunchtime and it was an interesting description in my menu box so i decided to watch it seriously only a movie only suitable for late night tvyou know after conan but before the infomercials sorta dealbr br although this movie has very little to do with webs it does have a lot to do with spiders refer to my heading if you need a refresherbr br i found the idea behind the story absolutely fascinating a hidden nuclear generator a scientist and a believable portalwould have been a good start to a cool fantasy but then it goes downhill after 1520 minutesbr br the cast is poor with no memorable performances poor quality queen who has had her breasts amplifiedconsidering spiders dont carry breasts as well as poor sound effects an obvious low budget movie though the cast has triedbr br spoilerbr br 4 electricians stumble upon a hidden nuclear generator while on a job they fiddle with the buttons and open a portal 2 workers fall into the portal and it closesscrambling to figure out what is going on the party still in our world seeks help while the other party observers their surroundingsbr br help does not arrive so they open the portal and follow through meeting up in a parallel dimension they encounter a race of human spiders dubbed soldiers after a death and chase they are saved by survivorsbr br now it gets boringthey hide talk a bit try to build another portal then attack the hive after losing 2 more electricians they open the portal and escape returning to our worldsome 200 million years agobr br sounds interesting huh
