hercules the tv movie hercules  a very twisted and molted version of the story about the greek superhero paul telfer makes a good attempt to play this hero sean astin rehashes his sam gamgee image by playing lupin a thrown in character to make the whole thing a buddymovie picture i almost expected his to say at one point were in a bad situation mr frodo uh i mean hercules an unexpected good performance comes from timothy dalton one of the lesser james bonds as herculess father herucless love interest looks like paris hilton something which just turned me off right away unfourtunetly someone has twisted and molted the original story into somewhat of a murky and sometimes incomprehensible story the special effects dont help either while the hydra scene does the original story justice the nemean lion and harpies are justwell lame i believe the creatures and effects from power rangers flashed across my mind at least twice and the golden hind felt rushed and very computer generated and they took out cerberus one of my favorite parts of what was originally a very cool story the movie cant decide whether its greek roman or american and it almost ruined the original story a classic epic dont bother looking for this one on the direct to dvd  c
