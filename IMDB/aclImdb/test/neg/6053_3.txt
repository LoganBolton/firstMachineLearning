i hadnt heard anything about this project until i saw that it was going to be on so i watched it with a completely open mind and gee the cast is full of strong playersbr br unfortunately    its awful i dont mean it isnt good i mean its extraordinarily bad  sometimes laughably so but mostly its just boring its strongest appeal comes from having attractive people as naked as us network tv will allow but its all tease and no substance and having nymphs as backup characters cant justify several hours of bad tvbr br there are two basic problems that the cast cant overcome first the script is awful yes making changes to the hercules myth which is certainly not a single monolithic story in the first place is traditional but this version is relentlessly dull and much too frequently dumb and sometimes downright headshakingly peculiar with terrible pacing bits borrowed from here and there and several parts seemingly belonging in different films and truly awful dialogue the dialogue is frequently unbearably bad in fact to the point where you feel embarrassed for the actors sean astin apparently now typecast as secondbanana seems especially burdened by one awful line after another theres no consistency of tone or atmosphere and little cohesion to the plotbr br second most of the special effects are really bad really bad theres occasionally a decent bit of cgi but mostly again you feel really embarrassed on behalf of the cast i have no idea what the budget for this project was but it sure looks like crap compared to clash of the titans or even hercules the legendary journeys and doesnt even compare very favorably with the old lou ferrigno and italian spaghetti hercules movies just painfully miserablebr br there are plenty of other problems  the story is needlessly complex and cant keep up with itself and hercules himself isnt presented as a very interesting character almost everyone who doesnt have a european accent tries to fake one of some kind which is not merely amateurish and dated but never really made sense in the first place drama doesnt become better just because the actors use british accents after all but the terrible script and equally terrible effects sink the whole thing right off the batbr br in fairness hercules was apparently intended as a fourhour miniseries but truncated for this airing anyway to a threehour tv movie i dont know what they cut but its possible the edits made things worse i dont think you could make hercules good by adding to it but that doesnt mean that the continuity say hasnt suffered from the network edits theres no way ill watch the usa version to see though
