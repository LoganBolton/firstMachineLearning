i survived the first hour of this and came back for the last ten minutes just to say i saw the end if you want real mythology flawlessly executed look for armand assantes the odyssey great storytelling doesnt need to be tweaked  the stories are fantastic on their own i only hope sean astin needed the money and sophocles and ovid must be whirling in their graves  wherever those may bebr br at least with sorbos version the tongue was poked relentlessly in cheek  we knew it was mostly balderdash but perhaps enough interest was generated in the backstory to send someone to the libraryim surprised halmi could turn out something so amusing the tv series and follow it with something so devoid of quality
