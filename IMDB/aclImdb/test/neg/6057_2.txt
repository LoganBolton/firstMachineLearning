this is easily the worst adaptation of greek mythology ive ever seen it utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth inventing silly plot twists and reducing the 12 labours to 3 or 4 i think it makes up utterly needless things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways which bring into question the writers having ever read the myths like changing birds to harpies lions to sphinxes the oracle of delphi to tiresias and bulls to a pedantic version of proteus even integrating aspects never seen outside of sam raimis entertaining series concerning his first marriage to a woman with the coopted name of one of the furies so it sounds appropriate to the periodbr br i could accept much of that but it also fails completely in pure film standards most painful is the dialogue leaden portentous pseudoshakespearean tripe it is a poor reinterpretation of the myths making a sad attempt at the kind of postmodern revisionism that crichtons the 13th warrior attempted in regards to the beowulf legend while still including the strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and magical superstrength a sad sad failure of an entertainment experience who im sure many of the quality actors involved regret deeply
