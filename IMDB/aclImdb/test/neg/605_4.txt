when a killer calls is an unusually nasty slasher flick with some very unpleasant and unsettling sequences the decision was clearly made to try and cash in on the remake of when a stranger calls by pretty much putting in  almost word for word  the phone call sequences from that movie they seem very forcedbr br additionally the filmmaker commits the cardinal but all too common sin of having the heroines friends being repulsive jerks so for the beginning of the film we really like and are rooting for the babysitter a nice believable job by rebekah kochan but then shes joined by standard slasherflick teenage friends and the mood is ruinedbr br the flick sort of works but it probably a lot more unpleasant than youll be expected so be forewarned
