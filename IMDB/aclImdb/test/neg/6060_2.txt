i thought there might be some level of worth to this movie and sat through the whole thing i can summarize by saying it left a bad taste in my mouthbr br the movie started out ok i think the initial characterization of herc was true to the myths both as a child and a young adult he started out pretty strong but not the brightest bulb but later on he somehow transforms into a charismatic speaker beloved by all huh br br other problem terrible cgi the satyr looked ok but the rest of the critters just looked terrible especially the hart the phoniest looking beast in the movie and how come leelee sobieskis skin was sometimes golden sometimes normal the worst part for meand everyone should cringe at thiswas the twelve labors of hercules because the producers obviously didnt want to cover all of them maybe they thought us primitive screwheads watching this garbage couldnt count that high instead of the twelve labors of hercules we got the five labors of hercules yes the five labors wtf he didt even finish the last one so it was really the 4 12 labors just terrible ill take hercules the legendary journeys over this piece of crap any day of the week
