my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts and thus at least a quarter longer because otherwise how can one explain its confused abbreviated storyline i was never completely lost but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slotbr br if it were longer it might make more sense but it still wouldnt be much good the movies most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being a war between the male and female but the movie drops the ball on this making heras followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what zeus followers do or believe the movie is also interesting because you dont see the gods and theres no real certainty that they exist so its got a couple of intriguing ideas but it doesnt do anything useful with thembr br bad dialog cardboard characters and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons not unwatchable but also not worth watching
