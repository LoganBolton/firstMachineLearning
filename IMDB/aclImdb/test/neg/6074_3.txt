this film is the proof that a good actor is nothing without a good direction ed harris is awful how could you cast an actor built like rambo to play the maestro he shows no credibility at all and overplays beethoven most of all long hairs doesnt look good at all on his head the main actress is missing all the subtleties needed for its character the camera shots are cheesy and too conventional the lights are to close of the characters feelings bad casting and cheap direction too bad the only scene that worth the movie is when beeth i hope you dont care that i call him trough his nickname is turning the girls song to a joke any way i hope that harris could find his way back to true movie where he can really shows his hairless talent
