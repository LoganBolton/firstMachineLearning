its a shame that quality actors like baldwin and booth have to succumb to lousy stories and scripts just for the money but hey its a cruel worldbr br this is just another one of a long line of assassin thrillers that use all the usual narrative twists to try to make it appear more appealing than it is sure it has some nice locations its a slick production there is some good camera work and editing and its fairly well paced overallbr br so whats the real problem quite simply the whole premise is just totally unbelievable however instead of spoiling a rotten story for you ill let you find out what its all about that is if you can get through it i managed but only because i like baldwin and i kept hoping that it would get betterbr br it didnt and it had one of the most anticlimactic endings that ive seen for a long time in fact maybe neverbr br but its harmless fun i guess if youve got nothing better to do
