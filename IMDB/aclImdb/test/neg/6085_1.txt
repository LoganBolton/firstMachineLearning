this is the worst film ive seen in a long long time never mind the fact that so many useful things keep appearing on this island how convenient the acting is beyond poor from the outset its like one of those really badly scripted soft porn films on channel 5 a complete waste of time and i cant remember the lead actors name but i cant believe he still gets work ive never seen him act ive seen him in lots of films but ive never seen him act here are a few of the blaringly obvious errors apparently petrol lighters still work even when theyve been soaked in sea water also according to this film you can walk into the sea naked but come out wearing bikini bottoms im guessing the camera man and editor were studentsthere are plenty more errors but im ranting now besides its no so much the errors as the cast the script and the whole film avoid at all costs
