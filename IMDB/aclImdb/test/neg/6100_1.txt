this short subject is a remake of the three stooges 1942 film whats the matador about the boys trip to mexico and their bullfighting adventures although the original short was made during the stooges peak period it isnt that memorable and i believe it is one of the more mediocre films with curly howardbr br having established that i believe that sappy bullfighters is just pathetically awful like all the other shorts with joe besser moe and larry never should have hired besser because his whiny almost feminine character was completely wrong for the violent comedy of the stooges his 16 films with moe and larry marked the nadir for the team and those shorts are embarrassing to watch this short was released in 1959 and was the teams swan song with columbia maybe besser was a nice guy but he was all wrong as the third stoogebr br i wont review any more besser shorts because i would just be giving the same scathingly negative review over and over do yourself a big favor and dont watch this instead try to catch in the sweet pie and pie or hoi polloi
