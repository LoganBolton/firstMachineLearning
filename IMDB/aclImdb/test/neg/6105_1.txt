i dont know what chasidik movement was this film abouti saw this film a year agoi am an orthodox woman living in an orthodox chasidic community and i can tell you i was offended by this movieits so far away from the reality its scary  the director could at least hire a chasidik rabbi for a brief consultation before making a realistic movie about ultra orthodoxs for example meirs davening morning prayers or a jewish wedding or a mikveh  ritual bath  customsbr br movie is loaded with technical inaccuraciesbut its not them that bothered me its the spiritual side orthodoxs are portrayed next to taliban woman are powerless while men are the ultimate rulers  pleaseno one can force a jewish girl to the chuppa against her will  we orthodoxsalso live by the law halacha  which clearly states mans responsibilities towards his wifeno beating and no rapingalsoand no man  even rabbiis allowed to peak at the woman in the mikvehand balanit is not to place a hand over womans headwhile shes taking a ritual bath the idea is to immerse the whole body at one time director was clearly trying to bash ultra orthodoxs  but could he do so at least in a nice and more educated mannerbr br love story cute  but not credibledialogs are long and boringthe ending sucked totallyfor all that drama i was at least hoping for a nice ending for all that sitting i felt i deserved it obviously someone was trying to make a nice consciousness soothing movie for less observant jews or for non jews perhapslook at those fundamentalist they are so evil and meanand they succeed long thing short was hoping for a nice europien kane level  movie got instead a tradition bashing unrealisticmistakenly guiding junk i mean  todaywe live in a time of a free will as never before everyone has a right to choose malka chose a rock singerrivka made her choicemeir made his many people from non observing backgrounds are choosing orthodox judaism these daysbecausein this mad world religion might be a nice gateway
