my mother told me not to go to see kadosh  but who ever listens to ones mother br br i was so turned off by it while i was watching i thought i must have lost my feminist credentials on the way into the theater so i checked with cardcarrying feminists the next day no they also thought it was much more an antiorthodox screed than a profeminist statement painting the orthodox as equal to the talibanbr br while this israeli movie is careful to show that the sect the story is about is the ultimate ultraorthodox messianists it is so nasty as to be unbelievable plus that the nonfanatic orthodox rocknroller one of the sisters is in love with is incredibly sexyeven in israel that must be fantasybr br the theater was quite crowded so theres a pentup curiosity to see israeli movies too bad this vicious movie is the one getting wide distribution this was almost enough to drive me back to insipid hollywood romantic movies br br originally written 4292000
