as a writer and a lapsed orthodox jewish woman i was let down tremendously by this movie the dialogue is hackneyed and wasteful the characters too engaged with lines ranging from the wrackingly prosaic to the stunningly melodramatic arent allowed to expand into genuinely textured individuals the onetrick musical score tries to make up for the blandness swooping portentously into the silence to jar the viewer and the script out of protracted catatoniabr br like an adolescent revolutionary on a selfrighteous tirade this film is blown away by the wisdom of its revelationpatriarchy is wrongand thoroughly squanders its energies hammering on this point the resultant artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development the moral crime is the reduction of human beings to caricatures martyrs and grotesques
