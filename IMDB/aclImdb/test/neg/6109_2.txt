here is a film which clearly banks on being marketed as exotica to audiences unfamiliar with its subject matterbr br an attempted hybrid of fiction and document kadosh clumsily falls in between the chairs as a documentary on the one hand it is neither accurate nor insightful to realize its sloppy handling of detail one needs to go no further than the opening scene where it is quite obvious that the ultraorthodox protagonist does not know even so much as how to properly put on his tfilin more generally the tedious rotestyle presentation of details in this case of jewish ultraorthodox ritual is the role of a manual not of a good documentary the latter should provide an organizing principle a gestalt if you will for the viewer so that she may emerge with a better understanding of the viewed this clearly does not happen here as ultraorthodox ritual is being made even more enigmatic the director seems to have done a decent job explaining it all verbally during the films release campaign cinematically however this is a severe case of stuttering as a fictionfeature on the other hand it suffers from flatness of character simplicity of plot and bluntness of message at some points i felt i was watching a cartoon eg the wedding night consummation scene  without going in detail into angles positions and dimensions  well technically this could not possibly be a realistic portrayal of human sex savage as it may bebr br there are no subtleties in this film the clever manipulation of hints stimulating the viewers imagination and thought into taking an active part in the cinematic text which i believe is a mark of a good feature is completely absent on the contrary watching the movie i felt at times as being forcefed again and again with the same already chewedup and waytooobvious content it is indeed as director gitai himself put it in an interview an architectural shifting objects in space and then coloring the scenes with the appropriate emotions when called for and advancing the plot on its appropriate and predictable track but the spark that creative duendelike dark inarticulable spark lets not forget kadosh is supposedly a tragedy that which casts on a twodimensional screen the spell which turns it into an extension of the viewers world is missing without a trace perhaps a work of a visualengineer perhaps of an unsophisticated ideologue definitely not of a true filmmaker what i saw was a passionplay for animated issues rather than fleshbloodandcomplexities real people the acting by and large failed to transcend this directorial flatness of an idea forced at times even tortured into film one notable though relatively minor exception was that of the mikvelady and the mother both played by the excellent and seasoned lea koenigbr br it takes more than strict adherence to a winning formula namely a serving of exotica plus heart wrenching yet simple melodrama plus a popular agenda preferably politically correct to tantalize my interest buds the bottom line here all being said is that for a considerable portion of the movie i was simply bored in spite of the novel perhaps even pioneering achievement of using an ultraorthodox neighborhood as a movie set for which mr gitai and his crew deserve all praise i found kadosh way too nadosh hebrew for trite
