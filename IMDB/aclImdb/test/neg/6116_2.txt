the worst wrestlemania everbr br this had no must see bouts and many crap ones at that this took place in las vegas and wwe made its employees dress up like egyptian gods they even changed howard finkels name to finkus maximus which probably doesnt mean anything the sight of seeing jim ross in that terrible gown still gives me nightmares to this day and im 21 years old so you could imagine it when i was 7 years old bobby heenan was funny thoughbr br matches included the undertaker vs giant gonzales in a pss poor match the headshrinkers vs the steiner brothers in a useless match doink vs crush in a comedy match and a boring match featuring razor ramon vs bob backlund hulk hogan teamed up with brutus beefcake to battle money inc you could clearly see hogan had a black eye in storyline purposes ted dibiase and irs beat up hogan while he was playing poker or something like that in the casinos which is a poor storyline but in reality macho man randy savage hit hogan because savage thinks hes like the hulk no pun intended no not the wrestler but the film characterbr br the main event consisted of bret hitman hart facing off against yokozuna in a very boring main event match mr fuji threw salt in the face of hart and yoko won but not until hogan came down and squashed yoko in 21 secondsbr br overall grade  e
