1993 was a time of change in the wwe but for this wrestlemania they decided to wind back the clock as hulk hogan returned along with his good friend brutus beefcake who had been out of wrestling since a paragliding accident in 1990br br this was not a great event only two matches had any real build and the whole thing came off as being rushed the in ring action wasnt great and the twist at the end which ill discuss later really wasnt the earth shattering moment the wwe hoped it would bebr br this forgettable night started off with shawn micheals defending his intercontinental championship against the undefeated tatanka tatanka had beaten michaels a couple of times leading into the fight michaels had a new manager luna vachon while tatanka was accompanied by michaels former manager and future wwe hall of famer sherri martel tatanka won by dq michaels kept his title and went straight back into his feud with marty janetty which had been put on hold just for wrestlemania why i have no ideabr br next up saw the steiner brothers scott and rick defeat the headshrinkers samu and fatu with scott scoring the pin after hitting samu with the frankensteiner good matchbr br doink the clown needed help from another clown to win his match against crush a second doink distracting crush when he was in complete control and allowing doink to get the pin and the victory doink was an entertaining gimmick character who got old rather quicklybr br razor ramon easily defeated the returning bob backlund in the next matchbr br this brings us to the first in our double main event as the mega maniacs team of hulk hogan and brutus beefcake with the newly turned good guy jimmy hart in their corner took on harts former buddies money inc ted dibiase and irwin r shyster this was a fairly sketchy finish beefcake as mentioned had been in a paragliding accident requiring full facial surgery and had wrestled the match with a face mask on shyster ripped the mask off him and beat beefcake to a pulp the ref went down hogan grabbed the face mask and knocked out dibiase and shyster and then hart who was wearing a referee shirt counted the three another ref came down and reversed the decision declaring money inc winners by dqbr br next up lex luger or the narcissist as he was also known at the time defeated mr perfect this match came about because luger was being managed by perfects old manager bobby heenan perfect had is feet on the ropes when he was pinned but the ref missed itbr br the undertaker picked up a lacklustre dq victory in a pretty poor match against the giant gonzales the undertaker had earned the ire of gonzales manager harvey wippleman in 1992 and taker had defeated his big monster kamala at survivor series wippleman vowed revenge and took it at the royal rumble as gonzales attacked taker costing him the match gonzales dominated undertaker in this match but was dqd for choking taker out with chloroform weird finish to a bad matchbr br this bought us to our main event as wwe champion bret hart seriously challenged as champion for the first time put his title on the line against mr fujis unstoppable monster yokozuna yokozuna controlled the early going but hart resisted and then took control he had yokozuna in the sharpshooter surely he would give in and hart would be established as an heroic hero after taking out the big monster but fuji had other ideas throwing salt in harts face rendering the canadian helpless as yokozuna got the pinbr br what a downer ending but wait here comes hulk hogan hes checking hart to make sure hes ok suddenly fuji challenges hogan to a wwe title right then and there hogan accepts fuji throws salt towards hogan but hits yokozuna instead hogan hits the leg drop and wins the match and the title what did i just watch and so what most fans thought was going to be the night we either saw hart establish himself as a giant killer or yokozuna establish himself as an unstoppable monster we instead saw hulk hogan pick up a meaningless title win a title that he would not defend for three months as a matter of fact this was the only match hogan wrestled for the wwe before the king of the ring ppv in june 1993
