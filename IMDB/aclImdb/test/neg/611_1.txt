i am very diplomatic in my reviews and as an academic writer try to give creative license to tv writers trying to explicate a true story this story about karen carpenter could have helped so many yet due to the directing and editing does notbr br the story in this case is not fully addressed unless one reads psychological journals while cynthia gibb portrays a realistic karen it is sad that so much has been editedlouise fletcher portrays her mother and does an excellent job with limited material and dialogue in this case i give the actors credit for surviving this projectbr br why is the audience not permitted to see causation factorsamerican audiences are quite savvy and if they have cable usually educatedbr br i sincerely feel that i could have written a better story would not have edited out the truth and allowed the actors to project the realitybr br richard carpenter as director has seriously underestimated and insulted american audiences karens story is important and it is sad we will never hear it
