this movie was a waste of time it looks nice pretty settings nicely acted appears earnest and seems to be leading somewhere so you stay tuned awaiting a meaningful payoff it doesnt happen br br it surprised me that so much effort could be put into a movie it was clearly very professionally done and have an outcome that seems nothing short of a bmoviebr br save your precious time and see a good french film like les visiteurs funny jean de florette or manon of the spring i cant recall the language in europa europa but thats another great filmheavy but very worth viewingbr br this film appears to promise a lot but delivers nothing
