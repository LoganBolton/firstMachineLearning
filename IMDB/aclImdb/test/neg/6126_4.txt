the beginning of the film is promising when jeanne polletanna mouglalis hear the story of the incident that happen on the day she was born that raise the possibility that she is the daughter of a famous pianist andré polonski jacques dutrone she set to find out whether its true or not and giving the fact the she plays also the piano thats not such a remote idea jeanne meet andré and his wife mika mullerisabelle huppert and their son and on the way uncover the fact that there are some secrets in that family as much in her ownbr br ok we have seen this before and it has been done in a more interesting way than herethe character of mika muller is left with out us understanding her motives to her action and she is not interesting enough to care for her the piano scenes look fake and the whole piano subplot doesnt add anything to the characters insight but serve as to make the film longer than it should have been in the first placebr br in short a very disappointing outing from chabrol who can do better than this
