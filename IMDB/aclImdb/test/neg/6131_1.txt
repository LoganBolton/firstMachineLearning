jesus christ what the hell happened here this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen how is it possible that they screwed up such a nice idea for a movie to tell you the truth i was so hyped for this i though it was like blair witch but with actual alien creatures chasing the camera guy goddamn it i have been reduced to fast forwarding this pile of sht and i never do that while seeing movies the high rating here on imdb makes me believe that actual aliens are giving 10s for this piece of crapbr br invasion is about well an invasion the movie starts by saying that everything youre about to see is real blahblahblah then they go and tell me about a special camera system used in cars as if i need to believe their bullsht to enjoy this movie next thing you know im seeing the most boring car driving ever filmed in a forest at night mind you is this a movie or a disney theme park ride the first 20 minutes is all boring dialog between cops while seeing grass and one straight road with a flashlight where the hell were the aliens they were sleeping of course then we learn that bad acting is not only reduced to high school plays as the cop behind the camera goes out of his car to look for a missing man who was nightfishing and had stumbled upon a mysterious meteorite i wonder what happens to him out of nowhere we see the nightfishing guy walking like a zombie the cop is apparently too dumb to notice that something is wrong with this man apparently he was indeed dumb as the zombiealien guy injects in the cops ear some sort of alien parasite thus changing him into an alien then the copalien goes back into his car looks for a young couple that were having sex a while back in the forest gets to them changes the guy into an alien and then the girl runs to the cops car and escapes if this quick plot introduction didnt get it in your head that this movie was bad then the following 40 minutes will watching this movie is as painful as stabbing yourself repeatedly with a plastic fork the script while it may sound interesting on the back of the dvd box is badly directed and sadly we are left with another boring straight to dvd atrocitybr br the only thing that kept me awake were the constant flashing and loud sound effects lamentably if seeing the same forest trail for 63 minutes is not enough we must endure crappy flashing techniques to scare the viewer and constant wailing of a bad actress that gets old and annoying pretty quickbr br if you feel you must rent this i say to you why there are better scifihorror films out there even the dreaded remake of the invasion of the body snatchers is more entertaining than this for the love of all things good dont bother with his crap my eyes bled and for the first time i wanted suicide a 110 avoid this like a disease
