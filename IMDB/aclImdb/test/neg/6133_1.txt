okay first i should say that i assume this was just made by a group of friends with a limited budget with that in mind it really shouldnt be compared to blockbuster features and my rating would be higher but stillbr br after giving it a chance it still violated some basic filmmaking rules to such an extent that both the viewer and the amateur director in me cringed a lotbr br think blair witch in a car but really boringbr br think you left your camcorder on the dashboard and recorded yourself getting lost in the park at night for an hour then making your friends watch itbr br the scariest part possible spoiler alert if spoiling here is possible was at one point the picture rewinds and you might think you will have to watch it all over again scarybr br silliness aside this is a pretty good idea for a lowbudget letsgomakeamovietonight film but the concept walks a fine line between being really good and really bad and lets just say it wasnt really good there were just too many parts where nothing happened at first i thought that was the directors plan  you were supposed to be lulled into a sense of security and then really scary things would start happening butnobr br i kept trying to find good things to say about it and i had plenty of time to think and ill say the music was kinda cool and i have to give the female lead credit for standing around by herself looking scared for a really really long time but thats it the actors playing infected people looked as if they were making fun of zombie movies or they got their motivation from the bug wearing his edgar suit from mib chances are if for some strange reason youre going to watch this movie its on dvd or tivo so you can fast forward it whenever waiting for something to happen gets too difficultbr br i hate to be so critical of something but at the same time ive watched a lot of similar movies and nothing has ever been this painful if they just chopped a half an hour out of it and added some scary stuff it might be decent maybe thatll be the directors cut
