ive become a big fan of the carpenters and i didnt really enjoy this moviebr br i feel it focused far too much on her anorexia and didnt let her true personality shine through i wasnt overly fond of cynthia gibbs portrayal especially knowing she decided karens anorexia was suicide which it clearly wasnt although her family was not big on hugs and kisses i thought the movie portrayed agnes their mother as being terriblebr br i did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier i thought the metaphor sotospeak there was rather effective when the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her frail body was pretty moving which is probably the wrong word as wellbr br overall i feel they needed to bring out her more bubbly quirky sideher genuine personality even as the focus of the film there really wasnt a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia though of course no one can really know and almost made it seem baseless the film was more poorsingerwithanorexia than karen carpenters story in my opinionbr br i would assume that they changed her husbands nameprofession and all because they couldnt get his permission to actually include him there were some bad terms there but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes on this note i cant recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husbandbr br on the whole it ends up as a lowbudget madefortv movie that just isnt very high quality and can be disappointing if youre a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond karens disease i feel that such a legend deservesdeserved a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice
