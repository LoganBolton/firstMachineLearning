hey i really do not know why this film has been appreciated so muchperhaps i missed the pointthe way i see it  a lot of international film makers have made brilliant films that have dealt with schizophrenia and have informed excited shockedevoked emotion and compelled the audience to step aside from their own reality and thinkwhile it is true that aparna sens endeavor was an ambitious one in light of all the other movies  this one falls short miserablyit was too slow there were no details about anything and the ending  was completely pointlessit was not open ended or anything just pointlessso watch it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted
