i saw this film when it first came out in the cinema we were all looking forward to seeing mark hamill relaunch his career but we came out wishing we hadnt bothered many people walked out after about half an hour  i wish i had too the basic premise seems okay but the plot was ridiculously involved and tortuous and runs out half way through its completely unmemorable and not a film you want to have paid money to see if youre really bored and its on tv then itll help you kill a couple of hours or help you to nod off 210
