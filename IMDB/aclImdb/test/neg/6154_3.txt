yeeeehaa br br i have seen it argued that most american movies are cowboy movies in disguise that hollywood is so in love with its only truly original creation that it keeps reinventing the cowboy myth im not sure i totally buy that argument but slipstream is evidence in support of the theory its a cowboy movie with aeroplanes br br actually it goes one better than that its a spagetti western with aeroplanes substitute the planes with horses make the android a priest and this movie would be indistinguishable from any one of a dozen italian spanish semiarty shootemups with pretensions of the seventiesbr br the film isnt as bad as i had been lead to believe by some of the reviews i had read here but it certainly wasnt good
