the quote above just about says it all for slipstream i should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour but decided i ought to be fair and give it a chance i wont watch it again so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clich√©d lines in the movie im sure it will set a recordbr br some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker mark hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and bill paxton is his quarry paxtons character has hijacked hamills prisoner an android taking his name from the poet byron bob peck tasker hamill shoots owens paxton with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion belitski kitty aldridge can keep tabs on the pair the real question though is why didnt he just fire the device at byron thereby cutting out the middlemanbr br if you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense then i suppose youll find something of interest here but you cant convince me that the film makes sense on any level scenes of a futuristic stone age make way for high society snobbery but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when paxtons character is displayed following a night of revelry with hickeys all over his torso if anyone thinks theres some hidden meaning here youre really stretchingbr br patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming the end to come into view alas even that was denied if beauty is in the eye of the beholder then so is understanding this movie had neither yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run  an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons apparently the film was keeping them afloat
