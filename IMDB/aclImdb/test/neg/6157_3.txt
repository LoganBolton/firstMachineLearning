the story and the characters really really needed work the world idea is kind of neat but no one bothered to develop any of it either through exposition or through the plot despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the film it makes sense that you wouldnt use exposition since no one is new to this world and yet when matt owens bill paxton and byron bob peck stray offcourse and get lost and get introduced to the windworshipers and the fat lazy rich people in the museum we dont get any real idea of who these people are or why we should care about any of them smart films have ways of developing this simply by having the characters live in the world simple things like ordering a drink at a bar or talking about something in the past  these are the kind of things that make the film world memorable not endless shots of crappy planes and cheap cg effects of someone trying to do loops in an ultralightbr br if this is too difficult for you heres a little tip  pare down the multiple locations if everythings becoming disjointed because youre pulling up to often stay in one place for a little while and have the characters talk a little all the superfluous crap should be removed get rid of the entire windworshipers scene get rid of the stuffy museum people get rid of all the crappy flying crap unless you can make the wind relevant to the story have the entire thing set on a big plane or something just get people talking about something we care aboutbr br hey get rid of bill paxton have the film center around taskers character and his relationship with the robot byronbr br indeed the biggest problem of the film is that we dont care anything about anybody because no one takes the time to either explain their motivations or delve into their characters we dont like matt well because hes played by bill paxton among other things hes a scoundrel who doesnt redeem himself enough except to let the android byron go and this action has even less meaning than most because of three key points br br 1 byron is a murderer 2 byron is indestructible 3 byron can leave any time he damn well pleasesbr br we try to like byron because theres a kind of pathos there but its largely undeveloped all were left with is a whiny glassyeyed robot guy whos acting is subdued and wooden one moment and practically zany the next we dont know why or how he develops emotions but we do know for a fact that hes murdered someone we dont know why he murdered someone or the circumstances of this grisly event because it isnt developed we cant feel pity for him if we dont know the story all we know for a fact is that he murders people and he likes bill paxtonbr br we dont hate tasker enough partly because hes played by goodguy mark hamill since while gruff and ruthless doesnt do anything out of the ordinary for his character  a postapocalyptic peace officer sure he kills montclaire robbie coltrane and his team but they are drug dealers on their way to grow poppies for heroin and they shoot at him first he doesnt kill anyone who doesnt get in the way or who does not try to physically harm him first that goes equally well for the final confrontation in the museum he uses a smidge of police brutality against a lazy dilettante f murray abraham is wasted in this role and everyone else draws a gun on himbr br i really dont understand whats the deal with belitski kitty aldridge taskers partner after only an accumulated 10 minutes with matt shes ready to switch sides despite her shouts of loyalty and despite matts trashtalking her and punching her out if thats love then ill choose hate any daybr br really paxtons character is about as lovable as simon in true lies or pvt hudson from aliens does anyone fall for him in these movies no why because hes a loudmouthed idiot and a loser why put him at the helm of this film
