this film fails on many many levels the script is the first failing and as i understand it if the script stinks theres nothing that can fix that the plot is boring after the first 45 minutes im looking at the counter on the dvd saying to myself how much longer the cinematography is pretty awful im not sure how bad the transfer was to dvd but it looked like a vhs copy also the sound was bad i realize this isnt going to get remixed for 51 but yikes it didnt even sound like it was in dolby stereo which had been around for almost a decade when they cut this filmbr br slipstream was far too similar to both mad max and blade runner for comfort because of the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialog it is extremely disappointing if i recall the pointer scene took place during the last 20 minutes usually it should take place in the first 20 most people will be totally confused as to what the heck is going on until the final 20 minutesbr br the films music was excellent in parts and then completely inappropriate in others elmer bernstien did the scoring but it sounds like someone else had a hand in sticking in other stuff elsewhere as it doesnt match the overall good orchestral score with some synthesizer musicbr br there were great actors cast bob peck mark hamill ben kingsley bill paxton and they did a great job breathing the little available life into their characters well paxtons character was pretty stupid and the whole movie was centered on him im not sure a heroic stooge is a good choice for the main character who carries the film again a major flaw with the scriptbr br thank goodness i watched this from a mail order dvd service and not the theater overall a major disappointment for scifi fans or fans of paxton or hamill 90 minutes of your life youll never get back
