they say david duchovny took six days to write the script for this movie that sounds about rightbr br this movie is one of the worst films ive ever seen and ive seen gigli its not as bad as gigli but thats like saying saddam hussein wasnt as bad as adolf hitlerbr br tom warshaw has been living in france with his french wife and 13year old son he has been pretending to be french all this time he reveals to his wife that he is actually american for some reason this comes as an earthshattering reveal for her despite the fact that she always commented on her husbands american accent also their son  remember he was born in france and never knew his father was american  speaks perfect american english without a hint of french accent thats just one of several huge plot holes in this moviebr br the main bulk of the movie is a flashback to tommys youth in new york city during the 1970s as he explains to his wife why he has been hiding in france his best friend as a boy was pappas a retarded adult played terribly by robin williams i assume duchovny thinks that retarded is someone who is just sort of dumb because pappas comes off only mildly slow at times while other times he comes off as just robin williams yes williams actually fits in his tired improv schtick although he is supposed to play a person who is mentally slowbr br tommys mother played by duchovnys wife tea leoni is a pillpopping nurse who is distraught over the recent death of her husband leoni does a good job but she mainly just smokes a lot and yells at tommy for things that dont seem to be too important the script didnt give her much to work with tommy also befriends a lady whom he calls lady who is in prison and offers him advice through her jail window this house of detention is called house of d for short thus the title tommy has no qualms yelling his personal problems out loud on a city street so this incarcerated felon can offer him advice and he does so many times without carebr br i dont want to bore you with the entire summary of the movie but plot holes are abound in this film that tries way too hard to be touching but comes off as well bad real bad real real bad near the end of this train wreck the script gets cornier and cornier and ends with a laughably crappy endingbr br critics tore house of d apart and rightfully so i cant believe some people actually like this movie it is a painful film to sit through and i felt weak afterwards  not from emotion but from how terrible it was
