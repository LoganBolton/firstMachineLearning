an american boy goes to paris after his mother commits suicide becomes and artist and then discovers himself and returns to the states so he can make things right with his former friendsbr br i have to think that the people who are rating this movie so highly are all xfiles fans even though there are no aliens or serial killers in it dont be fooled this movie blows chunksbr br the story is incoherent with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why when you do get an explanation it doesnt fit the story that went before it what it does is bore you for all the acting talent in the film it just isnt interesting i spent the whole movie wondering when sexaddict duchovny was going to bang someone maybe he was doing it behind the scenes they should have filmed that insteadbr br what comes across is a story of a selfobsessed artist worrying about minor incidents in his life and wanting to make them right somehow  even though they didnt seem that wrong to begin with there arent any particularly interesting or shocking revelations despite the mention of a big secret in the first few minutes its just a guy thinking that his life is as interesting to you as it is to him its notbr br i saw in the trivia that duchovny claims he wrote the script in a week thats entirely believable the guy can act theres no doubt but writing and directing are obviously beyond his talentsbr br why hollywood keeps greenlighting these selfdiscovery stories is beyond me i discover myself in the shower every morning but i dont bother making a movie about it mine would probably be better than this one though at least there would be some nudity
