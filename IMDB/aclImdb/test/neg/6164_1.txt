unfortunately house of d is just awful with a ridiculous plot terrible writing some mediocre acting and in fact just about everything else about it is subparbr br tom flees nyc to somehow survive as a lone child in paris and manages to convince the beautiful parisian girl he eventually marries that hes french despite a poor grasp of her language shes shocked when years later he reveals his secret to her riiiightbr br he then gifts his tale of woe to his own son and who we are expected to believe thinks thats just the greatest birthday gift a dad can give his 13 year old boy if only such things were so easy david duchovny miscasts his own wife tea leoni in the role of his mother and strikes out yet again leoni makes me laugh as a comic but shes just plain wrong for this rolebr br one of the problems with that is none of the characters are sympathetic i just didnt give a damn what happened to any of them i did rather hope that robin williams and his trademark child in a grownups body schtick would fall into a village pothole but alas it was not to be and we had to endure his simpering performance all the waybr br anton yelchin and williams daughter zelda were not bad but i suspect the rave reviews others are giving them is simply because they werent anywhere near as bad as everyone else in this movie they werent great let me put it that waybr br there are so many silly and contrived aspects to this film  erykah badu the bicycle the catholic school and its staff of morons the conveniently stupid characters etc  that this review would go on for ever so ill just finish up by saying that house of d is a very poor movie and im almost embarrassed for duchovnybr br the thing that really annoys me is how i was so strongly encouraged by online friends to see this that i traveled a long way to do sobr br i would not have been so annoyed that this movie is so bad if id just wasted a couple of hours down at the local movie theater but instead i lost a whole day and discovered that my socalled friends are either stupid or dishonest because this is an awful movie
