im sorry guys all who thought this film could be something great im afraid you would be disappointedbr br the standard the movie wanted to set is completely ruined by some very simple plot so simple that the movie is not evolving until the end i asked myself if the plot wasnt about the action but about the main character played by mickey rourke but i found that the character was inconsistent  either he is a professional killer or some guilt haunted brother but both dont go together because the kid he tries to guide poses him in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself now joseph gordonlevitt is a good looking actor but he played his character a little unnatural i didnt believe his acting it looked like the director tried to pull out of him some personality he couldnt provide and he didnt have to because his less crazy behavior was creepy enough the only one whose acting was great was diane lane if not her i would give this movie 1 starbr br in conclusion i expected to see some well played movie and some interesting plot and i completely blew it with my high expectations
