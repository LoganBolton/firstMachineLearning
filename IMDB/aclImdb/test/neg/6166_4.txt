based on the elmore leonard novel of the same name killshot suffers from a lack of focus direction and creativity  all elements which the original story likely had and negative test screenings forced severe edits including the complete excising of a character resulting in a film that feels almost nothing like a leonard story far too many characters populate a storyline too simplistic and straightforward not a typical trait of the authors work and the focus continually switches between two hit men who are difficult to like and a troubled couple who dont command our sympathy while the story itself provides precious few twists and turns sadly by the end of the film its appeal still remains a mystery br br washedup hitman armand the blackbird degas mickey rourke follows a strict code during his missions that inadvertently sours his latest assignment now on the run from his former employer he haphazardly joins forces with inept misfit criminal richie nix joseph gordonlevitt to gain some quick cash by extorting a wealthy realtor when struggling couple carmen and wayne colson diane lane and thomas jane are privy to the thieves blundered plot they are forced into hiding as the crazed killers will stop at nothing to silence the two witnesses br br killshot proves that being based on an elmore leonard novel isnt grounds for immediate success or even a promising adaptation the characters situations and even resolutions in the film are all tired and unoriginal and only very randomly hint at something more its not that there wasnt potential especially when rourkes blackgarbed calm and collected assassin perfectly executes a hit during the opening scene  purpose and principals are just continually abandoned as each minute ticks away the style and manner in which each character is introduced is the most intriguing visually the roles of bird and even wayne are fleshed out befittingly giving immediate interest and depth to personas that typically end in a creative impassebr br the pairing of the cold and calculating black bird with the irrational and explosive richie is an enticing combination comparisons to fargo would be extravagantly too kind except that each character seems to slowly lose track of the traits that kept them initially interesting as richie starts picking up the more experienced killers habits bird loosens his grip on his own methods of murder regardless of what he sees in his momentary lighthearted fling with donna rosario dawson its hard to imagine that his final confrontation with panicky carmen would provoke a confession of his true nature and subsequent carelessness that drastically affects his outcome likely or not this is killshots unfortunate downfall  and little entertainment can be garnered from these characters who steadily lose their originality by continually contradicting the habits that once made them intriguing br br  the massie twins
