let me first state that i rarely review movies i only comment if im blown away or disappointed in something that i thought was going to be good killshot was a major disappointment on so many levels the script was horrible the acting was subpar espically coming from heavy weights like rourke and lane and the editing and effects were comical blowing up cars etc etc rosario dawson had a horrible role i cant believe would even accept it it was such a misuse of her talent i cant even put into words i should have know after i saw the trailer for this movie 3 years ago and it kept being put on the shelve that their was a serious problem with this film b movie all the waydont bother unless your really bored
