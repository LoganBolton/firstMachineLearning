i decided to watch this movie in order to fall asleep it kept me awake so it was interesting however it was pretty blandbr br the acting was good i dont think any of the actors did a bad job mickey rourke is as believable as an overthehill hitman can be the dialogue in this movie does not provide much opportunity for these actors to show off their full potential but they still shinedbr br the atmosphere was great music was good and colors matched the mood that the director wanted to paint for the viewers even the weather enhanced the mood of the movie everything was well donebr br the failures of this movie are in its story development the storyline with the mafia vs blackbird doesnt get enough attention the storyline for carmen and waynes divorce doesnt get explained the fbi seems to work extra fast here is there no paperwork for all these processes is it really that easy to dig up your brothers body from his grave burn the corpse and have it be identified as you there are too many loops in the storyline for me to give this movie anything higher than a 4 out of 10 rating i wouldnt recommend this movie to people unless theyre really bored and have smoked some really good weed even if wow is down for maintenance go find something better to do than watch this movie
