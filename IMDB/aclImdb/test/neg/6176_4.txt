following the whirlwind success of the wrestler see my review mickey rourke had this gem head straight to video every copy was rented for months and i even heard some good buzz around it so months later i caught it on a movie network and sat down to watch it first of allone of the locations in the film walpole island is a place i used to visit on a regular basis as a child because we lived very very close to the reserve cool huh thats about where the coolness ends with this dud i mean the story is decent enough to warrant a four and even the direction is not bad but the performances are just awful and downright ridiculous with some truly wasted star power and mickey  rourke playing a native canadianamerican hitman what in the lords name were they thinking he doesnt even resemble native blood and his attempt at the generic native accent made him look even more ridiculous they could have went anywhere with this storythey could have hired a native actor or changed rourkes character how about a white man raised by native parents instead they made killshot a complete and utter jokebr br as you may have caught mickey rourke stars in killshot i use that term loosely i have never liked rourke much although his oscar winning performance was decent enough this shows and confirms my dislike for him he looks bored constantly bored and his lame attempt at portraying a native is bordering on insulting i would think he makes a decent cold blooded killer but then the story never explores that part of him which is totally backwards to the story diane lane although well respected in hollywood turns in another drab performance she has had her moments but overall she just usually doesnt take off in any one performance she looks like she is going to be great but then when she isnt its even more disappointing thomas jane plays her protective husband ive always felt jane deserves a bigger career than he has i think hes got action star in his blood all said and done his performance in killshot is actually not bad he doesnt take things too far and hes tough and almost heroic in a way him and lane manage to have decent chemistry but he doesnt get a lot in the way of his character i have absolutely no idea why rosario dawson a did this movie and b had a character at all her character is absolutely useless and had no point to the plot or story making any performance she would give equally as bad i have rarely seen a character who is supporting so incredibly useless the only redeeming character and performance in this film is that given by joseph gordonlevitt as the deranged mini killer who wants to team up with rourkes hitman gordonlevitt is over the top crazy and entertaining and his character is actually engaging if this film had been entirely about him it would have been a smash he literally saves this from utter crap his performance is almost worth watching this drivel forbr br oscar nominated directorwhoa wait yes oscar nominated director john madden i think the football coach could have done a better job helms this mess i have actually never seen shakespeare in love but i remember the critical acclaim it received and it surprised me because the direction in this film and with the characters was downright awful screenplay writer hossein amini has done nothing i recognize but apparently has been slated to write the next jack ryan movie and after this mess i cant even imagine why theyd want him i understand this is based on a novel and i really hope the novel is worlds above this mess a little bit of action and some sort of hokey attempt at an emotionally charged story of a hitman and his partner and the mess they get involved in unfortunately unless youre a huge rourke fan or really love joseph gordonlevitt then there is no reason to put yourself through this pain i did it for you and i still feel the pain 410
