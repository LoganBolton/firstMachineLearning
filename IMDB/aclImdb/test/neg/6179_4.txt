so as far as i gather this episode is trying to make a statement about how reallife villains are very bad people and this is just as scary as the paranormal the paranormal imagery associated with the villain donnie is purely symbolic hes actually just a normal human beingbr br the problem is that i just dont buy it donnie is simply not scarier than the paranormal hes not even that scary at all as a guy who seems confused and weird rather than malicious likes dead girls and hair and has only newly become a murderer hes significantly less disturbing than most wellknown reallife serial killers eg hes like a very watereddown version of ed gein which is why scullys horror at seeing nothing but bodies with hair and nails cut off something not too different from a normal personal hygiene routine before anybody has even been killed or hurt at all is completely out of character she sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly flinchesbr br so as comic book guy says worst episode ever
