felony is a bmovie no doubt about itbr br of course if you take a look at the cast lineup you might have some high hopes for its entertainment potential this film is stuffed with all of those wonderful character actors that you grew up with the ones with the faces you immediately recognize even though you probably dont know their names its amazing that the filmmakers were able to get all of these people together on one project almost like they decided to do a bmovie actor reunion the cast even includes a couple of really firstrate actors david warner who most people will recognize from titanic although my favorite of his roles is jack the ripper in time after time and lance henriksen who many will remember as bishop in aliens these two actors have done some excellent work in their long careers and made some very fine filmsbr br however as impressive as this collection of actors is their talent is never fully manifested on the screen the writers of felony spent a lot of money to assemble a dreamteam cast and then missed their golden opportunity because of one important factor the common denominator of all bmovies a silly scriptbr br we start with a silly premise the bad guys are caught on tape committing a gruesome murder and they relentlessly pursue the film crew in order to acquire the videotape and destroy the evidence but honestly why bother in the time it takes them to track down the film crew a thousand copies of that tape could be made and circulated to every law enforcement agency and media outlet the criminals dont seem to realize how futile their effort is and they talk as if stealing and destroying the one original videotape is going to solve the whole problem sillybut i suppose if the bad guys were so logical there would be no moviebr br then there is the dialogue it is at times silly at times clich√© and at times unbelievableeverything you have come to expect from a bmovie of course i have always believed that strong performances can overcome a lot of weaknesses in the material this cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances and although a number of the cast members are not good actors at all and have achieved bmovie status quite deservedly one still might be hopeful that the stronger part of the cast would be able to infuse some life into their parts however its disappointing to see that few of the actors in this film really seem to take the movie seriously enough to give it their best shot theres not much inspiration evident in these performances but then again its an uninspiring script now ill admit that some of the more colorful actors in the cast do manage to add a certain amount of pizazz into the delivery of their lines but honestly even the very fine actors i mentioned earlier seem mostly disinterested and uninvolved with the storybr br speaking of the storyeven if the acting had been of a high enough caliber that it made the dialogue seem a little less cheesy it still would not redeem felony from the fact that its writer commits the ultimate faux pas of low budget action movie scripts a plot with as many holes as a block of swiss cheese you can watch this movie a hundred times and you still wont figure out how everything adds up in an effort to create suspense and always keep the viewer guessing the writer throws in all kinds of surprises and unexpected twists into his script and ends up with a jigsaw puzzle but when you get to the end you find there are a bunch of pieces that just dont fit anywhere and others that are missing i admire a good thriller that keeps me guessing but creating plot twists that exist just to confuse you and which are not consistent with the rest of the story is amateurish there was so much that was never explained that i felt extremely frustrated at the end if you decide to watch it be prepared to be confusedbr br i havent even mentioned all kinds of other silly things about this movie but i wont bother the funny thing is that despite everything ive said i have to admit that i cant give felony 110 stars although i cant exactly put my finger on why i actually found this film to be somewhat likable the silliness can actually be fun at times if you are in the mood for it plus i really like some of these character actors and even though their performances are somewhat lackluster considering their talents i still got a kick out of seeing thembr br now i realize i have been rating this film from the standpoint of a serious moviegoer its entirely possible i have completely missed the point it could be that the filmmakers intention all along was to make a bmovie maybe the silliness is all completely intentional if thats the case and if i were to rate it on those terms i would have to say that felony is a classic in the genre of tongueincheek action flicks bmovie fans will love seeing all of their favorite actors together in one film will get some chuckles from the script and will be entertained by the healthy dose of guns explosions and chases
