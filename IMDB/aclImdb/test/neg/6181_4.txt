ok so i saw this movie at this years sundance and i was sorely unimpressed it took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense and it took another 30 minutes before the hamfisted script gave way to a working plot that wasnt contingent on a closeup of ryan goslings smile or contrived moralizing after the first 45 minutes however the script blossomed into a watchable albeit not completely entertaining or thoughtprovoking the highlights certainly include both gosling and morses acting gosling being an upandcoming star and morse being an extremely wellestablished character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions as a sidenote after the screening i was talking a little smack about the movie to some of my friends when david morse walked right behind mehe looks like the nicest guy in the world but hes a solid 62 and probably outweighs me by 50 pounds i removed my foot from my mouth and promptly changed the subject
