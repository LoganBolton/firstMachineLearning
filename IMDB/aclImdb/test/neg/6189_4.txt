atmosphere and droll dialog dont redeem this overrated classic boyer is a french thief hiding in the casbah of algiers while the police try to figure out how to get him out meanwhile he falls for lamarr and tries to find a way to escape the film is slow to get started and never really goes anywhere reminiscent of casablanca in some ways its completely lacking any larger theme than the wanted man seducing a good woman its all talktalktalk with endless scenes of boyer swaggering among his idiot cohorts and boyer wooing lamarr in the shadows personally i didnt care for boyers character for a minute so the tension was utterly nonexistentbr br stock 1930s character actors stumble thru the mushy plot as boyers henchmenguys who clearly do not belong in algiers sigrid gurie is the wildlyoveracting jealous girlfriend of boyer his brazen womanizing in front of her doesnt bode well for any future he might have with lamarrbr br especially bad is a long sequence in which an underling comes to tell boyer how another henchman was captured it sounds exciting too bad we didnt see it for ourselves the ending is completely anticlimactic and seems to be remarkable only because it is not a hollywood happy ending that doesnt stop it from being sappy
