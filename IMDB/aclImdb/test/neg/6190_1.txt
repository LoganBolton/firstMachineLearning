algiers is not a classic it is a perversion of the wonderful original pepe le moko directed by duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming pepe jean gabin if you want to fully experience the casbah and the characters in algiers i recommend you dont even watch this movie and see pepe le moko instead for it is much more elaborate more beautifully filmed the lines are not clich√©d and the characters adhere much more to reality furthermore the ending is so dramatic and key to pepes character that youll find the algiers version intolerable although algiers does an almost excellent job mimicking each scene the acting falls short as does the credibility of the characters plus the wardrobe is truly breathtaking in all scenes particularly pepes in the last scene and gabys at all times but also when shes on the boat frankly algiers is cheap as far as imitations go
