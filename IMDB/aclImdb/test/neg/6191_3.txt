pepe le moko played by charles boyer is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout europe and to stay free he holes himself up in the casbah a mysterious part of algiers where even the police are reluctant to go until a senior officer is sent from paris to capture le moko once and for all for le moko although the casbah allows him to remain out of police custody it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time  a place he cant leave because the moment he does he knows hell be arrestedbr br boyers performance was good and i can understand why he was nominated for an oscar he captures the essence of such a character  a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time the movie itself unfortunately was quite a letdown a number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent of which ill mention two first was the idea that the police wouldnt enter the casbah that was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the casbah fairly regularly so neither the suggestion by commissioner janvier that the police wouldnt enter nor the statement by inspector slimane also a decent performance by joseph calleia that they could get into the casbah but not out seemed to make much sense i also found it difficult to believe that le moko  hardened criminal mastermind that he was  could be so quickly swept off his feet by gaby hedy lamarr to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the casbah to find her essentially giving himself up i understand the irony of the final few scenes of course as pepe leaves the freedom of his prison the casbah only to find real freedom in his capture because hes shot and killed by the police i just found it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such a trapbr br this is worth watching for boyer and to a lesser extent calleia but the story is disappointing and inconsistent 310
