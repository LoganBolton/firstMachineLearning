okay i sensed that a film by mormons about mormons for mormons would be a disaster waiting to happen but little did i know how so very painful it would be a little known fact is that mormons have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films the churchs official cinematic campaign has produced rare and lasting gems that transcend the mormon community including the wonderful short film cipher in the snow which ended up making the rounds as an educational film in the late 70s then theres neil labutes disturbingly masterful ouvrebr br however the success of these films depended largely on the fact that they didnt focus on mormons or any specific mormon theology instead they opt to focus on a universal theme and deal with it on a basic human level gods army abandons any pretext of universality and runs headlong into the stilted and myopic world of the orthodox while this might be enough to alienate anyone but the most devoted mormon director richard ductchers ineptitude as a filmmaker and his juvenile approach to storytelling are sufficient grounds to judge gods army unwatchable by almost any standardbr br dutchers own appallingly wooden acting sets the tone for his army of the least interesting mormons youre ever likely to meet of course the casts sorry performances arent helped any by dutchers pathetic script he should be given credit for not avoiding some of the more controversial aspects of the church but as can be expected he conveniently frames these controversies in a sympathetic light it should also come as no surprise that most of the answers to the churchs darker side are addressed with little other than faith at one point an africanamerican missionary is scolded by a black couple for joining a church that was segregated up until 1978 some ten to twenty years after nearly every congregation in the most degenerate parts of the deep south had already done so instead of addressing the churchs actively racist history perhaps the sorest spot in mormon theology which even church leaders dont defend anymore dutchers troubled character instead ponders joseph smiths murderan obvious and perhaps outrageous allusion to lynching top off this syruppy milktoast with third grader leper jokes passing as comic relief and you have a strong case for the revival of silent filmsbr br if you knew little about mormons before watching this film you might become prone to avoiding them at all costs if you are mormon this film offers absolutely nothing to be proud about
