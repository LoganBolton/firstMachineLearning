david dhawan copied hitch and such an unofficial copy the film isnt even 12 as funny or amusing as the original its boring with forced stories like the lara track of having a child and no hubby plus there is an unwanted stupid chota don and david tries to choke drama too but the film looks disjointed boringbr br songs just pop in so does romance and everything barring some funny govinda scenes the dance before interval nothing else is worth mentioning the last few scenes are quite funny but there tend to get too longbr br davids direction is as bad as maine pyaar kyun kiyaa he needs to change his style or attempt something good music is saving grace some songs are good but the situations seem forcedbr br govinda looks overweight and seems too loud and screams his lines in initial reels but he gets into the groove and gives his best in the office and the scene with salman in his cabin and towards the endbr br salman just plays himself and his nasal tone plus his fake style of acting is a headachebr br lara is avoidable katrina is fake as usualbr br the kid overacts
