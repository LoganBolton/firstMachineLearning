i just dont know how this stupid crap junk garbage  good for nothing film is a blockbuster it was so boring with a very very weak or no storyline and wasnt even a jot funny the film was about 135 minutes of only a paragraph of story about prem salman khan is a love guru and is helping hapless  romantic bhaskar govinda to get the girl he wants im not saying that i didnt like the film because it wasnt funny or anything i will accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story the only two reasons why i can say its a superhit are br br 1 salman khan  govinda are onscreen together but there first time together was in salaam e ishq which was a flop so it cant be but it was a really good moviebr br 2 salman khans name is prem and all the films with that name have been a hit including maine pyar kiya so its just luckbr br i heard that its a remake of hitch ive not seen it  im glad i didnt music is ok the only good songs are do you want a partner youre my love  soni de nakhre but what is the use of it in a really bad film that too if you have someone like katrina kaif who dances with two left feet she is completely crap neither she knows acting language her voice is always dubbed for her dance and always fails to impress i do not like her one bit she was even disappointing in koffee with karan overall partner is a disposable film with a disposable actress katrina kaif its better off that she is kicked out of bollywood and never comes back again
