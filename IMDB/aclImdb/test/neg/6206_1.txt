this is not a good movie it is a tried remake of the english movie the hitch but it insults the original one this is hardly a movie you expect from a veteran director like david dhawan who is credited to directing good movies like raja babu coolie no1 hero no 1br br the main theme for this movie is taken from the hitch with some changes so as to appeal to the indian audience but somehow the story and the screenplay is not convincing enough plus the acting from the lead roles ie salman khan and govinda is pitiful it seems that they need the slightest provocation to remove their shirts to reveal their bare chest i do not consider this fascinating and least of all comic what was the director thinking  added to this the viewers have to bear the case of govindas overacting it was simply unbearable i advise the viewers to watch it at your own risk my rating of 2 for this movie could be considered to be a very generous onebr br instead i would advise the viewers to watch the english movie hitch which is a lot better
