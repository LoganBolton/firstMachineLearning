this is another bollywood remake of a hollywood movie hitchif im correctbr br the film has some great moments which will have you laughing out loud which frankly only come from govinda who has become a legend within indian cinema and will always bring his a game in terms of comedies another bonus is rajpal yadav who is hilarious as the gangster who mimics don an indian icon of cinema lara dutta is a plusi know i sound shallow but its mainly because i have a soft spot for her she tries to be funny but its seems to be forced her acting is weakbut she still shines salman khan is atrocious he tries to bring the cool charming depths but fails miserably he over acts and keeps shouting for no apparent reason br br thats not acting mate thats called being mentally challengedbr br katrina kaif is just badnot very good at anything no charisma no talentand i dont see why people consider her pretty the plot was far fetched and i had a hard time believing that katrinas character was remotely attracted to govinda the only good thing is the musicyoure my love was the best in the soundtrack
