i couldnt i was bored not just because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was simply a bmovie whose plot was all about the cannibalism but the fact i was watching a subtitle foreign film which doesnt bother me at all but was still dubbedbr br the special effects were awful as the back of the plane splits off you can see the model is hollow as it breaks away in the phony snow most of the movie takes place on a sound stage that clearly is not real and almost looks like a play as the sounds of snow blowing all over are heard but not actually scenebr br but how what will they eat they have no food one military person its never clear what this guy does or why hes in charge says which im sure no one ever said in reality or even thought about food since they were concerned if the people were alive not how theyd eat it was simply a stupid line written to point out that yes they will have to eat the dead bodies to survivebr br when they finally decide to eat the bodies one man finds one shirtless body who despite being in the snow for however long is not remotely frozen in fact his flesh is very flexible and fresh he cuts the fresh meat off his back that again is not frozen or even cold it appears and this scene goes on for five minutes thats where i had to stop the remake alive was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that im sure the real survivors praised whereas i cant imagine any of them had anything nice to say about this version it was simply about eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary avoid
