this movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together i wouldnt call it a movie its more like a combination of 10 different unfinished illogical stories which are not all that funny therere several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning and they just disappeared from the story hes just trying too hard to fit everything in 2 12 hours i left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guybr br i think this movie is just an extended version of hitch padded with a lot more characters and dancingbr br if this is the best movie that this couple has ever made then im pretty sure im not interested in any of his previous ones
