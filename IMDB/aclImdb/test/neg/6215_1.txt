the supposed writer and director mrdhawan has copied almost the whole plot of the blockbuster hollywood movie hitch starring will smith many scenes are also exactly the same the plot was just copy pasted and some low grade humorprobably mrdhawans own creation and frequent dancing was added to increase the movie time to local standardsbr br although salman khan and govindas acting did give us some smiles however it does not suit legendary artists like them to be a part of plagiarism specially when they themselves keep telling people to stop buying pirated discs
