everyone knows the socalled plot so let me cut to the chasebr br forced frivolity miscast performers working hard to have fun so you can have fun the brilliant meryl streep gives it a great try pierce brosnan just plain embarrassing inexplicably set on a greek island lots of squealing shrieking women lotsbr br it was a silly juke box musical on stage now its a big splashy poorly shot screen juke box musical if you like abba soso if not an assault on the senses and an insult to whatever intelligence youre left with when you exit the theater i readily admit that i didnt really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did but for the love of god why does my gender shriek and squeal to convey delight ever sit next to a table of women who have had too much to drink and are absolutely determined to have great night out on the town thats the feeling of this whole project it just felt so good when it stopped
