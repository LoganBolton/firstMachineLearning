theres no better way to describe the horrendous experience thats to watch mamma mia hitler must be looking up saying to the pseudodirector phyllida lloyd you monster what have you donebr br everything about the movie is wrong justÂ… wrong even its success which is unexplainable i can understand when those crappy parody movies like epic movie make their minimal share of money and turn profit just because theyre cheap of course they are but when something like mamma mia makes 450 million dollars worldwide you think what the hell is wrong with the worldbr br and to think we have meryl streep one of the greatest alive actresses of the world in it what was she thinking i need the money she could say well then sell one of your grandchildren even that would be less embarrassing its not that meryl is good in a disastrous piece of err movie shes also disastrous when she sings even though shes got the vocals its ridiculous worse than her only pierce brosnan he used to be james bond now hes singing abba in a purple spandex during the credits of the worst movie ever really and when i mention abba not that i have anything against the band and their music though it doesnt help them when actors started singing badly dancing worse and the extras join then they pop out of nowhere frequently to present one terrible musical sequences after the other you wanna cry when the music starts and i love musicals but this is the first in the genre where you pray for actual silencebr br i could keep going the list goes on forever you could write a stephen king novel with the complete list of mistakes in this moviebr br to sum up go watch it really youve got to witness to understand and since its already a huge success who cares if it makes a few more dollars from you and its not liking youre selling your soul to the devil meryl did that before for the whole mankind and now the world must end because weve committed the ultimate evil and we must be destroyed
