this is a new approach to comedy it isnt funnybr br the joke is that this in and of itself is supposed to be funnybr br the story is based on a french short story located in paris and the characters have french names louis aubinard for example  played by  bob hoskins the movie also stars the equally french jeff goldblum and natasha richardson the situations are similar to and the characters perform as if in those carryon movies from years backbr br i believe these are also jokes  to cast these actors who make no attempt to act french in any way to have them cavort in the manner of broad english dance hall comedy and to leave the whole bloomin mystery unexplained to the audiencebr br in the humour department this is practically the algonquin round table isnt itbr br the movie tries to be charming and quirky and i guess these characteristics are sort of funny not as funny as duck soup or love and death perhaps but funnier than the deer hunter or the battleship potemkinbr br it is an example of personal filmmaking it makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience but stays true to its premise and its internal logic although all the situations are unbelievable they are logical within the films own bizarro worldbr br i generally like this kind of eccentric movie but i found this one to be paced too slowly to be dullwitted tedious and to provide too few pleasurable surprises or genuine wit it just kind of meanders in predictable and sophomoric ways and wastes some wonderful talents along the way it has to be the low point in the career of each of the major stars who are all otherwise distinguished players i found it to be the biggest waste of talent since the betsy and i wish i had never seen goldblum and hoskins in this thingbr br so call it an interesting miss and pass on it as a rental unless you really have a lot of time to killbr br
