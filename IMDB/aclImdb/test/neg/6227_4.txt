this movie is not that good at allits pretty stupid pretty annoying and very poorly donei really only saw this film was because one of my friends said they hated this filmalthough i didnt hate it as much as them i still found it to be a pretty bad filmthe only thing that is remotely good about this was that it was a little entertaining at times and also i feel that if it had been done a little better it would have been equally okaywhat i mean by a little better is that if it had been totally recast not have had it looked like it had been shot for a film festival and if the script had been improved it would have been a okay slasher filminstead it isnt but instead what it is now a crappy filmthe acting is atrocious i felt as if i was watching a couple of teens act for like a halloween show or thrill ride or somethingthe kills are pretty cheapas is the film itself and basically everything else is lowclassoverall this film really is bad and you wouldnt be missing out on anything if you decided to skip this filmbr br 38 out of 10 stars
