i have to say that there is one redeeming speck in regards to this film it firmly establishes the bottom of the barrel now filmmakers know what to aim above when making a movie other than that i regret watching this debacle what shameless abandon the making of this film was what a waste of 100000 thats right folks one hundred thousand dollars this film reminds me of that adult video awards show in which of group of industrial prostitutes stand up a praise themselves believing that they are real actors actresses and filmmakers ironic then how ive watched blue movies with better acting directing and writing i also found it funny that the executive producer justin ament just had to be in the movie he plays deputy jake barker im sure his acting career has taken off ted pfiffer the writer has a part he no doubt was wallowing in the clich√©d glory he created it should be noted that carrie finklea has a lead role in the movie you might remember her from gus van sants elephant though im not too sure that shell want to write this film on her resume and im not sure which is a more depressing point money was spent to make this film or people are going to watch it along with torque godsend and sky captain and the world of tomorrow one of the worst films if not the worst film of 2004
