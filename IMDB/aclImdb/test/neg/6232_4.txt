like in so many movies of the past you would think hollywood would learn this by now makes for a very disappointing movie not to mention make sure the kidnapped victim is alive first before paying the ransombr br maybe this film wants to remind of these basic facts in case it should ever happen to one of us why the long walk in the woods and can a city guy really go through the woods without getting lost just an opportunity for some sentimental dialog that was meaningless in the endbr br i had to listen to part of the directors comments in the special features section from the great moves that redford has made in the past sneakers for one surprised he agreed to star in such a film the directors comments and reasons were weakbr br the best parts of this movie was the scenery cant wait for spring to come
