i had never heard of the clearing until i was really bored one day with some friends in the local blockbuster and it grabbed our attention the description on the dvd jacket grabbed our interest but once we popped it into the dvd player the boredom was only beginningbr br the story was dragged out for waaaay too long it seemed to follow the same outline as other movies which include a kidnapping the most suspenseful parts were in the beginning of the movie however after that the outline was followed exactly and that made the clearing unoriginal the flashbacks were too many in number and the grief of the victims family provided nothing interesting nor enhanced the nature of the film and i also found that i did not like the ending so that probably led to me not liking the movie at allbr br the acting was not horribleit wasnt the greatest though robert redford has given much better performances willem dafoes tragic character was the only one i really saw develop throughout the story line and the viewer only really sees that change in the last ten minutes or so in the movie helen mirrens portrayal as robert redfords wife was flat and sort of followed the same generic mold as other movies which include a tragic and heartsplitting eventbr br in my opinion the clearing is nothing to rave about use your movie rental money on something elselike garden state perhaps
