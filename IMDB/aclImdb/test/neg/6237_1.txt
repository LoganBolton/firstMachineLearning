what the hell was the point of this dull movie it looked pretty interesting in the beginning but quickly fell flat on its face its supposed to be based on a true story but for crying out loud is there no more script writers left in hollywood man ive seen these guys in some of the best movies ever madedefoe can play just about anything and when i see hes in a movie i dont have a problem renting it but im starting to wonderredford also a great actor is also slipping perhaps their hard up or just losing their senses the dialog was long and terribly heavy eyedespecially at home with the familyi wonder if the actors thought they had a hit going here perhapsuhan oscar
