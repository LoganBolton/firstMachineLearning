how do two great actors foist off a piece of junk like this on filmgoers my only conclusion is that they and their director believe that any film in which they star just must be seen and applaudedbr br now to the film  probably the worst thriller i have ever seen the actors showed minimal emotion the plot was reasonable for a 12 hour time slot not 91 minutes the fbi agent was almost a silly parody  his partner was apparently struck dumb and spoke not one word to paraphrase robert redford the villain was a meaningless piece of crap the film was drawn out and meaningless  the only question was whether the hero would die or not one truly bizarre part of the story  the waiting family seemed to go on for at least several days the hero and antihero seemed to only take one daybr br all in all  waste of time
