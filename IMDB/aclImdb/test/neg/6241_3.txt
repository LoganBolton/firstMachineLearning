i wanted to like this film and certainly there is room for a psychological characterdriven movie which doesnt go for the cheap thrills yet for the enjoyment of a movie one requires a believable plot some pacing and editing and a feeling of involvement in the clearing what starts out as an intriguing mystery with a kidnapping and unknown motives turns into a slow draggy pointless exercise nothing much really happens and the socalled characterdriven angles as expressed by the director in his commentary really dont add up to muchbr br fine actors are wasted here robert redford does his best trying to engage and outwit willem dafoe dafoe brings a bit of nuance to his character insofar as one can feel somewhat sympathetic towards him its unfortunate that dafoe has been typecast as a villain hes gone into the christopher walken hall of fame of typecastingbr br wendy crewson is usually good but her characters entry into the movie was brief and contrived and i was wondering why they even bothered to introduce her character by far the biggest waste of talent was helen mirren in the directors commentary all i heard was how fabulous a talent she is i agree shes a great actress then why was she not used properly only towards the climax of this movie does she get to show herself but by then the viewer has quit caringbr br too bad i liked parts of this movie but as another reviewer wrote once youre halfway in you know the film is not going to get much better
