now i know why this movie can be bought for so cheap at the video stores i was curious since it had three bigname stars yet was among the b movies that the video apparently cant even give away the answer is it is a film that would attract a very limited audience an over50 crowd with very liberal sensibilitiesbr br who else who watch robert redford willem dafoe and helen mirren give essentially a basic message that cheating on your wife is okay so long as you still love her thats the nice feelgood message here particularly at the end at the end of this strange kidnapping story who wrote this scriptbill clintonbr br i say strange because the kidnapper is the nicest kidnapper dafoe youve ever seen except at the end he unties his hostage redford frequently which no kidnapper would risk has casual conversations about family matters etc its all ludicrous well the la times says its an intelligent thriller ha ha well that confirms what most people know of the la times for those of you who believe that and havent seen it i wont spoil it with more of the gigantic holes in this story particularly at the end the fact is its an insult to anyone with intelligencebr br anyway you cant fool all the people all the time as critics have yet to figure out here is another film they touted that justifiably bombed at the box office and video store
