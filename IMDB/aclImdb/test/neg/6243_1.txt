i hate it when people in the movie theater talk back to the screen its one of the main reasons why i stick to dvds or videos  i saw the clearing on dvd but if i had seen it in the movies i would have had to stand up and scream  hes not dead yet  you moron  br br the clearing is another in a long list of horrible movies that feature mrredford  legal eagles  havana  indecent proposal  up close and personal  sneakers  last castle  and spy game  if robert redford told me to invest in something id go the other way  br br but the worst possible thing you can do to an audience is this  say youre being kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun  hes holding it on you for most of the movie  you turn the tables on him and start strangling him  whatever you do keep strangling him until hes dead  dont just strangle him for ten seconds  stay with it  ten minutes at least  but bob stops too soon  walks away and forgets about mr kidnapper until  he gets up  finds the gun and holds it on our hero again  at this point i wanted mr kidnapper to shoot robert redford  more than a few times  and i wanted to shoot him as well
