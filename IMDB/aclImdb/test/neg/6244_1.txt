after reading many good things about it i finally watched the clearingwith a cast of great actors like redford and dafoe one wouldat least expect a decent filmafter the closing credits had rolled i was still shocked by how bad and incoherent this movie actually wasbr br is it supposed to be an art filmi dont think so cause it is too melodramatic for thatthe bad thing is that the drama seems way too forced and unrealisticbr br the truth is that the script makes absolutely no sensefirst of all it never really explains the motive behind the actions of any of the charactersit just overblows their so called personal issueswhats so bad about redfords characters life that he has to clear itthe fact that he cheatsoccasionallyhis wifethe guy is a millionaire who has had a good lifehas a great son and a great daughtera wife that loves himand a girlfriend that also seems to be way above the generic mistress type of womano and a newborn grandsonthe only problem seems to be that hehas been working hard for all his life to be a successful personso whatit seems that his hard work has really paid off and theres actually no real problems with his lifebr br then we come to dafoes characterheres someone who was a manager for one of redfords companies and was firedwhy is this guy unemployed for eight yearsit seems that he must have some kind of good education to have a job like the one he had in the first place and seems to have been a man with solid ideas about his workas evident by his flashback of a conversation that he had with redford when he was working for himwhy couldnt a man like that get a decent job and have a decent lifecause he was oncefiredtotally unrealisticbr br the film really tries to portray these men as tortured souls or something and that comes off as really cheesyin fact i would say that if the creators of this film were trying to say something about the american dream then they failed miserablybr br as for the actual events that take place during the movie they also make no sense at allin fact the last 20 minutes of the film come off as an insult to the viewers intelligencebecause theres not one thing that takes place that actually makes any senseredford seems to have about a 1000 chances to escape yet he doesntat one moment he is ready to escape and yet he misses his chance cause he feels sorry for his kidnapper and doesnt want to hurt himthen dafoe picks up his gun from the water and the mudwhich should be uselessif you fire a shot with a gun after the gun has been in the water and mud it will possibly blow up in your faceand the gun is in perfect condition the way an unemployed uselessas portrayed in this film and mentally unstable charactermanages to outsmart the entire fbi with such ease brings the narrative of this film to twilight zone levelsthe cheesy endingwith redfords wife illusion comes to finish the viewer offbr br this film pretends to be somethingits notie a qualitysophisticated psychological thrillerunfortunately it fails so hardthat it becomes a disaster and thats the word that describes this film besta disaster
