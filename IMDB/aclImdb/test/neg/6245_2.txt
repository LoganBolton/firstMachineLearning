on my continuing quest to find the worst movie of all time my friends and i stumbled upon this little gem it is hilarious through and through especially if you dont know like we didnt that its a semisequel to another horror seriesbr br i wont bother going into the plot except to mention that everyone complains about the horrible snowstorm that was coming it was equivalent to the characters just screaming foreshadowing at the camera and waving their arms and in some odd twist of fate the snow storm ever occurs budget problems i guessbr br add that to a magical front door that is opened or closed depending on what scare effect the director wants to create and the electricity being cut off until the gym teacher decides to take a shower with lots of soap ill admit it i had trouble breathing at pointsbr br the only actual decent part of this movie as it turns out was from the original slumber party massacre movie its so much funnier now that i know thatbr br spoiler the end where it is revealed that the slasher did it because her drunk friends stumbled in on her and a female friend making out and then the friend driving into a train or something is probably the funniest psycho killer origin ever heightened by the fabulous use of blurring and stock footage im glad all of the slashers friends forgot the incident completely until a flashback was necessary br br run dont walk to pick this up and see the hilarity of course the continuity editor should be given an award for all of this if only they werent stuck in that horrible snow storm
