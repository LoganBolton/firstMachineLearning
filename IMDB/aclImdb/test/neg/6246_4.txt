directed by jim wynorski chopping mall return of the swamp thing cheerleader massacre is the fourth installment in the slumber party massacre series just think about it its the fourth chapter of a slasher series that no one really cares about so how could this even be good well its not but since when did slasher films have to be good cheerleader massacre is entertaining thats for sure but in the entertainment field weve seen better thats for sure too as you can see im not sure about where i stand concerning this movie those who watch slashers only for nudity will be more than satisfied this movies all boobs but unfortunately no blood or not enough i think im being generous with this movie because i had a good time watching it and i really enjoy watching slasher movies even as bad as they sometimes are if you want me to be sincere the slumber party massacre part 1 is the best one and all the others are a waste of time so i guess i have a lot of time to waste for more fun watch sleepaway camp 2 and cheerleader camp
