hmmmmmmm  cheerleader massacre let me think  high school girls get sliced up except the cute one survives got it next moviebr br i was actually surprised this one was made in 2003 i really thought they quit making these movies in the 80s this was truly your run of the mill slasher movie with teenage eye candy dumb male horn dogs even dumber male adult and hot teacher it continues on the list of dark and stormy night and abandoned cabin in the woods we have seen it all beforebr br however this one had a few interesting plot twists that places it above the normal metoo slashers so if you have got a few brain cells to fry and 2 hours to kill  you could do worse
