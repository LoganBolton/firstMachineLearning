before i start i need to inform you that i love horror films with a passion love them i have seen thousands and rarely does one come along that i do not like i am very forgiving of the horror genre one of the greatest lines in movie history is in the film ed wood where ed wood johnny depp freaks out and yells at the overly critical producers after they comment on plan 9s cheap sets and continuity problems you dont know anything havent you ever heard of suspension of disbelief well i try to bring that suspension of disbelief philosophy with me to every horror film i see and it usually works unfortunately it didnt work for me during the screening of cheerleader massacrebr br strike onebr br the first thing youll notice about this film is that it is shot on video and has that crummy handheldhomedigitalcamera style the camera work and quality are so bad it makes daytime soaps look breathtaking in comparison in fact it makes troma and full moon video releases look good and thats badbr br strike twobr br jim wynorski this filmmaker probably fancies himself a chip off the ol corman but nothing could be further from the truth roger corman shot fast furious and under budget but was able to deliver a tight original film though wynorski delivers a cheap film he cheats his viewers and perhaps other artists as he steals entire pieces of james horners humanoids from the deep and battle beyond the stars musical scores and inappropriately drops them into cheerleader massacre on the back of the box art and during the beginning credits the music score is falsely attributed to dan savio an extra in wynorskis deathstalker ii you will also notice how cheerleader massacre jumps from video to film and back again as wynorski lifts entire scenes from both slumber party massacre and humanoids from the deep wynorski utilized this deception fourteen years earlier in his horrible version of not of this earthbr br strike three youre outbr br while cheerleader massacre does have some nudity 40yearolds playing teenagers and the grossest set of fake breasts that i have ever seen in a horror film ugh the murders are relatively bloodless what the heck is that all about the film is titled cheerleader massacre but a handful of offscreen killings in my opinion does not add up to a massacre it doesnt even add up to a bad mosquito bitebr br the films story is fair enough  unseen killer stalks a vanload of cheerleaders old gals playing teens until the van runs out of gas and the girls are forced to hold up in secluded twostory mountain home i wont ruin the ending for you but this is one of those films where the person who is obviously the killer is not obviously the killer cheerleader massacre would have been great if it were shot on film directed by joseph zito and had special effects by tom savini instead it is an effectless shotonvideo travesty by jim wynorski ouchbr br i beg of you please dont buy or rent this abomination if we keep supporting these clowns the more of this talentless video garbage theyll produce go out and rent the prowler the last house on dead end street delirium or the burning instead youll be glad you did
