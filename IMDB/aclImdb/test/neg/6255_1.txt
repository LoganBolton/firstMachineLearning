this movie was just plain bad i can forgive lowbudget films for being low budget but it wasnt funny it wasnt smart it had no redeeming qualities at all unless you really like looking at fake boobs i dont know what this genre is classified as possibly erotic horror but if so well its neither sexy nor scary tying it into the slumber party massacre movies was useless id never seen the previous movies myself and except for one scene that attempted to tie it together i had no way of knowing who the escaped psycho killer in cheerleader was or why they were bothering with including him especially because and i dont think im revealing anything here it was really obvious that the cheerleader killer in this film wasnt him as for the actual murderer all i can say is lame really lame when you find out why the killer is offing the cheerleading squad and the squads coach and two stoners who happened to be on the bus trip theyre taking and the bus driver just for the heck of it apparently you will sit there and go wtf worst excuse for a murdering spree ever the actors two guesses why i added the quotes generally looked like lowbudget porn rejects which they most likely were those poor people trying to break into legitimate film one of my friends had this to say about the actor who played buzzy the bus driver he looks like the guy who you know gets really into it and his face gets all red and stuff we had a good larf at that half of the other actors had all the skill and subtlety of the actors in the sixth grade production of annie i just saw the other half pretty much seemed bored to death especially in the deleted scene this one redhead and by ten minutes into this movie i was toobr br a note the dvd contains one deleted scene which wouldve put the movie from rrated to nc17 if it had been left in it was entirely gratuitous and as adult entertainment goes of no quality whatsoever the only reason to bother with it is to laugh a lot at the badness
