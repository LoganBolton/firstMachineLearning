this movie was one of those movies where it completely fooled me into thinking that it was a cheesy 80s slasher flick based on the cover but it wasnt it was quite possibly one of the worst slasher films that i have ever seen the picture on the cover did not match any part or scene in the movie in fact it didnt involve a chainsaw not even the tag line fit the movie the film is about a group of cheerleaders and two potheads who escape to a desolate cabin in the cold woods for a weekend getaway however things get extra chilly when they start to get murdered by an unknown killer at the same time the local sheriffs department is hunting down a dangerous killer ill name the problems in a listbr br 1 the acting boy was it cheap and horribly bad it felt unnatural and it seemed as thought it was very scripted none of the actors seemed as though they tried to perform with good intentions and therefore they seemed silly and tired there was bad acting by all the characters in the movie so i wont point out specific people but i wills say that the stoners did a horrible job as well as the police and the cheerleaders which is not a surprisebr br 2 the plot this story had set up a perfect storyline for good ol fashion slasher flick but instead they peppered it with plotholes useless and unnecessary scenes and an overall stupid backstory to the killers intentions there were major plotholes including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and yet still be there in the group of girls when it happened the excon virtually served no purpose in the movie aside from being a useless plot device there was random and unnecessary sex and nudity sprinkled throughout it even for a bmovie or my taste it was a bit too much as for the killers intentions lets just say it was stupid and it makes no sense as to why she  he is killing young girls plus there was also some very predictable kills that i saw coming about 30 miles awaybr br 3 the technical side the lighting was okay it certainly wasnt the worse lighting that ive seen in a movie but there were points where it was supposed to be dark but it looked more like the afternoon the house seemed darker with the lights on then with the lights off the camera work was average it didnt have any good establishing shots or amazing pans or zooms thought it did get the job done is building some suspense with its framingbr br overall this movie in the sense of plot character development and performance was a huge disappointment and a waste of my time what i thought would have been a great slasher flick turned out to be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen the acting was really bad and wooden there was hardly any sense in the plot and there was no emotion to this film however the technical aspect of this film saved it for me because if the camera work or the lighting was bad then i would have turned off the dvd player and popped in something else i would recommend this movie to those who enjoy really cheesy bmovies as well as those who follow cult classics because this movie certainly is i would partially recommend this film for those who enjoy 80s slasher flicks but for me this movie was pitiful and utterly horrible
