when i was 8 years old and going through my marx brothers phase my father read in the tv guide that they were showing the marx brothers film the big store late on friday night and set the vcr to tape it for me when i woke up on saturday  due no doubt to a misprint in the tv guide  my father and i discovered the story of mankind had been recorded insteadbr br the big store was probably one of the least funny of all the marx brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the centurys finest works of cinema when compared with the story of mankind i can almost justify tv guides error in that the marx brothers  groucho chico and harpo  appear in both movies although in the story of mankind they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes groucho plays peter minuit chico plays some guy talking to christopher columbus and harpo plays isaac newton harpos scene lasts about half a minute chico only has two or three lines grouchos scene is at least funny but horribly racially insensitive by todays standards the rest of the movie doesnt bear mentioning they trotted out some of the finest actors of the day and made them recite total garbage what a disappointmentbr br tv guide i sent you a nice letter im still waiting for an apologybr br for the record the big store has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the marx brothers on roller skates and a couple of songs by virginia obrien i was really looking forward to seeing it
