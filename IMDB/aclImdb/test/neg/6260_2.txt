hard to get indepth with this kind of stuff since there is absolutely no existing shred of even partial reason for watching it let alone expressing an opinion on it i dont know anything about this  watched it for a laugh and stayed for the fake breasts apparently its an unofficial sequel to 1982s slumber party massacre which i did enjoy as a fun slasher cheerleader massacre looks like a latenite softcore cinemax porno and not surprisingly chicks like nikki fritz and samantha phillips prolific ta actresses are in this plenty of nekkid hooters and not much else a group of 20something high school cheerleaders two random guys and the fat stupid comicrelief slob become stranded in the country and find a house where they plan to stay the night the recently escaped slumber party killer is in the area and begins killing them off theres no gore or originality and i wouldnt say the nudity is a real selling point since this is just about as boring a slasher movie can be absolutely terrible
