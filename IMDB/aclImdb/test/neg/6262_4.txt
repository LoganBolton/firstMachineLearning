ive never expected too much from a film by trashy bmovie director jim wynorski a silly premise some cheapo effects and a bit of nudity from some busty babes and im usually fairly happybr br well cheerleader massacre delivers on the former and definitely the latter but unfortunately is a tad light when it comes to the splatter and when a film has the word massacre in the title and scrimps on the gore then houston we have a problembr br wynorskis movie centres on a group of cheerleaders who along with their teacher minibus driver and a couple of guys become stranded in the mountains during a snowstorm they make their way on foot to a deserted mountain retreat where they find food and shelter and a crazy killer who wants them all dead from the outset good old jim ensures that his film features plenty of scenes loaded with ta and includes the obligatory shower scene along with numerous other moments in which tasty women get nekkid including a spot of raunchy softcore sex and a very gratuitous threebabesinahottub scene none of the women look young enough to be cheerleaders and are never even seen in their outfits but who cares about such details when theyre all too willing to strip off in the name of artbr br i do care however about the movies numerous lacklustre deaths with such an extremely lurid title i had been hoping for some inventive bloodletting to go with all of the bums bush and boobs instead practically all of the killings occur offscreen or feature next to no gore only a silly postdecapitation scene achieved with cheapaschips cgi comes anywhere near to delivering the goodsbr br still if youre feeling in the mood for some titillation or a bit of slasher silliness minus the grue then at 82 minutes at least cheerleader massacre wont be too much of a waste of your time
