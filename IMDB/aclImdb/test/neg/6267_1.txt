i normally finish every movie or book i start even if theyre poor just cause i hate giving up on them this was so poorly made i was in disbeliefbr br im not just looking for spielberg magic  i rent foreign films and i rent really old scifis most recently soylent green  worth the rent i like both hollywood action and slower moving character development different films need to be approached differently to be appreciated i could find no redeeming element to this one the action was so wooden i wasnt the least bit on edge the character development was virtually absent  youre not left feeling sorry for anyone or even identifying with them finally there were so many pieces that just didnt add upbr br dont waste your time  better to watch paint dry
