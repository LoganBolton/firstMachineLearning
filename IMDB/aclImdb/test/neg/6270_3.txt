why does c thomas howell do these movies cruise howells one time costar does a huge blockbuster of wotw and howell follows with this lame effortbr br where do i start here production values  ill start with the good stuff the look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest the setups are okay in spots and the direction not too badbr br script  terrible a series of clunky scenes that could have been put in any order you like permeate throughout the movie the amount of times the scene faded to black and reemerged a second later in the same room was uncountable very poor storyline but so was the cruise wotw takes some blame but an abysmal screenplay kills it offbr br special fx  okay i dont want to be too harsh here as i imagine the budget was smaller than cruises lunch bill  but in the overall context of the film the effects are badly done some shots are quite impressive  mainly far off destruction shots of bridges washington liner but in the main the alien machines and tentacles themselves are dreadful also the camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on othersbr br acting  im a fan of howell but as he has reduced himself to acting in these lowbudget flicks  he has succumbed to the overacting bug a long time ago look at his performance in the hitcher and compare it to this movie there is no comparison he overdoes his facial expressions his flailing arms and legs where did he get that running style and for a final coupdegras look at the scene where he loses the photo of his family hysterical but after saying all that  he is still the best actor on show here busey is embarrassing to look at and peter green zed is truly dead now baby mumbles incoherently through his one and only scene i honestly could not understand one word he said  i even went so far as trying to enable the subtitles on that scene  but the dvd did not have subtitles this seems to be a real keepitinthefamily affair too as howells son the directors wife and the line producer all make it into the film none of them are goodbr br direction  not bad but not good eitherbr br score  dismalbr br overall a lame duck effort that will do nothing for howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time he should take a look at rourke and try to figure out how he made in back to the a list but if he keeps doing stuff like this he wont have a career soon enoughbr br 310
