my paraphrase above of the slogan on the back of the dvd box sums it up this film was far more horrible than horrifyingbr br this is the worst film i have seen in as long as i can remember my wife accidentally rented it thinking it was the tom cruise version the laughably crude special effects on the menu screen should have tipped us off the gratuitous nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspiciousbr br but as the film wore on we were benumbed by clumsy acting  both over and underacting  noncontinuity in directing and editing trite writing and crude special effects we gave up after a halfhour or less after starting this badly it couldnt possibly get betterbr br since i despise reviews that pan a product without giving specifics here are some examples of the films especially awkward moments even if they amount to spoilersbr br  the lead says goodbye to his young old son as the latter is about to drive away with his mother the latter prickly because its their wedding anniversary but the lead is not coming along due to sudden business the son asks quietly worried will i ever see you again perhaps its supposed to come off as a premonition but it instead comes off as incongruous behavior for a child that age in that situationbr br  a huge alien spacecraft has crashed to earth and sits in an enormous crater a crowd of people stands nearby peering at it uneasily but otherwise looking generally unaroused one woman finally says its ginormousbr br  after this craft has laid waste a village and its inhabitants the lead and a bystander now alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape have an exchange something like this in a quietly puzzled tonebr br what was that thing anyway i dunnobr br  a crowd attempting to evacuate over a bridge is blocked by the military since part of the bridge is destroyed when an alien ship shoots an explosive at it the crowd starts to run away seemingly only because a director told them to and not because theyre frightened or in any kind of real danger let alone unusual circumstancesbr br and so forth writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it but please please save yourself the bother even if your morbid curiosity is piqued the film is so bad it cant even be enjoyed as unintentional humor versus say king vidors solomon  sheeba starring yul brynner wearing a wig life is too short to waste watching such nonsense there must be something more productive and enjoyable to do like walking the dog or cleaning a birdcage
