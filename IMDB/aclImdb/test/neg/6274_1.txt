this movie is so bad they should burn the master you cant spoil the plot because this movie doesnt have one the graphics are less than fake theyre horrendous then youve got the rambling through the countryside star gazer workaholic who bounces between his own lunacy  the mad rantings of the crazed preacher  when he finally makes it to dc they dont even have the decency to kill him the monster which you dont know at the time is already dieing but how  who knows  of course it has the ultimate sappy ending everybody else on the planet is dead or dieing but his family  a handful of stragglers survive imagine that this will be the movie that c thomas howell will go to his grave regretting he ever starred in it probably gives him nightmares
