this movie looked like the outtakes of the deleted scenes from a high school film class experiment it made no sense it was well acted but i only felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this slop the alien machines were created with pentium i technology and no creativity they were crabs the underlit and barely seen aliens were frisbees with legs where were the tripods the editing done by directorwriterproducermakeup artistgripper latt jumps all over the place with some scenes repeated numerous times most of it seemed to have been filmed in the wake of hurricane katrina the next time latt wants to make a movie someone needs to slap him in 2005 alone he produced 11 movies that doesnt include the writing editing directing or visual effects credits on other movies if the rest are like this snotload then hes just making fun of us this was a slapped together ripoff of spielbergs movie nothing more im looking forward to latts backbroke ridge xman iiv the hillocks have eyes
