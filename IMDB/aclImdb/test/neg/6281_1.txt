i felt like i was watching an example of how not to make a movie i think the director filmed it in his back yard there was no real plot br br terrible scriptbr br terrible actingbr br the worst production i have ever witnessed a couple of bad cg effects and then the rest of the movies was spent walking around in what looked like a junk yardbr br i dont normally write reviews to movies but was moved to warn everyone about this onebr br life is to short to waste your time with this movie
