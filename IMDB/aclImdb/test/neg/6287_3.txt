poor old robert taylor other than the feds nothing much has gone his way  this almostshocker is a wasteful ninety minutes and not much more its one of those cheesy detectivecrime flicks with the narrative of the lead character the whole way through  usually thats reserved for comedies these days but this film takes itself way too seriously a pity australian films particularly in the 200001 periods have been of exceptional quality overall  but i suppose there have got to be a few misses why even make a film like this that obviously isnt going to be any good
