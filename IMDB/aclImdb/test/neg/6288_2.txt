the funniest thing about fortunes is that one of the main characters lewis urbaniak has writers block and apparently so did the screenplay writer for the film this is sad as well as i guess by large this is supposed to be a comedy or dramedy but thats the funniest thing i can remember from watching thisbr br three friends go out and drink one night on the way home two decide to get their fortunes told by a gypsy as they call her those two lives fall apart while the third friend stands by then nothing happensbr br i hope i didnt spoil the movie there but really this extremely lowbudget bad quality movie had some kind of idea when it started but quickly snowballed into the depths of hell yeah im being harsh honestly it wasnt that bad it was just blahbr br the aforementioned writer was annoying to watch though he delivered maybe one or two of the only two funny lines the clich√©d ladies man the only one that didnt get his fortune told was just annoying the only bright spot was the remaining friend the married dad whose fortune was told that something big was to happen to his son and he needed to be prepared he was funny genuine and clearly the best actor in the movie unfortunately thats not saying muchbr br perhaps im being too cruel heck they got the ambition to make a movie went and got funding and accomplished something unfortunately however i cant at all recommend the film on the basis theres hundreds of thousands of other independent movies that have hundreds of thousands better ideas and executions this one was literally 10 minutes of an idea stretched another 81 boring minutes
