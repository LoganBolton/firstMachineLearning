i saw this in the cinema during its initial release and can only ask has the world gone mad the seemingly overwhelming positive response is mind boggling for this poorly written embarrasingly predictable clap trapbr br stephan elliot is no genius film maker as evidenced by the consistent bombs he has produced since check out welcome to woop woop eye of the beholderbr br i can only assume making a film dealing with the gaytransexual culture has people assuming that to dislike the film is an offense to this sector of the populace arent we smarter than that what about an interesting script and good performances ok so the 3 leads do alright considering what they have to work with but this film includes the worst performance by a child actor i have ever seen not helped by appalling dialogue and a really lame resolution that you can see a mile offbr br this is a disappointing film and one that doesnt deserve the overblown reputation it has garnered
