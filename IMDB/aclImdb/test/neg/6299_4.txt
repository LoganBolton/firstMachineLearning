this film tries hard but fails perhaps to nonaustralian audiences it may have appeal as a travelogue but to the native it is merely tediousbr br anyone who lives here knows broken hill is a rough tough isolated mining town if a couple of citified fruits turn up in drag well its all so predictable where have i come across that wellworn theme before oh yes  town mouse and country mouse spare usbr br i kept hoping it would improve but after the broken hill scene i could see where this was heading and so turned off the tv and went to bed
