i have seen previous movies from cédric klapisch and therefore expected a quality movie with psychological depth having been an erasmus student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad i know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time yes it is great fun because of that i thought i should not miss this movie unfortunately i was disappointed to find that lauberge espagnol fails to satisfy in many ways the characters are stereotyped the events are trite and the story is shallow although there are quite a few familiar situations they are irritatingly cliché and do not go beyond the trivial events this made the movie uninteresting to watch and gave me a strong beentheredonethatdontyouhaveanythingtoadd feeling apart from that the movie lacks a firm story it sometimes looks more like a documentary or reallife show than a seriously made moviebr br however i can imagine that if you havent studied or travelled abroad this might be fun to watch
