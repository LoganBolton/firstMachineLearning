the costumes are outrageous and the australian outback scenery is fun to view but there is an edge to this story  a mean edge  about drag queens i particularly noticed that in terrence stamps character ralph bernadette bassenger perhaps that was appropriate since there is nothing goodguy like about ralphbernadette and his group of queens br br once again we get the strong liberal slant which says anything goes and if youre not with it  or in this case prohomosexual then you are a homophobe gaspbr br whats really disturbing is the ending when a young boy goes off with his alternativelifestyle father and embraces his gay lifestyle not because it fit the story but because it fit the agenda of the people who wrote the script pitiful
