this is one of those inoffensive and mildly entertaining little movies that strive to make you to like them more but like so many others its material isnt strong enough to successfully fill a couple of hoursbr br the pitch is promising three drag queens drive a bus through the outback from sydney to alice springs they run into lots of trouble  with homophobic locals with the engine with their pastsbr br the real trouble is with the dialogue the leads are fine though pearces continual campness becomes tiresome but the oneliners and epithets feel forced where they should be casually thrown away characters shouldnt laugh at their own gagsbr br writerdirector elliott also feels the need to pile on the pleasingly incongruous shots of flamboyant drag costumes against stark desert backgrounds like so much cheap makeup for a movie about selfconfidence and just being yourself it all seems very insecure with itself
