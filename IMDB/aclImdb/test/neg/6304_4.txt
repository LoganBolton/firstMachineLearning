i like all of the main actors involved in this quite bizarre film terrance stamp guy pearce  hugo weaving have all proved themselves as some of the best  most capable actors around but i could not get into this i dont know if its because i dont understand the lifestyle or what but i could not get my head around this film worse than anything is that the actors made some of the ugliest drag queens ive ever seen i think that was part of the point i dont know i realize that is probably an insult but i dont know what else to call them i must say i bought the guys as the performers the correct term but the story just wasnt very good or very interesting either i will say that i cant usually appreciate costume designers very well although i notice them when they are wrong or out of place but i was very much impressed with these very creative to say the least just not attractive but i dont think theyre supposed to be i dont know i am definitely not the target audience and would never go see a performance done by these kind of performers but i wouldnt go see ballet or opera either so i dont know if this is your kind of film then you will probably like it but if its not skip it because it iswell not for most of us i just checked it won the oscar for costume design  i will say rightfully so i must say ebert didnt care much for this film either though he liked it better than i did
