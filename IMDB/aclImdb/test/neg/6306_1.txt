great balls of fire is the movie you show to someone you really really hate it is absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by minions of a foreign power to extract info from captured intelligence agents ive enjoyed some of dennis quaids performances in the past but he goes totally over the top in this film he doesnt so much cross the line he pole vaults over it then comes back to jump over and over again he struts and mugs as if on some incredibly bad acid trip its one of those rare performances where you wish you could enter the film and beat the man within an inch of his life for doing something so truly awful was he desperate to win a golden raspberry or some other award for bad acting thats the only conclusion i can come up with thank you dennis you gave us a bad performance for the ages where was the director to reign in this guybr br the opposite end of the extreme is winona ryder she of the plastic features and plastic acting i came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax dummy that was of course an insult to wax dummies all over the earth all of whom could have brough more humanity to the role of jerrys underage cousinwife this brings up the films mixed up message that being it is 100 okay to marry your own cousin and have a child by the union i fail to see what is so okay about that but it looks as though hollywood thinks that underage incest is hunky dory talk about family valuesbr br another problem is the format is it a stright forward re telling of lewis life or is it a musical im not talking about the music im talking about the truly weird scene where jerry drives up to the school starts to belt out a tune and everyone starts to dance like it was broadway musical in search of a tony fantasy and reality are thrown together in a mix that does not work but who really cares i dont and neither should you you cant get back the minutes of life you would waste on this film so dont waste your time its too precious for something this misguided and poor
