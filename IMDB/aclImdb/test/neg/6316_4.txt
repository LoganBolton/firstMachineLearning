being a huge street fighter fan and thoroughly enjoying the previous film street fighter ii the animated movie i was really looking forward to this onebr br however it seemed that the film had no real sense of direction or purpose most of the characters i could not associate with and it just lacked the intense action that made the other mentioned street fighter film so superiorbr br there are some good points however the animation is superb
