not being a particular fan of westerns i watched this primarily because i wanted to see lucille ball in something other than an i love lucy or lucy show type of role here she plays christine larson owner of a saloon in the arizona territory in 1868 whos about to be married to the unscrupulous local indian agent dean jagger balls performance was ok  nothing really more than that she didnt blow me away it succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what im accustomed to seeing her in  there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout a typical funny line  theres two ways to deal with women  and no one knows either one of them i didnt find the story all that compelling although i appreciated that the indians were shown as the victims of the indian agent theres typical shootout action and a lot of horses  your typical western in other words as to christine  we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up its just a question of how shes going to get there if you like westerns this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in if youre not big on the genre this will be lacking im not big on the genre 310
