in the opening sequence of wheres poppa george segal rises from his bed one morning shaves showers puts on a gorilla suit and goes into his mothers bedroom we realize later to give her a massive heart attack that will kill her and get her out of his life forever this is about the level of humor one can expect from most of this picture insanity blended with what might be taken as morbid daringbr br segal plays a new york attorney who lives with his supposedly senile mother ruth gordon whose life is further complicated when while hiring a nurse to care for the old bag meets the girl of his dreams the pleasantly prim trish van devere decked out like florence nightingale his dilemma how to integrate the lovely nurse into his and his pesky mothers lifebr br segals performance is about the only thing holding the picture together his frustrations his reactions his comic timing is almost peerless whatever happened to that guy where the film fails is in other areas ruth gordons characterization is dreadful as the mother at the beginning you cant figure out if her character is senile or just being deliberately vague to keep her son from moving out by the end its clear shes just nuts when segal brings van devere home to meet her gordons eyebrows furrow and she gets a mean sinister look she wants the intruder in her sons life removed shes calculating this is not the mode of a senile person youre not getting a consistent performance throughout the picture which is probably the directors carl reiner fault as much as gordons ruth gordons old lady in rosemary baby is much more successful because with the kind of ingratiating cloying person that ruth gordon generally plays the audience responds to her as annoying but when mia farrow is too timid to fight back gordon becomes more cloying her fangs dig deeper and deeper and were frightened for farrow this kind of imposition is genuinely terrifying here were being asked to laugh at what wed normally find annoying and if gordon played it as helplessly nutty all the way we might but shes selfish and mean as well and it dampens what little humor there isbr br there are a few good laughs though a courtroom scene with barnard hughes as a military officer and rob reiner as a counterculture punk is fairly hilarious and vincent gardenia does a nice turn as a lombardiesque football coach theres also an inspired bit where segals brother ron liebman having been stripped naked by muggers on his way to segals place asks him for something for to wear home and he gives him the gorilla suitbr br but of a lot of the script is poorly conceived and simply doesnt make sense why is a new york lawyer with his own practice even living at home in the first place why does segal if his mother is senile try to reason with her logically if you spoil this for me ill punch your fing heart out why does liebman keep cutting through the park if he knows hes going to get mugged why does he take a taxi after leaving segals with gorilla suit why wasnt he taking taxis all along a funnier bit would have been liebman as the gorilla terrorizing the muggers why does van devere keep coming back after her first husband was a kook why does she want to get involved with this bunch i suppose if i put this to carl reiner hed say these are crazy people they dont have to make sense which is a convenient way to excuse a lousy script thats full of holes the characters momenttomoment behavior may not have to make sense but their motivations do and thats where wheres poppa falls apart the situations are created just to have the gag and the gags are mostly oneshots they dont build to anythingbr br carl reiner is the most guilty in this whole fiasco how he has acquired this vaunted reputation as a pillar of comedy puzzles me basically his career has been to hold a microphone in front of sid caesar and mel brooks while they talk in funny voices his son rob has ten times the skill and intelligence as a director in showbiz terms reiner pushes buttons a monkey could do his job and that is most apparent in his framing of the action why is all of new york shot in tight and in closeups but the scenes in the country are all distant and panoramic thats the mentality of carl reiners direction claustrophobic for the city spatial for the country in the final lunatic scene at the old folks home the camera is so far off you cant even make out whats going on the abrupt ending suggests a resolution that segal could have easily arrived at ninety minutes ago it also suggests reiner couldnt figure out how to end the picture so he just cut it as another example of craziness reiner seems to think dumbness equals craziness and craziness without logic is always funny it isnt and the creators of wheres poppa are as demented as ruth gordon putting pepsi in her fruit loops
