i was prepared to love wheres poppa it features the nexus of normal lear sitcom character actors who when i was growing up felt like extended members of my raisenettesized broken nuclear family how fun it would be to see censorfree barnard hughes vincent gardenia ron liebman rob reiner and a presnl garret morrisbr br but alaswheres poppa drags its claustrophobic and plodding and breaks the cardinal rules of farce lightness of mood and a fast pacebr br the plot involves the efforts of a lawyer george segal to rid himself of his overbearing jewish mother who lives in his gigantic new york apartment along the way we are exposed ridiculous characters and situations a comedic group of muggers who repeatedly mug the brother of the main character the rape of a policeman which involving a gorilla suit and subsequent gay love ruth gorden pulling down segals pants and biting his ass as he serves her dinner why doesnt this work part of the explanation is the sense of doom engendered by the cramped dark interiors and antique setdecoration i absolutely eat up cinematography of new york during this era but watching this movie felt like i was leafing through the police gazette in a dark bus terminalbr br the main reason though is the slow pace modern mtvstyle quick cuts have changed what moviegoers feel is a comfortable editing tempo but even taking this into consideration camera shots are held for an excessively long time plot developments are also very slow there is one situation in which this works a weird love song george segal sings to trish van devere softly very close to her face and for an excruciatingly long period of time it reminded me of those cringeworthy extended shots in the british version of the office where you find yourself mentally begging the camera to cut away and at the same time you cant stop lookingbr br sadly most of the film is more hurry up than cant look away which made me wonder if its possible to have a black comedy that is also a farce the dilemma is that the gravitas of the subject matter in a black comedy tends to weigh down lightness of the farce movies like robert altmans mash and kubricks dr strangelove prove that it can be accomplished they do this not only through speed but also through entertaining subplots something wheres poppa neglectsbr br although the film features multiple stereotypicallyfunny characters almost all of them are directly involved in the central drama of how to deal with the recalcitrant mother the scenes featuring garret morris and the central park muggers are as close as the viewer gets to a mental break the muggers seemed almost shakespearean following the tradition of comic neerd0wells if the rest of wheres poppa had clung a little more closely to stage tradition it would have been a better film edgier isnt always better its as if all these talented actors and the director carl reiner were taking a short before the creative maelstrom of the 70s br br random notes after strealing ron liebmans clothes the muggers mention cornel wildes the naked prey 1966 a great action movie that was a stylistic precursor to 1968s planet of the apesbr br as politically incorrect as he was its disquieting to learn about the death of an action hero as formidable as charleton heston linda harrison who played nova taylors mute mate said that james fransicus in the sequel seemed to be cute and tiny compared to heston
