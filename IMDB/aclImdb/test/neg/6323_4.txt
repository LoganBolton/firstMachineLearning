george segal lives with his elderly and senile mother there are many jokes about her alzheimerslike dementia and most of them arent funny though there were a few funny moments sprinkled in here and there such as the nude running through the park scene and the old folks home at first segal tries to kill his mother because shes tough to live with and because hes a selfish guy making the film sort of like a wiley coyote versus the roadrunner comedy where he tries again and again to kill this indestructible gal would have been a hoottoo bad this was not the overall tone of the filmbr br i do applaud carl reiners attempt to make a tasteless film that is intended to offend everyone i have a special place in my heart for films like ed and his dead mother eating raoul and happiness of the katakurisall films about death that dare to offend the problem here though is that wheres poppa has some funny moments but it also has a lot of flat ones and the overall product is amazingly bland plus topics such as homosexual rape incest and the like are really difficult to make funny i read in the rough guide to cult movies that it is considered a cult film though i just cant see anyone wanting to see this more than once
