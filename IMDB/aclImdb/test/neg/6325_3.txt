if you read the plot summary for mad max youve just ruined the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the film youve also found out that mad max takes place in postapocalyptic australia which will be helpful because otherwise you wont have any idea whats going on the film made in 1979 tries really hard to be stanley kubricks a clockwork orange 1971 only that film in all its strangeness actually makes sense and leaves an impact this film does neither and ends up being a carbike stuntfilled romp that crashes like every vehicle in the film doesbr br the first thing wrong with mad max is that it tries to sell itself as a revenge tale when no vigilante appears to take revenge until the final 20 minutes if the first hour were condensed to 2030 minutes and then the final 20 added on and then another hour added after that mad max would be a cool action film with a great vigilante protagonist instead mel gibson has to wait around and act like a sissy for 23 of the film and then have a sudden epiphany to seek revenge ive yet to watch the sequel road warrior and i have to admit im excited for it only because i want to know what he does next this first film was mostly a waste of timebr br george miller does some great action stuff here but his overthetop symbolism is absurd and the unbearable cheesy reaction sequences every time a character discovers something horrifying like a burnt hand or what have you completely ruins those moments its a terribly clich√© bmovie techniquebr br there is absolutely no thematic value or subtle critique of society in this film no matter what you might think a great action scifi movie at least makes a point but the gratuitous violence done by random weird bikers doesnt say anything of value even the villain toecutter feels modeled off alex of clockwork only uglier and completely unimposing the pg violence just does not allow the violence of this gang to settle in and get a reaction from the viewer it just cheeses it up if anythingbr br ill give credit for the amount of stuff the film crew blew up and crashed into things and miller does a great job making you feel the intensity of the collisions everything else is mediocre at best and then after an hour of mediocrity you get something good and the film ends 20 minutes later im just crossing my fingers road warrior will fulfill the expectations of where this film ends otherwise thats more time wasted steven cbr br visit my site at httpmoviemusereviewsblogspotcom
