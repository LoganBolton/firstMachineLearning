i just have to comment on this movie because i gave it a 4 rating and in my opinion thats pretty high for a softporn smut movie the actual plot is kind of hokey who would expect otherwise but hafron is so incredibly funny and he delivers everything in a cyborgish voice so its easy for him whoever wrote the script had some wit definitely i must have laughed out loud ten times and thats not a reason anyone would pick up this movie the only softporn movie ive seen which had any merit other than beautiful women and believe me emmanuelle is drop dead gorgeousjust look at the coverbr br any movie that can entertain me considering how poor the plot was and how bad the acting is also considering the movie wasnt made to artistically entertain so to speak it gets at least a four in my book i mean who wouldnt watch this before stop or my mom will shoot
