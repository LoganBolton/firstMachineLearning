i caught this movie on latenight tv honestly i saw most of it and the whole time i was sitting in complete and utter disbeliefbr br is there any genre thats more pointless than softcore porn if there is i dont want to know about it softcore porn combines all the horrors of porn lousy production values abominable acting crappy scripts with the coyness of sexscenes in regular movies so the end result is arousing nor entertaining this movie also has the rather odd approach of a sciencefiction setting and it works horribly all the sex is performed in some sort of virtual reality setting where the crew from the future learn about physical love and yes its about as confused and silly as it soundsbr br but there has to be some positive points though right well there is one krista allen is amazingly hot thats about the only thing that was less than awful in this movie i dont know what it is about her but she has an amazing sex appeal the rest of the cast look like the standard porncast though rather unattractive women with poorly done fake breasts and men that have spent far too much time in the gym toning themselves grotesque probably a gym in germany as well judging by haircuts and clothingbr br to sum things up if you enjoy krista allens presence on screen you can watch this for the brief moments where she shows some of her seductive potential most of the time she tries to articulate crappy lines of dialog though if you dont enjoy krista allen then you might as well stay away altogetherbr br i rate this 1010 for krista allens sex appeal 110 for everything else and 210 for entertainment value since this is a unique crappy pornscience fiction hybrid thats not really like anything ive ever seen
