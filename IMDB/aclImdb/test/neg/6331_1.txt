la ragazza del vagone letto or terror express as it was called on the version i saw starts as various passengers board a long distance train three thuggish idiots dave phil  ernie carlo de mejo board  its clear that theyre there to cause trouble as they intimidate  verbally abuse the other passengers  staff as the train speeds along things turn nasty when a prostitute named juliette silvia dionisio refuses to have sex with dave he  his mates decide to hold the entire train hostage so they can have an orgy with juliette  well not much else actually happens apart from some hero cop  his prisoner who set about saving the day erm thats it reallybr br this italian production was directed by ferdinando baldi  is complete total  utter crap from start to finish the script by george eastman as luigi montefiori could just as easily be described as a really boring porno as much as a horrorthriller it is tediously slow its 35 minutes before anything even remotely sleazy happens  as a whole the film lacks the sort of exploitation elements that italian sleaze  horror was delivering at that time the film can be compared to another italian production the infinitely better the house on the edge of the park 1980 made the same year its a very broad comparison though as everything that made the house on the edge of the park the notorious film that it is is absent from la ragazza del vagone letto theres no blood no gore almost no violence theres only a couple of really tame rapes the story has no twists or turns  as its incredibly boring to watch italian sleaze  horror from the late 70s  early 80s isnt known for its strong story lines or great scripts but this films really does scrape the bottomofthebarrel on all counts the characters are awful the film spends the first 30 plus minutes building them up  giving some background as to why theyre on the train but this is all quickly forgotten  comes to absolutely nothing i hated the lame ending as well  i dont know if i missed something but was any sort of reasonable explanation given as to why these three lamebrains would hijack a train i dont think there was was there im sorry but because your angry at a prostitute is not enough of a reason surely the filmmakers could have come up with something a bit more substantial  interesting if not more plausible in my opinion this film stinks its as simple  straight forward as that im afraidbr br director baldi does an ok job to be fair he only has one corridor  a few train compartments to work with so ill cut him some slack having said that the film does become very repetitive there is no style  he films the sex scenes like a bad soft core porno complete with awful romantic sounding piano music there is not one single drop of blood spilt in the entire film thats right not one single drop forget about any gore or violence as youll be very disappointed if you do like i did there are a couple of rapes but theyre amateurishly staged  have zero impact the nasty exploitation  sleaze of say i spit on your grave 1978 or the last house on the left 1972 is not herebr br technically la ragazza del vagone letto is ok  its quite well made on what must have been a low budget but the setting obviously helped keep the cost down to a minimum the acting is poor as usual although since it was dubbed the original performances have been lost fans of italian horror will recognise a lot of the voices herebr br la ragazza del vagone letto is a terrible film its just my opinion but i was bored to tears waiting for something to happen  when it eventually never i felt cheated i want those 80 minutes of my life back this piece of crap isnt even fit to grace the 99p vhs bargain bin in your local blockbuster one to avoid
