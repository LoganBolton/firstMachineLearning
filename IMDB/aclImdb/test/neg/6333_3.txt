the unpleasant home invasion genre can be traced back to wes cravens early sleazefest last house on the left with such nasty offshoots as i spit on your grave wrong way and the visitors soon following in the footsteps of that film here in this early 80s italian offering the same plot is regurgitated once more with the twist being that this one is set on a continental train la ragazza del vagone letto  known in englishspeaking countries as terror express  starts out surprisingly well but about twenty minutes in it takes a turn for the worse as the sex scenes start to gain precedence over the more serious action and suspensebr br david phil and ernie three rich youths who wallow in terrorising and humiliating others board a transcontinental express in italy the train is full of other passengers among them prostitute juliette silvia dionisio who rides the train frequently and has struck up a deal with one of the porters to act as a kind of pimp persuading the male passengers to part with their cash for a night of passion in her sleeping compartment the three cretins quickly set about upsetting the passengers with their aggressive drunken behaviour but matters get more serious when they seize control of an entire car on the express and barricade themselves in from the rest of the train pretty soon they are revelling in their temporary control a young wife zora kerova is raped by two of the youths in a cramped compartment juliette herself is subjected to a prolonged sexual assault and later the odious trio force the male passengers to role a dice in order to decide which one will rape a 16 year old virgin travelling with her parents a concept made doubly tasteless by the fact that her father is one of the men forced to play the game the only passenger who seems prepared to fight back is a convict who is being escorted to germany but what hope does one man have against three armed thugs br br la ragazza del vagone letto gets off to a decent start various intriguing characters are introduced and the three hoodlums are shown to have a genuinely unsettling influence over the travellers though the story is clearly the stuff of exploitation the opening scenes are built up carefully and the film seems to be rising above the usual gutterlevel of its genre things fall apart during a horrid scene in which kerova is sexsandwiched in a toilet compartment by two of the thugs the scene is gloatingly filmed and the effect does not seem to be to generate sympathy for the victim or hatred towards the perpetrators instead we are being asked to feel turned on this is sensationalism at its worst further humiliating rapes follow but the rape sequences involve too much lingering camera work over acts of oral sex and the female genitalia one sequence featuring the 16 year old girl teeters on the brink of hard core and feels particularly wrong by the end of la ragazza del vagone letto it is easy to forget that it was intended as a thriller for the final hour of the film is dedicated to pornography rather than suspense lovers of sleaze will revel in it others might want to look elsewhere
