another sadistic and ultrasleazy late 70searly 80s revenge movie wes craven sure launched a popular trend with his last house on the left although terror express is more like a ripoff of other ripoffs like i spit on your grave and especially night train murders storywise this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director ferdinando baldi was to multiply the sleazefactor by a thousand this is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little bit rough near the ending on the night train from rome are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok they provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who keeps being screwed around by the three this is a very tame movie and there wasnt even enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood this type of movies is generally infamous for the brutal rape sequences and the discriminating behavior towards women but the sex in terror express isnt unsettling at all on the contrary these rapists spend more time orally pleasuring their victims then getting some themselves the music is great the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones i ever beheld the villains are wimps and the trainpassengers are so motionless they look like part of the set if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets this is your film however your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be stilled terror express should be in the pornsection of videostores
