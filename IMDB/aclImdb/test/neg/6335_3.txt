yet another cookiecutter movie about a hardened adult who meets an adorable streetsmart kid cop and 12 gloria etc and once again it is not funny or interesting for anyone to watch  kids or adults im sure some people might find this movie amusing but i have no earthly idea why once again i feel sorry for the poor kids who were forced to work in this movie so that everyone else and their parents could make some bucks at the price of a cheesy cheesy movie
