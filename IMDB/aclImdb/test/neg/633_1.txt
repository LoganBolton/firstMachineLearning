we all know that special effects cost money but it seems as if they could have used the money they saved writing the script to get some better shots the train is obviously a model in most moving shots the helicopter is obviously computer generated the alien looks like the one from the end of spaceballs except its a decade later and spaceballs had an excusebr br the only smart thing they did was blur all of the special effects to make them harder to seebr br not even the actors could compensate for such a poorly written script and its pretty obvious they didnt really try eitherbr br please dont waste your time please
