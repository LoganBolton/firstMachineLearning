i know these types of films sell tickets and make a profit for the film makers but it just wont do as a film about vietnam viet nam was filled with horrors for the men who lived it day in and day outbr br this film stars gene hackman who is korean war vet assigned to train a group of ragtag viet nam vets for a return trip to that country to rescue a group of american pows held at a camp there these men include a former tunnel rat a crazy acid dropping sailor a blond tanned surfer from california and some inexperienced kid patrick swayze who just so happens had a dad that was killed in nam they train first at some camp in texas and once in nam they are found out and lose all their weapons they are able to find replacement weapons and continue on their way to free the captured men most of the men are found and saved but the ragtag group is mostly wiped outbr br this movie played like a video game in which you could figure out what was going to happen next and who would pop out of behind what bush and who was going to die and who was going to live viet nam im guessing was not like a video game
