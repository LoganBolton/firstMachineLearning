gene hackman is a former marine corps colonel who musters a handful of private vietnam vets to go back to laos and rescue some americans who have been listed as missing in action hackman suspects that in actuality the halfdozen or so mias are secretly being held in a remote camp by laotians to be tormented and to provide more hard labor hackman is being paid by the wealthy robert stack whose son like hackmans son is thought to be among the mias but the circumstances are such that hackman can only manage to buy old and outdated weapons though he manages to pick up the help of a fervid anticommunist loatian and his two daughters along the waybr br i dont think the movie was deliberately concocted to endorse the myth of the vietnames still holding our mias for propaganda purposes the myth was real enough if anyone remembers there were many bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983 bring back the mias i think instead that the film was made partly in order to cash in on the myth it was absurd on the face of it why would our former enemy refuse to return mias propaganda where is the propaganda value in something thats kept secret to add the labor supply they need a hundred extra laborers in vietnam and laos the motives behind this movie  with its triumphant music and high body count  were scurrilousbr br but how about the movie itself stripped of its theme of rescuing mythical mistreated mias its a routine paramilitary actioner no better and no worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s gene hackmans performance is the only one that manages to keep its head above water hes just about always reliablebr br of the others this being a formulaic plot derived from the dirty dozen among others i kept trying to guess which of the gang would sacrifice themselves for the mission of the three anticommunist asians i figured one or more were dead meat thats why asian helpers appear in movies like this i was right two times out of three i also figured patrick swayzie as the rookie exofficer the youngest of the group whod never earned the respect of the others because hed never seen combat would also have to go in some heroic mode wrong he becomes a hero true but survives intact i thought there was a fiftyfifty chance that hackman would have to go too but he makes it out okay the formula doesnt really stretch for originality either charles bronsons claustrophobic pow escapee from the great escape is here in fred wards ex tunnel rat a claustrophobe who is forced to crawl through a drainage pipe with a snake inside it so that he can do a recon on the laotian pow campbr br the title uncommon valor is from a tribute that admiral nimitz made to the men on iwo jima  uncommon valor was common that day nimitz was certainly right about that whether or not the men who fought in vietnam were all equally valorous is remote from the point anyone who saw combat or even came near it putting their lives on the line for the guys in the line next to them were heroic enough this movie and the way it exploits our bitterness about the vietnam war doesnt really do them justice
