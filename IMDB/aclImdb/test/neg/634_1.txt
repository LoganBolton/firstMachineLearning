this review may contain spoilers or maybe not the warning is the same for allbr br dang it just when i thought that scifi channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies they give us this actually the plot itself its nothing we havent seen in movies like snakes on a plane deep blue sea etc that means a monsteranimalmenace of some kind is lurking in a close environment threatening a bunch of people in this case an alien in a train wowbr br i must say that when i first saw this thing on cable i couldnt stop laughing no scifi film had prepared me for this it was so incredibly pathetic i couldnt believe it the actors are all a bunch of stereotypicalgenre characters but since theyre not so famous to say the least i wasnt expecting much of them except diamond phillips no comments there but i think the guy was desperate to find a job the problem was something called special effects horrible even for scifi channel standards that modeltoy they made us believe it was a real train not to mention the modeltoy helicopter bigger than a trains wagon the meteor coming horizontally from space the baby alien a sock puppet and i aint kiddin the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly while they were static when they started moving it was awful the explosions the terrorist blew up literally and what about the exploding helicopter just how many barrels of gas was that thing carrying the insane mathematics used they couldnt even solve a school problem right and i wont talk about that doomsdaylike ending by that time i didnt know if to keep laughing or to start crying if i remember right i did bothbr br its an ideal movie to have a good laugh alone or with friends but be warned its so ridiculous at so many levels and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief
