wow jeez i dont even know where to begin commenting on this thing they called a movie i seriously dont know what the hell david bradley began smoking after making hard justice which in my opinion was quite a good movie after the american ninja features i hadnt seen any of this guys latter movies after cyborg cop lucky i saw them on amazon for like 5 pounds each and i can safely say the following if i had thrown down the drain the 5 pounds i spent on total reality crisis and expect to die i would have ended up happier than having to sit through the 90 minutes that each of them lasted my god how the heck can anybody label these as movies  and why do actionmartial arts actors fall kneedeep into the smelliest horsedung when theyve like reached their peak i mean david bradleys no oscar deserver but his first movies were pretty entertaining tough cool guy with pretty good martial expertise who delivered corny lines but at least entertained action and martial arts fans to a certain extent but i seriously would love to know what went through this guys head after making hard justice his final 3 movies have to frankly be the worst i have ever had to sit through as i mentioned before id love to get my money back on the 3 dvds i bought crisis was the epitome of sleepiness total reality was harsh but this expect to die is just utter nonsense i bet the director was either megastoned when he made this or he was just taking the pee out of every david bradley fan who would sit through this heap of crap the plot circles around a doctor bradley who develops some type of virtual reality game in which hes just killing different people off one by one sorry but i just couldnt take this guy seriously playing a baddie with that posh hairdo glasses and gray slacks and doing absolutely no physical fighting whatsoever frankly his best asset the film is even worse than any of those saturday afternoon bmovies because the acting is laughable the directing is horrendous and the few fights in the movie well what can i say the actors look like theyre training with their gym buddy we get a dumb muscular cop who starts to show off his fighting stuff like one hour into the movie and fails heavily a french hairy version of van damme who just cant fight act or speak to save his freaking life and bradley the supposed protagonist playing the evil doctor who i was really happy for when he stopped making this type of expendable rubbish i even reckon he didnt throw a kick in this movie probably due to his heart condition already playing up on him for a bactor i must admit i really liked this guy his style physique fighting skills but im really really glad he stopped acting after this monstrosity because i honestly wouldnt have been able to sit through another ninety minutes of peetaking material like this one avoid at all costs even if youre family of david bradley youll be glad you did word
