br br as a fan of bad movies and mst3k and a member of mft3k i must say ive seen my share of them but geez even the worst ive seen at least had a soundtrack as george lazenby stiffly wanders around hong kong doing who knows what you can guarantee that you wont be distracted by any of that background music that fills todays cinema or any of that music that fills elevators i dont think anyone in this film even humsbr br now this isnt entirely true  there is a sound track if you listen closely you will hear it chime in about a halfdozen times through the course of the film of course the timing will be entirely inappropriate and it doesnt last very long but something that could be classified as music does occur your best bet though is to sit your toddler armed with a wooden spoon down in front of the tv with a collection of pots and pans while you watch the rhythm and flow would be better than anything the film offersbr br keep an eye out for sammo hung as a minor villian in this film arent we all glad he found jackie chan to work with
