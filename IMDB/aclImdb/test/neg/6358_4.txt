spoilers  sorry the first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is gremlins its the only critters movie i have seen from the four movies but i enjoyed it it wasnt too complicated as i hadnt seen the past two but i thought it was quite a good movie all the same br br critters starts with a man his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation although it turns out that they end up at their own home  which i have no idea what the hell went on the girl meets up with a boy played by leo dicaprio and they go hang out in a nearby forest they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters he seems a bit psychotic and if i was in that situation i would not speak to him the critters steal a ride of the girl and boys car and end up in their flat thing they hide out in the basement and end up killing this lazy jerk they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girls dad they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic the critters eat stuff in the kitchen spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene and i cant remember not a good thing but im sure they have to go back for somethingsomeone anyway they end up getting out and saved the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two critters he is told he cant because they are endangered and so he sends them homebr br the ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off its a thrilling exciting movie worth a watch but if youre looking for a better version of this genre i recommend the gremlins movies sorry
