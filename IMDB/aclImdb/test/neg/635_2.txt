watching alien express inspired feelings of awe shock pity and yes sheer terror to think that actors who have done good work in the past should come to something like this the horror the horrorbr br tell me if any of this sounds familiarbr br a train especially built for a political campaign is on its way to las vegas for a big rally for the candidate a senator from texas barry corbin the only actor with roles both alien express and no country for old men in the same decade at a railroad crossing in utah a meteor incinerates a car waiting for the train to passbr br the train stops local law enforcement is summoned oh can it be the senator has a lovely young lady amy locane from crybaby and melrose place who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the 911 call lou diamond phillips stand and deliver la bamba is the exhusbandbr br meanwhile eeeeevil aliens have managed to stow away on the trainbr br the train leaves lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that lou can drop onto the moving train about 70 miles per hour so that he can save the day as the buddys reward he crashes the helicopter into the mountainbr br which is another example of how poorly written alien express is the cop heros sidekick must die we all know that but hes supposed to die near the end of the third act usually while saving several livesbr br once on the train lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel bruce willis in die hard by wearing a wife beater tshirt yeah lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym the part hes playing isnt worth bothering with but hes in good shapebr br the senator is going to have an afternoon delight with miss utah but aliens intercede and both he and the woman young enough to be his granddaughter pay the ultimate pricebr br soon we have bomb threats multiplying aliens and of course the train goes out of control and speeds toward its date with destiny while lou and todd bridges diffrent strokes try to save as many lives as they canbr br there is exactly one surprise in the entire movie early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirtyfifth anniversary with hopes for thirtyfive more years together the dude gets banged up but he and the mrs both live maybe the writers just lost track of thembr br this is the kind of movie that youd love to be a fly on the wall these actors who have done better work and really deserve much better than this are probably just happy for the work did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile or did they cry andor drink themselves to sleep at night at the end of the story the fairly numerous all things considered survivors gather in the last car of the train which is unhooked the other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just inches short of the cliffbr br lou and his ex are reunited happiness reigns id have thought that the first thing theyd do was get off the train so theyd have solid ground under their feet but i digressbr br someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star look make a wish then another then more and more the earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly hand puppets with big teeth will be everywherebr br its gotten to a point that seeing the words the scifi channel presents on an original movie tells us that well be glad we have tivo so that we can fast forward through the next two hours or better yet just go ahead and erase it two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely
