well this movie wasnt as horrible as i thought it would be i was expecting to give it one star i chose to give it three why well for a cheesy horrorscifi movie its not all that bad sure the characters are tacky as is their acting  including a young leonardo dicaprio the effects cheap looking and the monsterswell lets just say that ive seen some more effective halloween costumes in elementary schools but there was something about this movie that made me watch it till the end a little bit of humor helped out a bit i guess and if you ever wanted to see an alien pass gas this movie will let you live your dream 310
