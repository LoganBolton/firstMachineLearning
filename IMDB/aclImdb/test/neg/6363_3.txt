i didnt particularly like sliding doors or twice upon a yesterday so i certainly didnt this poor secondrate excuse for those films an idea thats been done to death what would happen if and the script is shoddy and unsuccessful not to mention the obvious attempt at adding sexnudity simply to gain an r rating and certain scenes that just werent necessary but were there to push the boundaries i really dont need to see a kid urinating or a struggle with a diaphragm especially when they have absolutely no connection to or use in the filmbr br the acting was also very poor the only actor i found the least bit satisfying was her daughter the rest were twodimensional and quite unbelievable the people i watched this with left the room about halfway through i managed to finish it but not without fast forwarding through part of itbr br overall nothing new here its a generic and boring film the few rather amusing moments are far outweighed by the silly or stupid ones this would be dull even if it hadnt been done before if it werent such a rehash id rate it a five but even for an indie film this was severely lacking and as a rehash it loses on originality as well 310
