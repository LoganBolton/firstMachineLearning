this years eurovision was to me a big disappointment ive watched the eurovision song contest every year since 1986 well at least thats the earliest one i can remember and i was only 2 at the time as any other year this one contained both good bad and horrible songs  nothing new there however this years show was the worst one i can remember only very few good decents probably more like it songs and a lot of absolutely terrible songsbr br turkeys winner song every way that i can sounded to me like a ripoff of turkish singer tarkans hit simarik just sounding a lot worse it didnt deserve to win from my point of view belgiums song sanomi coming in second was a nolanguage song wonder whats next animals singing nevertheless the music for the song was quite catchy giving the song a kind of dreamy feeling to which the lyrics seemed appropriate one of the better songs but thats not saying muchbr br after one of the closest races in eurovision history russian duo tatu ended in third place just three points behind turkey and behind belgium with ne ver ne boisia dont trust dont be afraid to me tatu was one of the very few highlights of the show surprising just about everyone by being some of the most covered up girls of all the female contestants they let their song do the talking and if we ignore the fact that they failed to pitch a few times in the first chorus they let the song speak very well indeedbr br the biggest surprise when looking at the scoreboard was austria the bookmakers here in denmark had the biggest odds on that song  a song that indeed was beyond horrible  but ended up in 8th place could it be that bum of his being shaken to the rhythm of the song that performance was the one that made me and my family laugh the most not because it looked good but because it looked so stupid that it was actually funbr br sweden did what they do the best abba in 1999 they won with take me to your heaven by sounding like abba in 2001 they made the top 10 with listen to your heartbeat again sounding like abba and once again this year they did it abbastyle again ending in the top 10br br england was finally punished for making those absolutely horrible noncatching songs that theyve been the past yearsbr br ireland ripped off the winner from 2000 fly on the wings of love and i could go on and on about how bad the songs werebr br i feel a bit sorry for the aussies who this year finally got the chance to see the eurovision song contest they deserved better than thisbr br i wasnt surprised by the show though the eurovision from 2000 to me stands out as one of the best in recent years 2001 was quite good but not as good 2002 was okay but certainly no more this year was quite simply disappointingbr br lets hope itll get better next year if not for us then at least for the aussiesbr br 410 one for tatu one for the close race one for the buttshaking and one for all the rest
