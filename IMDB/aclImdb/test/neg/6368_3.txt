the acting is generally pretty weak the dialog was also apparently dubbed in after the filming so it just doesnt come across well what do you want for a tv moviebr br annette otoole was ok there were a few strong lines from the parent of the queenbr br otherwise these kids werent quite up to it didnt impress my kids eitherbr br on the upside it is only an hour long considering that it got through plot and character development in a creditable fashion the settings and cinematography are ok toobr br some other viewers may like it for sentimental reasons
