this was something i had been looking forward to seeing the ultimate avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations and since iron man has been one of my favorite marvel characters i thought that this same production team would be able to do some really great stuff with an iron man solo title but the final film was unsatisfying i wasnt expecting them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to iron man gray armor the red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes all together not a major complaint but not what i expected from the ads and box the worse thing however was the story the acting and the cellshaded cgi animation for the monsters and iron man armor that was not convincing it didnt blend in well with the cell animation at all even on its own it seem sticklike and lifeless tony starks character arc as incredibly slow as it takes is so forced and unconvincing i wanted to see this movie because i love iron man but after forcing myself through the film i wondered if they couldnt have come up with something that had been as good as the ultimate avengers movies
