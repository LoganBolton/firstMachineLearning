i am obviously disappointed so ill be brief and wont waste your time first off the plot was uninspired at least the animation was even worse were in 2008 for gods sake and it looked like a shinier version of gijoe i wont even bother characterizing the actors performance and the dialogs or maybe i will cause i just saw that in order to post a comment over here you need 10 lines  where were we oh yeah the performance well it was totally flat lacking passion and talent if i am excused now as for the dialogs just like the acting no memorable quotes nothing that someone wouldnt expect lets just hope the movie will be decent at least
