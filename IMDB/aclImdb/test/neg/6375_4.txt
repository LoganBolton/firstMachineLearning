dont get me wrong the guys a success dynamo but he got to the top by selling overpriced plastic toys to impulsive brats so i get a little peeved when he looks at comic book fans as an extension of that same marketbr br see the invincible iron man wouldnt be bad if it were slotted on a saturday morning and geared exclusively toward undiscerning children but its not directed exclusively at children periphery characters are killed every five minutes and theres enough bloodshed and seminude bodies to make network censors squirm so it isnt quite cut out for childrens televisionbr br so what audience is this video aiming for then its the audience that enjoys nigh intelligible story lines about reviving a tyrannical chinese emperor with 5 arcane rings thats who and i think that audience is restrictively smallbr br a lot of great writers have passed through marvels leathery yoni over the decades so its a shame that marvel would risk their pricey animation investments on so many questionable storytellers and scribes who like mr arad are better accustomed to peddling action figures during saturday morning cartoons how many lukewarm receptions do marvel have to endure before they come up with a better strategy br br br br animation just passable cels some segments are better than others a low budget look all throughout  this aint no bakshi ralph and it aint no bluth don cg animations okay but far from impressivebr br story a litany of clich√©s all over the place convoluted contrived and uninspiredbr br characters so why is rhodes even here if all he does is add to starks sexual ambiguity hmmm her dads in a wheelchair tony misses his mom asian chicks are hot and apparently little else the female lead is thoroughly objectified by the features endbr br performances cant blame competent voice actors for a bad scriptbr br art very western musculature very clean lines faces are very derivative of eastern art very boring mattes very bland cgbr br conclusion not great but worth a watch for the fans and those who enjoy superhero myths a mustbuy for collectors a valuable what not to do course for junior animators
