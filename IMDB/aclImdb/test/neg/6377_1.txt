jon stewart aka john liebowitz constantly rips conservatism and anything republican this liberal comic is anything but as he pours his cutting humor down the throats of impressionable youths ive viewed the show while stuck in a waiting room while my car was repaired and this guy borders on treason hell take al quedas side over bush any day hes shameless and everything he says is punctuated by a phony laughtrack i do remember four years ago when he interviewed john kerry the two made faces at each other that seemed to preclude a makeout session it was like get a room you guys i just dont like smirky little traitors who peddle their propaganda call me shallow the daily show has had a long run and there are many likeminded liberals who have a seething hatred for republicans and conservatism im not surprised at its success but do that many people actually watch comedy central that mancia guy makes me barf
