comedy works best when it relates to stuff thats true but even as such some effort is required to make jokes that everyone likes and even the most grumpy of viewers can crack a smile when i look at the daily show i see the whole its funny because its true thing but i dont however see the effort and often times i dont if theyre being funny or just trying to make a pointi notice this mostly in the interview segments the daily show started off as a news parody by definition they poke fun at how the media plays its own news by pretending to be inept and dumb news reporters and anchormen and they tackled tons of subjects from science to movies and sometimes politics then jon stewart came alongand it all went to hell thr first years of jon stewarts reign were arguably golden i though he was so funny but then 2004 came along and its where you start to notice a huge chance in the show from there on the shows humor has gone stale colbert left steve carell left many of the shows best anchors left and now its mostly about jon stewart and the shows gone from a parody to a semiserious news show essentially evening news but with some gags here and there for those who havent seen the show and are having trouble finding out what to watch on cable ill give you a brief description of what the shows aboutat least until 2009 bush cheney and all republicansunless they happen to embrace an opinion shared by democrats as well are stupid evil corrupt and hypocrites anyone who stands by conservative beliefs is also evil corrupt and a hypocrite people who doubt the manmade global warming theory are evil and stupid vote democrat there i saved you 25 minutes of your time go watch something else at first i though that the producers hijacked the show for their own personal political agenda but when i actually see the interviews it becomes crystal clear what this shows aboutwhat i mentioned above but ill get to that in a moment frist off the humor in the daily show according to jon stewart expects you to find a random filmed quote said by either bush cheney or a random republican humorous because well because jon sets up the joke setting it in writers specific context and expects that the random quote somehow delivers the punchline so unless you «get» the context its entirely useless as bankable humor also the daily show expects you to laugh when they show a montage of one politician talking and in another separate video saying another thing again putting into a context that the writers expect you to understand thus making it funnywhy well because jon said so now imagine the daily show using that formula countless times for years every week and youll start to understand of what used to be a laughfest that is now 25 minutes of just silent staresyes even in the lewis black segments at first some decent amount of effort was put into these jokes but now much less of that is apparent and the interview have the most odd sense of bias that ive ever seen jon stewart calls bill oreilly a bully but what does that make him when he sucks up to every single actor and democratjohn kerry before obama today that appears on the show and looks down upon respected republicans and accomplished conservative newsmen such as weekly standards own bill kristol he puts them in some sort of peoples tribunal as if theyre being charged with a crime often times any person on the show who stands up for bush is portrayed as delusional as if that persons out of touch with reality and assumes he speaks for the majority of america thats the de facto treatment for anybody conservative unless they happen to share a similar point of view with democrats if so thens its an endless love fest but still it doesnt matter in the eyes of jon you are already wrong before you walked into the show and are still wrong afterwords thats the kind of treatment you get if you are anything remotely rightwing now you have to wonder what that could possibly have anything to do with humor one wonders whatll happen if democrats win the white house
