i have tried watching this show on several different occasions and each time found it to be utterly pale of humorbr br the reason to mention one thing is that it is solely based on ridiculing anything the republicans have done in short it is basically democratic party political opinions touted as humorbr br all mr stewart does is wisecrack about anything the republicans have done and the audience wets themselves in gales of forced laughterbr br my guess is that the left is so devoid of any real substance that they have to define themselves in terms of how much they all hate republicansbr br ldbr br br br my faith httpwwwangelfirecomny5jbc33
