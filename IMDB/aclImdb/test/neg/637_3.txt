this is fairly typical for the scifi channel onedimensional characters a ridiculous plot and terrible special effects weve got some alien sock puppets loose on a train and lou diamond phillips does his best with what little hes given to eke out a performance and save the day everyone else in this is utterly dispensable the exwife who goes through the timehonored clich√© of first disliking lou then of course comes to love him again at the end the obnoxious state senator who gets munched early on and a gaggle of dull security guards who run around a lot then theres an ecoterrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever except to provide us with 3 more running around he spends the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a boxbr br the special effects really deserve their own paragraph we start with a meteorite that flies through the air trailing flames behind it at about 100 miles per hour according to the physics of this movie if you exceed the posted speed limit in your car atmospheric friction may cause you to burst into flames then it lands on the hood of a car coming in horizontally sort of like a velcro ball landing on a velcro floor i guess it really doesnt damage the car much just bends up the hood a little bit later on lou gets in a helicopter and goes chasing after the train even though the train only had a two minute head start it takes a good half hour to catch it the cgi is so bad that the helicopter looks like its as big as the hills its flying over then it flies into the side of a mountain  this effect must be seen to be believed it looks like they took a jar of gasoline and threw it against a wall then superimposed the flame effect over the helicopter about 10 times too big no wonder the helicopter couldnt pull up in time it was carrying five tons of nitro glycerine then the ecoterrorist eventually blows himself up but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions do he explodes upwards like a cannon aimed into the air then theres the whole deal with not being able to stop the train because that would allow the little aliens to get off but it appears that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling so why this would keep them on the train i have no ideabr br overall if youve got a couple of hours that absolutely need killing and its down to this movie or reruns on the food network well come to think of it some of those chefs are kind of cute usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them maybe theres a sexy girl some ta or a character that actually has some personality or some suspense or well something i really didnt see any of that here
