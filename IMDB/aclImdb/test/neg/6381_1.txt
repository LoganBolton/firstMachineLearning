for some reason i just didnt like it at all and felt embarrassed about how bad it was since i bought it and watched it with my family all of us hated it with a passion its a nice enough kids movie maybe in the year it came out however think about it an outdated kids movie whats the point kids do not generally like to watch such old movies anyway and i dont see what adults are supposed to get out of this movie at allbr br some kids movies like mary poppins or wizard of oz can be enjoyed even now but time bandits is totally outdated for your reference and i think applicable in this case i also did not like dr strangelove or spinal tap at all so if you disagree with me on those similarly outdated movies you might like time banditsbr br there is also a horrible case of overacting as i recall from the bad guys think of the two stupid bad pirates in the pirates of the c movies except in time bandits they are not even remotely funnybr br anyway i warned you thats all i can do people that rate this movie high must have liked it from many years ago if you have not seen it before then dont bother watching it now
