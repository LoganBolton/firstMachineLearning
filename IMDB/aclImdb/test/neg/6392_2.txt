michael caines character has problems hes a plain nearsighted insecure man in his mid40s hes married but his wife doesnt seem to love him anymore he has a poor relationship with his only daughter but his most immediate problem is that a stunningly beautiful young woman played by michelle johnson is pursuing him too ardently kissing him groping him and trying to initiate sex at every opportunity whats the poor fellow to do br br this movie should be taken out of the comedy section and placed under science fiction only an intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of michelle johnsons character lets see  3 billion men in the world  she can pretty much have her pick  she goes with an clumsy aging loser this goes beyond a middleaged male fantasy into something so delusional you just hope that everyone involved voluntarily submitted to therapybr br theres not really anything funny here there are some quick attempts at wit from caine who often seems to playing hawkeye pierce more than a new character joseph bologna is like fingernails on a chalkboard michelle johnson is no actress  she has one crying scene that wouldnt pass muster in a high school play  but she is beautiful and she does take her clothes off so buy the dvd skip to scenes 4 and 9 and forget the rest
