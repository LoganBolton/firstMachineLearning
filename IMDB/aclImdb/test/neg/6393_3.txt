yeah i know the girls are hot and the scenery lovely but for someone knowing the place its hilariousbr br if you want some accuracy this is not a movie to rely on it starts with the flight from s√£o paulo to rio aboard a 747 this will never happen on the 400 km flight smaller planes such as 737 or a320 shuttle passengers between the two cities every half an hour the drive from the airport home if shown on a map would reveal an intricate zig zag back and forth perhaps the producers tried to emulate one of the very known taxicab drivers itineraries when faced to tourists not that it would be a local habit as i myself got ripped off in very serious places such as switzerland the girls yes all topless thats something an outsider will never understand brazilian chicks will be happy to expose 100  of their incredible bodies at the samba schools parades and wear almost nonexistent bikinis at beach but never go topless a handful beaches across the whole country will allow it all carefully secluded and out of town oh the indoor decoration the amazing wallpaper maybe in disneyworld apart from that it is very entertaining and yes demi moore is absolutely splendid
