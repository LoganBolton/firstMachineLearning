this movie should be called blame it on the script directed by stanley donen of singin in the rain fame this celluloid midlife crisis is not all bad its got some lush scenes of rio de janeiro and various scantily clad extras cavorting with each other and romping around the beach to the sultry sounds of samba but there is just something about watching fiftysomething michael caine get it on with whiny teenager michelle johnson that makes you feelwell sleazy this storyline is a complete stretch too nobody but pervy and vain old studio execs in hollywood could have greenlit this embarrassment maybe they are so used to having young bimbos as arm candy that they forget its their fat wallets that hold the key to their appeal not their huge larry kingstyle spectacles and yellow cigarstained teeth its one thing for a nubile young sexpot to have a crush on an older man but on her best friends father who happens to be married and then to throw herself at him shamelessly ugh theres nothing entertaining about that its rather pathetic and grotesque take note of a young demi moores budding cough talent
