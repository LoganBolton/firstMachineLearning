all in all dont expect much and you wont be disappointedbr br and if you want to see a movie that will take you back to 1983 this will do that for sure the only reason i gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is for 2 reasonsbr br 1 michael cainebr br 2 the people the sights the culture and the music of brazil br br the movie is almost completely carried by caine as he commits the seemingly impossible task of transforming it into a viable and semibelievable story even joe bologna and valerie harper fall short br br michael caine is pure class as always besides being a gifted classical and comic actor caine brings a blend of introspection mischievousness and sensitivity to every movie he does  the focus of his charm as far back as his role in alfieand the reason why he won the academy award for hannah and her sisters 2 years later in this farce he is tenderly beguilingfunny and vulnerable melancholy and sentimentaland besides the jewel that is rio de janeiro the only reason to not seek out a better form of entertainmentbr br wellmaybe a glimpse at the 2 lovely young actresses michelle johnson and demi moore would be a reason but look is all you can do at michelle though her look seems sorely datedthere couldnt be a more painful movie experience than watching her try to act most of her dialogue seems overdubbed too demis acting and looks hold up 100 times better and you could easily transplant her as is into any movie today she doesnt really look much different to be honest ms moore is surely underused especially considering she was the bigger star of the 2 br br save the fact that it is a silly farce at the end i actually kind of like the maturity with which all these people handle this scandalous situationthat it doesnt end friendships nor marriages and that an affair even with the underage daughter of your best friend could be forgiven and everyone can move on the injured parties do show anger and disappointment at what transpired but all works out for the besta bit unrealistic for sure but surprisingly refreshing hope always is
