blame it on rio is a romantic comedy 80s style with more than an eye full of sex throughout its 101 minute running timebr br the plot concerns two middleaged men in crisis one of whom is sorting through his divorce the other dealing with the possibility of that same prospect both good friends they decide to take a vacation in exotic rio de janeiro each with a daughter at their side complications set in when one of them gets involved with the others daughterbr br this potential riot of a story is fairly funny and there are some good lines however it never really becomes hilarious as it could have any attempt at handling the moral issue seriously doesnt work either and perhaps director donen should have stuck to the humour of the situationbr br not a bad film but what really ruins it is michelle johnsons awful performance as the naughty little temptress jennifer while she uses her body to full advantage its the only thing shes got michelles acting prowess leaves a great deal to be desired no wonder we havent seen her in anything elsebr br friday january 7 1994  video
