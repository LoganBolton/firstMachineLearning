one would make you believe that this game is about a man obsessed with a number and sure its an interesting subject  can a person become so obsessed by something marginal as a simple number that he completely loses touch with reality and becomes hopelessly delusional and paranoid br br well perhaps someone will make a movie about that sometime this one unfortunately doesnt have anything to do with the above never mind what the trailers or even the movie itself would like you to believe i would like to say that this number is just a macguffin but it isnt even that its pointless a gimmick a hook for unsuspecting audiencebr br well what is the movie about a dogcatcher carrey who becomes obsessed with a cheesy noir crime book because he feels it somehow reflects his own life there sure the character in the book  detective fingerling sigh  is for some reason obsessed with number 23 and carrey himself becomes obsessed and starts seeing the number everywhere but its just padding and totally irrelevant to the story in fact you can cut out all the 23 references and have the main characters obsess about cheese or something and youll have the exactly same story it is painfully obvious that all the 23 stuff was written in waay after the story was already finished rejected and sent for rewritesbr br which would be ok i guess if the movie wasnt dull dull dull half of the movie is narrated for chrissakes you arent watching the movie you are listening to jim carrey narrating the movie about a quarterin carrey starts reading the book and from then until the horribly clich√© ending we are forced to watch reallife scenes from dogcatchers life where nothing happens interspersed with narrated artsy film noirish book scenes which will either leave you snickering or just plain depressed its like a poor mans sin city with all the violence cut out narrated by carrey and shown in slowmotion ughbr br this is a simple case of a cmovie script somehow being filmed with an amovie cast probably because of the number 23 hook which i guess sounded intriguing enough on paper to warrant the premium hollywood treatment however since  as i said already  the movie is about number 23 as much as it is about cheese production in switzerland one cannot feel anything but cheatedbr br i give fingerling  the movie 3 out of 10 because i guess it didnt insult my intelligence as much as forsaken did or made me downright suicidal like battlefield earth did and the bottom of the scale must be reserved for abominations like those but fear not this is still a pretty lousy flick
