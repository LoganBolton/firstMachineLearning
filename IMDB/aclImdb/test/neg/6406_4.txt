there was a time when joel schumacher was ranked quite high on my list of favorite directors back in the late 80s and early 90s when his name was attached to several great films like the lost boys flatliners and falling down he truly was one of the most gifted directors in hollywood then came the stupid batman sequels unfortunately and after that it seemed as if every potentially sublime screenplay turned into a gigantic mess in schumachers hands both 8mm and phone booth could have been much better films and even the incredibly imbecilic concept of the number 23 should have been processed into a slightly more compelling and entertaining movie literally from start to finish the number 23 desperately attempts to be a mysterious and uncanny thriller and therefore uses all the dreadful clichés from the big book of cinema history including heavyvoiced narration flashbacks disorderly structure characters with multiple personalities numerous plot twists that grow increasingly absurd and sinister asylum settings nothing helps however simply due to the sheer silliness of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired engagement of cast  crew as much as you try to associate with the lead character and be openminded regarding the insane theories this still remains a movie about a twodigit number and twodigit numbers arent scary walter sparrow jim carrey in a rare noncomical role is a bored animal trapper whose wife agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday the book tells about all sorts of devilish theories and strange coincidences that are linked to the number 23 walter almost promptly identifies himself with the books protagonist a sleazy detective investigating a grim case of suicide and begins to spot copious examples of the 23 enigma in his own private life i did some research on google and wikipedia and apparently this whole 23 numerology nonsense really exists and certain people honestly believe that most catastrophes and accidents are directly connected to this evil number well thats just  crazy but hey im not here to judge peoples beliefs and fears regardless of how demented they are and i can only share my humble opinion on a movie that is based on an outandout berserk enigma the number 23 is not suspenseful in spite of several gloomy set pieces and nasty makeup effects and never at one point manages to make you contemplate about the role of numbers in your own life all cast members perform below their normal capacities but it was still nevertheless a joy to see the lovely mrs virginia madsen in a relatively big production again definitely not recommended in case youre looking for a solid and creepy evening of thriller fun but endurable and not entirely without merit
