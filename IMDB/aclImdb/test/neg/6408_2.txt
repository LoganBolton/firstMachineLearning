not just because of that theme in the movie which was one of the lame excuses for something reminiscent of plot nobr br i watched this knowing i would not like it i hate numerology whenever someone starts going off about patterns with numbers i feel the urge to slap them my own brain starts hurting out of empathy and fully aware this is a movie just about that topic i couldnt resist the urge to watch it and maybe get a good laugh but it wasnt funny just exactly the dumb sort of isnt this totally scary and yet amazingly cool i can turn any crap into 23 dialog i was afraid of as soon as the son started to chime in i knew this movie is a turd no matter what happens but i hardly ever stop watching a movie i started i sat through it i enjoy the painbr br the movie pretends to mock numerology under the disguise of showing how obsession can end badly but it rides that wave as much as its supposed to crush it i dont see that message i only see characters raving about a stupid number with little plot to justify br br top that off with the usual surprises  trying to put another twist to throw you off that makes no sense and you almost believe it due to the quality of the narration up to there  and you get one hollow piece of moviemaking that just happens to be centered around the topic i despise if only it did not try to be serious and rather had been some hilarious movie with actors i dont give a damn about but i was starting to like carreywhile its not his fault he is trying its not even good for watching with a bunch of friends and mst3k the hell out of itbr br my expectations were low enough for someone to trip on them but this movie managed to live up to be one of the worst ive ever seen
