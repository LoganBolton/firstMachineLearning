 out of  starsbr br lets see14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 equals 23 which was my departed grandmothers favorite number and the year she was born 23 minutes past the 23rd hour assign the number any way you choose and ooh be very scared be extremely scared when you throw in a braindead looking mutt to go with 23 and you have schumachers latest attempt at a dark suspense fest with the number 23 oh yeah 23 is also my record in cuervo shots at my favorite dive on 23rd street in the 23rd state in the unionbr br carrey carries the film to about its halfway point then we lose sight of him not caring much dont look for any crazy expressions to come from the comedian carrey as you have seen in the mask and me myself and irene no and dont expect an embodiment of a character as he did with andy kaufman this role is a sad and peculiar devolvement for jimbo wheres the riddler when you need him i know we dont need him virginia madsen like usual is underused as the supportive speculative and peculiar wife her talent like carreys is suppressed and its almost painful to watch her try to rescue her underdeveloped character from near anonymity br br to give credit where credit is due there are a couple of interesting scenes in the number 23 that showcase some very crafty cinematography they are arresting enough on their own without having to be convoluted within the incoherent narrative of this silly storybr br i dont know about you and i realize this is a work of absolute fiction but i dont know of anyone who often reads his novel in a dank dark basement or spends his time at graveyards on a regular basis like carrey does in this movie schumacher keeps his film dark and bloodred and gloomy and rainy and smoggy and gloomy and rainy and dank and on and on and on from beginning to end even flatliners and the lost boys had a little more daylight in them and were talking about medical students obsessed with death and teenage vampiresbr br if you feel like watching this film even if its out of mere curiositymake sure you do it while enjoying about 23 catnaps that way you can kill 23 birds with one stone
