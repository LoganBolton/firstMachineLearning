apparently a massive head wound is the cure for homicidal tendencies turning a murderous sociopath into a lovable and oafish dog catcher also this ones for the ladies it seems that the front gate of a psychiatric hospital is an overlooked hot spot for meeting potential mates those are just two of the approximately 23 absurdities were supposed to accept for this movie to have any meaning i love movies and i believed as im assuming many americans do forgive me if im wrong that hollywood turned out the best product ive come to learn how sadly naive and brainwashed i was and 2 how much more sophisticated europeanasian cinema is in comparison to its american counterpartbr br i watched this allegedly disturbing psychological thriller the night following a viewing of a japanese movie called suicide club as the camera faded on walter sparrows happy little family enjoying some quality time around a prison visiting room table not to mention the patronizing voiceover extolling the virtue of doing the right thing i suddenly had an epiphany i had just finished watching a movie that left me feeling as though id just had a glass of water when i really wanted a beer my thirst was sated but it was strictly utilitarian the premise was mildly interesting but the story itself with its innumerable coincidences how do we explain her finding the book well just say something likeor did the book find her theyll buy that gaping plot holes why did wifey take the skeleton predictability and obligatory happy ending turned out to be just another hollywood hack job additionally the casting of jim carrey was justwrong at any moment i felt he was capable of breaking into some shtick from one of his stupid comedies or in living color jim carrey as a tattooed hardboiled police detective who enjoys bondage and rough sex didnt buy it for a secondbr br you want disturbing deeply disturbing watch suicide club the story surrounds the mysterious mass suicide of 54 school girls the film opens with a group of giggling high schoolers mulling about on a subway train platform we then watch in horror as they line up hold hands and happily throw themselves in front of a fast moving commuter train needless to say much chaos ensues thats as far as im going to go with the story line because i encourage the reader to see the film in fact im not sure if i could outline the plot even if i wanted to what begins as a straightforward mystery quickly descends into a madhouse of grotesque imagery did i understand the movie nonot initiallylike many of the foreign films my girlfriend has introduced me to so naturally i thought it was bad but this one lingered in my mind i went to bed thinking on the film and awoke the next morning and looked it up on imdb i read some of the viewer comments and was astonished at 1 the insights others had derived from the film and 2 the fact that i had so thoroughly missed the whole point of the movie i realized that i was so used to being spoon fed the message from hollywood that when confronted with a film that actually required the viewer to participateto actually think for themselves i was totally unequipped its as if i had been conditioned to check my brain at the door of the theaterbr br am i saying that suicide club is the greatest movie ever made of course not it has its flaws many of which were reported adroitly by the imdb reviewers am i saying that all american movies are bad and all foreign movies are good againof course not my point is that theres a whole world of filmmaking outside of hollywooda body of work that engages the viewer forces them to think and questionmovies that dont telegraph plot twists follow a strict linear sequence and above all dont insult the intelligence of the person watching i look forward to expanding my mind while exploring this new world of film that doesnt do the thinking for me
