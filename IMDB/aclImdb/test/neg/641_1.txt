ehheh ehheh hey dude  look at these aliens theyre like  biting the humans and stuff ehheh ehheh ehheh br br this must rank amongst the worst movies of all time its utter drivel for anyone with a modicum of a brain sure you have the reviewers on the payroll who give glowing reviews and vote highly for this abomination but its easy to tell who these sellouts are their reviews are too good to give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some bmovie remedial appeal would be a glowing review calling this a great movie tips the hands of the corporate shillsbr br but enough of thatbr br this movie had about all the bad characteristics a movie can have without being so bad that its enjoyable just to laugh at the old japanese 60s monster films had a quality that this movie lacked at least in those 60s films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships how the models dangled on the strings and how the flames curved upwards out of the back those movies made fun of how bad they were alien express aka dead rail seems to actually think of itself as a good movie  which makes it incredibly absurdbr br the effects were awful by todays standards beyond awful however not quite as bad as the 60s monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal the plot and dialogue were about as sophomoric as ive ever seen made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect i wont even point out the plot and logic holes in this one it just wouldnt be fair to this pitiable plot plus it would take to long to even get started most of the acting was awful lou diamond phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this onebr br scifi channel is rapidly becoming the cheap thrills channel producing movie after movie without an iota of concept or intelligence in the lot i can only wonder  why botherbr br dont bother with this tripe it doesnt get any worse
