if you see this film in the tv listings just ignore it if youre looking for something scary youll be better off watching reruns of the xfilesbr br previous comments referencing the incredibly poor acting by the female lead are dead on she is almost unwatchable the sum total of her range includes whiny and scared and whiny and not scaredbr br i am the kind of movie buff who enjoys a good bad movie but this is ridiculous there is no direction the plot is as simplistic as the set of numbers they keep throwing at you and much like that set of numbers it ends up having no meaning in the endbr br your time will be better spent if you turn off the tv and give your dog a bath
