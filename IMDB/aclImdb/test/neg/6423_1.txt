newly released on dvd in the us just stay far away from itbr br i usually give plenty of room for stupidity in horror films ill settle for nearly anything remotely suspenseful supernatural spooky or even just a vaguely interesting concept this one simply stank i knew there was trouble when saras best friend in college who had considerable screen time wasnt even listed in the credits on imdb i wasnt surprised not recognizing any actors but that character daysha or dayglo or whatever her name was apparently didnt even exist br br im so embarrassed that i actually paid a rental fee for this garbage deeply deeply ashamed
