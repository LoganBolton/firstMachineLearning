bad plot bad acting bad directionbr br it had possibilities but just didnt achieve anythingbr br this film looks like someone started with an idea googled a bit of info and then tried to flesh an hour and a half with lots of night shots and bad suspense musicbr br others had to stop watching because they were scared 23 of the way through  i had to take a break purely because i just didnt care anymorebr br reminded me of an episode of days of our lives with marginally more suspensebr br just bad
