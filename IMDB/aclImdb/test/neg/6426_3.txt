the film starts well enough it is a truly terrifying scene as a couple of fugitives on the run from the law tear apart an innocent family living in a secluded country cottage by killing the mother and father the young daughter only manages to escape with the aid of a mysterious spectre who kills the two aggressors while she covers in a downstairs cupboard then we catch up with her 15 years later as a drugaddled student researching the supernatural living with her promiscuous aunt and being looked after by a mysterious redhead she has no real friends was almost raped at a party and keeps having bizarre visions which noone else can see so yep life is grand things get a lot more pleasant when she has a falling out with her mums sister who is later found dead in a bathtub under suspicious circumstances with 11 etched into her forehead hmm i wonder who the polices main suspect will be this is quickly followed by more deaths all linked by their relation to our heroine having been on bad terms with them before their passing could she be the culprit or perhaps the explanation could be something of a more ethereal nature clue if you think the former youve picked up the wrong movie from blockbuster go back and get the correct one shortsighted gimpbr br as i said i was all ready to fastforward to the good parts safe in the knowledge that i wasnt missing out on anything but a mediocre suspense potboiler but the first ten minutes grabbed me and i decided to give it a chance i was quite pleasantly surprised it certainly wasnt a masterpiece but the acting was good enough and the script kept throwing up intriguing situations of which i looked forward to finding the solution to alas 45 minutes in i realised my attention start to wander during a long sequence where the main character is walking round a library doing nothing we then get a cheap scare followed by quarter of an hour of goddledegook about the paranormal between her and her new hunk of a boyfriend things only got worse from there as the promising beginning is thrown out the window as we get one unconvincing plot twist after another followed by an ending so anticlimatic its like being promised the moon and ending up with a teeny weeny meteorite instead patheticbr br if it was bad all the way through it would have been far easier to swallow the fact that it starts at a canter and barely ends with a whimper is not just disappointing it is heartbreaking how can something which began so promisingly end up being so formulaic i dont know and i dont particularly care ill just give the writer and director a bit of advice for next time dont spend 5 weeks writing the first part of your screenplay then 5 minutes finishing the rest you tend to notice these things in the final product when you treat your project as sloppily as you have here 310
