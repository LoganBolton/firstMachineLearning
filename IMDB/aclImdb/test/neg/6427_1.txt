wow what a bad film not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling whats that line from a famous critic she runs the emotional gamut from a to b yup that about sums it up not even good for camp value i wasnt expecting oscar material but this and gosh her friends a ghost youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one comingbr br this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower on the bright sideat least its not a full two hours long
