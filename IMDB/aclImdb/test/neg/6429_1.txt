what can be said about such a pathetic movie  br br  very bad acting  the main actress seems to know only one facial expression  fear mixed with weakness like a poor beaten dog the other actress the one who plays the evil looks like the female double of ozzy osbourne with an awful red wig the other actors are so pitiful that they dont even worth being described br br  theres absolutely no plot the story begins with possibilities but goes nowhere  we dont know anything about the meaning of 1111 nor who rayden really is excepted the simple shes evil or shes a child of apocalypse which is not an explanation we dont know why the parents have been killed what kind of danger is growing and why sara was chosen as the film goes on we just watch pseudoscary scenes with a bad music moreover the end doesnt tell anything  we just see two possibilities as if one of them was a bonus scene or the directors cut theres no plot so no possible interpretation br br  1111 is just full of clich√©s  it is so obvious that i couldnt help laughing for example  the deserted library or the bathroom scenes ghost silhouettes walking with a blast of wind  theres even the fashionable little scary girl as in dark water or the ring of course the main character is bullied at school and looks like a stereotyped gothic girl dark hair red lips skinny black clothes is it an obligation to make her credible  i dont think so the psychology of sara is so few developed and so typical that it doesnt make her credible nor endearingbr br  terrible direction  as i said nothing original everything has already been seen a thousand times and is used here without any real purpose br br  there are some funny incoherences for example i dont know if ghost science paranormal course or whatever is taught in american universities in europe it is really not the case  teachers talking about negative energies or using unmaterial creatures sensors ridiculous also  how can you watch a movie shot in the sixties with a super8 camera on a computer screen without spending hours of your time for a digitalization in the movie they watch it immediately on the computer screen and how can you on this old film isolate a tiny detail then zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face  i wonder if the director has ever tried to digitize an old analogical filmbr br eventually 1111 just worths being watched if you like to laugh at silly movies or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your couch but its an expensive way to fall asleep
