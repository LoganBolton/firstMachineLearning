alien express is one of the worst movies ive bothered to experiencebr br the plot is predictable the aliens look like rubber sock puppets the effects would have been mediocre in the 70s but are just atrocious by todays standards couldnt they take a shot of a real train instead of using an obvious modelbr br the acting isnt great but really the dialogue is the worst part it gouges its way into your mind dont you die on me not now if you ever manage to suspend disbelief long enough to be absorbed into the movie youll rapidly be jolted painfully back to reality by the aliens the model train or the clich√©d dialoguebr br the only reason i didnt give this movie a 1 is that it doesnt deserve to be rated so badly that some poor suckers might watch it for the pleasure inherent in a truly bad film
