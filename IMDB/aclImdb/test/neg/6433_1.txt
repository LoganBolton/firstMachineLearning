war is in your blood rambo says early in the film dont fight it say what is the scriptwriter taking the mickey out of sly it is impossible for any person with a primary school education to miss the joke here yet stallone utters it without a hint of ironybr br the same lack of humour applies to the movie rambo iv is an overthetop idiotic actioner that would have been funny without intention if it werent sickeningly violent a redneck fantasy of the basest kind where villains are so villainous it is not enough just to kill them  you have to dismember them with relish stallone stops at no bluecollar cliché to make his point it is not enough for the chief villain to be feedthemtothepigs throwbabiesintofire kind of sadist he is also a pedophile homosexualbr br what is happening to imdb is it taken over by the rifle society how can this loathsome excuse for gross exploitation rate that high i like a good action movie as much as the next man but this is not entertainment  this is pornography of violence that trivializes and ultimately denigrates the real tragedy of myanmar the only good thing about the movie is that sly doesnt take his shirt off for this i will give it one star
