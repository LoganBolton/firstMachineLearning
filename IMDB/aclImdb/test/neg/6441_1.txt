eastenders has gone full circle from unmissable in 1985 to totally abysmal now its such a bad reflection of the nation this crap tops the ratingsbr br the ideas for plots can consist of nothing more trivial than putting ever characters name in a hat the first two out regardless of their sex will sleep with each other the 3rd  4th out will have a fight in the vic the 5th one will be arrested the 6th develop an addiction 7th get pregnant etc etcbr br the producers are clever though the 30 minute show is only actually ever comprised of 3 linesbr br 1 someone will walk in the vic  say whats goin on 2 someone else will stand up say leave it aht out 3 then a woman will say doan choo come in ere n insult mah famlybr br thats it thats every show apart from the occasional get it sortid  is it sortidbr br the show was once a realistic portrayal of east end folk  their way of life the buffers came off when 1 they extended it from two nights a week  2 the slater family turned up how they attract viewers is beyond me the kat character symbolizes everything thats gone wrong with society treating anyone else like something shes pulled off the bottom of her shoebr br the people who vote her the best character in these polls must the same as the ones that vote jamie redknapp best sportsman despite the fact he hasnt played a game for 3 yearsbr br what i can never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of british tv why do all the biggest names leave ross kemp martin kemp the list is endlessbr br how long has the longest couples marriage lasted with them being faithful to each other yes people leave but until the script writers realise that characters couple can be interesting  likeable without sleeping around the show will continue to deteriorate an episode last week had 3 separate plots of exactly that and zoe  the doctor top even lofty  shell as most unconvincing couple ever to appear on tvbr br yes eastenders is the most watched show thats undisputed but many external factors contribute to that 1930  2000 is the perfect time of day to gain the most audience figures it has an omnibus edition for 2 hours and more than that millions of the viewers watch it out of nothing more than habit but if they were completely honest to themselves they would admit that in 2002 more than ever it can be absolutely pitiful
