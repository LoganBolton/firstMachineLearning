i spent three months living in the east end of london in the latter half of 1987 when the show had been on the air for almost two years it was considered a running joke therebr br why because it had an allwhite cast every cast member and extra in the first couple of years was whitebr br the street where i lived was a long one with over 800 houses and to the best of my knowledge i was one of only three or four white faces living on that street we were on the corner of the indian and turkish quarters and even if you excluded those two races the asians and afrocaribbeans outnumbered the white people twentytoone plus of course of the very few white people who did live in the area the vast majority were scots like me  a cockney accent was never heardbr br that wasnt a racist rant just a simple statement of fact the bbc either couldnt be bothered crossing london to do their research before writing this soap or else they only had white actors available and decided to bluff it outbr br either way as i say in the east end of the time we considered it a comedy show
