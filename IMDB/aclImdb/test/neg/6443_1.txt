my wife and i watched this abortion from its beginning i hated it immediately but my wife became hooked on it for a couple of yearsfor me it just got worse and worse and the characters were all without question dreary and depressing without any redeeming features my wife then grew tired of it and we stopped watching altogether occasionally i catch a clip of it or pass through it when channel surfingthere is always someone yelling at someone else or doing something dreadful there never seems to be any lighter moments or happiness of any kind that was always my main gripe with it when we first watched it no humour the writers seem to have no idea about drama  they seem to think conflict is drama and of course that is only one element of it light and shade is sorely needed and actors who can bring something to it i am sure the actors in eastenders are competent but they have nothing to work with it must be the most depressing acting job in showbiz i fail to understand why the british public watch it and love it what on earth does it say about our psyche i have heard it said that it is just like real lifeits nothing like my life or anyones life i know otherwise we would be flinging ourselves from high buildings or under public transport the themes it tackles are far from family viewing but still are shown prewatershed i love series like breaking bad or the wire but i would not expect to see them at 730 or 800 in the evening the programme is trash writ large and should be avoided at all cost
