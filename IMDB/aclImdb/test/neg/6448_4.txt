amanda bynes is an enormously talented actress and ive really enjoyed all of her roles in the past especially in the fantastic shes the man for that reason alone sydney white was a huge disappointment for me the real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters in a good fun teen comedy its perfectly alright to have a cast of all fairly realitybased teen characters in sydney white this idea is thrown out the windowbr br amanda bynes makes a fine sydney but she is really lacking in a lot of what usually makes her sparkle as an actress i blame this on the script which makes her character too bland and restrained and on the hairmakeup department which gives her a detestable plastic look and an annoying hair style the seven dorks that sydney eventually befriends are far worse they are so dorky that its impossible to like them or even respect them as characters theyre essentially repulsive gag fodder as is the storys prince charming who is completely unbelievable as a character and is about as cheesy as can bebr br perhaps the films biggest startobe with the possible exception of amanda bynes is sara paxton whos actually very good as the conniving rachel witchburn its just a shame that the scriptwriters didnt make her a bit more gray than blackbr br the plot is basically that of snow white what kills it is that it is too blunt and obvious a reimagining the connections to snow white are thrown at us so much throughout the film that they are ultimately annoying and overblown prince charming is unrealistically charming the witch is far too despicably witchy the seven dorks are too dorky and sydney is just too pure of heart now this is not to say that the movie is all bad though bynes is forced down by the script she still has her moments as does sara paxton who brings physical comedy to the max in her scenes sydneys roommate named dinky is also great fun as a character its a somewhat funny film at parts that is ultimately just too cheesy and clich√©d to recommend
