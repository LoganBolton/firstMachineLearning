this movie was a low point for both jason robards and sam peckinpah major plot points are taken directly from sergio leones masterpiece once upon a time in the west released two years earlier and also featuring robards a man finds a watering hole is found in the desert being the only water for many miles in every direction he plans to build a station around the hole and to ensure theres a love interest he falls in love with a prostitute to this add an intemperate preacher bad music silly fast action shots even sillier ta shots  and there you go there is little question why it failed at the box office the real question is how did it make it that far
