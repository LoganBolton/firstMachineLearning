i tried to like this movie i love kevin spacey and i knew the other guy from his role as big brain on brad in pulp fiction but i just didnt care about the characters at all kevin spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him i didnt like him especially the endingthat made me hate him even more this was like watching a bad car wreck spacey played a prick well he does it all well but other than that i dont recommend it
