yes this review may contain spoilers but youll thank me for it this is the worst film ive seen in quite some time i came to this board expecting to see the same response i had but inexplicably there are several people who love this film and spaceys performance in particularbr br some will chastise me for saying it but i find kevin spaceys acting quite limited despite the worlds admiration for him i felt like i was watching a meaner version of kevins american beauty role his character in this film is ridiculously overacted all the way down to his laughable insults he throws at his assistantbr br there are allworld trite and boring scenes like when spacey is tearing into whaley about bringing him equal instead of sweat and low somehow i suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny but by this time i was ready to hit the stop button this is approximately 20 minutes into the filmbr br what about the fauxhomage to resevoir dogs whaley proclaims i think i saw this in a movie once as if hes going to cut off spaceys ear but what does he use to cut him an envelope thats right hes going to give him paper cuts that has to be one of hollywoods alltime worst scenes and the fact that the actors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appallingbr br i will admit that i didnt see the end of this film my dvd mercifully locked up about a half hour before the end but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that i missed a great twist and everything would have made sense well i dont care what happened in the end because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly overthetop dialogue i even got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as i did
