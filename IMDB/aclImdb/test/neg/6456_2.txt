theres something wonderful about a revenge film everyone wakes up in the morning believing heshe is the star of the movie and that anyone who interferes with ones own personal agenda is in some way the enemy revenge plot films work particularly well if a person has low selfesteem rather than fighting back in the moment the hero draws upon builtup inner anxiety to engage in a single act of power in an attempt to restore equilibrium quite naturally in the real world this type of revenge seldom relieves the tension because life is not a movie after the revenge is enacted the actions taken have their own consequences a good revenge flick helps people ignore this bitter pill in the movies the end credits roll and all responsibility resolvedbr br swimming with sharks is advertised as a comedy no doubt an act on the part of the producers to figure out just how to sell this oddity its dark but it isnt dark comedy company of men and the works of todd solondz come much closer parts of the film are so brutal they predate the current tortureporn genre everyone is so obsessed with saw hostel there are some laughs there are laughs in saving private ryan too but it isnt labeled comedybr br the intrinsic problem with this film is that it hasnt earned its revenge case it is ostensibly about a young man who is abused by his boss and eventually takes his boss hostage to pay him back for all the mistreatment the hero aptly named guy is an everyman so vague we know literally nothing about himwhat does he do with his spare time does he have friendsfamily how did he get where he is what are his interests this becomes a running motif through the film no doubt inspired by the films authors own strugglewhat do you want the answer to which we are denied by a vague cheat of an ending its very difficult to care for such a character even if acted well even tom hanks becomes a creep in the wrong roll such as punchline kevin spacey as the boss buddy is supposed to be a monster but hes too charismatic as an actor the best laughs came when he abused his assistanthe seemed almost as surprised as the audience probably is at what guy will endure when kevins character is being tortured the view taken suddenly becomes empathy for him guy is suddenly filmed as a leering monster without rationality at this point any message the author had has been lost theres no hero in this film ergo no reason to care at allbr br its not a stretch to assume this story is based on the authors own troubled career in the film business i worked for a similar boss and can vouch that its not that farfetched i had similar wishfulfillment fantasies at that time and thought that i was justified i thought you could win over the most beautiful woman in the story actually the only womanthere seem to be all of about four people in the universe of this film just by being your eager naive self that eagerness won accolades and that a boss abused you because he was a mean person time and tide have revealed the truth that most monsters are really just the demons of an individuals personal psyche and resentment is usually based in the self as the film points out if guy was so unhappy he only had to leave the film doesnt offer any denouement at all surprise ending notwithstanding we still know nothing about the protagonists we cant even be sure anything they said was based in fact and everyone magically gets to have his cake and eat it too in short there was no point to this story at all other than to point out that shock the film business can be pretty brutalbr br there are plenty of good films that tell solid and satisfying revengestyle fantasies both the feelgood variety 9to5 working girl the devil wears prada and not so much war of the roses the remake of the hills have eyes this isnt one of themdespite a fun turn by benicio del toro in the emily blunt role from prada and some interesting work by spacey and michelle forbes this is a frustrating mean confused and slightly dull creation of self indulgence from a director who has one hopes worked it all out by now
