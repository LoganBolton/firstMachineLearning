talk about false advertising what was this doing in the comedy section of my video rental place i think there was maybe one laughable part in the movie i can appreciate black comedy but this had only the blackness without any comedy the movie was generally disturbing and unfunny yes kevin spacey was good as buddy and the rest of the cast was also good but generally the movie falls apart because we dont really see a good enough reason for guy whaley to lose his mind so badly the ending was disappointing as well what would buddys motivation be for letting guy get away with what he did this isnt really explained at all why would buddy go for such a plan wouldnt it be more like buddy to screw guy completely by turning him over to the police the ending didnt seem to make a whole lot of sense to me no matter how i looked at itbr br generally i disliked the film despite the good acting spacey essentially chews scenery for most of the film but towards the end he gives buddy a bit of needed humanity the story just wasnt as good as the cast
