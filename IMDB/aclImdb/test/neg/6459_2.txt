i was recommended this movie by one of my filmmaking friends and was therefore expecting something good sadly i was very disappointed by the first half  ah a movie about a wimp taking revenge on their ahole boss how original  and watched the second half on fast forward hoping to find something that would justify the 45odd minutes id already wasted but all i got was the shock endingbr br the basic problem is that this is a movie which seems unable to decide what it wants to say and says whatever it does say hard to tell what that is badly great acting does not save a bad script full of characters i cant care aboutbr br now maybe if i didnt moonlight in the movie industry id be shocked to discover the dumb politics and exploitation going on behind the screen but as it is my feelings are as summed up above ho humbr br 210 would have been 110 if it werent for the acting and the paper cut scene
