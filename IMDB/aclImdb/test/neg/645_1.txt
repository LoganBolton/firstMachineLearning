the first thing that struck me about this movie was the terrible acting the whole cast was so uniformly inept at delivering their lines that i started laughing at the awful dialog midway through the film an even bigger issue with this movie is that at no point do we ever find out what motivates the actions of each character the one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is halfdan husseys innovative visual effects however as eyecatching as they may be they do little to make up for the gaping flaws mentioned above a dreadful script mixed with community theater level acting does not make for a pleasant viewing i was honestly shocked at how bad this movie was
