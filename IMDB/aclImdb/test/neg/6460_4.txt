why is guy working for buddy probably because ari was not around in 1995 why does dawn want to be with guy for access to buddy why does she stay with guy i am not surebr br there are bunch of things about this movie that i am not sure about but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actorbr br frank whaleys guy is certainly out of his element working for buddy  he wants to write and make meaningful movies not be a gofer that is verbally abused for getting equal instead of sweet  low br br michelle forbes dawn who also wants to make meaningful movies seems way out of guys leaguebr br the ending leaves a lot to be desired
