i am a huge fan of northern exposure men in trees is a complete knockoff of northern exposure theres the cityfolk from new york stuck in a remote backwoods town marin frist  joel fleishman she immediately doesnt hit it off with a local jack slattery  maggie oconnell the town only has one pilot who is not often available ther is only one radio show and the entire show is about quirky people with sincere and odd relationships too many parallels just like northern exposure except one obvious demographic has been altered in each character im bored give me something new to think aboutbr br on the upside the writing is pretty good but if this was a school project it would certainly have earned the stamp of plagiarism br br perhaps people who love this show were sheltered from the dedicated creativity and hard labors of joshua brand and john falsey
