on one thursday evening at 1000pm my local west coast abc affiliate aired the pilot episode of northern exposure the abc network usually airs men in trees in that time slot but the program was preempted for a live sporting eventbr br despite both shows are set in alaska and filmed on location in the pacific northwest exposure in washington state trees in vancouver bc rewatching northern exposure as well as few episodes of sex and the city reminds me how disappointed i am with the poorly conceived hybrid men in trees br br anne heche can be a good actress with the right material unfortunately her role as a writer who ends up in a small town in alaska grates on my nerves perhaps because i feel that heche is miscast i am not convinced of her fishoutofwater characterbr br i also cannot help but feel that the supporting cast fits the typical quirky stereotypes the hotlooking local the kindly bar owner the bush pilot the local police officers the dim but wellintentioned radio dj etcbr br the only stereotype that may have been broken was teddy bear and veteran er actor abraham benrubi as the local bartender in love with two different women considering that one of the executive producers is filmmaker james mangold his movies heavy and cop land had lead characters who were large men then i am not surprised why benrubi was cast in a nontypical rolebr br nonetheless i can see why there are a lot of dedicated viewers who love men in trees it fits the quirky niche for television audiences i wished the show could find its own voice instead of borrowing ideas from better shows
