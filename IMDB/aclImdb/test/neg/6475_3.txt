chris ricci sleepwalks her way through most of this but then quickly takes on an air of boredom and disdain  much as i did when watching it without her this would be no more than a cheap kids movie but at least she does add an air of quality there are few if any more visually striking and charismatic young actresses in the businessbr br theres not much wrong with it as long as you accept it for what it is  a cheap disney remake aimed at very undemanding children i could watch ricci all day so im probably oblivious to many of the movies shortcomings but unless you too are a ricci fan a catlover or very small child i doubt you will find this very entertaining
