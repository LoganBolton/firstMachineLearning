the movie isnt too bad up untilbr br the main problem is with the ending so its a pretty major spoilerbr br for the time it was made its a beautiful movie and does get a lot of it rightbr br howeverbr br in the book sam succeeds and lives his dream whereas in the movie he gives up and goes back to the city completely destroying the you can do what you put your mind to theme of the bookbr br this movie is a desecration and instead of remaking classics that dont need redone the hollywood types who havent any better ideas should do this one right this time
