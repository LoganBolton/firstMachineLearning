with al jolson at the height of his popularity and warner brotherss the jazz singer having been the highest grossing film of 1927 it was inevitable that the other studios would churn out a few vehicles for their own jolsonesquire characters but while the jazz singer was a sensation for its being the first parttalkie the matinée idol lacks the singing voice of its star the now obscure johnnie walker and has to make do with just his visual anticsbr br the matinée idol was an early directorial assignment for the renowned frank capra capras first couple of fulllength features for harry langdon reveal a very showy excessive style which made langdons already mediocre slapstick almost unwatchable a couple of pictures later and capra has learnt to ease off a bit with some fairly regular and decent camerawork however he still shows no aptitude for shooting physical comedy the longest comic routine  the stage performance  seems to have a few good gags but its all cut up into lots of different camera angles and there is no chance for the comedy to flow naturally from the performances theoretically a good portion of the jokes are in the intertitles but there are far too many of these and none of them is especially funnybr br of course capra would eventually mature into a fine dramatic and romantic director and you can see him beginning to develop in this respect he cuts down the line closing in on walker and bessie love in the scene where she first lays eyes on him in his don wilson get up neatly establishing the wordless connection between them then there is some beautiful and tender framing of the couple in their scene together at the masquerade which is all very reminiscent of the love scenes in capras early 30s outputbr br johnnie walker columbias answer to al jolson is not an exceptional talent his comic timing is good but there is nothing to make him stand out bessie love on the other hand is a pretty good actress too with a very expressive face kudos to her for getting involved with the physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys theres also a good role for lionel belmore that rotund and jolly character actor who seems to turn up in absolutely everything in the late 20s and early 30sbr br the matinée idol is one of those pictures that has gained more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director later having made a handful of masterpieces in and of itself it is a very uninteresting piece and like most of capras work before he met robert riskin a disappointment
