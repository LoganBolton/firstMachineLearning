royal rumble 1988 bored me pretty damn good the rumble itself is pretty uneventful filled with mid carders and a winner that really had no point in winning and why on earth did the young stallions vs the islanders main event half the crowd left jessie ventura sounds bored through half the thing and you can tell when he mentions he finds the development of hogan vs andre more interesting mcmahon and ventura dont have the chemistry of gorilla and jessiebr br ricky steamboat vs ravishing rick rude heavily disappointing match with too many rest holds and too much of a sluggish pace sink this one when it picks up like crazy in the last 5 minutes its too little too late steamboat wins by dqbr br 2 12 5br br next is up dino bravo attempting to set a new bench press record with ventura spotting him horrendous segment with no entertainment value what so ever ventura is not nearly enough to carry this segment and even mcmahon admitted it was boring controversy or not i wasted enough time on this crapbr br 05br br wwf womans tag team championshipbr br 2 out of 3 fallsbr br the glamour girlscw jimmy hart vs the jumping bomb angels this is the best match of the night no im not kidding very exciting stuff for womans wrestling and youll be hard pressed to find stuff this good now a days the jumping bomb angels were way over and the crowd went ape sht for their title winbr br 35br br contract signing between hulk hogan and andre the giant hogan gets a decent pop but there a few noticeable boos for him probably because its in canada a bit too drawn out for my liking but it was necessary for the storyline it got its point across and had some effective moments but a lot of the times i kept saying get on with it both sign and andre slams hogans head on the table and pushes the table on himbr br 2 12 5br br royal rumble match very weak royal rumble probably due to awkward pacing and the true lack of star power i think vince was testing the waters with this one and it showed ventura seems uninterested and i dont blame him crowd clearly wanted roberts to win yelling ddt almost every 5 minutes he was in there and while duggan got a good pop i dont believe he was the winner they wanted and where did this take his career nowhere brets 1st ever royal rumble and he made an impressive showing it wasnt terrible but it was quite lackluster and it didnt have enough to make the show considering this was what the show was based onbr br 2 12 5br br hogan has an interview with craig degeorge standard hulkster interview but not with the same craziness and outrageous remarks he usually pullsbr br 25br br ted and andre get interviewed andre claims he will deliver the championship to mr dibiase short but effectivebr br 35br br 2 out of 3 fallsbr br the islanders vs the young stallions crowd is completely dead for this and half of them bolted for the exits its quite dull and had no business being in the main event jessie and vince seem bored and argue about other things while the match is taking place islanders win due to taking advantage of romas injurybr br 25br br bottom line historically important i suppose but there is really nothing to see here this was just a starting cue for great things to come for the royal rumble and while you can see glimpses of potential here there is nothing on here going out of your way to see i usually recommend everything once for die hard wrestling fans and considering its the 1st royal rumble event i suppose i have too but prepare to be bored a lot of the timebr br 310
