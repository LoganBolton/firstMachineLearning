i bought this film from a gas station in the 399 bin for one reason billy drago who is one of my favorite actors he is terrifically creepy and good but thats where it stops the movie itself is a dirt cheap gratingly awful attempt at a horror western and manages neither never mind a successful merging of the two genres the acting besides dragos is so bad i wanted to put the couch cushions over my ears the production values are nonexistent and the script  i dont even know where to startbr br avoid at all costs unless you are a die hard drago fan like mebr br terrible shameful unforgivable
