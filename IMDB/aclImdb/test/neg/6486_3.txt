an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones the soundtrack wasnt terrible eitherbr br but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale i dont know where this was filmed but were i to hazard a guess it would be either an openair museum or one of those reenactment villages where everything is just a bit too wellkept to do more than suggest the real old west okay so it was shot on a college kids budget that said i could have forgiven one or two of the aforementioned faults but taken all together and being generous i could not see giving it more than three stars
