set in a post apocalyptic future the new highlander is an effeminate little twerp named quentin macleod who is being mentored by a new ramirez while his little sister tags along on their quest to thwart an evil immortal overlord to do so quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before this overlord korton doesbr br in short this is pure crap much like the highlander sequels quentin is a fairly stupid character constantly whining and moaning and bitching in a woe is me for i am a reluctant hero kind of way and he never catches on to the fact that hes an immortal and cant be killed at least not easily ramirez would have done better to ditch him and thwart korton himself
