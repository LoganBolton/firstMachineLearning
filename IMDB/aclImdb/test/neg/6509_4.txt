kennan ivory wayans was so funny in low down dirty shame that i had to see this one and it was one of the worst he has done and steven seagal didnt help much it starts off with some odd religious killings that dont make much sense to jim campbell keenan he is surprised to see a new partner waiting for him to work by his side to crack the case but jack cole doesnt seem to be who everyone thinks he is until jacks ex wife is killed in one of those ritual killings that end up making him the suspect as well its the same thing as all of his other movies smoke past cia involvement and now trying to be a normal cop why does steven dress up like he is from a western movie and the prayer beeds on top of that make things a little confusing
