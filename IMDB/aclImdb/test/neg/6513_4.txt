new year 2006 and im watching glimmer man again say what you like i find steven seagals movies amusing like many comments good fight sequences  i particularly liked his answering of the phone at the restaurant saying how long it would be closed for restoration bit like schwarzeneggers humour in the earlier action films  although that tended to be selfdeprecatingbr br but the one i like here is brian cox one of the most versatile actors around pity about his hand and foot but so much for withstanding extended interrogation  must have flunked that class at the farmbr br as the films went on i wonder just how the ever thickening girth of seagal affected his movement never mind its entertainment
