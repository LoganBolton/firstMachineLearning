i did not like this movie i rented it hoping it would be something like the 10th kingdom i was disappointed when i discovered it wasnt i also found it just plain nervracking the acting was bad the characters where unbelievable and the time jumps were crazy i only recomend this film if your in the mood to see a crazy dude running around but im sure there are better films with the same thing i cant believe i wasted my time on this one
