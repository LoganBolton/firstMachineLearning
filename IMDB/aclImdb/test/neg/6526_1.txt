ok first off there may be a spoiler here since i dont know what constitutes giving out too much information my subject line says it all but surely people will want to know why its so stupidbr br first off this film follows a bunch of yuppies as they go to a sports game in chicago but wind up taking the wrong exit and winding up in the ghetto scary huh well first of all emilio is driving everyone in the worlds most overblown rvwinnebago tricked out with satellite dishes and crap like that on it so these guys are going to a sports game i forget which though likely the bulls or the white sox since theyre near the ohsoscary ghetto yet they cant even make it down the freeway without having an onboard viewing command center that would put espn to shame yet theyre smart enough to earn livings that would pay for the stuff but are such sports fans that they dont even know which exit to get off at on their way to the game they so lovebr br i gave up on the movie within a half hour after that but the reasons were plentiful they wind up in the ghetto yet their main danger to their existence is denis leary a white guy im no racist but come on in anything resembling reality  and this film was trying to be an urban nightmare  denis leary would not be trying to kill emilio estevez hed be hitching a ride to get the f out of dodge himselfbr br this is easily one of the dumbest movies ever created although im not familiar with much of the rest of the worlds cinema if mst3k were still on they surely would have devoted an episode to this one
