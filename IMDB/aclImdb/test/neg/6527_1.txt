lets get one thing straight this was bad so putrid that it doesnt even qualify to be imprinted on anyones memoriesbr br the ever repeating storyline whos constant recycling of not only jokes but story lines and character appearances a typical storyline goes as follows sue the mother opens the episode quoting on how she loves her baby son but smells awful as if that doesnt get old hardebloodyhar some australian quasinationalist bogan look it up appears to say how she thinks shes awesome because shes an ozzie while everythingeveryone else that isnt sucks before disappearing for the rest of the episode a small mercybr br the rest of the plot revolves around the father gary getting in some kind of disagreement with sue and him talking to members of his band for advice on how to sort it outbr br the phrase words fail me is an old one but this is where it is the most truthful thing to say it is so incredibly bad so horrible that i would like every trace of its existence sent to the lowest depths of the north sea and life can go onbr br it saddens me though to see someone as good as sally bretton good actress i like her make a prat out of herself ardal o hanlon my hero aside has the ability to be pretty funny  but not here  and ben elton distinguished for so much good stuff somehow manages to come up with thisthing then comedy is in very serious trouble
