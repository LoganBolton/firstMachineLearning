and now im up to episode 7 i really was hoping itd be over by now not to mention canceled once everything connected with the show including the actors  had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere never to be seen again because this series really is dire br br to have this program listed under the genre of comedy is at best misleading its so hard to believe ben elton could write something this bad maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything hes been connected with before in some episodes i havent even laughed oncebr br oh and i cant believe ardal ohanlon actually stopped doing my hero  started doing this instead his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day  perhaps he simply cant read and didnt realise just how poor the scripts for blessed were dont get me wrong my hero is not masterpiece but its a million times better than this piece of junkbr br and just to annoy me even more i bet this gets a dvd release as well when there are so many great tv series that arent getting released
