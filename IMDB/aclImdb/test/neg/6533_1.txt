this movie is ridiculous its attempting to be a comedy but the screenplay is horrible the whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that its a comedy truly is bad cinematography you really have to sit there and watch it to realize theres a few jokes here and there going on but either way theyre all inside jokes amongst themselves this is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad it really is a very pointless movietheir expressions reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turns out that way anyway unless you want to be bored out of your ass i suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie
