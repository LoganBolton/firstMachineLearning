plotbr br  a chair from ebaybr br  random peoplebr br  random people talk  dude its right  im feeling it lets get married nowbr br  if you are a hippie then you will love this movie you must be high or drunk otherwise you will question your life watching this junkbr br this movie was clearly not thought out from the beginning to the end and the other comments are probably the crew padding the reviews if this wasnt aimed at my demographic i dont know what it is aimed for i found the plot everyday boring its something that i would do and trust me its not worth filming going on a roadtrip and filming half of the silence does not make a movie
