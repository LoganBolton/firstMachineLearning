imdb lists this movie as a comedy i have no idea what genre this movie falls into but it certainly isnt comedy tragedy maybebr br i wont say whether this is a good movie or not all i know is it is not a comedy i wanted a laugh tonight and what i got was some bizarre notion of someones attachment to some ugly chairbr br this movie is not what is advertised its film school tripe that i can only assume is intended to make people think i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone that i know or even that i dont know its ridiculous drivel that makes no sense whatsoeverbr br it made me think alright it made me think i wish i had those ninety minutes of my life backbr br im sure the world is full of armchair critics who have a liberal bent on their world view that will make this movie something worth watching to thembr br i am not one of them
