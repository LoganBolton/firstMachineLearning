so then this is what passes as high art for the likes of sxsw film festival and sundance eh well i suppose i can relate as long as story script dialog acting save for ms aselton cinematography and editing are completely irrelevantbr br i remember telling other filmmaking friends some years ago that the biggest problem with digital video was that we were now going to have to wade through a future sea of crap to get to anything worth watching now that anyone and his brother or brothers in the case of the duplass could run out and make a movie the puffy chair need i say morebr br this feature length video is yet another chapter in the dismal everexpanding world of dudeology movies young guns armed with a dvx100a a few thousand dollars a hastily written shallow script and some friends they call actors who decide one afternoon to make a movie and voil√† instant feature videomakers dont get me wrong  im all about independent cinema ie hollywierd sucks but having said that you cant argue with some of the realities of that system br br if the duplass brothers wouldve had to have gone out and raised a real budget and bring on real producers its clear a script like this would never have been greenlighted and therein lies the problem there is no longer such a thing as a vetting process for getting films sorry videos ready for production just grab a dvp2 camera and off you go and what makes it worse is that highprofile festivals like the aforementioned actually embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense and why precisely because its nobudget br br i think its important especially in todays climate of indie films to quit allowing videomakers to highjack the language by labeling themselves filmmakers there is quite a difference in my book when you have to go out and actually put your script on the line asking friends and family or business people for real money to make a feature film knowing the potentially losses at stake then you will know what it means to be a filmmaker but dropping a few hundred at sams club for some dv tapes some soda and chips doesnt cut it br br oh and by the way i have to mention how utterly annoying it was to listen to a female being addressed as dude throughout the entire movie even mark borchardt reserves that intenselyoverused moniker for his male friends only where it is at least endearing where his buddy mike is concernedbr br i think its high time the indie film community started to call out these shoddy nobudget videos for what they are and simultaneously scold prestigious festivals for giving such casual efforts high praise either that or ask these festivals to at least have the courtesy to add a new category to their festival line ups dude films
