i saw this at my citys independent cinema  no surprise because no mainstream theatre would want its fingerprints on this train wreckbr br the camera work is very distracting the constant shifting refocusing and zooms could induce a sensitive person to have motion sickness it looks more like a film students project than a serious moviebr br though wellacted the characters are unlikeable josh is devious always trying to manipulate situations and people to his advantage without any context to emily and joshs relationship she comes off as a whiny insecure girl whos desperate to get married rhett is an emotional infant incapable of understanding the complexities of human interaction without any redeeming qualities i didnt care about what happened to any of thembr br obviously some people liked this movie as the couple sitting behind me were laughing hysterically of course they could have just making fun of it i could hardly blame them for it
