most films are crappy with high production values this one is crappy without high production values which sets it aside from the large pool of horrible movies as bad as this film was i need to give due respect to kathryn aselton who i believe if given the proper script could probably turn in a pretty good performance she plays emily the girlfriend to perennial doofus josh who often refers to her as dude or man in a nonironical tonebr br but heres the thing emily is a semibelievable character which means rhett will soon need to be added to the cast to counteract this almost believable character with a guy even more preposterous than josh when we first meet rhett we learn that he is deep because he is videotaping a lizard which is proof that he sees the world uniquely rhett then shows the tape to emily and in one of emilys few unbelievable moments she acts impressed by this amateur tape of a lizard wow i believe is how she responds once again with no irony of sarcasm even mildly impliedbr br from the opening scene you are given warning that the camera work will be crappy we open on a shaky close up of josh as he attempts to win over the viewers by acting goofy oh how care free this main protagonist is that he will act goofy haha this film could almost be a case study in just how bad films can be and for that matter just how far bad films can get in the festival circuit i mean by comparison of most circuit crap this film probably did appear pretty awesomebr br i believe sxsw gave this film some minor award oh south by southwest why do you encourage them its only cruel but here is where i hand this film a compliment it is the best of the mumblecore movement mind you all other mumblecore movies sucked beyond belief and generally included grotesque nudity and incomprehensibly bad acting but still its good to be the best of somethingbr br i havent seen baghead yet but it looks like maybe they have made a few strides forward the preview at least made it appear tolerable where as even the puffy chair preview couldnt really hide the fact that it was going to suck ive gotten off topic here anyways rhett is most likely not portrayed by a professional actor at all much like josh most likely isnt an actual actor but rather the director or brother of director theres some mixed messages there i think rhett was somebodies buddy and they said hey why dont you play this guy named rhett in the movie the fact that rhett is the name of the actor and character probably means the actor and character are the same unless i am mistaken which i am notbr br if rhett shaved the raccoon off of his face you would probably say he was attractive so anyways rhett emily and josh team up to bring the puffy chair to rhett and joshs dad some stuff happens along the way more bad acting bad supporting actors crappy camera work an attempt at significance this film wouldnt have been bad if it hadnt been so shamelessly pursuing profound self importancebr br the whole thing is amateurish if you can view this movie without paying for it like if its on tv or for rent at the library then consider looking at it just to see if you like this super cheap style of filmmaking i like what the duplass are doing the whole make a movie with nothing concept but i wish they would make a movie that someone would want to see
