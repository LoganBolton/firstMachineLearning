when the puffy chair beckons beware of its soft colorful upholsterybr br the movie starts out quite well josh mark duplass and emily kathryn aselton are a boyfriendgirlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship an argument occurs one night and in order to make up josh asks emily to come along on a roadtrip to his fathers house where josh plans to deliver a purplish lazyboy recliner for his dads birthday emily accepts and along the way they pick up joshs flighty brother rhett rhett wilkins an amishlooking fellow more in touch with other peoples lives than his ownbr br the roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between josh and emily as well as a bitter feeling for the puffy chair it is initially very grubby and falling apart until josh convinces the original owner to refurbish it rhett quickly ascertains that the cause of all of emily and joshs problems is the lazyboy and sets it to the torch one night br br and thats the last we hear of the chair even though there are many minutes left in the filmbr br the big issue is that the title of the film is the puffy chair when it isnt the chair at all that takes centerstage it is josh and emilys doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another once the chair is destroyed theres never another mention of it even though they arrive at joshs parents place on his fathers birthday without a gift josh never mentions the chair nor does his father theres no connection between it and the lives of these people so why call the movie the puffy chair and why isnt there a tiein with it at the end bad scriptbr br the other annoying thing is that mark duplass brother jay duplass is not only the director but also the cameraman and not a very good nearly every scene has a rapid zoomin on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the cameras autofocus catches up and rights itself initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel but rapidly became unbearablebr br the acting in the film is accessible and entertaining all of the actorsactresses did fine jobs but the poor production quality stilted ending and lack of coherency to the title caused this flick too many problems
