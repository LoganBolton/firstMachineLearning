although the film does have a fairly stylish look for an indie made on a really low budget thats not what i go to movies for there wasnt one character i found sympathetic they all seemed to be absolutely clueless losers everything they attempt ends badly its all too hopeless for me reviews refer to the puffy chair as a black comedycomedy the brother rhett behaves like an escapee from an institution when josh talks to girl friend emily about his brother he almost hints at rhett not playing with a full deck nonetheless josh performs a wedding for rhett and a woman rhett met just a few hours before there were a few interesting performances by some of the characters encountered on the road however for me the most telling thing was that people were walking out of the filmand i saw it at a free screening
