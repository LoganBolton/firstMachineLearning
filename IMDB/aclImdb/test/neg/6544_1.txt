this lowbudget indie film redefines the word blah it will surprise most that this word can actually be found in the dictionary defined as nonsense uninteresting dull lifeless the movie redefines the word because i would have to add to those four words pc crap pretentious on a pathetic level and pointlessbr br the film tries so hard to be hip and in touch with contemporary beautifulpeoplestrugglingforjenesaisquoi behaviour and thinking do they think there is almost no plot to speak of though there is one to sleep to the phoniest and most politicallycorrect things about it are how a white woman is great friends with a young black stud the black streetsaxplayer with a penchant for ohso wise council and advice and the fat black psychic isnt it beautiful how the races can get along after all ahhhh in the end the woman reads out poetry which is nothing more than one of her dull dear diary entries she gets a standing ovation although in real life her listeners would have more likely than not dozed off into deep slumber but this movie has little to do with real life even though that is where its supposed to be happening in real life her poetry reading would have gotten standing ovations only if she had the sense to include the juicy sexual details and then i rubbed his huge penis against my sweaty impatient pink little vagina cheers whats worse the lead actress has a dozen scenes in which she either bathes or screws with someone yet they never have the sense to show her breasts which was clearly the only thing left to save this messbr br the black guy and the blonde who are separated by about a meter in height hook up they look like a cheap variation of rodman and madonna as if the latter two arent a cheap enough combination already nicole eggert mentioned by howard stern in his miss america book is the blonde stern writes of eggert that she took her implants out yet i believe that when they took her implants out they also sucked most of the meat out of her flesh and muscles by mistake for she looks starved herebr br the sax player in one scene develops angellike wings he looks like al roker advertising angel food cakes
