the only interesting part of this movie was its jazz and reggae new orleans back drop it tries to be one of those movies that has two struggles the heroine has to overcome one from the past and one from the present which she fails to do convincingly the actings bad and the direction is even worse im not surprised at all that this went straight to video the end result of this film leaves no one satisfied or convinced including the actors themselves
