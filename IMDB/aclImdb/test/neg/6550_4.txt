this movie is about people living at a trailerpark later in the movie it gets obvious that those people are outofwork comedians mainly old males well more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about fing but never there is any action just those people talking in the beginning i thought its some cool perverted redneckstuff but after a while it got boring i mean how many versions can you think of saying fing dk  ct for sure this can be funny  for half an hour maybe not 80 minutes but it was funny to watch those people trying to act im pretty sure that they often were reading their text on some sheet when playing but it does not disturb the movie its cool like this because those individuals seem so poor fedup crestfallen aoles that the style totally fits their wooden helpless reading of the texts makes quite good atmosphere i fell in love with the characters a littlebr br spoiler ahead later in the movie the fers do some comedyshows rhymes about fing with just themselves as audience and imagined applause then one gets an evictionadvice and so they decide to defend the trailer park and enter their roofs  armed with some weapons then they got shoot fin sounds like action but its not just some trashy homecamera takes spoiler endbr br but the movie is totally consequent in its style and im pretty sure its just what the moviemaker wanted to have its the portrait of those fkups in an groggy homecamera style with characters who can not act but seem interesting personalities so they are nice to watch but the texts about  you know what  the whole time get boring after a whilebr br pretty young director who also seems an interesting person as he played some teenagerstuff in popular moviestvseries but now got in more horrormovies which is more his cup of tea i guess and this his first directioneffort will be distributed by troma now dont know anything about a release i got this one as an advance screener from this years cannes which says for bootlegging purposes only
