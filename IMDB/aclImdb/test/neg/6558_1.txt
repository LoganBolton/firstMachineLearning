welcome to the plan 9 from outer space of star trek movies come on trekkers admit it this movie is so bad so staggeringly inept in every department its become something of a classicbr br the shat gives the worst performance ever committed to celluloid boones hi bones brilliant this isnt just ham  its several large pig farms in kentucky br br the special effects should be done under the trade descriptions act for using such a term the enterprise is a moving piece of cardboard in this film really even the star trek tv show had betterbr br bones spock and the shat sing yeah spock sings row row row your boat after struggling over the meaning of the words capt life is not a dream poor leonard nimoy he must really want to strangle shatner for this could the shat not have given us his rendition of mr tambourine man or harmonised with nimoy on ballad of bilbo baggins sorely disappointedbr br a sean connery lookalike plays spocks halfbrother only cos they couldnt get sean connery uhura does a fan dance that would have been sexy in 1966 in 1989 its like watching your drunk granny embarrass herself at a christmas partybr br cat woman jumps on shatners back shat twirls her around a few times like a wwf wrestler and chucks her off yayy the shat seems connery 20 was a bit of a vulcan rebel which explains why spock hasnt previously mentioned him in 79 tv episodes and 4 movies mccoy apparently mercykilled his dad but afterwards they found a cure tell me this isnt hysterically funnybr br the 11 deck enterprise suddenly grows another 400 decks for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft spocks antigrav boots amazingly support bones and the shat as well should also have used em on the humpedback whales in star trek iv shatner meets god or what purports to be god but i assume is really some kind of alien being god looks a bit like charlton heston in the 10 commandments sean connery the 2nd calls on god to share his pain and promptly dies or something god punishes the shat for questioning his identity so spock kills god with a photon torpedo id love to know what jehovahs witnesses made of this scenebr br the shat having killed god promptly goes back to his singsong with spock and bones altogether now row row row your boat
