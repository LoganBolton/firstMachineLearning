thats the only word i can think of to describe this movie not waste as in a waste of time any time spent with these characters is never wasted but waste as in a waste of opportunitiesbr br when i see this movie i think of all the star trek novels that were written which would have made a much better film than the story shatner chose the setup was like an average television episode while the finish felt like the climax if you can call it that of the first moviebr br nimoy in directing iiiv focused on the character of spockhow he faced the kobayashi maru outside of the classroom and how he handled his emotional live now that he had a chance to start fresh shatner could have done the same with kirk here but he didnt we dont know much about kirk that we didnt know before again one of the novels would have been bettertry my enemy my ally for a very interesting character study of our friend james t the minor characters are used mostly for cute bits and the scottyuhura subplot seems way out of left field particularly since the subtext in the original series was suluuhurabr br even hardcore fans cant find much to enjoy here sorry but its true
