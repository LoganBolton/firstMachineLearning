leonard nimoy directed star trek iii which wasnt half bad maybe william shatner thought seeming as how nimoy did it he could after seeing this film he should have reversed that decisionbr br star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountainbr br the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards she looked like she was taking part in a granny competition if they meant to make her look sexy they were wrong she looked grotesquebr br how this got to production or even writtenwell it dosent bear thinking about the only place good for this film is in the garbage the worst one of the series
