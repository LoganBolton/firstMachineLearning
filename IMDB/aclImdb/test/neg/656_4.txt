a wildly uneven film where the major problem is the uneasy mix of comedy and thriller to me the unusual premise is clearly a comedic one and they should have gone for an allout comedy for example rock has some funny lines but occasionally he is too unlikable for a comedy the scene where bettys husband gets scalped is too nasty for what should have been a less violent comedy an even better example is the hollywood leftist writer preaching to us tritely through freemans character early on about the plight of the indians i mean  yawn they should have given freeman something funny to say in that segment but that is of course much more difficult than to simply write him a boring pc speechbr br there is yet more new age pcness in the form of the ending the girl not only doesnt get the boy  she gets no boy at all in fact the message is that the girl needs no boy at all bit of a feminist statement there the first halfhour is weak but the movie gets better  ironically  once zellweger gets to kinnear i say ironically because im not much of a fan of kinnears though hes solid here zellweger is very cute as usual she has the sort of allamerican cute looks which should appeal to almost every guy and i have to wonder why more of such women arent represented nowadays instead of the dogs who inexplicably became stars such as diaz roberts aniston lopez or barrymorebr br since the movie tries to be very serious at times i have no choice but to criticize freemans character which is the gangsters equivalent of the movie worlds hookerwiththeheartofgold there is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between freeman and rock to suggest even remotely that they were father and son
