when i first saw it 9 years ago when i was 9 i thought it stunk im 18 now and i still think it stinks i mean geez no special effects or anything it was boring and kinda anticlimatic my cousin watched once and george takai sulu kept talking about how it was supposed to be so much better but they kept cutting to the budget it would have been a great episode but it was a terrible movie
