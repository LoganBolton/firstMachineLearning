supposedly director william shatner had in mind a much darker film when it came to star trek v the final frontier but the suits at paramount looking at the huge boxoffice receipts taken in by its humorfilled predecessor insisted the new film have plenty of laughs too so what we get is arguably the weakest and goofiest of the six star trek movies with the original cast there are bad ideas aplenty along with a few good ones and if youre in a charitable mood you could look at the final frontier the same way you would a soso episode of the tv series on the plus side laurence luckenbill is a fine actor and gives one of the best guest star performances in any star trek big or small screen ranking right up there with william windoms commodore decker his portrayal of sybok spocks halfbrother consistently lifts the film when it threatens to sink which happens all too frequently charles cooper is good too as the fat old klingon general korrd too bad his role isnt as large as he is if the story about shatners intentions is true then i owe him an apology because i was prepared to lay the blame for the incessant silliness and notveryconvincing action scenes squarely at his directorial feet the reason is ive always felt that of all the trek regulars shatner was the least tunedin to everything that makes star trek work and what makes it special to its fans having read his trek memoirs its very apparent to me that he considered the show another actionadventure series that just happened to have a sciencefiction setting he preferred the vision of gene coon over that of gene roddenberry coon was known for his work on the popular western series the wild wild west shatner also mentioned that a favorite star trek episode of his was a piece of the action a silly secondseason episode cowritten by coon so finally given an opportunity to direct a star trek feature film would not shatner follow his instincts and produce an actionfilled flick with lots of tongueincheek humor well somebody did because thats what the final frontier ended up being shatner himself definitely returns to form as the great ham and as leonard maltin points out the film suffers from a bad case of the cutes in the opening scene at yosemite national park its hard to say which is worse the supercheesy special effects or the godawful dialogue running gags about equipment malfunctioning on the enterprise have run all the way from wrath of khan and by this the fifth trek movie have run themselves into the ground so has the idea of a skeleton crew one new development is an apparent romantic relationship between scotty and uhura and suffice it to say one does not exactly sense flames of passion burning between the two its a pointless subplot and adds nothing the climactic scene where god is encountered doesnt add much either whether or not this was a good idea in the first place is debatable but the scene itself doesnt make much sense the god creatures abilities seem to vary according to what is needed at the moment roughly half of this is a tired retread of the climax from the search for spock leonard nimoy manages to salvage spocks integrity even while spouting such unspocklike lines as get a grip on yourself doctor and deforest kelley as usual outperforms both shatner and nimoy he really came on as an actor in the final trek films so this trek outing isnt terrible it just isnt very good there was to be one more original cast trek movie before the baton was passed to the next generation and it was far better suited to the task than star trek v the final frontier
