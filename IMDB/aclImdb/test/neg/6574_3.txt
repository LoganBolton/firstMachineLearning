i guess that after leonard nimoy had been successful in directing the search for spock and the voyage home william shatner thought he could direct too although he is a competent actor he shows here that hes just not a good directorbr br actually this movie is hard evidence to support the arguments of trekkies who say that william shatner being an arrogant egomaniac for although his character captain james kirk was always arguably the most important role in the original star trek it seems in this movie that he is the heart of the movie the two other most important characters captain spock and doctor leonard mccoy are just there to support him and the other characters are just there to add comic reliefbr br the plot is that some emotional vulcan outcast named sybok is mindmelding with people and releasing the pain bottled up inside them from that traumatic event early in life that changed them forever grateful they join him in his quest to make the entire world free of pain and thus at peace sybok and his followers commandeer the building in which a peace conference between a human klingon and romulan diplomat is taking place this lures the stillbeingconstructed enterprise there since none of starfleets other ships have experienced commanders honestly with how starfleet is run the klingons and romulans should have conquered them years ago sybok adds the enterprises crew save spock who is revealed to be secret brothers with sybok mccoy and kirk sybok orders that the enterprise take off to the center of the universe to meet god who apparently every race has a word for however it turns out that this is only a minor entity when he demands the use of the enterprise and kirk asks what does god need with a starship the entity is destroyed but not before sybok realizing hes been lied to for years sacrifices his life and earns spocks respect in death after the enterprises photon torpedos destroy the entity and inexplicably sybok as wellbr br ok science fiction movies are not known for realism but at some point rationality must be enforced why do people follow sybok just for releasing their pain why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event ive certainly led a traumafree life why doesnt kirk try his crew for mutiny and treason after they join sybok what was the point of sybok sacrificing himself when the torpedos were going to kill the entity anywaybr br so the plots weak another problem is that sybok though played well by lawrence luckinbill is poorly portrayed just because hes an emotional vulcan doesnt mean he should act exactly like a human religious fanatic shatner who was a cowriter as well as the director could have at least developed dialog fitting for an emotional vulcan i guess he feels that any emotional being talks like us gee i guess that means that klingons should say isnt and dont more often than is not and do not and the cardassians shouldnt prolong their sentences because they like to talk yeah i know its sad that i know this please every st race uses unique dialog why is sybok the exceptionbr br the only thing to not complain about is the acting ive always known star trek to have great actors and this movie is not exception cudos also go to leonard nimoy for it had to be difficult to play the dispassionate spock in his old agebr br some other things i didnt likebr br shatner and the late deforrest kelly twice show what bad singers they are by singing row row row your boat in this movie i guess shatner wished to silence his detractors of his singing ability what he did was prove their pointbr br uhura does a fan dance while wearing nothing but tree bark to draw some men into a booby trap after all the dreams of all us men are filled with images of middleaged plump women dancing nakedbr br comedys all well and good as long as it doesnt affect the nature of star trek too much but when scotty bumps into an object on the enterprise and kos himself its kinda goin overboardbr br kirk is the only crew member who can reject syboks offer of releasing their inner pain and see through the god imposters deception not even spock can manage either of these perhaps this scenes were valantines from shatner to his character as many suspectbr br the concept of an entity posing as god had been used in star trek before this movie more than once be creative shatnerbr br speaking of uncreativeness i didnt purticularly care for the ripping off of the music of star trek the next generationbr br all in all pretty bad trek movie if youre a trekkie watch it once because its star trek otherwise watch star trek ii the wrath of khan its way better
