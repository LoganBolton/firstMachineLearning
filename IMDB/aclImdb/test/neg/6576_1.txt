i find it almost touching how star trek fans try desperately to like this film in spite of its unbelievable number of flawsbr br to begin with none of the familiar characters are really in character so to speak scotty is depicted as a bumbling tinkerer instead of the competent engineer he was in the original series uhuragods i cant even think about what they did to her character all of her dialog was painful to listen to mccoy seemed like a neurotic stepfather to kirk instead of his trusted friend spockwell lets just say that leonard nimoy was terribly wasted he was given bad dialog i do not believe you have grasped the gravity of your situation captain gravity get it get it and made almost into a buffoon kirkoh man dont get me started william shatner is a hammy actor to begin with so to allow him to direct really is to invite disaster which is what we gotbr br the plot is beyond ridiculous giving spock a brother is a pretty desperate story line and unnecessarily soap operaish but hey lets go with it the search for god again a weak plot basis you dont think so ok lets go with that too so assuming that the two aforementioned plot elements are sound whats wrong with the script well for one thing it recycles way too much the enterprise for example is yet again not working properly are we to assume that starfleet would send a grossly malfunctioning ship with a skeleton crew into a potentially dangerous situation just because they want james kirk to handle the situation if thats the case then why not put him on a better ship as an adviser adding to thatthe crew is grossly incompetent scotty has the ship in pieces and apparently is cloddish enough to bump his head knocking himself into unconsciousness while there are hostiles on board no one seem to notice the klingon ship decloaking at a crucial moment despite the fact that the sensors are clearly showing the ship in weapons range and the crew all seem way too familiar with each other in other words there is no sense of discipline if this is the flagship of starfleet then its a wonder that the klingons hadnt already overthrown the federationbr br as to the personal struggles with pain it was crap lawrence luckenbill is a competent actor but even he couldnt save this turkey in short no one could of all the people involved i imagine leonard nimoy is the most embarrassed by it i hope he is anywaybr br thank god the original cast didnt bow out on this cloddish opus
