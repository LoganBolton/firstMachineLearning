i like underdogs so 12 years after having first seen star trek v and thinking it was bizarrely bad i gave it a second watch hoping i would find some redeeming quality which i missed the first time aroundbr br i didntbr br the writing is halfbaked and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the movie on its feet albeit shakily the further we get into the plot the sillier it gets the last quarter of the film is just plain ridiculous what was even worse from the original casts pov is that this was the first st movie to be released after the franchise returned to television with next generation and the average episode of next generation would put this to shame  including the special effects what an embarrassmentbr br the final frontier isnt thoroughly wretched  i gave it 4 out of 10  but its so far below the standard of its predecessors yes including the first one that the only reason i can think of to watch it is because youll appreciate the other movies morebr br  unless its an episode with trois mother in it
