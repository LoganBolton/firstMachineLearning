i am not kidding theres a scene in this movie where a hobo hits his head on a tunnel keystone and explodes with no fireball though into a million pieces it made some kid in front of me scream in terror in a grated filmbr br this film might serve to convince children that santa clause is evil his helpers are ugly misanthropic overthetop and mean when santa here an anagram of satan appears all 200000 elves begin singing santa clause is coming to town as though it were a druid war chant then in the reflection of this movies rosebud object a jingle bell that whispers hints of why you cant hear it ringing doubtdoubt old saint nick appears looking like a stoic donald sutherland his face glowing like moses from k10c when we hear him speak his thundering voice sounds less like a jolly old elf and more like james earl jones voice sloweddown about 20 frighteningbr br the syrupy music is outofplace boring and repetitive it doesnt follow any emotional threads as in titanics very effective score it just seems thrown in at certain points in order to generate feelings of warmth and magic it fails to stir partly because it doesnt match the imagery of the film there are some musical train wrecks no pun intended where out of nowhere the eerie symphonic score slams abruptly into happy childvoiced polka about the title locomotive it just makes the whole movie sound like it was rushed into production br br finally i agree with some other reviewers about how well dead everyone looks it does seem a little macabre at times the motioncapture technique is good for allowing the kings islandlike rollercoaster train sequences to look convincing from a distance but up close real actors should have been used overall nice eyecandy for killing time in front of the tv but not much else here
