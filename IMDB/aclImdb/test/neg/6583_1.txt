much like final fantasy if you look at a still shot  it doesnt look so bad but when the people start moving its utterly horrifying uneven jerky motions frightening lack of emotion and lack of a feel of life in the face gives me the creeps the characters do not even appear aliveorganicbr br i saw a preview screening with my daughter who actually fell asleep she was not at all engaged for the record i thought her to be easily engaged by both pixaresque films as well as a number of the bad 2d films like sinbadbr br the lighting is painful giving the children the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin at a campfire the lip syncing is bad  worse actually than final fantasy br br i also seriously question having hanks play five characters this was a major distraction throughout the film the role of the conductor is eerie  although in a way i just cant pinpoint it reminds me of my fathers fake phone voice when greeting clientsbr br i think this is why the multiple roles are distracting  you are accutely aware that the voice is the same but yet distinctly different it gives each character the feel of being acted as opposed to being real human characters the illusion of reality is broken by the multiple role playing of hanks ive seen the technique work  a la eddie murphy but hanks just cant come close to pulling it off with a voice alone given the horrifying animationbr br i would not waste my money on this  wait for the rental
