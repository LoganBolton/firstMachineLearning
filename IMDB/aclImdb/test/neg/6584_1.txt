the polar express director robert zemeckis i love back to the future forrest gump contact and who framed roger rabbit no question mark after that movie title and tom hanks one of my favorite actors the reviews of this movie were almost unanimous saying that this is an instant holiday classic ebert  roeper give it two enthusiastic thumbs up even eberts written review gave it a full four stars wow ok this i gotta see but wait the motion capture used looks really weird hmm maybe im not so interested in seeing this anymorebr br well you comin says the train conductor to the boy in the polar express the boy is reluctant at first and the train begins on its course without him the boy soon changes his mind and jumps aboard just in the nick of time br br now most of you have probably decided to not jump aboard this train and wait for the tv train or rental express hee hee im so witty and clever i on the other hand was like the boy who was skeptical at first but jumped on to see what the fuss was all about br br i just wasted 10 and two hours of my life br br i cant even begin to explain the pain in my stomach the polar express was so painful to sit through its not even funny theres no story theres no pay off you sit there through these series of events and you wonder is there any point to all this itd be one thing if the scenes were entertaining but theyre notbr br this movie is void of any emotion any soul any ounce of plausibility and most of all any fun this movie is not fun br br and lets talk about the way these characters look for a second saying that its the same technology motion im sorry performance capture used to make gollum is a real shame because gollum was believable photorealism just does not translate well in this medium youre using animation why not design the characters to be more expressive or why not just film it all with real actors they certainly could have we as people know all too well how we walk talk interact with things seeing it on the screen done unconvincingly is not impressive caricatures done convincingly is all the more believable as the incredibles has proved the result of the polar express now is as if they took corpses of dead children and turned them into puppets theyre moving and talking but wheres the heart wheres the soul thats what were seeing on the screen ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh this movie is so horrible br br theres a scene early in the movie where the boy takes a girls train ticket from her seat because she got up and left it he wants to give it to her but you sit there going why just leave it shes coming back he of course loses the ticket and adventure ensues and then theres a boy whos stuck in the back of the train all the time and they bring him hot chocolate but he cant come up and join the rest of the kids and then theres this annoying know it all kid with the voice of a 35 year old its all so very disturbing br br oh and theres songs one girl goes into the back of the train where the lonely kid is hes singing a song to himself and then she interrupts and joins in they end the song as theyre holding hands looking into each others eyes as if they were lovers very awkward i wont even go into details about the song about serving hot chocolate while waiters dance around the train keep it hot keep it hot the one scene where tom hanks slides on his knees with his arms stretched up in the air has to be one of the most memorably bad scenes in the history of bad scenes br br i have to stop now or ill just kill myself i need to watch something crappy to cleanse the palette yes crappy is better than the polar express br br the one thing about trains it doesnt matter where youre going what matters is deciding to get onbr br dont get on this one for the love of god i have decided for you this is just another film taken from a childrens book stretched incredibly thin into movie form it happened with the grinch and the cat in the hat and those were horrible also but who can blame them i bet if i took the book the berenstein bears too much junk food and turned that into a feature film itd probably be pretty dull also but at least thered be a story and a point which is what the polar express is so lacking of
