this movie is awful it creates characters not in the book and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes including an obnoxious little jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl not to mention the yiddish speaking elves the book was a simple story about belief and this movie is a dark ugly and needlessly scary movie about nothingbr br the animation is superb but the story has been ruined by hollywoodbr br the good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from tampering with a story that needs no improvement hanks was overdone and i dont see why there couldnt have been other actors voices be used
