yes it might be not historically accurateactually only 6 soldiers of 9th rota were killed there and yes it has some mistakes and exaggerationbended machine gun come on or the that history lesson about how afghanistan was never conquered by anyone  educated russian officer would know history much better than that  take for example british campaign in afghanistan and yes it does not have multimillion dollars hollywoodstyle special effects but its strongest point in showing soldiers life there their relationships and their feelings when the best friends are being killed in front of their eyes in my opinion 9ya rota really does a good job showing all those thingsbr br again movie has it weaknesses but in my opinion it appears to be one of the strongest russian movie for the past few yearsbr br 810
