where the hell did vh1 find the scriptwriter for this movie out of high school this movie tries so hard to be sympathetic to michael jackson but instead turns him into a horrible tacky caricature all the lines are filled with clich√©s but surprisingly the acting wasnt bad as usual this is a bad movie with pretty good actors the actor that plays michael jackson jeez i feel sorry for him i think he did the best he could with the weak script i didnt mind that flex did not look like michael jackson i thought he did the best he could but later on when he had all that white makeup on oh man did he look yucky the other actors that played debbie rowe priscilla presley and elizabeth taylor were pretty good except that the actress that plays liz taylor looked too young and healthy to be playing liz the actress that plays diana ross didnt look at all like her and i couldnt figure out who this woman was until much later on in the moviebr br this movie does a disservice to everyone who is on the side of michael jackson or against michael jackson it doesnt do anything to change anyones opinion as a matter of fact the only opinion anyone will have after watching this movie is oh god this movie really really sucks and where the hell is michael jacksons wonderful music and songs there are none to be found in this movie i love the soundtrack to this movie anyway and ill probably purchase it if i couldbr br on the lighter side though this is a very funny campy movie its a great time waster if you want to watch something light that wont trouble your brain too much ill probably watch it again because it just is so entertainingly bad
