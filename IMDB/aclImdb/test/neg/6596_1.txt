okay first of all i missed like the first 15 minutes of the movie so i missed credits and stuff so when i finally got to it i was like who the hell is this dude i found out it was flex like hours after watching the movie br br flex didnt look like michael jackson not one bit he couldnt dance like him or move like him the only thing he almost had was the voice people commented on elizabeth taylor but i cant really comment on that because i dont know much about her br br the whole movie was like just plain wack the dialogue sucked the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked the soundtrack sucked the acting sucked yes even flexim so upset about it though i didnt want it to suck im so sad that flex got told he can get away with it but the whole thing looked like dressup you know its like nobody looked like they were supposed to except for joseph jackson br br the concert sequences just sucked im sorry but flex just cant dance like michael i mean like what the hell was vh1 thinking the makeup didnt even match like the time of whatever michael was going through for example in the movie he was still dark when neverland got raided the first time around in real life mj was white as hell there was some sort of stupid delay in his skin discoloring br br the movie wasnt boring well for me it wasnt it wasnt really anything i was just so upset about everything that was wrong with it i wanted to see how it turned out and if flex could redeem himself he didnt really the only part i found like a bit interesting was the whole lisa marie thing when they fell in love that was nice but i had to turn my face away when they kissed heh and only two parts made me collapse with laughter the first time was when they cut from michael with short hair you know the thriller era to michael with long flowing hair from the dangerous era and he was still black that was funny the second time i laughed was when they showed all of the posters and memorabilia of michael but they had flexs face instead it was so funny br br overall this movie was cheap trash it was simply two hours of dressup and could have been so much better but no vh1 is cheap watch if you want but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it i came out of it feeling angry and when i found out it was flex i just started to feel so bad sowatch if you want
