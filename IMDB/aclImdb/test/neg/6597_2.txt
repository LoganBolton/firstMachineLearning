even though i sat and watched the whole thingi must say it was not goodit was all over the placewith big chunks of information missing about how things developed and even inaccurate at some bits tooif you know nothing about michael  you wont understand a thingyou have to rely on your current knowledge of the man in order for some bits to make senseacting was a bit dramatic flex alexander looked nothing like michael which was a put off for me and towards the end he literally looked greysaying that portraying michael as somewhat naive but highly positive gentle and loving individual was okay even though they still made a fool out of him time to timeif you want to watch mjs life story check out an american dream it is much better but the only thing is it will cover up to bad era i have no doubt that they will eventually make a big budget movie of mjs life story cos michael you rock
