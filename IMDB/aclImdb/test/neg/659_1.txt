the cheesiest movie ive ever seen not scary just bad 1st movie made by the wwe and trust methe only person this movie might appeal to is wrestling fans it has terrible acting and the worst directing ive seen yeti found myself laughing at the storyline and bad actors i saw that the wwe people tried really hard to put a lot of the wrestling moves in the kills and several camera effects i think they copied a lot from silent hill this movies not engaging either so if you do see it youre gonna find yourself tuning out because of its lack of suspense the endings the worst no matter what youll come out wanting your money back
