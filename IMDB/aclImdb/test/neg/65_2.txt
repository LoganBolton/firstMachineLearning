i watched this movie purely for the setting it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of the plot was predictable the acting was mediorcre at best the scares were all grossouts not true scaresbr br i dont remember much of the plot and i think thats because there wasnt much of one to remember they didnt even use the hotel to its fullest potentialthe beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula at low tide you can walk almost 14 mile into the bay which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracksbr br the best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action and im using that term looslyscenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings
