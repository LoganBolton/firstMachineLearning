usually when a television biopic is released on a celebrity its at the very least campy ie cybill shepherd as martha stewart lauren bacall as doris duke this is the most horrendous cheap and boring television movie ever made if vh1 is going to make a television film they have got to spend a little more money on them flex alexanderthough gifted with the michael voiceis not a great dancer does not resemble michael one bit and does not even have his mannerisms down vh1 would have done better by hiring an actual impersonator that way when see michael go into get plastic surgery he doesnt actually come out looking exactly the same why should we be taken aback at the shrinking of michaels nose when its exactly the same size as in the beginning of the film the woman playing elizabeth taylor cannot act and looks nothing like her and dont even get me started on the woman as janet jackson terrible script and a severe case of miscasting needs to keep vh1 from producing any more movies flex alexander would have made a much better jermaine jackson rather than michael costumes trashy ripoffs neverland spliced together footage from news docs dont bother with this oneits not even remotely worth it the one good piece of castingthe actor portraying joseph jackson and maybe the actress as lisa marie presley though she should have been more tomboy than girlie girl
