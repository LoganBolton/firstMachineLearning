there are three main problems with the film or rather there are three reasons why it isnt even a contender worthy of more serious considerationbr br firstly and this was always going to be true its not nearly as good as the books however at least we could have expected to reflect some of the sapkowskis wit or depthbr br secondly we have the production fantasy movies are in my opinion the hardest to produce well everything from the props through costumes scenery stunts and especially cgi is substandardbr br finally and this is many be very subjective i just cant quite take the acting seriously i wasnt brought up in poland so i cant really judge it may me my lack of familiarity with films in polish all the same the lines seem very amateurishly delivered the casting could be better as wellbr br in summation the only possible redeeming feature of this film is the remainder of the plot shining through not unlike a diamond ring on a rotting cadaverbr br on a separate note i heard that the books are coming out in english i havent seen them yet but i cant imagine how one would even begin to translate them i would ask the englishspeaking reader to bare this in mind when judging the book
