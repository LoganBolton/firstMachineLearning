the movie is simply horrible 210 although actors are trying their best well sometimes that isnt much special effects are let me put it this way it would be better if there werent anybr br the script is based on sapkowskis prose so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie sadly its the opposite there is nothing left of the original atmosphere and its all very chaotic maybe they just had too much material to show in 2h timebr br anyway if you would like to see this film i would recommend you to look for the tv series same title same actors even the plot stays the same that was made in the same time the movie did it is so much better 910 and the story there actually make sense
