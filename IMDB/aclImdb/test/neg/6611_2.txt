when just days away before the films premiere its screenwriter backs out of the project and demands his name to be removed from the credits you know that this does not bode well br br the books on which wiedzmin is based on have great potential for a vivacious fantasy film  geralt de rivia is a witcher his sole purpose is to destroy the monsters that plague the world but not everything monstrouslooking is evil and not everything fair is good but all that didnt matter when a polish film crew with a low budget and no or little appreciation for sapkowskis work decided to make a 13part miniseries out of it the twohour film is a byproduct of their actions to maximize the profits br br its not hard to point out in this case what makes people label this film as bad plot incoherent thanks to cramming it with too many stories acting below average with exception of zebrowski dialogues bland editing choppy special effects unbearable and choreography poor add up to the films overall bad experience only the soundtrack done by grzegorz ciechowski brings out the beauty of the world of wiedzmin which was never brought to the screen even polands grandiose flora and fauna where part of the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe was shot a crucial element in almost any fantasy film were not used up to their full potential the more i think about this dead loss the more im running out of words at least its a comfort to know that marek brodzki the director of wiedzmin has directed only one film ever since in addition in germany br br for now were left with topnotch fantasy stories and a fantastic computer rpg released in 2007 referring to the wiedzmin books but im sure that one day justice will be done for the wiedzmin saga and well be treated with an equally good film adaptation soon enough
