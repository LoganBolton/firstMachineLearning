this movie is trash from the word go first it gives an account of a season that took place 16 years ago who cares this movie had about as much depth as a bottle cap it makes a complex person like bob knight into a cartoon characterbr br swearing doesnt bother me but im still amazed that espn showed a movie with more cursing than a kevin smith movie on a basic cable channel the fword was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial breakbr br this movie was terrible and anyone associated with it should be embarrassed i rate this on the same level as jaws iv  the revenge and everybody wins2 movies that are in the crapfest hall of fame
