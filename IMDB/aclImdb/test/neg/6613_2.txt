this movie probably seemed like a great idea in preproduction lets make a movie about one of the greatest and most controversial athletic coaches of the modern era and lets cast brian dennehey as coach bobby knight thats where this movie went terribly wrong why cast an actor who bears no semblance of the man hes portraying and then why let this actor turn his character into not coach knight but brian dennehey in a red sweater as i sat watching this movie on espn i didnt find myself believing this man was actually coach knight he didnt look like him talk like him act like him or even walk like him i could not get past this fact and thusly i could not enjoy the movie when paul newman and robert redford were cast as the outlaws butch cassidy and the sundance kid we didnt care if they were accurate historical models of their true characters because most of us had never even heard of these men until we saw the movie but with someone as visible in todays media as coach knight you have to do better when anthony hopkins was cast as nixon it was the same situation but anthony hopkins made us believe he in fact was nixon dennehey didnt even try what might have been a great movie was turned sour by this besides the fact that this movie tried to do for the fourletter word what saving private ryan did for dismemberment it stunk too little of the real coach knight and too much profanity for the sake of shock value turned this movie into a season to turn off halfway through the broadcast the only good thing about this is that it was television movie i didnt have to waste my hardearned money on this piece of trash
