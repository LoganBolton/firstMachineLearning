season on the brink is one of my favorite books of all time  an insightful unflinching look at bob knight and his indiana hoosiers and dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors of all time so i made a point of watching this adaptationbr br it disappointed on every level dennehys performance was less than inspired and he seemed unprepared to play knight  like he had accepted the role just prior to filming the rest of the cast isnt much betterbr br and it was obvious that this was espns first movie it was poorly directed poorly filmed and the lack of budget was obvious anytime games were being simulated smaller gyms empty seats etc skip this adaptation and read the book  it holds up well to this day
