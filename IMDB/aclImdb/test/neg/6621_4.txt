before i sat down and watched this film on hbo i wasnt expecting nothing but a few laughs here and there and all together a stupid and common plot well thats exactly what i got out of it except that i was somewhat satisfied at the end of the movie i wasnt expecting it to be i thought it was just going to be another hour and a half that i had on my hands to waste well it was but still it was somewhat worth it the whole plot was very stupid cheap acting and some of the lines were very very dumb otherwise than that it still had its funny moments even though not manybr br all in all if youre going to rent this dont watch it on television i gave it a 4 i was generous because it made me laugh but yet it was still pretty stupid
