this should not have been made into a movie everything about it was idiotic and i dont think i laughed even once there were bits and pieces that were okay i guess but thats about it a lot of parts were strikingly similar to a lot of other movies which did them a hell of a lot better there were some famous actorsactresses in this but no one did a good job they mustve just not cared this is one of those movies that tries to have a cute ending but it was so idiotic that it literally had no redeeming values carrot top is probably the worst comedian out there right now do yourself a favor and steer clear of this onebr br final decisionsbr br movies  nooooobr br purchase dvd  absolutely notbr br rental  only if youve seen everything else and have a free coupon but even then its still not worth your while
