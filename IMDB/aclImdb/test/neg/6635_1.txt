yes the votes are in this film may very well be the plan 9 from outer space for our generation but whereas ed woods film for all its flaws retains a certain charm despite it all this film defines the word charmless to the nth degree in fact id suggest to the editors of the oxford english dictionary to cite this movie as a key example defining the that word in the next update to the dictionarybr br carrot top is a performer of such abysmal ability that normally rational people that i know once they hear his name become homicidal maniacs dedicated to wanting to kill mr top as soon as possible indeed if one goes to amazoncom and look at customer reviews for carrot tops movie and other performance dvd one will find several that could be construed as death threats to mr topbr br one other curious fact about this film i recall that mike nelson the head writer for mst 3000 in his book mikes mega cheese about movies good and bad said he saw this film and shortly afterwords couldnt recall a thing about it including the title obviously mike was suffering a classic reaction to trauma viewing this atrocity was so soul numbing mike nelson had to block it from his mind evidently in a later chapter in his book mike nelson had recovered his memeory of this film from the review he offers mike nelson was definitely not grateful for the recovered memorybr br the only comment i offer about the film and it is not a spoiler its simply gods honest truth its not funny none of it is not even a nanosecond of it is funny
