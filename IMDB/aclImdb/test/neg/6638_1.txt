chairman of the board is a ridiculously stupid film from the popular comic carrot top also seen on the 1800collect commercials he plays a surfing inventor who comes upon a man who has a flat tire top helps him out and a few days later discovers the guys died and has given his company to the comedian even if someone else was in carrot tops role it still would have been bad the jokes which are constantly rigged throughout are terrible and the idea of a romantic plot twist should have been discarded do not watch
