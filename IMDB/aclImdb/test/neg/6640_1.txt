so i turned on hbo which i just got thinking that it would have some quality movies and i saw this carrot top is so unfunny its nauseating to watch ive seen unfunny movies before but i think i find this one so impossible to watch because carrot top seems to think hes hilarious watching this movie is really like watching a movie designed for 5 year olds with crazy over the top overreactions replete with ultra stupid jokes that only a 4 year old would appreciatebr br what is amazing is how some other talented actors actually signed on for this project such as larry miller and m emmet walsh if youve ever seen carrot tops absolutely horrible mci commercials or whatever they were then this is more of the same just worse its a slapstick fest that is a waste of a high budget that could have done something saved homeless people anything but this im not sure its in the bottom 50 of all time but for the 10 million spent its a disgrace
