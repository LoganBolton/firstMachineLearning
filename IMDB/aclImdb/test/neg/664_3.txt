another movie with a star of a wrestling so far i have noticedwrestlers cant act on the movie screen this movie is no exceptionbr br the action is dreadful it makes you laugh at what they say and they cant be serious they try to act scared but they fail and look stupid the acting is horrible possibly from the bad directorbr br the plot was stupidjust some people get placed in a hotel because theyre criminals and they get randomly killed off the movie is stupid all the way through making it one of the worst i have ever seenbr br the only think and this is why i give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way jacob goodnight dies the pole through the head and the stories of him plunging was awesomebr br overall this is a really horrible movie and you definitely shouldnt waste your time with it
