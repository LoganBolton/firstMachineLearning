i really wanted to see this film  i thought the plot was really unique and intriguing a cop andy garcia has a son who is dying and needs bone marrow replacement in order to live the only match is a convicted serial killer who escapes from jail to save his son he has to track down the killerbr br michael keaton plays the convict in one of many disappointing aspects of the film keaton is a great actor at times but here he is pretty much boring its overthetop to the point where you just stop caringbr br garcia is better but tries too hard for a film that isnt up to par barbet schroeder at one time such a promising director with films like barfly that amounted to pretty much nothing in the american market directs well enough  i honestly thought the script was the culprit hereits just a big messbr br the film ultimately wastes a lot of good material good actors and a good director  all because of a faulty script what should have been a tense and thoughtprovoking film is just a hollywood action dud
