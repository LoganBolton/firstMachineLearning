this movie desperate measures was im not quite sure how to even put it into words was this supposed to be a comedy i couldnt stop laughing at how absolutely ridiculous it was i love michael keaton and i cannot actually comprehend that he did this they did a good job at keeping my attention because i couldnt wait to see how much more ridiculous it was going to get minute by minute i actually just registered on this site so that i could get this out i dont review movies i dont have time for this but i cannot let this go knowing i havent done my civil duty by letting people those who have an iq of 85 and above know that this is no actionthriller it is honest to goodness funny you people that actually got thrills off of this scare me go watch a good movie like million dollar baby clint eastwoods acting is not superb but i was balling at the end exercise your brain america
