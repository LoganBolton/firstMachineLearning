its a shame that someone so idolised by many kids as well as parents should demean himself in appearing in this exploitative bandwagonjumping tripe i often wonder if mr wisdom in his later years looked back at his excuse for a film with any pride at least sally geeson had the decency to retire to doing something worthwhile after appearing in this low budget rubbish a cameo by some long forgotten pop called the pretty things cannot rescue the film from its awfulness if you want 60s nostalgia invest in here we go round the mulberry bush instead starring barry evans and sallys sister judy instead
