the first official release of world wrestling entertainments film division is a pretty basic horrorslasher movie called see no evil starring kane one of their big men wrestlers known for having an intimidating presence hardhitting moves and one of the most convoluted backstories in wrestling and lets not pull any punches here while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time mostly by wwe it goes without saying that after having seen this movie i can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all timebr br see no evil sees a bunch of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up of course a monstrous murderer played by kane also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes without giving away too much of the movie plot this film has all the semblance and structure of an early1980s slasher flick with most of the clich√©s intact but without any of the scares that those films accompany and thats sort of the main problem with see no evil it tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next its too generic to be scarybr br the movies gory no doubt but its only there for the effect the dark atmosphere instilled in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially but as you get towards the end it somehow feels out of place and gets tiresome quickly the death scenes dont come off as gory and horrific as much as they do laughable although some of them are pretty inventivebr br and the acting in this movie is pretty bad too as the main characters arent developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get axed some cant even portray fear properly they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote so when they die it only adds to the comedy because you dont care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of starfleet redshirts to the monster kanebr br as for kane he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone theres no doubt in my mind that kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre he has the look and presence for it he just needs better material specifically a script that isnt written by someone who writes wrestling shows to work withbr br now despite what may seem like a harsh review i actually enjoyed the film its one of those laughably bad movies that you cant help but sit down and enjoy my main gripe with the film again is that its simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesnt have any frightening or shock moments i enjoyed it but i enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie if that happens because it was supposed to be that way the movie would have been rated higher but it didnt it got laughs because its a bmovie and it doesnt help that the directors previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos not exactly overcomplicated things to direct anyway nonetheless i enjoyed it tremendouslybr br if you dont mind a fun bmovie or funny horror film id highly recommend see no evil if you are a true enthusiast of the genre id wait until the dvd comes out before checking it out everyone else should probably go watch something else
