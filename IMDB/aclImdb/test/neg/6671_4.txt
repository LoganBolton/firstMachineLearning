norman wisdoms final starring vehicle was a departure from his previous outings  bringing his accidentprone milquetoast uptodate this being a product of the swinging sixties the end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which mixes the stars typical slapstick and sentimentality with mild sexuality and even milder satire the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a banking conference falling for teenager sally geeson who doesnt mind getting involved with him but doesnt take their relationship all that seriously either sarah atkinson appears as geesons friend who warns norman of her fickle characterbr br the film is nowhere near as bad as leonard maltins bomb rating would have it and if anything is interesting for its treatment of midlife crisis being in many ways similar to hoffman 1970 and 10 1979  both of which incidentally ive only just watched towards the end norman even tries to bring his wife round to his new way of thinking the pretty things appear as themselves performing a number of good tunes in a nightclub and norm himself sings the catchy title track
