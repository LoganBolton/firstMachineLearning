well acted yes very well i must say even though i dont speak chezck nice cinematography but the script is lame really lame a predictable soap opera in which you know exactly everything that is going to happen ok maybe the ending isnt as predictable but is it any good it is one of those films that you have the feeling that have seen already and forget about the day afterbr br i just got a note from imdb saying that my comment was not long enough thats really sad because i have no idea of what else to say about this movie which actually says a a lot about it dont you think the thing is it has no soul and no originality compare this movie with barrio or riff raff shot more than ten years ago or the extraordinary recently shot the child its sad to see that this is a much worse film
