unlike what one reviewer said this is not a ripoff of magnum force in that one lieutenant hal holbrook put together his own little squad from academy rookies to dispatch repeat offenders in extreme justice this operation has the sanction from the higher ups of the lapd just how far they sanction the exact methods used is open to question br br this special investigations squad seems to be quite the haven for the misfits of the lapd those that have forgotten their first duty is protection and service which is why scott glenn thinks lou diamond phillips a detective with more than his share of beefs with internal affairs for excessive use of force is perfect for the squadbr br what should have sent him running from phillips is the fact hes got a nice livein relationship with a reporter chelsea field that one certainly threw me in this film youd think that lou would be the last guy hed try to recruit for his teambr br and what his team is is a death squad they target perpetrators follow them and wait to catch them in the act then its open seasonbr br extreme justice went very overboard in trying to make a point there sure would have been no harm in waiting for a gang of bank robbers to finish the robbery and taking them down outside no civilians got hurt when the citizens of coffeyville did that to the daltons or waiting until three rapists finish the job before moving in thats what were asked to believe herebr br and frankly i couldnt buy it a lot of good players get really wasted in this one
