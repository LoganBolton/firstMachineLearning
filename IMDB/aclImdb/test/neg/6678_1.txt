ordinarily i wouldnt waste the time on reviewing a film like human pork chop the 2001 version not to be confused with the earlier film of the same title which is probably better known in the west as the untold story but since the reviews already here are quite vague as to what it actually consists of i figured id best post something more detailed so as no one actually gets tempted as i was into buying it because of the films mystique i honestly would just say stay awaybr br  major spoilers are contained below br br human pork chop i was expecting to be like a chinese interpretation of the popular japanese guinea pig films anyone whos watched enough of that series can see where its makers are coming from theres a strong sense of humour running throughout it  you cant watch the ludicrous he never dies without laughing and the making of guinea pig is a fabulous turning of the whole thing on its head proving it was just made with some glee by fairly good natured gorehounds all the gp films have a punk rock diy shotonvideo aesthetic occasional flashes of genuine artistry mermaid in a manhole an angry political agenda and a warped deranged zeal that sets them in a league of their ownbr br human pork chop has none of the abovebr br its shot on 35mm film with disarmingly good production values its 90 gruelling minutes long and its utterly devoid of anything redeeming the plot tells in flashback at a police interviewing of the suspects of the systematic torture death and eventual dismemberment of grace a heroinaddicted streetwalker who is kidnapped and brutalised by her pimp and his henchmen when she steals money from himbr br despite its fleeting attempts at being a morality play the film possesses a detached inhumane feel to it and one cant help but dwell on the mindsets of those behind it although it halfheartedly paints grace as an innocent victim the meanspirited nature of its screenplay and the protagonists constant vicious dialogue veers towards a shocking utterly unwelcome she deserves it point of view which makes the whole thing almost impossible to watch far more time is spent detailing graces degradation and when her captors are eventually deemed guilty and jailed it seems like a hurried afterthought on behalf of the writers whove long since stopped caring lessbr br what makes it boggling as to why anyone would want to watch such a film is that even the kind of people who do really get off on mindless sex and violence in the movies would be severely missing out the torture is just a continuous stream of kickings slappings verbal abuse psychological abuse and then increasingly bizarre displays of power on behalf of the captors use graces heroin addiction to make her do their bidding and when i say that dont get me wrong incidentally unlike guinea pig with its frequent barrage of nudity that gives an almost teenage feel of mocktitillation to the proceedings in spite of the ultraviolence human pork chop has no such sexual overtones there isnt any actual nudity in the film and the violence is performed purely out of malice by the odious protagonists who early in the film are seen stuffing a dog into a bag and banging it against a brick wall  dont worry not real just a cheap special effectbr br the only actual bloodshed in the film is towards the end when they dismember graces body and boil the bones all very poor special fx nowhere near guinea pig level and by that stage youll probably be already feeling too miserable and sick to even care whats going onbr br the film is depressingly bleak and uncompromising along a similar line to buddy giovinazzos combat shock and i guess could even be compared at a push both movies deal with the gradual physical decline of an individual who exists in a nightmarish environment devoid of any social or morally redeemable characters and both movies climax in a particularly visceral manner with the individuals inevitable inescapable doombr br in fairness neither glamourises its violence whereas guinea pig could easily be accused of this but one cant help but wonder where the place is for a film like this it fails to many any real points in its frank presentation of such brutality and with a leadenpace a virtually nonexistent plot line and the aforementioned lack of any entertainment value i just cant understand what would encourage anyone to watch something like this i only made it to the end purely for the purpose of being able to review it fairly which i hope ive now donebr br overall score 0 of of 10 welcome to the bottom of the barrel
