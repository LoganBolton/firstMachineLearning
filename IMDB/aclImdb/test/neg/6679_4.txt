star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning br br as a boy mark goddard c thomas howell sat powerless as his family including his hero cop father jeff fahey were brutally murdered by vicious criminals hed tried to bring down with an inner desire to punish wrongdoers festering in him as he grew up as a result of this mark employs tough means when bringing the suspects hes chasing down in and gets into a lot of trouble with his superiors because of this but then he learns of justice incorporated a secret group of men and women lead by a mysterious man ed lauter who serve to dish out punishment that fits the crime outside the lawbut then things get out of hand and getting out alive might be harder than he thoughtbr br the sweeper gets into problems from the offset because weve seen this exact same plot done before and better in films like the star chamber with michael douglas and magnum force with clint eastwood the title doesnt make any sense either but we also have to contend with the movies utter ludicrousness including a scene where a daughters headphone manages to drown out the sound of her family being slaughtered a finale involving a chase with a bad guy that starts on the freeway and ends on a wright brothers plane as well as some of the most ridiculous acting ever put on screen and a very clich√©d pretentious script but theres some cool action sequences here and there and the movies unintentional laughs factor certainly keeps it alive with a pulse
