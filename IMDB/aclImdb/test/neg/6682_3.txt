this was a first feature for clinton i was there while he shot this mess back in adelaide around 98br br although i wasnt involved directly in the production i was witness to the typically delusional behavior post set that went down the parties the drugs the illusionary glamor really an example of what not to do when making a film but also a byproduct of young talented people getting caught up in classic ideologies of fame  worldly positionbr br i like clinton we had a curious friendship he deserves to have another crack with a more mature scriptthere the problems lay and im sure a much better job will be done if theres a next time round because frankly he certainly didnt do himself any favours with this on his cv and neither did the castbut hey it was a paying job in country where actors regularly starve to deathbr br in summary fascinating to watch the making of basically not so much fun to experience alas
