first the recent campaigning of this movie is a huge hoax judging from the cover youd think this was some kind of scandal movie about kylie playing a character having sex taking drugs and whatever this is just a cheap marketscheme shes barely in it and does neither of the things the marketing here is unbelievable and im surprised the filmmakers hasnt objected br br the movie itself was to me a huge disappointment it seemed like a sunset beach episode directed sloppyhanded by a teenage quentin tarantino and thats not meant as a compliment mind you br br i think the weakness of the movie first of all is the story it seems to be about nothing just about cool teenagers tripping around living on the edge the characters themselves does have some personality though but the movie doesnt use its potential as said theres no story of any substance here it seems to elaborate too much on cool dialog and ends up looking like a colorful mtv ad it definitely has that feeling br br still though i guess some people might enjoy it but id say theres far better movies like this around
