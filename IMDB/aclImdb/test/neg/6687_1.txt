seriously i couldnt find anything that constituted a rational human thought in this movie for some reason the writer decided to have a bunch of actors in random places grunting groveling and yelling like cromagnon bipeds i understand that this was about gymnastics but seriously whats with all the roaring and human bleating  i also saw at least five actors with overactive terrets syndrome and stage 10 syphilisbr br although this movie has actual human acrobatics i must say it is surprising that you can make a movie like this without having any intelligible form of human speech patterns this is truly a milestone in the history of filmmaking because there was no conscious decision to make the characters express anything more than a timely urrrrr  or rfff  soundbr br incredible
