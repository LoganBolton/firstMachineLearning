stars hayden pantierrebr br there have been so many movies that have this exact same plot and this one is just a poor rehashing of it populer white girl moves to ethnic school doesnt fit in soon becomes accepted originality is nonexistent in this and neither are the laughs it uses so many old poorly executed jokes its annoying i dont know why they think its a good idea to make made for video sequels to mediocre films but it isnt with that said the positives in this are that all the people in it are fairly competent actors and actressesbr br my rating  out of  pg13 for language and sexual humor
