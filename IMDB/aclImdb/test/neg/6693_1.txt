from all the rave reviews we couldnt wait to see this show we love wacky humor and creative material especially from australia and new zealandbr br i admit this may not be a fair review since we only saw the first 15 minutes but we just couldnt bear any more misery  it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes weve ever experienced watching a tv show  it felt like 15 hours the songs may be mildly interesting by themselves but inserted for an interminable 3 minutes each in the middle of a story scene just doesnt workbr br were trying hard now to erase the memory if you want some wonderful downunder humor in a delightful and engaging film see the dish instead
