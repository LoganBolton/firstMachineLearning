this show is perhaps one of the most boring most unfunny shows ive ever seen while the humour was subtle and im all for the subtle humour the jokes just werent funnybr br the show is about two kiwis in their midthirties living in new york trying to start their music careersbr br i saw the one episode where brett leaves the other kiwi behind during a mugging okay the plot idea has potential but i got the feeling that half the episode was just filler and the other half was actually important to the storybr br what i mean is they kept on explaining how the one who was left behind felt betrayed and had a lot of mistrust for the other guy ive got one piece of advice for the writers mention it once for the idiots who cant figure it out by the way hes acting and move onbr br and i found the characters were annoying the character who left the other behind brett came across as being overly innocent and naive the one left behind walked around talking in this monotone and robotic voicebr br a third character who was the band manager was obviously incompetent but he was the one character that i liked hes also the one that earned the show a onestar ratingbr br all in all a show i have no intention of ever watching again
