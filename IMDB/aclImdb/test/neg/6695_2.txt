br br i tuned into this movie not because i am a fan of us high school basketball in fact i only rarely watch nba games but rather because i am a fan of gene hackman who usually manages to bring an impressive depth to his performances in this case however i was sorely disappointed this was not one of the bright shining stars of hackmans careerbr br in fairness to him he didnt have a lot to work with as norman dale the new coach of a small town high school basketball team in indiana he wasnt called on to do much acting basically his performance consisted of pacing up and down basketball sidelines ranting at the referees i didnt find him particularly believable in the role to be honest i also was unimpressed with the requisite romance between dale and myra fleener barbara hershey quite honestly there was absolutely no chemistry between hackman and hershey the romance never captured my attention and neither did the basketball action which was altogether too predictablebr br there were far too many problems with this movie to make it worthwhile i never did understand the depth of the sheer hatred that so many of the townsfolk had for dale almost from before the time he arrived the character development was poor and the story itself was poorly developed too much basketball and not enough human interaction in my opinion how many shots of kids shooting baskets do we need to see to get the point that this is a basketball movie there was no suspense is it even possible to doubt that hickory is going to win the big one i realize that this is based on a true story but i guess it proves that not every true story should be a movie quite frankly it just wasnt a very interesting movie definitely a movie gene hackman would like to forgetbr br no better than a 210 in my opinion
