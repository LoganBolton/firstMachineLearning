badland is one of the worst movies i ever seen most of the time this is fine and i can go on with my life but i feel the need to warn others in this case as a veteran of the iraq war i feel it necessary to say that the story plot acting and depiction of what soldiers go through upon returning home was pure garbage it was as if the directorwriterwhoever latched on to whatever cliché about returning soldiers and ran with it and ran with it and ran with itnot to mention i would imagine there was absolutely no research put into this film the marine uniform looked like it was fresh off a surplus store shelf and was a pattern not used since the first iraq war i wont go on forever this is a horrible movie if you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers there are much better alternatives i recommend going to your local library
