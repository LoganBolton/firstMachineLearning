notwithstanding that the house of adam is meant to be a mainstream gay movie that anthony john shaw who is gay curious and a major cutiehunk and adam jared cadwell who is openly gay and a close second in looks that there is a whole minute of wonderful convincing and naked lovemaking sorry no frontal between anthony and adam 41 minutes into the movie that alone may be sufficient for many of us  notwithstanding all that to which i give a thumbs up the house of adam is a horrible movie by most any other movie making standard a big thumbs downbr br shaws and cadwells acting abilities are either sophomoric or else truly suffer from the bad script direction and editing or rather the lack thereof their lovemaking scene is nevertheless convincing and may have more to do with their really being into each other considering the rest of their scripting and actingbr br writerdirector jorge amers bonus feature selfcongratulation as to his movie making skills is off the wallbr br so the script and lack thereof is a thumbs down overall the acting is thumbs down with just the slightest exception for shaw and cadwell alexis karriker as nina might have been the best except for the limitations expressed above far and away the absolute worst and insufferable acting was by thomas michael kappier as albert ross anthonys father having not even of elementary school acting quality he truly represents a colossal casting failurebr br the actors playing the new cabin owners are worthy of truly bad acting nominations as wellbr br if only the production editing and post production were as good as the trailer this movie would have been quite something else the trailer presents well put together clips of scenes that drew me into renting the movie in the first place that and the hope that this gaycentered movie was supposedly prominently played and touted at gay film festivalsbr br overall the movie is a big thumbs downbr br is it worth buyingrenting and watching it only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love making scene and a few minutes of semiconvincing dialogue between anthony and adam or if you truly just enjoy watching bad movies
