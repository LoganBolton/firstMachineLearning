simply put i was amazingly disappointed im a huge fan of asian horror and i can watch unoriginality i myself enjoyed the red shoes and phone but this was just poorbr br the movie has a lot of elements that are very highquality the photography is eyecatching the visuals are cool the directing is inspired the acting is pretty good the music is easy on the ears and the cgi is incredible but since this is a horror film we are expected to be scared which just wont happen with this film as with most south korean horrors this is unoriginal almost from beginning to end theres the trademark longhaired vengeful female ghost ominous clumps of thick black hair and puddles of water and near the end a twist that almost but not quite makes sense out of the whole thing the twist is easily one of the best qualities and to the viewers irritation when the film isnt recycling at times so exact that it could easily be dubbed plagiarized imagery from other movies its making you jump a lot and by jumps i dont mean things jumping out or anything just very loud noises and screeches in the soundtrack used to make the audience jump six feet in the air theres even a few madeyoujump moments that are simply infuriating and when it is not rippingoff other movies its boring and hard to sit throughbr br and its a shame because ryeong could have easily been really good and it has everything to make it good but its the annoying overuse of completely predictable loud noises and jump scares that eventually ruin the movie a perfect example of how good it could have been theres a moment when one of out characters is looking at a corpse and without a sound the corpse looks back its wholly predictable but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant and unfortunately thats as scary as the movie got for mebr br admittedly ryeong has a few good features and even a couple jumps that arent as predictable and do work theres a very good and sad backstory used to explain the events and the twist is pretty unpredictable those are the only things that separate the film from any other asian ghosthorror film but the problem with these is even though they do work they have been used before jhorror fans will easily realize the big reveal was inspired by a tale of two sisters and it takes the backstory a good fifty minutes to get goingbr br so in the end ryong really seems like a truly wasted opportunity taekyeong kim hoped that the plot twist and other good features act as diversions so the audience wont notice the huge flaws but he failed and well we noticed everythingbr br my rating 410
