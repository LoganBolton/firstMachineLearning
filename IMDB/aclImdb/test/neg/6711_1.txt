two things are changed from thenfirst of all i am not a kid anymoreand second most of new seagal movies are just terriblethis is on my opinion the worst movie ever made with derailed starred by jean claude van dammethere is no plot in this moviethe plot is just an excuse to shoot some terrible action scenes which are painful to watchi love action moviesbut this is not an action moviethis isnt a moviethis is a group of irritating scenes which are connected in annoying way to kill the viewers love for the action moviesi am sorry but i dont have any respect for anyone who liked this moviehe has a serious intelligence problem theni hope that seagal will make some new good movies in the futuregood luck for him
