lord have mercy why was this film made why did seagal and rising star max ryan agree to be in it the foreigner is so excruciatingly bad in every conceivable way that it boggles the mindbr br the film has an ultracheap look to it like a budget of a couple of bucks was far out of their reach whats worse is that the makers know this and try to make it look slick to compensate the result is a film that just dont look right the fight scenes are so dull and edited discretely to hide the fact that steven seagal is not in good shape anymore none of them are engaging or exciting the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it the easterneurope locations a sly move by the producers to keep the budget down or nonexistent look unpleasant and should not be serving as the backdrop for an action film what actionbr br and what is the deal with the title as far as i could tell everyone in the movie was foreign which one does the title refer tobr br the dvd is in 1851 anamorphic widescreen and in dolby 51 sound neither are remarkable enough to warrant even a single rent the foreigner is not worth one second of your time gotta love that tagline tho if they think they can stop him theyre dead wrong sheesh
