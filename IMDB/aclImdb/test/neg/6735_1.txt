if i could have given this film 010 i would and this is the first film i have wanted to rate so low its worse than awful if i went to see it in the cinema i would want the cinema to pay me for watching it at least minimum wage some of the camera shots were quite effective but a lot were rubbish eg villains reflection in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders sideways from his body seeing is believing several totally pointless killings of innocent civilians 2 murders that made me laugh out loud due to the victims actionsfacial expressions when they were shot i only watched it to the end fast forwarding about 10 mins of the boring pointless dialogue hoping to see seagal in some decent hand to hand combat but there was almost none of that should have known that when at the beginning he threw someone while going down an elevator and it was shown in slow motion with music  end of action scene in one scene we see seagal hand chop someones neck in slow motion which makes it obvious that his hand never even made contact the chief villain keeps coming back to life he gets shot in the chest on 2 separate occasions the 1st time its with a shotgun which blows him out the 2nd3rd floor onto the street to sum up this film is a total waste of time and a total joke it looks very low budget even for seagal the colour is dull and grey i could go on and onjust like this film but i wont watch this film if youve got insomnia its guaranteed to put you to sleep
