i saw that the foreigner was ranked in the bottom 100 movie listings here on imdb so i wasnt expecting much when i tuned into it on the usa channel a week back but i did have hopes belly of the beast which aired a month ago was a mess but it had great scenery and photography and some pretty cool moments scattered throughout so i thought that this movie might have some of the same br br alas this movie fails the standards of basic watchability in almost every way the screenplay comes off as the bastard offspring of a john lecarre novel and a richard ludlum movie but done by people with none of those worthy writers talent for plot and characterization instead what we got is a glum meanspirited nihilistic cryptic mares nest of muddled motives tangled alliances and backshootings and chest shootings and bombings and eviscerations this carries over to the directorial style which relies on hackneyed grainy shotslow motion shots every 10 seconds along with wire work and hyperactive jump cuts these filmic devices that were stale 10 years ago when mtv directors used them for whitesnake videos and the director works them like a punch press hoping to inject some weird arthouse techno thriller coolness into the proceedings br br segal himself is just awful in this he spends the entire film talking in a hoarse throaty halfwhisper and alternating between two expressions looking like he is sucking on a lemon while someone waves a small turd under his nose or looking constipated and hes so chunky and vain about it that he never actually takes off his knee length duster on camera i understand that its hard to keep the girth under control as a male actor ages although denzel washington and paul newman never seemed to have that problem but you deal with it by being honest about it and by growing as an actor not by hiding it with carefully chosen camera angles and floor length robes br br so i cant really tell whats going on and the movie doesnt give me a reason to care about whats going on and the protagonist is completely one dimensional and visually unappealing not a recipe for a good movie experience br br oddly most of the set designs and scenery are atmospheric and striking in fact if you were to freeze the film on almost any given scene that wasnt a closeup of seagal you would be struck by the care and professionalism of the lightingcolors and composition and by how beautiful the eastern european settings are but dressing up a rotten egg as a faberge egg cant make it edible and the proceedings are rotten at heart br br there are cool movies like versus and there are visually striking but emotionally cold movies like underworld and there are paranoia conspiracy thrillers like the bourne identity and its remake with matt damon and then there is this thing which cant make up its mind what it wants to be pretends to be all these things and fails because it has no guts or soul br br this is a movie made by professionals with an actual budget so you cant really put it in the same class as manos killer shrews or hobgoblins but id rather watch all three of those movies backtoback several times than watch the foreigner again even once
