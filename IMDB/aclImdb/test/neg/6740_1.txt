the foreigner is a straighttovideo steven seagal film that was originally intended to be released as a theatrical feature in march 2003 an intention which was reportedly reversed when seagals prior film half past dead tanked at the box office according to some reports the film had a lavish 20 million budget including location shoots in warsaw and paris and was completed as part of the studios obligation to a twopicture deal which was negotiated after the relative success of exit wounds seemed to indicate that seagal still had a solid followingbr br despite the size of their investment sony screen gems probably made the right move in shelving this movie it is nearly incomprehensible what am i saying it is incomprehensible i dont think i understood what was going on at all except in the very broadest termsbr br seagal is employed by a mysterious guy to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious guy other mysterious guys try to stop him other highly mysterious guys try to kill the moderately mysterious guys who try to stop him other really really mysterious guys do especially mysterious stuff all of which which was in fact too mysterious for me to figure out the intended recipients mysterious wife tries to intercept the package before it can be delivered to her husband because he is a selfproclaimed consummate professional who has been hired to deliver the package only into the hands of the husband seagal at first defies the wife then later gets involved in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious guys with unexplained agendas as well as from her husbandbr br many people have mysterious cryptic conversations many people blow each others brains out some guys seem to die more than once while in other scenes gunfights end without a clear view of the result so the audience sees somebody die but is not sure which one of the gunslingers is headed to boot hill allegiances shift often adding further mystery or should i say confusionbr br i dont know who was on whose side or what anybody really wanted and the resolution was as unsatisfying as the exposition at the end of the movie i just sat there thinking thats the end what the br br i couldnt even figure out the credits imdb says that aussie actress kate fischer from sirens was in this film but ill be damned if i know where either she was left on the cutting room floor or she wisely opted out of the project she could have found some activities more beneficial to her career like having unnecessary surgery ripping those pesky insert cards out of magazines or taking some community college courses in animal husbandrybr br seagal used to be a pretty fair handtohand combatant but the action scenes didnt manage to redeem this film at all seagal is in his 50s now and is a very large man so he is reduced to a mimimal level of physical exertion and even during that he is contained in a kneelength coat to hide his inchoate brandoesque girth he might even get a little winded removing the wrappers from candy bars although thats understandable if you estimate just how many of those he must have to eat to maintain his present girthbr br steven seagal seemed to be making a comeback with exit wounds but if his last film was half past dead this one must be pretty close to filling out the other half
