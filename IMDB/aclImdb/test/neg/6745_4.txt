i speak badly of gijtm mostly because i think it lacked something that gi joe had yes it had something that gi joe didnt have like celebrity cameos by don johnson and burgess meredith but i think gi joe the movie lacked the passion for the characters that the gi joe tv series had most of the voice over artists really sounded like they were dead pan and they were going to die at anytime now its a good movie but i wouldnt say that it was the greatest movie in the world imho br br although violence is what gi joe was built on id say that serpentor striking duke in his chest wasnt the very best way for charlie adlers character to go out neither was seeing golobulus remind cobra commander why he was chosen to lead the cobra forces and then being horribly mutated after he failed to deliver what cobrala felt was rightfully theirsbr br it wasnt the best way for the gi joe series to go out but its better than nothing
