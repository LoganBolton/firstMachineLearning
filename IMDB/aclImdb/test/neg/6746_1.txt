i am still trying to figure out what the target of this movie was 1 whether to show how stupid disorganized unprofessional and arrogant the police is i surely could add various adjectives here but i think my point on this is clear 2 whether to show how a twistedminded crook that does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos 3 whether to show if a persistent detective will solve a case just by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again till the criminal answers 4 or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called a moviebr br this was one of those movies that in a way  did not disappoint me from the first 10 minutes i kind of figured out that this movie will not be nominated for the best movie award and surprisingly enough  this was consistent throughout the whole time it was stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how stupidly it will continue and end  and i was not disappointed there either br br was it a complete waist of time yes which raises your question  why did i watch it throughout well i was trying to fall asleep and i thought this was a great candidate for that but unfortunately i had too much coffee before that
