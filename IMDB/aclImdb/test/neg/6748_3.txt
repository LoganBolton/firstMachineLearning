well now heres the thing  for this movie to work youll have to accept the following  a woman whos murdered is alive again at the end of the movie a detective stops interrogating the dead womans fianc√©e because a newspaper reporter asked him not to and that same reporter smitten by a good looking blonde hauled into night court for suspicious behavior winds up getting married to her in exchange for the judge letting her off the hook are you following me on this i cant tell you how many times i paused and rewound the picture to repeat scenes that just didnt make any sense in the end the blonde claudia dell and the reporter richard hemingway remained married but i have no idea how they came to that decision in fact i cant figure out how the film maker came to the decision to make this flick oh i suppose theres some entertainment value here for just the sheer nonsense of it all but it would have been nice if even a couple of the pieces fit still im not ready to add this one to my top ten worst list i think that night club scene with the feathered ladies might have saved it but why was it in the movie i just dont know
