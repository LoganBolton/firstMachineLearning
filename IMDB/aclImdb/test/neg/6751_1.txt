this was pretty bad pedestrian work or worse i dont think it was homophobic just really bad if anything it was really amateurish like when youre 14 and first discover curse words and skin magsbr br the main point of this movie the romance falls really flat i cant help but wonder if the writers ever had any serious relationships before this moviebr br plotting and pacing are horrible going nowhere at all one minute were watching these guys catch cheaters then were at a gay club then were at a date out of nowhere the girl apparently likes comics and then they sleep together none of this feels real like an elementary school production of shakespeare if hamlet was written by a frat boybr br the ending was some kind of creepy over the top revenge fantasy by a loser who got dumped by a girl unnecessary and actually kind of disturbingbr br still you have to watch it whybr br as others noted the directors commentary actually is hilarious  what kind of of professional talks about banging or hooking up with the actresses dialogue sucked relationships lacked chemistry you will be on the floor laughing at this pretentious jackass
