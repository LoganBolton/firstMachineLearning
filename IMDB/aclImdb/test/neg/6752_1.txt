they should make terrorists watch this video as torture and not just for the disturbing final scene in which tying up and beating a woman with mental problems is apparently a source of comedy about a half hour of this would convince even the staunchest fundamentalist to spill the beans rather than sit through even one more minute of this disasterbr br this movie is awful i rented it because a friend said it was hilarious only to find he was talking about the blowhard director doing the commentary rather than the movie itself i guess if you find unrestrained arrogance funny youll like this it apparently is true that he goes on and on about chicks hes banged the most tasteless example being when the lead actress comes on screenbr br actually cj stacy was the only good part of this movie  her charisma shines like a diamond in this horrid dung pile this apparently is the only movie shes done according to imdb i hope she is involved with theatre or indie stuff as i think she has the talent and natural beauty to really be an asset to any production
