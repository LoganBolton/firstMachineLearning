i was completely mislead by the comments on this film mainly by someone saying they saw it at a film festival and loved every minute of it expecting this to be a nice run of the mill american pie style film i was deeply disappointedbr br firstly the camera work is awful i dont think the director knows that cameras can move around scenes rather than stay still and having the actors move close up and far away of their own accordbr br secondly the scenery my god ive seen more furnishings in a birds nest the club was totally unconvincing with around 3 extras dancing in the back ground at any one time the flats were bare and lacked personalitybr br thirdly the actors wow the director obviously went for the typical reaper character set up a wimpy main character with a gruff i dont give a fk character that takes pot shots at the main everything the main character said and did was a chore so much so it made me wincebr br overall the plot the supposedly big revenge theme lasted for about 30 seconds and lacked any real motivation the characters acted irrationally and didnt seem to have any real relationship with anyone else no character had any depth to them they may as well have been cardboard cut outs walking past the static camerabr br a truly horrible piece worse than a first year students 2 minute short for youtube advice to the director change your name and deny any association with the film that will probably sell one copy at a yard sale in ohio
