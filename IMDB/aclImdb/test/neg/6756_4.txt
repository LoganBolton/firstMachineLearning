how many disaster movies can there be before we get tired of them come on we can see them on the discovery channel all day longbr br i agree with the comment that the first part of this movie is just a soap opera the great predictors grandson makes a prediction and everybody starts moaning about how he is ruining the family name the evil motherinlaw convinces the wife to throw him out into the arms of his mistress whom she wants to meet can you believe that the wife wants to approve the new wife at the same time the mistress has someone in love with her that doesnt have a wife but she sends him packingbr br now that the soap opera is over the earthquake appearsbr br the special effects are really good but the dubbing is bad that is why i like subtitled films the actors are all very experienced and have won many awards so you will get to see some of japans best in an oftrepeated storybr br but the soapopera story returns with a kitchy ending
