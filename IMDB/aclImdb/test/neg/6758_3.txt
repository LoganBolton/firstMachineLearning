remnants of an ambushed army unit hook up with a group of cowboys to fight their way through indians on the warpath sounds like it could be an exciting western but this one is dull dull dull it moves like molasses the action scenes are uninspired the acting is pedestrian the writing is flat even the photography isnt very good eastwood in a very early role plays an exconfederate who doesnt like the idea of fighting on the same side as yankees thats about the only remotely interesting situation in the whole movie but eastwood wasnt experienced enough an actor to pull it off and his character comes across as petulant rather than angry or embittered a very ordinary western actually a very lessthanordinary western worth a look if youre a diehard eastwood fan and want to see him at the very beginning of his career otherwise dont bother
