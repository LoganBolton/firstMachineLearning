first of all katherine hepburn is badly miscast as clara she just cant be convincing as the devoted selfless rather smarmy wife that the writers have createdbr br but the real weakness of the film is its shallowness in the face of a potentially great piece of drama schumanns bipolar manicdepressive disorder amounts to oh oh i have a headache and the occasional angry word suicide the word is used but theres no sign of it in domestic scenes and when we see him in the mental hospital hes calm and subdued and smiling and optimistic a superficial treatment and brahms is so upright and bourgeois  no sign of his gruff humour his love of tweaking the noses of the establishment no sign of his tortured attitude toward sex and women resulting from spending his youth playing piano in brothels and was claras long concert career entirely about promoting roberts music or was she in fact a remarkable pianist who wanted a career for herself a female pianist carving out a place for herself in a male world any sort of treatment of the lives of great artists is better than none but this is a standard hollywood middleoftheroad approach particularly disappointing because the real story is so much more dramatic so much more interesting so much more human
