i once heard this movie described as either youll love it or youll hate it from reading some of the other reviews and the ratings i would venture to say that this is true i am placing myself in the hate it crowd i have seen some truly bad movies boring movies and even low budget movies this movie is bad on all three frontsbr br this island earths exeter jeff morrow returns to his scifibmovie roots as dr les minus giant head prosthetic the doctor and his assistant arnie george ohanlon  aka the voice of george jetson along with les girlfriend assistant vera are tracking a meteor this is the crux of the cast and is almost a double date les has vera and arnie has his susie synchro unifying sinometric integrating equitensor  aka the computer lets just say the relationship between george and his robotic maid rosie and his relationship with susie is more believable than the cold clamlike feelings vera has for les and vice versa the object of their all their interest is no ordinary meteor however it is really an alien art nouveauart deco energy storage device which moves around like a 3 legged dog there is also the little alien energy being that controls dr hubbel aka the chief scientist there the alien is obviously and from the getgo malicious and evil is this the kind of science we are handing out no wonder the aliens from the explorers were afraid of us from watching some of these movies we shoot first theres no need for questions afterwards br br the whole movie is synonymous with watching some really boring science experiments like boiling an egg or adding food color to celery its not the fact that this is a low budget scifi movie or thats its a bit cheesy and outdated it is really really really boring the whole movie is about trying to figure out what is going on that is it most of the things we learn about whats going on are through monologues and self dictation now add crappy dialog cardboard acting and cheapsets and you have the makings of an ed wood clone by the way ed has made some really boring movies as well  please avoid the orgy of the dead the dialog  oh the dialog jems such as br br from under 2 miles of ocean br br why not  it came through a billion miles in spacebr br orbr br do you think youll be able to respect a husband whos probably pulled the scientific boner of all time br br this movie is obviously trying to pull a forbidden planet this island earth magnetic monster or in the same light as the outer limits twilight zone namely a low budget scifi movie or tv episode that is compelling enough to get past the technical difficulties and strange situations at the core these movies are enjoyable on some level the story the underlying meaning or the sheer comical nature of the dialog or situations this movie has none of that it is just 90 minutes of boredom i couldnt even enjoy this on a ed wood level i definitely recommend skipping this one and seeing one of the movies i mentioned above instead it is so bad that if my name was dr forrester i would never think of showing this movie to anyone  except frank maybe
