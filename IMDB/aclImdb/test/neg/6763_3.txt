jeff morrow is leslie gaskell barbara laurence is vera hunter and john emory is hubbel eliot along with some ancillary air force personnel and a comic geek they are in charge of a supersecret underground laboratory on the west coast morrow is thrilled when he discovers a meteor passing through the atmosphere but nonplussed when the meteor decides to take a dip in the pacific ocean and emerge as a fantastic machine on the mexican coastbr br nobody knows what this colossal blocky structure is obviously its some kind of carpentered artifact because its all made up of right angles with a kind of bald sphere half visible on topbr br it turns out that the machine dubbed kronos is from some faraway planet and has been sent here to rob the earth of energy you see here on earth we have learned how to convert matter into energy but on kronos planet they have figured out the other half of the equation  how to convert energy into matter and now theyre running out of energy on the other planet are you taking notes on this goodbr br maybe youll be able to fill me in on some of the scientific questions raised by kronos mission for instance if kronos builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa why dont they just convert a little of their own spare matter into energy instead of sending elaborate machines to earth to extinguish las lights but its doubtful the writers could explain it either reversing the polarities of two antenna is described as an anthropic conversion which means a towardshuman change which doesnt make sense but it doesnt seem that any of the science makes sense for that matter the diagram that morrow draws on the board has the current going in the wrong direction from positive to negativebr br theres a problem with kronos locomotion too it marches along the coast threatening populated areas read southern california but it has no joints in its two or three legs these stumps just thump slowly up and down squashing some people the film doesnt make much of these squashed people theyre shown as mexican peasants so maybe they dont count for too much the usaf also drops a hydrogen bomb on kronos  while its in mexico mind you nobody raises an eyebrowbr br not much acting is called for and not much is given jeff morrow has a distinct and resonant voice great for radio or for tv voice overs his face is less expressive he has only one expression no matter what the situation is  a tight smile as if hes having his picture taken at the universal studios tour barbara laurence had a fine golden quality when she made street with no name a few years earlier she was a slender seventeenyearold as richard widmarks wife here her grooming and demeanor reduce her to the level of bmovie actress though shes still beautiful its always good to see morris ankrum in one of these movies hes made so many i get them mixed upbr br on the whole the film comes across as flat im afraid there are some nice shots of a b47 in flight though the sets reveal a lowbudget enterprise thats not necessarily bad in itself but theres nothing to make up for the barren settings little tension in the script no directorial display and little effort put into the performancesbr br you might get a kick out of it  a relaxed high  because this is distinctly unchallenging its just that there are so many better films of the genre out there
