some nameless aliens off on a distant ship from a distant planet have sent the giant robot kronos to rob the world of its energy theyve got a prototype clanking around mexico for openers and if he proves successful more will be sent it would certainly take a lot of time for just this one kronos to perform that taskbr br for reasons i cant explain the aliens first capture the mind of leading scientist john emery who telepathically directs kronos to his first targets since emery is killed off later and the monster seems to function well enough without emery as a controller why the aliens needed him in the first place is a bit bizarrebr br in any event scientists jeff morrow barbara lawrence and george ohanlon who work under emery arent fooled a bit about his nature and of course they come up with a plan to deal with the raging metal giantbr br kronos is a perfect film for the fifties the bad guys are never seen theyre just out there looking to undermine mankind its a perfect film for the cold war and jeff morrow assures us well be ready for them in the futurebr br the players look like theyre having a grand old time mouthing as many clich√©d lines the writers could put in the script i get the impression that kronos is the kind of film ed wood might have done on a bigger budget with a bit more care
