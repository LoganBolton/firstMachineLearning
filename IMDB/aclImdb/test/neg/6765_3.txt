we chose to see this movie as an alternative to the polar express showing at our local imax theater what a waste of time and money first it is not cute the snowman at times looked demonic other times he was simply a zombie he showed no expression or emotions most of the time and his hollow blue eyes were just creepybr br secondly santa states in the beginning its a movie about the spirit of giving santa and a snowman declaring war on each other is a movie about giving im all for a little parody but this just wasnt funny or entertainingbr br the idea that the snowmans flute is his voice is different too bad you never see or hear the snowman play his flutenot even a thank you to santabr br the only funny parts of the movie were the outtakes at the end of the film too bad they didnt use them in the movie it would have been better
