apparently recut episodes from the gangbusters tv show on the big screen while this was frequently done in the 50s and 60s because people didnt have a tv or a color tv and producers wanted an increased return on their investment big screen ticket sales or if it went to the small screen resale of a series that isnt in syndication the results were usually less then the sum of their parts the only time ive ever seen it work were where multipart stories were put together ala rocky jones or man from uncle or in the case of horror anthology the veil and 13 demon street here the effect is to have stories of american criminals in the 20s and 30s dillinger pretty boy floyd bonnie and clyde etcintercut with each other as a narrator talks about how the fbi hunted them down its a weird concoction that doesnt quite work because its clear that there are things here that dont belong together more than once i looked at the tv oddly because things didnt seem right in fairness i wont describe the cheapness of the production since this was what early tv and the series was like its not bad but its not very good either to be perfectly honest the episodes of the series that ive seen work better a single episodes where were not expecting as much given the choice id rent dvds of the show instead of this movie
