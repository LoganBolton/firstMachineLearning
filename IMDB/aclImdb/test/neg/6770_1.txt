i caught a screening of this at the truefalse documentary film festival in columbia missouri and i was pretty disappointed i was expecting a cool documentary into the protest and activism surrounding the rnc but what i got was a largely flawed badacted fictitious conspiracy ridden badly woven tale id heard of its neodocumentary technique blending both true and false but i expected more along the lines of a fictitious storyline developed for a better personification and to create a sense of unity between real interviews but it was more along the lines of a terrible madeforconspiracy theory tv moviebr br the acting overall is terrible except for rossario which is not surprising considering the director at the screening said most of the lead characters had no acting training his excuse being that he wanted them to be real heres a hint real people cant act but actors can usually act realbr br it would of been not so cornily offensive if it wasnt blatantly obvious about how keen he was to push this extremely radical conspiracy theory onto us throughout the whole movie its especially hysterical when we get a scene where the director cameos and starts ranting on about ridiculously stupid theories and secret agendas the movie also does a good job of laughably stereotyping every single role it tries so hard to romanticize these street activists and stamp a big good or evil on every characterbr br skip it maybe find yourself a nice real documentary
