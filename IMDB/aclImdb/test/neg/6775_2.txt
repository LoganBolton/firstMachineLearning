let me say this new heman cartoon is not destroying childhood memories as i didnt like the old heman cartoon either i loved the action figures but i found the cartoon to be corny and i hated the storyline the heman i liked was the one from the very early precartoon minicomics included in the figure boxes where heman was a barbarian the sword of power was split in two pieces and there was no prince adam no shazamripoff premise and no orko anyway lets leave the old stuff alonebr br the new heman cartoon or at least this pilot is a disgrace on its own s it represents both the worst cheesiness of the old show and the worst tendences of nowadays i watched it because i had heard the inyourface morals of the old show were thankfully gone and this one had more swordplay and character development but i encountered an awful mishmash of the worst clichés of the genre characters i couldnt help but hate and the sadly inevitable matrixesque visual stylebr br i think it was a good idea to give a bit of a background to the characters as it was showing a prefacepeeling skeletor but thats how far the character development goes aside from the usual comingtoage rubbish i see coming in the subsequent episodes where this teenybopper adam will be learning the responsibility of his newacquired powers blah blah at least in the old show adam was not a spoiled brat i found myself hating his guts thats what we get when they put out an adventure show aimed at preteens pretty faces and wannabecoolandlookjuvenile clothes i should check new episodes to see if nsync make a special appearance man does this show remind me to the 1996 flash gordon stinkbomb cartoonbr br dialogue ha it follows absolutely every cliché in the book from the goodyliltwoshoes randor in the opening scene to skeletors immortal oh and heman i lied in the ending and skeletors voice is still the same highpitch kind than in the old series 20 years and nothing we have learntbr br and sure nowadays there cant exist something remotely actionrelated thats not matrixstyle leave anime to the japanese folks think fresh ideas and seeing the characters poses while fighting didnt help eitherbr br of course we have our usual dose of pcness evillyn now i think about it who the hell comes up with these names has no yellow skin now but greyish oh so no asian people will be offended i bet jitsu wont appear in the show either shades of the 1996 fg again where ming the merciless was a green toadlike alienbr br people are complaining about cringers lack of speech i dont think i would have liked this more or less if cringer spoke hes corny enough this way and you have your extra ration of cheese with orko the shocking thing is probably many of the people who rightfully hated jar jar binks might be huge orko fansbr br i watched the featurelenght pilot and ive had enough leave the series alone 2 out of 10
