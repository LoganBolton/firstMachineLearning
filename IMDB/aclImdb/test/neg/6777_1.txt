i saw this cartoon accidentally on television one night when i couldnt get to sleep it didnt help in the slightest i found myself staring up at the ceiling trying to forget that face i could quite happily never see this cartoon again simply because of that facebr br now dont get me wrong  i love fairy tales and nursery rhymes as much as anyone but this twisted and terrifying rendition simply is disturbing it is mainly the cruel laughter and the exaggerated features that terrify me and i still have nightmares because of it please i urge you not to allow your children to see this it is far far too scary please i pray you keep it away
