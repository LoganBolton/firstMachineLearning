the problem with this and with all vietnam war films is that theyre all too biased antiwar films overlook the fact that the vast majority of us soldiers were heroes while prowar films overlook the fact that a lot of the soldiers did indeed commit atrocities like the one in this movie this film sucks its time for a movie that is neither prowar nor antiwar nor liberal nor conservative but completely unbiased
