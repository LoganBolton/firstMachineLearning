i had great expectations surrounding this movie not as it was an apocalypse now or an 8 12 but high enough and when i saw it on cable they were all shattered starting by the acting pooralmost mediocre an astonishing waste of good actors and talent and the story itself since when does a 5 men squad go out on patrol on a supposed «hot» zoneto suicidethat´s one big mistake that costs the film dearly very good actors do very poor acting here like sean penn that recently repeated the irritating way of talking on «i am sam» and michael j fox that wastes a good opportunity to beat charlie sheen on «platoon» performing just «average» but the most irritating character was diaz played by john leguizamo another stupid waste of fine talent by the director that was a cheesyscared and insecure kind of person even more irritating that jar jar binks yesyou heard it the battle sequences are average the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence with michael j fox trapped by his feet on a vc tunnelmr de palma has a weak work here and if it wasn´t for films like «scarface» and «the untouchables» these ones excellent films i would consider him a «bluff» director too much publicity bad filmingbr br 310
