some folkie friends recommended this but as a film its really lacking in originality i found the characters to be unflattering stereotypes and the plot is predictable almost from the beginning however if you like traditional englishappalachian ballads it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one ive also read that the soundtrack is nothing like the music in the movie with professional musicians filling in for the actors
