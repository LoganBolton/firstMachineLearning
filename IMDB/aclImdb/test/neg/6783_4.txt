i watched this film with a group of friends at the 1999 melbourne international film festival and noone had a good word for itbr br i happen to love bluegrass and country music so its not as if im unsympathetic to the subject matter but the problem is that at heart its a very conservative movie little more than a filmed mills and boon story a bodiceripper of the most simpleminded and soppy kindbr br its not just that the love story at its heart that between reece and dr lily penleric is more than a tad unbelievable why any male would be attracted to the nostrilflaring mandevouring lily is beyond me and frankly mike harding as reece seems to be just going through the motionsbr br its simply that the whole movie is too tame and wellmannered for its own good there is precious little danger dirt or drama sure theres a moment of excitement involving a school run by lilys younger sister but this whole episode is funnier than it is dramatic its just so poorly written and acted and the movie betrays its conservative agenda in the manner in which this subplot is resolvedbr br as for good old reece kinkaid now whats wrong with a name like eberneezer bumpass i ask you is the ending of this film believable fitting in with the character this film had earlier constructed i think not
