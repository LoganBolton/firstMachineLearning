visually beautiful with some fine music this film otherwise has a fairly trite madefortv quality the romance between two characters which spans a cultural and educational divide is simply not plausible of course from early on we knew our persnickety heroine would lighten up win over the locals and find true love but that doesnt make it any less woeful that the movie had to take such completely expected turns this film had lots of promise which makes it more of a shame that the promise was unrealized perhaps a nice undertheblanket on a cold night freebie on cable but i certainly wouldnt recommend paid rental or purchase im sure the soundtrack is wonderful though
