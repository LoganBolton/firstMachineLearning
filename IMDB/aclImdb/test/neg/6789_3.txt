id never thought that i would be caught saying this but i think dog the bounty hunter is more entertaining than this 90s era cop drama walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of high octane cop shows such as csi csi miami and so forth im not saying all these shows are bad but they arent good either i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this stereotypescountertypes thats right stereotypescountertypes unfortunately this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime for example there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in gothpunk clothing and they start harassing him now this is exactly what middle america perceives the gothpunk culture i mean come on how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot its always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood okay not everyone whos a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty again this is what middle red state america sees of these people finally why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick cant you make the sidekick an equal asskicker
