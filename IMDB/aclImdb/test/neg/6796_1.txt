i just dont understand why anytime someone does a show about one of the largest metro areas in the country houston dallas austinsan antonio etc they portray the average person as someone who wears wranglerscowboy hat  talks with a drawl has zero fashion sense and drives a truck on his way to either the saloon or his next hunting trip rodeo skeet shooting or country music concert i have never even seen a small town cop driving a policetruckanywhere in texasbr br the funny thing is this is not done for artistic reasons or comedythey are actually serious and i guess believe the average person is too stupid to know the difference the bad scripts and equally bad acting give that away this show makes goofy shows in the past like knightrider look like highbrow entertainment at least knightrider had the talking car
