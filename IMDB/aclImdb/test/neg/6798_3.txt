poor diane arbus whoever she was not only was she according to this movie a spoiledbutsweetacting upper east side brat she was a bad wife bad mother awful business partner plus there is no evidence in this picture that she was any kind of an artist  except in the bold statement in the prologuebr br nicole kidman who incredibly is more attractive today than 25 years ago and actually looks younger indeed gives an excellent performance but what can an actress do with a wife and mom who seeks out and falls for an incredibly weird werewolflooking guy living in the apartment upstairs set in the early 1970s manhattan was a virtual magnet for freaks and weirdos of all sizes and shapes most not looking like human hairballs so why is this affair worthy of a 122 minute moviebr br robert downey jr used to be one of my favorites but id say his well known and prolonged use of drugs has taken its toll one might think hed be disinclined to be in a movie that treats drug use as casually as it does smoking cigarettes br br fur has already taken a beating at the box office but in view of those who input a score of 10 for this misbegotten slice of trash id like to say taint so mcgee
