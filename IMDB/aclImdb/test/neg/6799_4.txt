bizarre this movie is supposed to be based on a famous photographer but everything that happens in this movie is fiction i guess it tries to explain why diane arbus had a fascination with oddities and made it her primary photography focus in the movie wolfman moves into the apartment above hers she seemingly becomes obsessed with him and falls for him she puts her kids and husband second over the wolfman and even tries to incorporate him into her family gatherings some of the wolfmans freak show side kicks come over to visit and she mingles with them the whole thing is very bizarrebr br final verdict nothing memorable there is just something weird about a woman who gets her jollies from shaving the wolfman i think you can find better films out there
