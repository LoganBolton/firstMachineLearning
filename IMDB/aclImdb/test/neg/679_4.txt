tamara anderson and her family are moving once again as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape fifteen years old she is in her rebellious stage already angry at her father for their frequent relocations her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis her mothers absence causes tamara to lash out at her father and seek comfort in religion the boy next door rusty as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented housebr br the story is modest to a fault its oddly paced and even during its emotional scenes there isnt any tension the actors portraying the parents are fine alberta watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother and maria ricossa is particularly effective as the guiltridden mother of the dead teenager but katie boland as tamara is too amateurish to carry the movie the dialog is very natural and boland cant quite pull it off she has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there were too many times when she came off awkward one can see her thinking ok this is what my line is and this is the face im supposed to make rather than actually reacting to the other actors shes not the only one kevin zegers as rusty and megan park as his sister brenda also suffer from stilted delivery but at least theyre in fewer scenesbr br if done right the screenplay could have made her an affecting movie and it has it moments but much of it is bogged down with an amateurish lead performance and flat directing
