as an early representation of the turmoil of the 1960s that followed diane arbus nicole kidman can be excused as an early flower child the film itself deserves no such latitude the lack of character development motivation and justification for the characters behavior makes the movie very disappointing i sat watching and waiting for some explanation of the bizarre actions only to find that shainberg was letting me peek into a story that must have been someones inside joke that the few facts presented did not match diane arbus life very much did not help to clarify things eitherbr br the washed out art direction in dianes normal life was nicely contrasted with the brilliant colors in her awakening life with lionel and the trap door stairway was a nice demonstration of dianes attempt to inject her new life into her existing family however i dont see how that trap door in the ceiling of her dining room could directly connect to lionels apartment which was two flights of stairs up from hersbr br maybe my analysis is a little too literal in looking for some character development and relationship understanding that goes beyond one sentence or one comment i also would have liked to see at least one of dianes photos as well i wont wait for the sequel
