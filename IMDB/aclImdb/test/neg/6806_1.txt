in order to enjoy fur  an imaginary portrait of diane arbus stephen shainberg needs the viewer to suspend all reality and prior knowledge of the american photographer diane arbus paradoxically its the very use of diane arbus name and knowledge to her life and work that sets this film up to fail on a grand scalebr br what becomes apparent quite early on with the casting of the beautiful waspish and glamorous nicole kidman as the antiglamorous jewish diane arbus is that shainberg didnt get arbus or what her work was about unsentimental realism and seems only attracted to arbus on a superficial level through her photographs of circus freaksbr br what follows is a kind of pretty and trivial beauty  the beast fantasy biopic with robert downey jr as kidmans hairy fictional love interest however its not the banality of the story that is the main flaw in this film but the directors misogynistic stance that diane arbus one of the art worlds most singular and original woman photographers was incapable of forming her own ideas about her work while his previous film secretary was a study of female masochism his continued portrayal of the female as submissive spoils this film completely  and flys in the face of the real life diane arbus courage tenacity and fearlessness in singlehandedly exploring the often shady world of outsidersbr br imagine an imaginary biopic on pop star madonnas life with guy richie as her svengali the man behind her career and youll get a feel of how seriously flawed and imaginary this film is it can only work if you have absolutely no knowledge of the subject or just choose to ignore all the factsbr br its a shame because once you remove all reference to diane arbus this film could have stood up on its own as an interesting study on fetishism and a good companion piece to secretary 410
