warning spoilers ahead even if i doubt that anybody hasnt seen this yetbr br the movie starts off rather well but about halfway through it falls apart and becomes a corny sugary sweet predictable and unrealistic harmony romance mess i mean its very obvious that there are serious problems in the main characters marriage but these problems are never solved but just forgottenbr br basically as soon as she decides to have a baby behind his back without even asking all of their problems magically disappear without a trace or an explanation given what had happened up until that moment it would have been far more logical if the marriage fell apart rather than becoming the trite and cliche having a baby will change everything endingbr br the two main characters families and neighbours are also extremely onedimensional and dont seem to serve really any purpose if not to irritate the viewer and they also mysteriously disappear from the movie as soon as the harmony moments startbr br i am sorry to be ripping this movie but given the start i would have expected something more 410 for me
