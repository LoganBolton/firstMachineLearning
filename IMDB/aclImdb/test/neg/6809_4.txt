dustin hoffmans debut feature isnt as bad as its reputed to be a spanishitalian coproduction filmed in italy with the director using the pseudonym dan ash the film is uneven but generally diverting and deals with a plethora of shady characters in search of a 1000000 hidden by gangster cesar romero who despite being thirdbilled  after elsa martinelli and hoffman himself  expires before the credit sequence has even rolledbr br hoffmans performance obviously is nowhere near as nuanced as in later films but manages to dodge embarrassment by playing what basically amounts to an amiable klutz  an accidentprone american treasury agent of sicilian descent named puzzu which nobody seems to be able to get right sent out by his firm to retrieve the money and told to remain inconspicuous but instead is forever getting into trouble  though he ultimately proves surprisingly resourceful by finding the loot foiling the crooks and winning the girl martinelli as romeros daughter whos somewhat wasted here br br still the films best moments are provided by suave gangster riccardo garrone apart from his wouldbe hardboiled persona and the hilarious use of dialect hes flanked by a trio of nitwits who more often than not prove a hindrance in the fulfillment of his various schemes also in view of the story being set in rome its odd that the police officer investigating the case is a spaniard doubtless an exigency of the coproduction deal br br along the years ive missed out on hoffmans other italian comedy  alfredo alfredo 1972  a number of times i guess mainly because leonard maltin only rates it 12 in his movies  video guidebut then madigans million gets a bomb with pietro germi directing and costarring the luscious stefania sandrelli the credentials of that film are certainly more respectable and i really hope it turns up again on italian tv soon
