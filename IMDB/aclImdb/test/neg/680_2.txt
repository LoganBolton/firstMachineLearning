the director seems like a good solid man his parents struggle with the same issues we all cope with they strayed from each other they loved each other they misunderstood each other and the poor audience has to sit through ninety minutes of what is possibly the trials and tribulations of one of the most boring families ever to come out of long islandbr br there are few interesting choices in this documentarythe music is banal the filming uninspired and the story is the same story that has played out on every birch street in every town in america i dont mean to sound too harshseldom has a sweeter more wellintentioned documentary been made the director is the kind of man with whom youd want to be friends you just wish he had struggled as much presenting the material as his parents did keeping their marriage alive
