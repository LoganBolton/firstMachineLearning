ill give it this i didnt stop watching and its not corporate which is kind of cool but my internal critic cut it to pieces  i suppose i see too many movies wooden script the slang just sort of clanks out of their mouths without any kind of flow editing mentioned before is hit and miss sometimes it evokes a good ghetto feel but mostly its irritating  jerky quirky angles and really dull lingering facial closeups the actors were marginal though letisha had her momentsbr br im not sure why the audience supposed to care about curtis hes a total screwup and the actor is entirely expressionless and not particularly funny or endearing the directing doesnt help make you love him or hate him even i just wanted him to shut up and get shot already i didnt care about his impotent vengeance when that rolled around the completely predictable ending isnt credible at all im not sure why were supposed to believe that some erstwhile successful dealers he deposes are stupid enough to fall for his petty scams oh you just got out of jail and are on probation heres thousands of dollars worth of cocaine go run it around the corner for me now dont steal from me etcbr br a good sex scene in the beginning gave me hope but it was let down in the end handling of a rape scene was slightly eyebrowraising if only mildly interesting there are better movies in this genre that dont insult your intelligence by trying for some kind of authentic ghetto realism while more resembling a filmschool offering 410 an f
