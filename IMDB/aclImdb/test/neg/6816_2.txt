dogmatic as another reviewer described this film is a fitting word the directors idea was to present bach without plot acting fun theatrics dialog narrative or drama mission accomplished monsieur straub pretentious yes cinematic no way this is anticinema no one moves hardly anyone talks the camera holds static shots for 1012 minutes at a time very very occasionally the camera will dolly in you may catch a glimpse of gustav leonhardts fingers moving over the keys thats itbr br if you like the idea of staring at the back of a harpsichordists bewigged head for 7 minutes at a stretch while listening to bach this is the film for you id rather listen to bach on my stereo with my eyes closed
