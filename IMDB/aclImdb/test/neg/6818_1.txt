utterly ridiculous movie which makes fun of the college admission process while it is true that the sats is not everything in evaluating a student for admission to college what the movie talks about is utterly ridiculous and not worth repeating nor viewingbr br college admissions officials are made to look like stupid people who have an extremely narrow view of the entire process the film is an insult to hardworking high school students who work hard and then have to suffer through a long process until they receive that letter of acceptance or rejection from the schools they have applied for br br this movie certainly deserves rejection on all levels
