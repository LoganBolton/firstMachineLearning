after seeing the movie i feel the father and the mother are both reasonable person although not perfect at all on the contrary i dont like the author and his two sistersbr br is a persons journal an accurate portrait of herself no most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem so a journal is always a more negative side of a person in this movie the author judge his mothers life by her journal not a wise choicebr br the authors elder sister is so ugly external and internal first she said her fathers second marriage is not fair for her mother then she said she doesnt love her mother so she dont love both father and mother i doubt she love anybody in the world her face is so ugly just a reflection of her heart through out the movie i feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents however i feel the father are mother are very loving to their children even the author try to portrait them as cold deceitful person
