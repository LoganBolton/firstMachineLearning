im normally a fan of bruce willis and despite him playing the coldhearted professional killer i thought him the most appealing character here that said his character makes such a mess of his professional activity its incredible he hasnt been caught before the plot is thin to the point of being nonsensical the end was no less annoying and insulting for the fact that it could have been predicted from about 20 minutes into the moviebr br  spoilers follow  in hollywood morality the good guys always win with a few casualties along the way and the bad guys die or are at least heading for justice by the end the breathtaking insult of the film is the way that our ira terrorist who has somehow become a cuddly touchyfeely character gets to walk off to a new life as does his former terrorist playmate who is now a loving wife and motherbr br whos the bigger villain the former and so far as we can tell unrepentant terrorist or the hired assassin i dont see much to choose between them  in real life or in the filmbr br this is the poorest film ive seen this year
