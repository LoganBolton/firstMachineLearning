i was looking forward to seeing bruce willis in this especially since i remember being mesmerised by the original when i was youngbr br this movie is a perfect example of how movie companies can take a very good story and dumb it down until its just another formula ridden hype of the fabled american law enforcement systemarmy vs the russians no sorry the cold war is over make that with the russians vs the terrorists similar to probably 50 other moviesbr br furthermore it treats its audience like a bunch of idiots the choice of weapon is well plain ridiculous are we seriously expected to believe that the worlds most feared and experienced hit manterrorist would select that for an assasinationbr br the whole point of the original story was the tense dual of intellects between the ordinary detective who is given the responsibility and the professional who crafts a ruthless but elegant plan to reach his target and then get away none of that survived all we have is the tired old american ciafbiarmy vs the evil terrorist plot weve all seen 1000 times beforebr br but of course the movie companys mbas realised that a new intellectual angle here would lose them revenue from the short attention span gang so the answer is bruce willis big explosions and a crippled plot they assume the american audience wont be able to relate to a threat to a foreign statesperson where is france on the map afterall so it has be an americanbr br another example of a movie defiled by the boardroom
