the 1973 day of the jackal directed by fred zinnemann from the frederick forsyth novel while not a masterpiece in the general scheme of things was nevertheless quite an aboveaverage thriller written and carried out with considerable panache wit and style it remains a pleasure to rent and watch now and thenbr br in adapting that for the 1997 the jackal it seems that at every turn the writers and director made the worst possible choice making it all quite leaden overdone unsuspenseful unsurprising unsexy and unthrilling if we put together a catalog of all the specifics that went into this movie big and small i could give you a miniessay for each topic on how the 1997 adaptation ed upbr br item the weapon br br in the original there is considerable intrigue over how the assassin is going to smuggle it onto the scene how he intends to disguise it and why it needs custom work from his underground craftsmen in the remake they apparently thought that todays actionflickraised audiences wouldnt tolerate a small rifle whose point is precision and would demand the lugubrious offtheblackmarketshelf machine gun which needs a minivan to transport it and whose point is to shout macho the whole involved and interesting business about disguising its components has been reduced to showing us repeatedly like this is a difficult point to follow that the joystick for his absurdly hightech remotecontrol system has been in his pocket as a pen br br item the conspirators and motivebr br without resorting to dry lecture the original still manages to give us a good understanding of the historical situation of the piedsnoirs  blackfeet the frenchalgerian irredentists who could not accept that the century was moving away from colonialism and formed the view that de gaulle had betrayed them this gives the whole plot some historical weight the remake seems to leave it as a ganglandshootout revenge story minimally spicing it up by making them russian gangsters note please that im not opposed to updating they could have done this intelligently and come up with something more current but nontrivial certainly russia and the rest of exussr have been through huge changes of late and an updated story could have been situated there in a way that would make us feel that it mattersbr br item the relationship of the assassin on the run and the police hunting him down and the complex steering of the viewers sympathies from the bad guy to the good guybr br above i hesitated somewhat at calling the original a masterpiece overall but in this aspect it really was one we follow along with the assassin for much of the first portions of the film and having seen his cleverness and resourcefulness we begin to admire him and not want to see his plan thwarted or see him caught  at least not too soon then we meet the policeman who gets pushed into heading up the investigation  protection efforts and bitbybit we take to him and see he is not the sadsack his domestic troubles may have suggested by the time it matters we have been won over to his sidebr br in the remake perhaps poitier could have handled that sort of development  but gere sure cant and the absurd 48 hoursderived gimmick of the con brought out to help the police should have been left in those comedies where it came from br br the remake has the assassin and the assassinhunter talk about how they re like players above a chessboard communicating indirectly via their moves and only able to infer what the other is like that was achieved superbly in the original but in the remake in fact theyre brought into facetoface confrontation way too soon so they can grimace at each other bloody the place up and go through some fairly standard chase scenesbr br item photography and scenerybr br the remake does have some nice images particularly in snowy finland in the opening section but the washington dc metro cannot really compete with the streets of paris for interesting perspectives and bystander faces
