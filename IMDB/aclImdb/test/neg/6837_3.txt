this may well be the worst remake hollywood has ever produced and thats saying something ill take it further than that and say this movie is so stunningly deliriously bad that it must be seen i dont know if im even capable of tackling all the things wrong with itlike the fact that the casting director appears to have pulled names out of a hat or the mindblower of richard geres character being allowed to walk away scotfree at the end im sure the people saying its just fiction who cares would have no problem if it was a former alqaeda operative who just wants to return to his home countryso ill just devote my review to the utter hilarity which is mainly the scene where bruce willis is testing out his gun br br in the original version youll recall the jackal practices his kill on a pumpkin the pumpkin explodes on impact an effect known as understatement in this version willis sets up a pumpkin target but he doesnt use a sniper riflehe uses a gigantic remotecontrolled cannon which costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a huge conspicuous minivan this man likes a challenge he reveals the cannon by pulling away a tarp at which point jack black who is there to observe jumps around and says that rocks this thing rocks about 18 times i guess willis didnt have to disassemble it first he just lifted it tarp and all out of the back of the van despite it probably weighing several tons the scene then turns into an austin powers movie as willis misses the pumpkin and takes out a tree then has black run through the mud with his pants falling down finally blowing off blacks entire arm the pumpkin falls to the ground unharmed br br if i can recommend this movie for one nonironic reason its for the diane venora character as a tough russian major who becomes romantically linked to gere despite having a facial disfigurementa bold move for a hollywood feature by mid movie i was really liking this character so it was a shame when she had to be killed i would have liked to see a movie about her other than that this pile of crap is only useful as an objective intelligence test 310
