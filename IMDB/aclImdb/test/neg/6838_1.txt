spoilers bruce willis the parttime comic and funny guy plays a hispanic assassin nicknamed after an african scavenger prairie dog i guess all the good hispanic nicknames like sicatriz scar scorpion viper cobra snake tarantula latigo whip navaja blade etc were not available and why would some south american assassin be acquainted with a terrorist from the irish republican army last time i checked the ira is not looking to open any branch headquarters in south america and why would some prisontough battleweary irish terrorist look like a middleaged richard gere i thought maybe this movie was going to be a spoof of the crying game when geres character was introduced as the person who was going to hunt down the jackal what bad casting and why would the fbi be hiring depraved terrorists in order to track down assassins it seems like a terrorist goes for mass destruction and an assassin usually hits one target in a nonspectacular manner but gere is the only person who has ever seen willis alive according to the fbi i thought this movie was supposed to be a remake of the very great film day of the jackal but this movie is just a dumber version of assassins with stallone and banderas both of these movies are really dumb and part of the dumbness is the fact that as the audience we are forced to watch bruce willis go through his routines and we should say wow isnt he smart the professional with jean reno was a much better movie about assassins the jackal is just a movie about two fat middleaged millionaire actors who could get paid for standing around looking pretty and pretending to be smart the jackal is so poor that i expected to see sly stallone dennis rodman mickey rourke and jean clod van dumme making cameo appearances as other hitmen or fbi needless to say the jackal has eluded the fbi for twentyfive years but as soon as richard gere gets on the job it is only a few days before the jackal is kaput i guess the positive message of this movie is thanks to terrorists our streets are safe from assassins overall the jackal has no redeeming qualities
