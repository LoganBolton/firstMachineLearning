roll up roll up its big gay bruce and his big gay death cannon plausible plot unnecessary decent acting unnecessary respect shown to its mighty progenitor unnecessary yes its another offensively stuffed turkey in the butch bruce canonbr br i mean where do you start with this film okay lets begin with the woeful misapprehension people might have that this was in some way related to either the book or the original film the day of the jackal its not in fact its so different and so bad that fredrick forsyth asked to have his name taken off it now im not necessarily a stuffy brit who cant hack hollywood remaking british films well okay maybe i am a bit like that but fortunately its a redundant point in this case this film is so different to the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survivebr br now lets move to the premise cheesy russian gangster gets killed in a moscow police raid somehow involving the fbi although no one bothers to explain why in revenge brother of gangster decides to wreak vengeance by killing the wife of the us president although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move  although to be fair it was pre911 so he wasnt to know it would have resulted in the us airforce carpet bombing eastern europe gangster hires nasty killer willis police hire cuddly killer gere cuddly killer tracks nasty killer police fanny around and periodically get killed cuddly killer kills nasty killer first lady is saved and we all realise that the ira are just this bunch of real sweet guys yknow who just happen to want to kill innocent people nicebr br lets put to one side the distasteful hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of northern ireland like it was a sandpit in a theme park i deal with this point more extensively on the message boards if hollywood directors want to cast the belfast butchers as hookers with hearts of gold thats up to them i of course reserve the right to despise them for it its a free countrybr br more egregious however is the fact that the film manages to patronise and insult the irish while trying to support them thats not politically distasteful its far worse its incompetent its no wonder for instance that gere still looks so damn good given that he slept through the entire six months it took to make this piece of crap the fact that geres accent is not only southern irish but an appalling parody of southern irish shows that the filmmakers werent looking much beyond america to make money from this film then there is that lovely scene at the end where sidney poitier a complete waste of space in this film says hes off for a coffee offers to get our cuddly ira man one then casually says ah but then you guys drink guinness dont you yeah thats right sidney the irish live on guinness and potatoesbr br while were on the subject of poitier why in the original film the detective is the tracker in jackal gere is the tracker so what does poitier do well he just hangs around and looks like a twat of course hes got absolutely nothing to do apart from call in the marines at the end and he only does this because the nice ira man tells him tobr br while were on the subject of gere why i suppose its only a matter of time before hollywood remakes gandhi with vin diesel playing exmujahideen commando mahatma gandhi beheading his way through 1940s and 50s india he is after all a bit dark of hue and therefore very likely to be a muslim fundamentalist lets not forget that geres character is a killer and therefore a nasty piece of work and if hes not why does he know the jackal if hes not why does he know all his moves and if he is why is he such a limp biscuit and such a loveable person br br all this goes to show that the makers of this film couldnt be bothered to a think about the plot b have the characters making decisions that were in keeping with their characterc avoid cheesy stereotypes like having the big boss bad guy kill his own friend  i honestly thought this had turned into a bond movie d give the central characters something to do e credit the audience with a modicum of intelligencebr br this film is an insult to the british and irish killed at the hands of terrorists its an insult to the irish people its an insult to not great but pretty good film it rips off and an insult to the intelligence but most of all  and most unforgivable  it is an insult to my arse for having to sit through the over two hours of run time it took to finish honestly youd think with no plot no characters and no dialogue it would be over in no time but they didnt even have the decency to quit early
