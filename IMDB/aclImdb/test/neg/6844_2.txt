a movie theater with a bad history of past gruesome murders reopens of course the bloody killings start anew written directed shot scored and edited with an appalling lack of flair and finesse by the singularly talentless rick sloane who later disgraced celluloid some more with the absolutely atrocious hobgoblins this horrendously hamfisted attempt at a slasher spoof strikes out something rotten in every conceivable way the excruciatingly lethargic pacing the painfully static grainy cinematography theres a stinky surplus of drab master shots featured throughout an annoyingly droning and redundant humnshiver synthesizer score the flat nondirection a tediously talky and uneventful script the groaninducing sophomoric sense of lowbrow humor the bloodless murder set pieces a pitifully unscary killer hes just some wrinkledup old guy in pasty makeup the uniformly obnoxious and unappealing characters a dissatisfyingly abrupt ending and lifeless performances from a noticeably uninspired cast all ensure that watching this schlocky swill is about as fun and rewarding as eating rancid raw eels drenched with sour vinegar this crud totally lacks the necessary crude charm and sleazy vigor required to be enjoyable junk instead its just a bland plodding and meandering stiff that never catches fire or becomes even remotely amusing in a soshoddyitssmoking sort of way only a smidgen of nudity and the delightful presence of the always dependable mary woronov as a snarky sardonic secretary provide a little relief from the overall crumminess of this lousy loser
