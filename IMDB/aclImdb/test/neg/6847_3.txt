i agree that mary woronov murdochs secretary is one of the only good things about this film she is my favorite actress ever every role she plays is always done so well her character is sly sarcastic clever light hearted funny and cunning she really pulls this role off well and you get a good feel for what her character is all about br br the rest of the movie is pretty bad the music is the most entertaining thing left one of the characters has this really strange circular radio that she brings with her while she wears her tight zebra striped tank topbr br one thing that was a little intriguing about the story was the idea that someone hires these three collegeaged kids to spruce up an old abandoned theater he gives them the keys and says  go at it that would be really fun and i wish someone would give me that chance imagine going into an old abandoned theater with two other people and you get to decide how to decorate it and fix it up you have total control over the whole building that would be so fun unfortunately the characters do not think of this as an exciting adventure they think of it as a big chore they walk around with long faces and fight with each other the whole time its kind of a bummer but its fun to think about the possibilities that these people arent even excited aboutbr br the movie does a pretty good job at making you feel helpless or a little spooked out by the theater itself however the acting besides woronov and possibly murdoch the boss  just because makes a really good money hungry fake smiley business man who never has any luck is really horrible and you just end up feeling unsatisfied plus the random slapstick is a little tacky and kind of ruins the reality that the film tries to createbr br watch this if you dig mary woronov funky 80s casio keyboard style electronic beats and if you think having a giant spooky abandoned theater to yourself is at all intriguing
