this is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and i stopped caring this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex theres a leak and a plumber put a hole in the mans floor so you can see into the womans below apartment also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reportsbr br sounds promisingbr br not reallybr br i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film basically i started not watching which made events seem even more surreal when i did look upbr br it may work for you it didnt for me
