i dont really know why but i watched this with quite a sense of anticipation unfortunatly it was misplaced firstly this is not horror it doesnt scare and unless it was even worse than i gave it credit for  which is possible doesnt try to its a trashy comedy and the fact i smiled once means i gave it a 2 not a 1 this film ripps of gremlins in a truly special way i cant claim to have ever seen a film which devotes its self more very very bad  avoid
