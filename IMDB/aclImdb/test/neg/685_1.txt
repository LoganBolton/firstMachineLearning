last fall of 2001 i took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie mark hoeger his vast knowledge of filmmaking his ability to dissect any scene of a film and his winning of an academy award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director when he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called full ride and was in the postproduction stages my interest was piqued however that would be the last i would ever hear of that film project until last weekbr br last week i saw in a tv listing that full ride was going to be showing on the wb network this immediately raised a red flag as i cant help but associate wb with teensploitation shows such as dawsons creek charmed etc plus the fact that full ride was going to be released straight to tv wasnt too flattering in itself but nevertheless i set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teachers creationbr br after two hours passed and the end credits began to roll i thought long and hard about what i had just seen what i had just seen was a typical wbquality show stretched out to the length of two hours in fact it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the wb network critiquing this movie will basically be like critiquing a typical wb showbr br where to begin the characters are shallow the story is cliche in every sense of the word the scenes are completely contrived and the character development is forced and unbelievable this movie just screams unoriginalbr br the main character matt sabo is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks literally who plays solid high school football as a fullback but then fizzles off into a life of crime he is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail obviously without much of a choice he agrees to play football with an allstar football team but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitudebr br then comes the love interest of course where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest she comes in the form of amy lear played by the beautiful meredith monroe she is actually a likable character as opposed to the eversoabrasive matt sabo so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first but of course the inevitable comes to pass she falls for him changes his attitude towards everything and all seems good and happy but now its time for conflictbr br earlier in the movie amy makes it clear to matt that she doesnt want to score with him because it would be shameful to her and her mother this is much to matts dismay and his football buddies yes they eventually warm up to him who bet him he wouldnt get any but of course matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides hes not all about the nookie heres where the exciting plot thickens if you dont want me to ruin this surprise then skip aheadbr br begin spoilerbr br matt finds out from some local guys that apparently amy lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the allstar team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria which is baffling in the first place and make it to the big city suddenly realizing hes been used and that his love was a sham matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before the big game amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time but hes too hotheaded to buy it so what will matt do will he take her back or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an allround jerk i wont ruin the superultrasurprising ending for youbr br end spoilerbr br so if i somehow got you pumped up for this movie please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm this movie is an uninspired version of varsity blues or summer catch and thats not saying much theres hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about so what do you have left not a whole lotbr br what i most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture hoeger painted of nebraska through this film it seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural nebraska and teenage life in the small towns but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow the characters high hopes for making in the big city and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated and it only further cements the stereotype of nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities i am unsure of whether or not hoegers intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight but i think he ended up with a very shameful product if hoeger wanted to portray nebraska in a favorable light he should have taken a note or two from alexander payne while payne simply chooses to use nebraska as a backdrop for his films hoeger integrates it into the plot of full ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where hes shooting that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider if hoeger actually lived here youd think hed know better than thatbr br all in all i am completely disappointed in hoegers first big film and i hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thoughtprovoking
