ive enjoyed watching lost from the beginning and endured a few bad actors in poorly written episodes because when lost is good its really good but this episode that features mr echos demise had so many drawn out scenes with lingering closeups of bad acting that i found myself tapping the fast forward button this episode stood out so far as by far the worst in fact the variation in quality of lost has been so inconsistent i find myself often wondering how many writers they are usingbr br i will continue to watch but hope things get better and hope i stop secretly wishing for the subpar actors in the series to die off
