was unlucky enough to see this while travelling by coach across africa it was far and away the worst film i have ever come across deserves to be the 1 alltime worst  no acting no plot very little speaking lots of apelike grunting though in this hopelessly unlikely film an unwitting selfsatire  youll either laugh at it or cry
