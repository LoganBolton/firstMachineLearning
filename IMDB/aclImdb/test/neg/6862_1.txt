i remember seeing this film when i was about 10 one of my friends had it at the time it was just a film as i was about 10ish and just thought of it as another action filmbr br when i look back now as a complete film buff this is quite a shockingly bad film whoever produced this film i am sure had a short hollywood career although the lead actor seems to have done a few films according to imdb albeit i havent seen any and dont really remember him too muchbr br anyway just to say that this film is really bad in all ways it could be i would love to see it again though od
