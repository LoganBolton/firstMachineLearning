the concept is excellent the execution typifies the overall quality of the abc networkbr br apart from peter jones it appears that the rest of the panel consist of marketing execs rather than real entrepreneursbr br when i realised that peter jones was getting together with simon cowell my initial thoughts were wow hes gonna take america by the balls but it appears that abc have come along and destroyed the conceptbr br i was an absolute addict of the dragons den in the uk and was interested to see that peter jones had manipulated the concept that originated in japan and developed his own show for the states the result is neither inspiring nor informativebr br if you lack drama in your life you have a choice nowÂ… jerry springer or the american inventor to sum it up a struggling musician selling out to a media mogulbr br idea get me and ill produce a show worthy of the title
