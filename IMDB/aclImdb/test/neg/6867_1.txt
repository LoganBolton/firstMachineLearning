idea is great spoiled big time by the judgesbr br why make fun of people if what the inventors say is true and as most of them say they spent their life saving on the invention the minimum is to reject the idea without making fun out of the peoplebr br also it shows when they want to accept an idea by the crier that they added to the judgesbr br the only one i respect out of the judges is the one who always sits on the right of the table he is a respectable personbr br of course the english snob who claims to be a business man wearing a suite doesnt make you one palbr br last but not least the big guy who sits between the english and the crier wake up man the is no job called and inventor for you to call yourself one an inventor is an attribute not a job manbr br i think they wanted to add someone like simon from the american idol they thought it worked there it can work here as well the context is different and the idea is totally differentbr br it is a good idea and they could have done a good show out of it if they just change the judges and remove their act and attitudebr br just stop making fun of the people
