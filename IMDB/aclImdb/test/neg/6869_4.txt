visitors is a hard hard movie to enjoy its so slow and leaden in its pacing that at times i was drifting off during the film this was about 11am on a hot sunny day i might add not midnight on a cold winter evening so you get an idea of just how slow this movie isbr br strange thing is its not long at 100 minutes its only ten minutes longer than the average straight to video and its only fifteen minutes longer than the superior darkwolf that id quite happily watched the day before it just drags an awful lot enough for you to lose interestbr br when its not mistaking sloow development for atmosphere visitors is good enough at action to almost make it excusable how slowly things happen while the flashbacks are both cheap and annoying as a way to round out radha mitchells boatswoman the hauntingsalienswhatever are actually quite creepy and effective especially when her suicidal mother turns up and starts groaning in the night full marks for not splurging makeup all over the shop too the single person boat is a creepy place and at times the movie uses the full power of the location and the deserted sea to scare the hell out of youbr br still though i find it hard to recommend visitors i came out of it not only feeling like id just watched a 4 hour film not a 100 minute one but also feeling like id been cheated somehow as while offering many explanations as to the hauntings mind games real ghosts space aliens visitors doesnt pick one for definite all that watching radha mitchell talk to her cat and dominic purcell smoulder for no obvious reason about some unexplained horrific event in the past for nothing say what you like about shyamalan but at least he tells you what happened however crazystupid you might think it if you dont watch a lot of these movies your fresh perspective will probably improve matters somewhat but i found this slow boring and highly derivative if you want to scare yourself silly there are much better places to do it if you want a clever thriller there are many that are smarter
