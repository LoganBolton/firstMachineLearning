and one only in my opinionbr br that reason is margaret leighton she is a wonderful actress onstage as well as on the screen we have few chances to see her though i think thats especially true in the united statesbr br here she plays a sympathetic role not only that but she is also very pretty and meant to be something of a bombshellbr br walter pigeon does not hold up the tradition of drummond performers he is always reliable but hes not much fun hes not a rascal or a knave consequently this seemed to me a talky endeavor with little action or suspense but check it out for leighton
