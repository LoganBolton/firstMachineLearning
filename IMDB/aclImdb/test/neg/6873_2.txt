heres yet another movie with dysfunctional lead characters who are totally amoral and yet were supposed to root for them not me no character in this film was worth a damnbr br robin williams plays car salesman joey obrien the man has no class a loser in every moral sense and a guy who thinks he can talk his way out of anything knowing williams ability to talk he was good for this role the women in his life are driving him loony too some of them arent much better than himbr br tim robbins plays a similar lowlife who starts the take over the film when he fully loaded with explosives crashes into a car dealership showroom and holds people including his wife hostage robbins as in normal for him plays a disturbed and ridiculous character i guess these nutcase roles come easily to these two actors gee i wonder whybr br there is so much yelling and screaming in this the movie that it will give you a headache combine those two screamers with the nasal voice of fran drescher and you really have an annoying overthetop cast this is like listening to chalk on a blackboard for an hourand ahalf this is comedy no this is lame br br in fact for a robin williams film to only have a dozen reviews posted here tells you something its a far cry from his best movie
