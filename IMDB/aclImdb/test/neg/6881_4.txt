overall it was a watchable movie i didnt pause it or stop it to come back to ita clear sign of a boring movieso it passed the first test best of all it got into the story fast no boring unneeded back story for the charactersbr br it will never go down as a great movie nor as a great b movie i would recommend this movie to slasherhorror fans who dont mind straight to video releasesbr br unlike some movies of its ilk there is no nudity only moderate language and rather subdued gore there is violence though the deaths were rather dry and unimaginative sadly the computer special effects were actually pretty good the way the creature wielded his chains in some scenes reminded me of spawn and the ghost rider comic booksbr br a little pet peeveits set in lousinia but no one seems to talk with any accent i had to watch the credits to even realize it was filmed in lousiniabr br like most low budget movies there are small goofs in the filming lack of time and money would be the main factors for the goofs for example in one scene it went from mid afternoon to pitch black in secondsduring a short car ride the other instance was the stunt double for the creature didnt have on the creature makeup when falling out of the tow truckit also looks like hes wearing a shirt in the scenebr br in summary i didnt hate this movie but i also didnt love it i probably will never rent it again but if a buddy owned it i may watch it again in a few years
