i gotta admit it i love horror filmsespecially 80s slasher films hell i even love cheese like sleepaway camp and night of the demons but i didnt think much of this movie the death scenes werent very well done the cgi was terrible and the acting was hohum worst of all was the story which didnt make sense at all id say save your money but chances are if you want to see this movieyoure going to anyway i didnt hate itits just not very good overall its just another bland lifeless horror film that lacks life its no surprise that this one was on the shelf at dimension for over a year after it was completed
