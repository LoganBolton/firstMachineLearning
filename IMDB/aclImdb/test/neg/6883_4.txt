its hard to comment on this movie its one of the few movies dimension actually has not shelved its hard to come up with a reason why and it was rushed into a an unimpressive 500 theaters its opening day maybe dimension was afraid of how people would respond to a swamp creature using his tow truck to pull a house apart piece by piecebr br ray sawyer is just a tow truck driver until he rescues a voodoo priestess from a bad car accident and in return he gets attacked by a bag full of snakes and drowns at the morgue ray comes back to life and stalks a group of teenagers who witnessed the awful crash occur br br what brings this movie down is its paper thin characters i didnt care for one moment about any of them also the dialog was less than hohum also it was very predictable characters did the typical stupid horror movie character things like check creaky noises call out peoples names and trip on a rock while being chased i also could immediately pick out who the final girl would be and why did the camera have those quick white flashes whenever somebody died or whenever the killer was shownbr br whats good well there is an impressive suspense scene where the killer walks underneath swamp waters to get to his victims and a tense sequence where the final girl must camouflage herself with bunch of other dead bodies while the killer looks onbr br but other than that its another augustseptember disappointment i was looking forward to it but i did not get what was expected
