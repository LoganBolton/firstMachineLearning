this episode has just aired in the ukbr br what a disappointment the heavyhanded touches of humour were illjudged childish and detracted from what could have been a pretty good storyline i cannot believe that jerry bruckheimer allowed this episode to take place i have seen every previous episode of this show and even the episode where jack played his own older self was way ahead of this episode the lesbian kiss was pathetic sensationalismbr br there was also no continuity from the previous episode there was nothing in the storyline investigating martins dangerous behaviour or possible drug addiction there was similarly nothing explicitly written about jacks burgeoning relationship with ann usually without a trace is pretty good at this sort of continuitybr br the next episode needs to be a considerable improvement
