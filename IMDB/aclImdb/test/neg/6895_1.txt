around 1980 the name godfrey ho was attached to a series of lowcomedy action films starring an actor with the unlikely name elton chong although no masterworks of the genre they remain surprisingly entertaining films for those with a high tolerance for sillinessbr br it is altogether unclear why ho or whomever would want to make a film that would attack jackie chans drunken master the film that legitimated the making of comedyaction films in hong kong but thats what this is a savage attack on the chan film the imitation chan who stars in this movie learns to cause his opponents to laugh themselves to death  a pointless gimmick in any genrebr br along with all the flaws one expects from a godfrey ho film of this period  no continuity no motivation incomprehensible plot line irrelevant and unbelievable characters  the film suffers from two unforgivable faults that effectively make it unwatchable the fight scenes stink and the comedy isnt funnybr br pointless
