i normally hate puns but this seems the only appropriate summary for barnyard i suspect i am not the first and im sure many many comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with udders it certainly bothered me right off the bat but theres much more wrong with this movie than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals workbr br personally if i was a parent i would be irritated by the violent turn it takes near the end in the showdown with the coyotes although for me it at least injected a little action and from a conventional screen writing point of view you might expect the coyotes to play a greater role in the conflictgee you have a widow cowmaybe her husband was killed by coyotes nopetheres a much dumber explanation and what kind of a farm is this otis vows to protect all the animals from harm but there certainly seems to be no threat from humans they make reference to the farmer being vegan but what is he raising pigs for in all childrens animal stories babe charlottes web you name itthe reality of farm life is at least touched on perhaps our friendly farmer is running some sort of rescue shelter there is some reference to this but its never explained but all the farmer gets in return is abuse from a horse in a scene that is supposed to be funny but left me seriously wondering if he was going to wind up buried in a shallow grave behind the barn and what the heck is the deal with wild mike it was like the gimp scene in pulp fiction without the ballgagbr br add in some truly awful attempts at emotional scenes a nearly complete lack of laughs and those udders and youve got the worst kids movie ive seen in ages i generally only post to imdb to highlight a film thats not so well known not to slam the current 2 boxoffice hit but this movie angered me it was taking up space in my local theater space that could have been used to show something worthwhile theres been plenty of good family entertainment this summer in fact there were at least 2 more kids films playing at the same multiplex but im not allowed to see something like little miss sunshine so viacom can cheat families out of an extra 30 at least i had a free passbr br i know that as a 35 year old with no children this film was not designed for me but theres just no excuse for such a lazy dreadful childrens film as barnyard in the age of pixar i was bored by the ice age films but they certainly didnt anger me like barnyard shark tale was a weak attempt at street hipness but it had quite a few laughs for that matter you could turn on nickelodeon at any time of the day and see something more entertaining and intelligent which is why they should be ashamed for putting their name on this garbagebr br im giving it a 2 out of 10 only because pip the mouse was sporadically amusing and maria bamford had a few amusing lines as the farmers wife well not the farmers wife some other farmer they didnt really explain who she was they didnt explain a lot of things especially not why sam elliot the ultimate mans man had an udder jiggling around down there creepy
