i can find no redeeming value to this movie it appears to be loosely based on the lion king school of thought father gets killed son cant fill the shoes and tries to run away etc etc etc the only difference other than being in a barnyard instead of a jungle is that barnyard tries to liven things up with clubtype music they go way over the top in trying to be cool the problem is that it really isnt cool its like that guy everybody knows at least one of those guys who are older and still hang out with the younger crowd in a futile attempt to cling onto their youth they try to be cool to fit in but they really arent thats this moviebr br but hey if you have money to burn and you feel like paying someone to suck 90 minutes of you life away by all means dont let me stop you
