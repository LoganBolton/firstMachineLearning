words cannot describe how horrible this movie is well maybe they can ill take a stab at it 1  pitiful hollywood makes more talking animals set in graphics apparently script and storyline arent needed anymorebr br 2  violent kids movie but yet one of the characters is viciously attacked and killedbr br 3  blatantly stupid the movie is actually depicting the farm animals as having human abilities in nemo the fish could talk but for the most part they are still fish we only hear the english as a translation in barnyard the animals are actually speaking english that other people can understandbr br 4  unintelligent  no smart story line or even any smart humor ok the 13 year old dog on crutches was funnybr br 5  culturally insensitive  the black cow is actually played by a black actress the pink cow is played by a white actress the black cow was playing a stereotypical black personbr br 6  ignorant  no such thing as a male cow that im aware of i believe we call them bulls if we are going to expose our children to drek it might as well have the simplest facts correctbr br 7  boring and borish my 4 year old had us leave after 45 minutes he practically fell asleepbr br im sure this movie will make millions which is unfortunate because it only proves to hollywood producers that the american public at large is just filled with suckers waiting to pay 8 bucks just to get some peace and quiet from the kids for an hour or two an unfortunate circumstance why should the producers spend real money when the returns will be the same either way
