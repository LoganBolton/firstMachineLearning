although humphrey bogart got star billing in king of the underworld im willing to bet he didnt thank jack warner for it in fact this film was one hollow crownbr br king of the underworld was supposedly a remake of the paul muni film dr socrates but given humphrey bogart was in the cast the character is written more like duke mantee in the petrified forest he even has an english writer along in the person of james stephensonbr br kay francis and john eldredge are a pair of married doctors and eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of bogarts henchmen bogeys a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives eldredge 50000 and theres more where that came from if he plays his cards right eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income br br but when hes killed in a raid on the gangs hideout francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the american medical association no matter how much she protests her innocence its no good and she and her aunt jessie busley move to a small town to get away from the notorietybr br of course the notoriety and bogart and an itinerant leslie howard like writer in stephenson all meet up with her again but kay is plucky and resourceful to say the leastbr br bogarts character was ridiculous no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts hes a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs hes concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states and then lets kay francis completely outsmart him hard to believe he was king of anythingbr br definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars
