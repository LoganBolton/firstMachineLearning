there seems to be a whole sub genre of cheap tired old sex comedies out there that say the same old things about middle class couples sort of like friends but with more soft porn and no wit this film is no exception it had situations so familiar i died from deja vu people sat on couches spinning out clich√©s about sex and relationships check monogamy versus cheating with some womanman who would never look twice in reality at some other womanman check porn the baddies111 check some guygirl in it who happens to be the only reason youre watching this rubbish check the lesson seems to be when it doubt make a tired old sex comedy about people no one cares anything about in order to make some statement that everybody has already heard three thousand times before thatll get your film made itll even attract some sitcom nobody in a bad wig
