no one in this movie has very much to do this is probably the longest 65 minutes ive ever spent watching a movie the makeup effects on the pianist with macromeglia are pretty good but thats the only thing that keeps this from being rate a 1 the doctors assistant goes through extreme mood swings from passivity to hysteria in seconds and then seems to forget where she was in the next scene the director assembled a lot of the right ingredients for a maddoctor movie but somehow forgot the skeleton of a story to hang them on unless you know someone in the cast or crew i wouldnt recommend even sampling this one
