dr markoff is a mad scientist who is experimenting  trying to find a cure for a viral cause of acromegaly when he attends a piano concert he is stricken by the beautiful daughter of the pianist and sets out to woo her but when she wants nothing to do with him he infects her father with the acromegaly virus in an attempt to extort money and his daughter in exchange for a curebr br that is the basic premise for this bgrade low budget thriller i have to say i was underwhelmed by this movie not that it was terribleit wasnt but there was nothing particularly noteworthy about it either it was entertaining enough for a viewing but is not one that will stay in my memorybr br the dialog is a bit corny at times and the acting is just mediocre the story is fairly predictable and doesnt really give us anything new of course i cant complain too much about a movie that has a guy in a gorilla suit who serves almost no real purpose and a doctor with a svengalilike stare that fails to mesmerize his victimsbr br it may be worth a watch if you like this sort of movie but dont go into it with too many expectations
