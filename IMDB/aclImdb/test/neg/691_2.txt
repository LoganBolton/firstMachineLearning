this was the worst wrestlemania in history the only good matches were ricky steamboat vs hercules hernandez and the tag title match between the british bulldogs and the dream team this one bordered on classic everything else was either poor or awful the idea of having three host cities was unnecessary confusing and messed up the fluidity of the show the celebrity guests were terrible on commentary especially susan saint jamesbr br if youre interested in the mid 80s wwf youre better renting or buying wrestlemania 3 or just about any other ppv for that matter
