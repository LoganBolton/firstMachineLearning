writerdirector brian burns has obviously seen a few romantic comedies and he seems to think that hes discovered the formula for success plenty of location shots in new york preferably in the winter allusions to old hollywood films especially musicals enjoyable musical soundtrack alas all of this is mere compensation for burns lack of talent as a writer the great mystery of many writerdirectors making independent films is not why they cannot get on with major studios but how they get any backing at all for their filmsbr br normally our interest in romantic comedy is motivated by the lead characters but the couple in this film simply has no appeal this is not the fault of either david krumholtz or milla jovavich their characters are just poorly written what we respond to in such classics as when harry met sally or annie hall or older films such as his girl friday are quirks and flaws of the lead characters personalities lacking the ability to create individuals burns gives us an afterschool special inspired by men are from mars women are from venusbr br how anyone can see burns as the successor to woody allen is beyond me i did not laugh once during this film and the screenplay is full of echo chamber dialog i want to paint the town red you want to paint the town red which is the most telltale sign of someone who has no business writing for a living in one of the early scenes we see krumholzs actress girlfriend filming a mindless tv sitcom its the only moment in the whole film that the dialog feels right maybe that indicates what burns talents are really suited for
