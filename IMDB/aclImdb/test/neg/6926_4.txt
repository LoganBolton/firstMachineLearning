i was looking forward to this so much being a big fan of the book however when it came out i remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time ive ever spent at the cinemabr br in principle the acting the sets and the music were excellent and are the main reason why im rating this a 4br br in this version sara is a little too selfsacrificing for my taste there is no way she would have deliberately lied to miss minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls in the book she makes a point of describing lies as not just wicked but vulgar br br theres also far too much of a disneyfied ending for me saras father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the indian sunset while the book does have a happy and critics might say equally improbable ending it doesnt leave you thinking oh puhleezebr br about the only things true to the book werebr br 1 saras father being a soldier 2 the lines between sara and her father are you learning me by heartno i know you by heart you are inside my heart 3 saras friendship with becky and her adopting lottie although this last one wasnt developed as much as it could have been 4 the changing of her room by adding various luxury items that part was brilliantly done 5 the basic core  a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly  is there but thats about all that isbr br people might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience possibly all i can say to that is i have two cousins  aged 7 and 12 respectively  who were big fans of this film until they read the bookbr br if all you want is a feelgood family film then this delivers if youre looking for a film that actually tells the story of a little princess in fact if youve read the book dont waste time with this one its such a shame with a cast like this if theyd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantasticbr br am i harping on about read the book this and read the book that a little too much very probably but if someone attempts to adapt a book  especially such a classic  into a movie then they should at least have done the same thing preferably more than once
