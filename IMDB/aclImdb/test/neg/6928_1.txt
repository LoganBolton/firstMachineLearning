i absolutely despise this film i wanted to love it  i really wanted to but man oh man  they were so off with sara and the father living was pretty cheesy thats straight out of the shirley temple filmbr br i highly recommend the book it is amazing in the book sara is honorable and decent and she does the right thing because it is right she doesnt have a spiteful bone in her bodybr br in the film she is meanspirited and spiteful she does little things to get back at miss minchin in the book sara is above such things she does stand up to miss minchin she tells the truth and is not cowed by her but she does not do the stupid spiteful things that the sara in the film doesbr br its really rather unsettling to me that so many here say they loved the book and they love the movie i cant help but wonder did we read the same book the whole point of the book was personal responsibility behaving with honor and integrity always telling the truth and facing adversity with calm and integritybr br sara has a happy ending in the book  not the ridiculous survival of her father but the joining with his partner who has been searching for her in the book she is taken in by this new father figure who loves and cares for her and becky and miss minchin is not a chimney sweep  that part of the film really was stupidbr br to see all this praise for this wretched film is disturbing to me we are praising a film that glorifies petty spiteful behavior with a few tips of the hat to kindness sara in the book was kind to the bone and full of integrity i dont even recognize her in the film shes not in itbr br good thing mrs burnett isnt alive to see this horrid thing its ghastly and undeserving to bear the title of her book
