a fourandahalfhour oneill play gets boiled down to a little under two and much of that running time is devoted to actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read their characters thoughts in voiceover it can work onstage but it looks hilariously stilted in this soapopera adaptation which softpeddles its heroines bad behavior and never explains why she has so captivated so many men norma shearer and alexander kirkland overacting ludicrously are outclassed by a naturalistic clark gablehes the only one who makes the frozenface technique work it gets even funnier when shearers and gables son a surly moppet does the frozenface shtick there are also frank morgans brother ralph as an unsuccessful suitor given to soliloquizing poor charlie over and over again and a young robert young and maureen osullivan by the time they show up the voiceovers have largely been abandoned and it plays as a ripe soap with a sentimental fadeout that actually plays silver threads among the gold as background music robert leonards direction is stodgy and he shows little facility for reining in hyperactive actors its certainly entertainingtheres nothing else like it unless you count grouchos satirical parody in animal crackers or an old mad magazine satire that rendered shirley booths sitcom hazel a la strange interlude but it isnt good
