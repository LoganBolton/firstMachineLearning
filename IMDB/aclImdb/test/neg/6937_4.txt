in one sense i kind of liked this movie because of a mindless positive atmosphere it sort of conveys i had a problem with an aspect of the plot but more about that later first the characters were a little goofy and one dimensional the good people had similar physical and character traits and the bad people had similar physical and character traits  hmmm the basic storyline was ok pretty simple and standard  nothing too exciting or objectionable the main attraction was of course the miniature dinosaurs  kind of a nice fantasy element to have however they had a very minimal presence in the moviebr br outside of that the movie kept a brisk pace and didnt get too bogged down in any one place i liked this about the moviebr br the problem i had with the plot had to do with the the idea of stealing i think this movie may not have been thought out enough  somethings wrong especially if this is a kids movie ill keep the next sentence abstract to not be a spoiler skip it if youre worried the good guys do some stealing and they dont have the same info the audience has  so its just stealing and thats kind of a bad thing for a kids moviebr br overall if you have kids because of a questionable plot aspect id consider passing however this whole movie is pretty low key anyway so it may not matter pass this one if you have any other interesting choices
