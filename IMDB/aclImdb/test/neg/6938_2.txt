if you are a sixyearold boy whos into dinosaurs you will love this movie if you are anybody else youll be rolling your eyes about every 15 seconds if you want to start picking on things like the acting the special effects the dialogue or the absence of a coherent plot that makes even the slightest amount of sense youll have plenty of material if all you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your kid it will do just fine that said theres a lot of kids entertainment out there thats much smarter and some of it is even bearable or enjoyable for adults unless your child is in an uncompromising dinosaur mood youre probably better off looking for something else
