marlene dietrich is magnificent as concha perez the temptress who drives all men to despair in josef von sternbergs the devil is a woman her performance has nothing to do with acting in any conventional sense but shes incandescent a true star in full command of her material but shes the only good thing about the film shes so good she keeps you watching this dross i doubt if any other actress could have done the samebr br the story is an appallingly lame melodrama surely pierre louys novel was better in which dietrichs amoral concha ruins the lives of two friends played by lionel atwill and cesar romero with a stiffness bordering on petrification and for von sternberg its an ugly looking movie maybe in keeping with its fairly ugly subject matter bunuel on the other hand thought enough of it to remake it as that obscure object of desire with a greater emphasis on the surrealist aspects of it all down to casting two different actresses in the same role neither film is either directors finest hour and while the bunuel version may be the better film it is dietrichs performance you remember
