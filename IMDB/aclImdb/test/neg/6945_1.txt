this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life they said this was the mans answer to waiting to exhaleall im going to say is that we really didnt respond at all i couldnt believe that it was actually made the director should choose another profession because he cant make a movie the script wasnt good it made no sense and was very messy bet movies are much better than this was and i was horribly disappointed to see the talented actor terrence in this bad excuse of a movie if i could turn back the hands of time i wouldnt go back to media play to never buy the movie i would just keep it wrapped sitting on the shelf instead of wasting my time watching it
