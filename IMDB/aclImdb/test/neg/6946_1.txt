this movie isnt even good enough for the 1 bin at the grocery storebr br i only purchased it because terrence howard was in it guess he couldnt be too choosy about his roles during this time br br the movie in itself was hard to sit through it seemed they were grasping at straws with a storyline the guys night out had to be the most boring ive ever seen one minute they are talking and the next reciting poetry even the arguments were hard to follow most of the acting lacked any depthbr br i have no idea what they were going for with this one but they certainly missed the mark
