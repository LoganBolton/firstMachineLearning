why do the powers that be continue to cast jennifer lopez in unbelievable roles she was excellent in selena and pretty good in money train which both cast her in roles where she could basically be herself however roles like this just draw the line i could never see lopez as an fbi agent see out of sight for that unremarkable performance but as a psychotherapist give me a breakbr br basically lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients in order to help them sort out their issues when she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims she breaks all the rules to try and crack the insanity of his inner mindbr br lopezs acting here is typically below average i cant get over that highpitched squeak of a voice she has shes no julia roberts but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field well shes not even in the same stadium sure she is a very sexy lady however that isnt going to carry a film and it certainly doesnt carry this one with anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been excellent especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the characterbr br having said all that this film is visually stunning the colors are fabulous and the story line isnt half bad in a bmovie kind of way the audio here is superb as well this movie gains some points for the fairly original storyline and major points for how it looks and sounds unfortunately the acting and poor casting bring it down a few notchesbr br my rating 610
