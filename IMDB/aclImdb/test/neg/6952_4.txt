not every movie with lesbian chicks and vampires touching our favorite trashcult genre is nice unfortunately this movie lucks of originality and the performances do not come up with the trash standards seem the creators intention to make it cult it failed trash movies are trash movies because it happens you cant create in purpose this kind of filmsi dont know if mr creepo is a legend first time i heard his name but if he is i wonder the reasonbr br awful even the lesbian scenes are pathetic so any fans of erotic xploitation films will not be satisfied as there a thousands of movies better than barely legal lesbian vampires
