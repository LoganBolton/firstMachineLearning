a vehicle for michael caine its fairly well written and theres some ok acting in it but really its a mess  not funny enough not frightening enough its a flaccid modern cockney thrillerbr br i like the premise  that even in the refracted moral hinterland of east london people do do things for the right reasons a surprise result to the first proper fight caines oldschool billy shiner has promoted inflames his paranoia the second half of the film has him chasing shadows to deal with the disappointment of the outcome of the firstbr br my greatest disappointment was in director john irvins failure to make more of the relationship between shiner and his lieutenantfilial substitute frank harper harpers a british tom sizemore understands his role well whilst those around him seem to have ignored it pity 410
