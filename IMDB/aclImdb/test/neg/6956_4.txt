on paper this looks a good film  michael caine plays a tough and ruthless boxing promoter whos son is up for a title eliminator  the pity is that when the story is transferred from paper to my television screen it loses a certain everything  i had hoped wed be seen emulating his definitive role in get carter and as the film progresses it does seem to take on the qualities of a tough gritty revenge thriller but the whole tone of the film jumps around so much youll be confused as to what genre its trying to fit in to  for example caine  who you cant believe in as billy  shiner  simpson  hes simply michael caine  has a laugh out line as he refers to someone as  hattie jacques  then in a supposedly humorous moment has his henchmen break someones arm  oh how i laughed  i mean its supposed to elicit a laugh the way it plays out on screen isnt it  but these seems at odds with the way the rest of the film plays out br br obviously director john irvin doesnt know what approach to take with scott cherrys screenplay  irvin isnt a bad director and is well regarded for his war films such as the dogs of war and hamburger hill but hes ill suited to this type of violent drama and one cant help but feel he might have been intimidated somewhat by a living legend like caine  caine does give the impression hes just doing it for the money and the well known faces in supporting roles like landua and cranham are basically just cameos who could be played by anyone
