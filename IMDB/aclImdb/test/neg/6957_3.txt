first off this movie leaves you in a limbo mood wise you dont know what to feel so much so that you dont feel bad for caines character when his son gets murdered which was actually mostly due to bad editing the script was too bland none of the situations matter as you watch them the soundtrack or lack there of if there was it wasnt good enough to even remember does not help it one bit only good surprise to this movie was andy serkis performance it was on par if not better than caines the story would have probably gone better off if serkis would have killed him because quite frankly you dont feel any kind of redemption in the climax just a feeling of lack of feeling if ya feel me basically this movie massively lacks draw leaving the audience alienated throughout the entire thing
