decent but overrated dramatic thriller film attempts to depict the spiraling outofcontrol inner demons of a tormented artist the problem is not a single relationship illustrated on screen is believable and plausibility appears to have been thrown out the window the title character is so difficult to relate to making its rather impossible to imagine any of the on screen characters emotionally invested in him either the conclusion is also fairly predictable there are certainly enough clues provided from the get go to indicate exactly where the story is headed choosing to entirely suspend ones belief in the situations or the relationships the film itself is well acted especially by the leads and manages to create some nice tension as the story unfolds as a metaphorical feature there is some food for thought and had the script been stronger theres certainly potential here that could have been put to better use
