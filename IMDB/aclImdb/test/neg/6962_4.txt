i approached this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst flicks ever made i sat down to watch it with this mindset and was pleasantly surprisedbr br its not great its not even that good in fact its pretty poor however its not as bad as i had been led to believe by a long shot its pretty inept and evidently as a cost cutting measure a lot of stock footage is pressed into service a lot of which has no apparent relation to the narrativebr br what it is however is an intensely personal movie made by a man who evidently did not have the skills or the funding to do his idea justice before you discount glen or glenda out of hand examine your own artistic skills me id love to be able to draw but anything i try to sketch comes out like stick men id love to be able to sing but all i do is frighten young childrenbr br wood had an idea and unfortunately he didnt have what it takes to make it work however this was an incredibly daring movie for the puritan 50s however exploitative or incoherent it may appear at first glance
