bela lugosi as god transvestites discussed in a movie in the straightlaced 1950s by golly this must be an ed wood filmbr br watching this movie i felt a combination of guilt pleasure and nausea all at the same time the story is about glen ed wood himself and his crossdressing alterego glenda somehow if this movie were made now i could see kevin kline playing glenglenda notice how all the crossdressers alter egos are versions of their male name glenglenda robertroberta etc it attempts to sympathetically portray it as the mental disorder that it is rather than as a graphic perversion br br somehow wood manages to sneak in bondage and sm sequences into his initial story of glenglenda along with these racy scenes satan himself shows up obviously having a bad hair day the dialog and pace are nonexistent but the film is enjoyable in its context  the weird world of ed woodbr br sterno says put on your favorite lace panties for this one
