as many know this is the feature film debut of edward d wood jr as as a writerproducerdirectoractor i have been a fan of ed wood for several years now while i dont like this as much as some of his other films it was probably the largest insight that the cinematic going public gets of wood during his life everybody knows that he was a transvestite this film is about changing ones sex and how being a transvestite can create conflict in relationships with loved ones this film is way ahead of its time in dealing with this subject matter and how it deals with it however the film still contains woods usual pitfalls of bad dialog meaningless stock footage and hokey special effects throw in woods usual overdose of bela lugosi hamming it up and you have woods first attempt at being a directorbr br the plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after he discovers the body of a transvestite who committed suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems along these lines the doctor tells him the story of glen who is also a transvestite glen wants to marry barbara but cant bring himself to tell her about his secret he also tells the inspector about alan who undergoes a sex change because he is really more suited to being a woman bela lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some kind of running commentary on what is going on lugosis part really isnt well defined and proves to be most likely a vehicle for wood to have a star in his film and lugosi to get some cashbr br all in all the movie shows the hallmarks of woods career it was obviously shot on a very low budget and has quite a few things thrown in rather haphazardly it definitely has the its so bad its good feel to it however i do have to applaud ed on his progressive thinking in making this film transvestitism and sex changes were not extremely open subjects in the early 50s wood took a big risk in making a film that portrays transvestites as people who are not sexual deviants and putting a more human face on crossdressing
