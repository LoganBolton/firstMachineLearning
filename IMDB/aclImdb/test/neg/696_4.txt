if you like to watch movies because they are pretty you should be okay with this one if you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie skip it at the end of the movie i still didnt know why stargher killed the women the way he did when you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from in dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasnt the best but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained they also hinted at a dark background for vaughns character but didnt explain didnt really say why lopezs child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed didnt give much of an explanation for the little kids problem etc if the rest of the story is compelling i dont care about details like how stargher afforded all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers or why the fbi wasnt checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killers mind thing would work but i do like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner
