let me say this about edward d wood jr he had a passion for his work that i wish more people did have if we all had the optimism and the commanding hope of ed wood the world would probably be a much better place being familiar with ed woods story and having seen the most wonderful biopic ed wood 1994 several times i admire his boldness and his strives for the job he loved i still admire his neversaydie attitude he had a love for directing that i wish more people in modernday hollywood hadbr br but that doesnt make his movies any more fun to watch and glen or glenda his first and most confessional film is probably his very worstbr br glen or glenda is a deadening cult movie about a crossdresser named glen played by directorwriter ed wood himself who despite his love for his fianc√©e barbara dolores fuller cannot seem to conquer his lust for transvestitism in which he dresses in womens clothing and a wig and thus becomesglenda glenglendas story is narrated by a doctor and he too is talked and watched over by a mysterious character called the scientist played by veteran horror star bela lugosi oh and theres also some substory about an alananne character who becomes a transsexual based on the christine jorgenson story upon whom this movie originally titled i changed my sex was previously to be basedbr br have i dropped your jaw yet well as much as i want to warn you off this picture if youve never seen it i would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not one word of falsehood in that plot synopsis i just gave you every thing in it is true this is a movie about crossdressers and transsexuals a topic that does not sound very appealing to begin with and is not done in a very appealing manner im sure that with a good screenplay and a good director it had neither that glen or glenda despite the subject matter could have been a very moving picture it is a confessional movie on woods part as he was a transvestite in real life as well as on screen but once again that does not make it a good movieor a watchable one for that matter glen or glenda is a jumbled disorganized mess of a movie that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema it makes no more sense than does its notoriously silly scene where bela lugosi screams pull the string over inexplicable footage of stampeding bison the majority of the movie is narrated in a monotonous voice reminding me of some very bad short informative films ive seen before its like one of those really bad short films expanded into a seventyminute feature and twice as dull we sit there for ages waiting for the plot that never comes there is no real attempt to even build energy with the camera being locked down in one position for many grueling minutes and long stretches of time where nothing at all happens the only moments that are worth anybodys time are those of bela lugosi who manages to bring some light into these dark trenches i guess lugosi is supposed to be like the deity of the film but personally i couldnt care less who or what hes supposed to be ill tell you what he was a gifted actor who wound up making trash but he and wood were very good friends and liked working with each other so good for himbr br i will always admire edward d wood jr for his passion for the cinema but i will never as long as i live admire his movies a film critic once called ed woods movies innocent fun but i think even that is questionable innocent yes fun no sir and if citizen kane is the mount everest of the cinematic world then glen or glenda is probably the mariana trench
