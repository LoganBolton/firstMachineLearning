glen or glenda was edward d wood jrs first attempt at directing a feature film for this he chose a topic near and dear to his hearttransvestism the art of a man wanting to dress in womens clothes to his credit wood tried to deal with subject matter that was largely taboo in 1953 unfortunately wood had neither the budget nor the know how to make the filmbr br the story opens with a prologue by bela lugosi that makes little sense and then moves to the discovery of a dead transvestite glenglenda daniel davis aka ed wood inspector warren lyle talbot with the help of psychiatrist dr alton timothy farrell tries to understand why a man would want to live and die this waybr br glen is engaged to barbara dolores fuller and is reluctant to tell her of his obsession and thats it we see endless stock footage shots of anything from freeway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach interspersed with shots of wood walking down the same street dressed as either glen or glenda and looking longingly at womens clothes in a store window poor old bela who was down on his luck and befriended by wood keeps popping in throughout the story im not 100 sure but i think belas scenes were added for his name value after the body of the movie was completedbr br to add to the confusion of lugosis narration farrell as dr alton also provides off screen narration lugosi keeps saying bevare bevaretake care take care as well as some gibberish about snakes and snails and puppy dogs tailsbr br the story also deals with a transvestite who has a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and woods characters the dream sequences are laughable a wedding sequence in which someone dressed as the devil appears is a good example wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors fully clothed but leaving little to the imagination risqu√© for 1953br br this film along with woods other classics were so bad that they became embraced by the public as cult classics over the years for that reason they have survived to this day
