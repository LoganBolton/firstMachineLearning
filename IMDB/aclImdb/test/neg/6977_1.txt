sitting in a big wing chair with a huge book in his lap the one and only bela lugosi looks into the camera and in a dreadful vocal delivery that sounds as if he were mocking a reading of shakespeare intones sloooowly mans constant groping of things unknown drawing from the endless reaches of time brings to light many startling things snicker startling because they seem new lugosis eyes now bulging with raised eyebrows and mouth sneering he continues but most are not new the signs of the ages cue a visual of lightening accompanied by the sound of thunder which then continues to rumble for an astonishing 86 secondsbr br and so begins what is arguably the worst film ever made this movie almost defies description told in semidocudrama style with an unseen narrator explaining the plot  such as it is  the story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named glen ed wood jr who crossdresses hence the reference to glenda the film has no real structure instead it consists mostly of a random assortment of vignettes that may  or may not  relate to glen or to the crossdressing motif one long sequence consists of some unknown woman wriggling on a sofa followed by a man whipping a woman in what we would today refer to as smbr br then at odd moments bela reappears for no apparent reason and babbles more inane dialogue like when hes wrong because he does right and when hes right because he does wrong pull the string dance to that huhbr br about twenty percent of the films visuals consist of stock footage accompanied by a vo that relates to the story motif but not the visuals hence we see stock footage of bustling city streets freeway traffic a thunderous herd of buffalo and a playground full of kids but it gets worse in a film about crossdressing we have 58 consecutive seconds of stock footage of a foundry furnace making hot steel and 84 consecutive seconds of battle scenes from wwiibr br even the simplest items are botched in one scene we see a newspaper headline that reads man nabbed dressed as girl underneath the headline which has clearly been glued or pasted on the article is about  taxes in one of my favorite scenes an offscreen woman spouts out airplanes why its against the creators will in a voice that sounds like shes just inhaled heliumbr br except for the performance of lyle talbot the acting is uniformly horrendous production design is cheap looking and drab but you gotta love that tacky wallpaper the editing is sloppy most of the background music is suitable only for 1950 style elevators the bw cinematography has way too much contrast and the costumes look like something that came from a thrift storebr br this film is so bad it makes plan 9 from outer space look like citizen kane by comparison i just dont know how one could make a film any worse than ed woods glen or glenda but thankfully its got bela lugosi in it every time he opened his mouth and gazed into the camera with those big bulging eyes i about fell on the floor laughing
