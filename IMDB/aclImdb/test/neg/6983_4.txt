yeah i know his character was supposed to be a drunk and he may have been just acting goofy but something tells this critic that mr pleasence really was drinking a lot and was intoxicated during his scenes in the film basically everything he says is slurred and often unintelligible or maybe it was just the poor productions values hard to saybr br anyway the race for the yankee zephyr is a film that just doesnt work thats a shame too since the film has a terrific opening and a generally interesting plot ultimitely the production values are just too low and the action just too sparse for this new zealand adventure to deliver the goods the story deals with a us war plane which is filled with gold money and medals which crashes into a lake in new zealand during wwii the plane remains lost for about forty years or so until it somehow washes ashore and a drunk pleasence literally stumbles onto it at first he gathers up all the purple heart medals and tries to sell them in town actually getting 75 apiece for them little does he know that once he sells them the local jeweler gets on the phone and starts trying to track down info about the plane before you can blink all of the attention brings a wealthy scumbag peppard and his henchmen into town and they quickly try to force the old guy to give up the location of the plane since they know there is much more on it than just medals the old drunks business partner wahl and his daughter warren then race out to try and claim the fortune before the bad guys can get to it the resulting action just isnt as fun as youd hope it would bebr br the acting is rather awful save for pleasence george peppard tries to do some kind of i guess austrailian accent but it is hardly convincing lesley ann warren isnt too bad but ken wahl is really bad hes basically doing his best impression of michael pare on his worst day and thats saying something hopefully he made enough money on this film to fix his front teeth which looked a bit crooked i dont recall if hed had them straightened by the time he was in wiseguy the rest of the cast are pretty untalented probably mostly locals who never did much else i guess the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for much of the film and the lack of danger the villains are just too nice and goofy to be taken seriously and honestly there are no helicopters in the film that look like the ones on the dvd cover and none of the boats in the film have teeth painted on them eitherbr br the film does have its strengths though the beginning which starts off as a newsreel and then becomes part of the story was a nice touch brian mays score sounds a little too much like the one in mad max 2 but he included a nice little march they play for pleasence in some scenes sounds just like the one in the great escape there are some neat helicopter stunts and a great boat chase that apparently killed three stunt men during filming the scenery despite the grainy look of the picture is still quite beautiful the thing youll remember most is the drunken antics of donald pleasence though he was almost enough to save this film almost 4 of 10 starsbr br the hound
