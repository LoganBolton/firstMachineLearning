everybody loves to see a really bad movie sometime you watch it take a good laughs and forget it in the next half hour but this is not one of those its the worst thing that will appear in front of your eyes for a whilebr br i would like to see someone to take responsibility for dante  hes really the most stupid villain you can think of a guy in leather pants that speaks with a voice over and has a victory laugh like a 50s dracula how can someone came up with this guy and the herothe dragon or whatevermy cereals box has better acting skills than him maybe than all of them its unbelievable but the worst are the fighting scenes where you would think there could be something in it theyre so lame its beyond any kind of description theres no shame i just cant believe how this movie was allowed by any studio but im just thrilled it was watching this is a selfmutilating pleasure see this only if youre in a movie quest for pain and in that case this one is a sure winner
