this harold lloyd short wasnt really much not one of his funnier efforts of course i never see bratty kids as anything hilarious thats what the bulk of this story is harold and his wife mildred davis babysitting his inlaws two young kids one is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a fouryearold terror who does everything but demolish the house letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to mebr br the best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon noah young is burglarizing their house half the time its the pet cat scaring the couple but overall that segment is fun with some good sight gags reminding me of another lloyd short haunted spooksbr br however the good ending doesnt save the whole picture which i probably wouldnt watch again lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again it just isnt that funny
