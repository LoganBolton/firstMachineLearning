i rarely shut a movie off after the first 10 minutes but that is what i did with this one what turned me off was it was so obvious that the only purpose of this movie was to expose as much skin of as many b actresses as possible and nothing else really mattersbr br dont get me wrong i like pretty actresses and sex scenes and sexploitation movies have their own scale of merits but this director does nothing else rightbr br for example take the scene where the two cops of course one guy one gal and of course there is all this supposedly witty banter between them are talking over while standing over the first dead body the camera pans between them for each line theres more than one screenwidth between them and you end up wondering whether youre seasick from that or the clueless dialogbr br well it might have gotten better after the first 10 minutes but i wouldnt know i declined the sucker bet and found something better to do
