im just throwing in this review to show that im not crazy  i like a lot of wynorskis work  deathstalker 2 chopping mall against the law are fastpaced and highly enjoyable  just to prove im not blind i have to mention this along with some shannon tweed body chemistry 3 or 4 or something are the lousy ones  ive got nothing against drawnout sex sequences but julie strains breasts are so unnatural looking you cant help but stare at them  which may be the desired effect but i didnt enjoy staring at them  and several members of this cast seem depressed or disinterested  the erotic thriller was the worst thing to happen to lowbudget flicks ever and thank god that their day has moreorless done
