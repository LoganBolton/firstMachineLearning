some good set design good songs though like the other guy said they arent performed with much energy bea arthur trying her damndest to do something with the material had an occasional good oneliner as mames friend vera and helped move the song bosom buddies along other than that theres nothing here thats worth your time slow pacing incredibly bad cinemetography not very good singing except from robert preston an awful script bad acting except from bea and a horrible lead actress who thought lucille ball would be good as the classy lifeloving mame the heads over at warner bros were no doubt on crack when they decided to not use angela lansbury who had done it so well on broadway and instead use ball who wasnt nearly as funny by then as she was 20 years earlier couldnt act the part the right way at all and used a painful croak as an excuse for singing even if perhaps because making the movie was painful for her to make and even if she financed it she just isnt mame auntie mame is such a better film and the soundtrack of the broadway musical with lansbury sounds great for the most part theres nothing here thats great engaging or interesting at all forget it unless youre a huge lucy fan who thinks she could do no wrong hopefully after seeing this youll realize she was only human
