i am a big fan of auntie mame with rosalind russell she really was the perfect actress to play that characterbr br ive heard angela lansbury was very good on stage in mame but its hard to imagine anyone topping rosalind russellbr br lucy was such a great comedienne that her comic bits salvaged her performance in this movie where i think she was miscast really they should have dubbed her singing voice  hearing these songs sung at a faster tempo and with strong voices really changes the whole effect br br i just saw the stage revival in washington dc and i think christine baranski was very good as mame harriet harris  the nasty chain smoking agent on frasier  played vera and she was particularly goodbr br both would be good casting for a tv movie of this show maybe if that production makes it to broadway theyll consider filming itbr br also i think tracy ullman would be good as agnes
