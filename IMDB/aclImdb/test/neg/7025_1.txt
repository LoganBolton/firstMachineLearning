up until around 1970 lucille ball was one great comedienne she was such a perfect clown i only wish more people could have seen her with bob hope in the facts of life because she could do dry deadpan too as well as slapstickbr br yep lucille ball was wonderful    until mamebr br trying to see lucille ball in mame is physically impossible because there is so much vaseline on the already filtered lenses that youd need windex to see lucille ball in some scenes so even if you see lucille ball in mame you cant really see lucille ball in mame which is a blessingbr br thats about the nicest thing i can say about mame the movie of the musical of the movie of the play this could go on but it started with a perfectly funny book called auntie mame giving this a bad rap is like beating a sponge so it does not matter that the music is croaked rather than sung most of the songs werent much anyway there isnt any difference in the first three its today open a new window and we need a little christmas are all the same song celene dion should do an album with them theyre so big and dull the killer ballad if he walked into my life today needs a confident gorgeous voice edyie gorme won a grammy for doing it in 1967 that poor lucille ball did not possess when she made this movie true elaine stritch cant carry a tune in a bucket either but at least stritch can put over a songbr br if you still feel your life is not going to be complete unless you see the movie musical mame notice how there is dancing in it but whenever lucymame starts to do anything beyond a palsied shuffle the camera cuts away returning right when the number is over and the star poses with the dancers again its just as well jane connell got to reprise the role of pathetic agnes gooch after lucille ball had madeline kahn fired to ensure no comic originality would upstage the star connell is a stage performer who like carol channing and ethyl merman cant scale down her performances for films so she joins lucille ball in being embarrassing though for different reasonsbr br the lavish gowns are by theadora van runkle van wrinkle and they provide the color missing in all but one of the cast br br bea arthur as the actress vera charles mames best friend ignores everyone and does her own fun thing if only she was in more scenes shes too old for her role too but at least she didnt maim it
