lucille balls version of mame in my opinion is one of the worst performances ever saved to film after seeing lucy in her various sitcoms more than an astronomical number of times i can tell you that i really love lucy however this movie is a fiasco of unbelievably bad casting music and dancing robert preston is the only saving grace with a part tiny enough to miss if you blink i dont know what she was thinking and i cant imagine how she was advised by the studio or director but i actually cringed watching this embarrassing performance i could be really cruel and suggest watching it for a laugh but its too pitiful even to qualify for that dont waste your money or your time
