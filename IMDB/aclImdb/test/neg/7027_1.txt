mame is a disgrace to many thingsto lucille ball to a story which has been told better many times over and to the musical genre altogether ms ball does not understand her character at all and she seems to be heavily sedated bea arthur is good but it is not enough the production is very shoddy and cheap looking the songs are subpar and nearly every joke misfires also lucy couldnt dance well so the music had to be slowed down to a funerial pace avoid at all costs but do see the delightful auntie mame
