i didnt think this movie was very good at all basically they took a bunch of oneliners from various shirley temple movies threw them together and had orr act like shirley temple acted onscreen oh my goodness was said quite a number of times if you are familiar with shirley temple movies you will recognize several lines direct from her movies the trouble is they have orr saying these in shirleys everyday life in the end what we get is a hodgepodge of recreated shirley temple movies instead of any sort of real look into shirley temples life save yourself the trouble and rent shirley temple movies its a lot better than watching orr try and recreate shirleys acting style
