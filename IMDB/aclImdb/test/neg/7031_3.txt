did we all see the same movie i cant believe the raves some of the others are giving this really awful bio which believe or not was authorized by shirley temple herself based on her book child star gives me the feeling that some are awfully easy to pleasebr br first of all ashley rose orr whatever her modest talents are in no way shape or form even resembles shirley temple enough to be cast as her in this sort of straightforward biography of the worlds most famous child star she gives no indication of why or how this child was so revered except for trying her hardest to do a shirley impersonation which never clicks on any level none whatsoeverbr br and that is the major handicap of the whole piece but as if that isnt bad enough any drama inherent in shirleys story of her climb to almost overnight stardom has been completely whitewashed with insipid writing peppered with occasional song and dance moments that dont even approximate what shirley did as for example the codfish ball with buddy ebsen which was probably the high point of shirleys choreographed dance routinesbr br simply putting a girl in a polka dot dress doesnt make her shirley temple none of shirleys own brand of charm warmth and appeal is even remotely suggested all we see on display is a pale imitation of the original proving once and for all that there was only one shirley templebr br its worthless to write anything further about this mess none of the others are more than ordinary in lifeless roles my advice for shirleys fans is to read her bookor better stillwatch her moviesbr br this is the pits
