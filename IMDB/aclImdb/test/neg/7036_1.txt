one of the worst films i have ever seen but extremely funny not on purpose though every scene that contains anything to do with aircraft romance script or acting is badly messed upbr br i recommend this film for all pilots itÂ´s so bad that you should burst into laughter at some point in the film also see airport 79the concorde for the same reasonbr br anyone else avoid this film like the plague except for fans of bmovies of coursebr br enjoy
