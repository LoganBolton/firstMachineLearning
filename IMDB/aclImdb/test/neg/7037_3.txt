although i have rarely flown myself i am keenly interested in aviation and this film has added to the precious laughing stock in aviation cinemabr br 1 why is the captain doing the ground checks why does he even measure the oil levels in the engines with turnaround times as low as 15 minutes in commercial aviation this is not a typical preflight checkbr br 2 why does the captain kick against the aircraft tire strange kind of pressure check or anger management br br 3 the cockpit has a crew of 3 all large western twoengined jets built since the 1980ies have a crew of 2 people now try a guess at how old the movie script isbr br 4 a helicopter manages to fly alongside the crippled airliner must be a fast one and the captains words to explain the maneuver to the passengers are indeed hilarious onesbr br 5 with arrested elevator rudders it is always possible to lower the nose of the aircraft it happens for example when any aircraft moves slower than the stall speedbr br 6 the elevator rudders have hydraulic actuators after the collision with the business plane it would most probably have severed the hydraulic lines and thus make them useless for steering but it would not fix them in certain positionbr br 7 the fire in the aft galley was a stupid idea it was designed to show that only gentlemen ask for the extinguisher and fight the fire regardless of who was actually trained to do that Â– the flight attendantbr br 8 at the time of collision the aircrafts elevators would have been in a neutral position the film could have ended herebr br 9 the flight engineer the third person in the cockpit has three bars on his uniform in reality flight engineers have twobr br 10 why does the captain slash the cabin casing with an axe to examine the damage behind i thought it would have been the flight engineers duty as he is already supposed to perform technical checks before and after flightbr br 11 in any aircraft there is no unused space at least commercial airplanes cannot afford the luxury of a compartment that can be filled with tons of waterbr br i could go on and on but at last i laughed hysterically about how the screenwriters imagine aircraft disasters woooohooo most aircraft disasters happen in such a short time span that you simply cannot make 90minute flicks out of them but you can always fill 90 minutes with mindboggling and insane crap irrespective of the genre
