its really a shame there was so much controversy surrounding this picture in other words the infamous affair between ingrid bergman and roberto rossellini as this drew a lot of attention to a very forgettable film the story is incredibly slow cheap looking and uninteresting and to top this off the film is stuffed to the brim with amateurish actors who can barely speak any english i really would have preferred subtitlesit would have made the experience less exhausting back to the rotten acting the neorealist movement was big in italy at the time this film was made many of these films are absolute masterpieces such as de sicas umberto d the children are watching us and miracle in milan because they got so much out of the nonprofessional actors they behaved like normal people but in stromboli they act like normal people trying to be actors and come off very badlylike kids in a school play br br by the wayif you are hoping the movie has a good ending thereby making your time commitment to the film worth while dont bother the plot was just totally uninvolving and sillyso much so that i really found that i could have cared less about the characters like the island they all inhabit the film is desolate and without color or life
