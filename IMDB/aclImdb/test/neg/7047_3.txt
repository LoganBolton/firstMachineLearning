why bother to see this movie it probably rates an award for being the worst career move of a major movie star since clark gables laughable playing of an irish patriot in parnellbr br its inconceivable that bergman would choose both this movie and its director over a lucrative hollywood career where she could choose among the finest scripts and directors being offered at that time to begin with there was no script to work with except a few notes then we are supposed to believe the polished bergman as a poor refugee willing to do anything to be released from a refugee camp including marriage to a poor italian fisherman she doesnt even love i read where anna magnani was the original choice for this part if so that made a lot more sense than to cast the luminous bergman in such a proletarian part but since she was in love with her director common sense flew out the windowbr br so she goes to live in this poor village where the men must toil to extract a meager living from the sea a place she obviously hates to be and where she doesnt fit inbr br her only friend is the village priest who knows shes not suited to the life of a poor fishermans bride but tells her that for the sake of love she must repress her true feelings of revulsion and accept the poverty and despair she encounters each day on top of all of this theres this volcano always on the brink of erupting and drowning them all in hot lava but like a true heroine bergman revolts against her misery by declaring war on just about everyone else in this dreary film she even goes as far as trying to seduce the village priest in a scene that would generate laughter if it were not so pathetic since her poor slob of a husband must lock her in a room to keep her from running away shes forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her off the island to her no sacrifice is too great no man unapproachable if he is willing to help her to escape the island and her misery i wont bother to tell you how this all ends the noscript movie ending is as plausible as the rest of stromboli i even remember from seeing it on late night tv that it had two different endings so be warned if you should feel brave enough to sit through this kingsize turkey and catch the miscast bergman it led to her downfall in hollywood for the next seven years and she was condemned for sleeping with her director while still married to peter lindstrom none of the movies she made with this directorwhom she later married are noteworthy except as proof of a career gone berserk i kid you not its pretty embarrassingbr br   soundtrack
