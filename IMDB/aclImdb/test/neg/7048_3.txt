my wife and i watched this movie because we plan to visit sicily and stromboli soon fortunately or unfortunately the landscape and seascape complete with tuna are the only believable members of this cast we expected reasonable wellwritten and wellacted movie but were disappointed its only redeeming grace is an extended and remarkable fishing sequence full of authenticity thrashing tuna nets wooden boats with long oars and passionate if superstitious fishermenbr br the movies sequencing is stagy its dialogue stilted and the acting ranges from stiff to completely overthetop one scene in which bergman stresses out as her macho native and na√Øve husband sics his ferret on an innocent but apparently already deceased rabbit would be perfect grist for a monty python skitbr br when the volcano blew we hoped for a merciful end to the suffering ours and the casts unfortunately the movie continues to flail on staggering finally to a melodramatic and absurd ending unless youre really into oldtime tuna fishing pass this hokey effort by
