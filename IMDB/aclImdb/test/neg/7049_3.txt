before the days of home video stan laurels prehardy comedy kill or cure was known  to the extent that it was known at all  only because a few sequences were included in robert youngsons compilation film laurel and hardys laughing 20s youngson knew what he was doing the best gags in kill or cure were brought intact into his compilation while the rest of this only mildly funny comedy remained on youngsons cuttingroom floorbr br laurel portrays a commercial traveller hawking a patent medicine cried professor io dines knoxall that name is the funniest joke in this movie which aint sayin much i should point out that this movie dates from 1923 the shank of prohibition during prohibition quite a lot of americans purchased patent medicine if it had ahem medicinal properties so  if knoxall contains alcohol  stans job in this movie is less desperate than the one which he and ollie famously had in big business selling christmas trees in the summer too bad for this movie that its not nearly so funny as big businessbr br we see stan but dont hear him in this silent film delivering a spirited sales talk to a man who seems to be paying attention  until we learn that theyre standing outside a deafmute institution and this man is deaf a haughty woman emerges from the gates stan quickly tries to engage her attention by wiggling his fingers at her of course shes not deaf and she promptly whacks him with her umbrella i found this sequence offensive not because it involves deaf people the deaf arent the butt of the joke but because it abets the very widelyheld misconception among hearing people that they can communicate with the deaf by merely waggling their fingers randomly and performing charades without actually learning the highly complex grammar of sign languagebr br more amusingly a spinster in this movie has a pet canary named rudolph as in valentino and theres a gag involving trick photography to enable a man to hide behind an object thats narrower than his body ive seen this device in several cartoons and liveaction movies but kill or cure is i think the earliest movie to use it that ive seen so farbr br stan laurel an underrated actor does one bit of physical business here thats worthy of chaplin or keaton in which he conveys his emotions  and a change in his demeanour  while walking away from the camera with his back to us still laurel never really became a firstrate comedian until he united with oliver hardy to form the greatest comedy team ever kill or cure barely rates 3 out of 10
