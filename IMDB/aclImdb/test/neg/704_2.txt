i never want to see this movie againbr br not only is it dreadfully bad but i cant stand seeing my hero stan laurel looking so old and sickbr br mostly i cant stand watching this terrible moviebr br frankly there is no reason to watch this awful film the plot is just plain stupid the actors that surround stan laurel and oliver hardy are really really bad and laurel and hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films br br i warn you dont watch it the images will haunt you for a long while to come
