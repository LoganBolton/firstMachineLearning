this is a case of taking a fairy tale too far the enchanted cottage delivers dorothy mcguire as a terrible ugly spinster and robert young as a disfigured pilot long story short scarface marries spinster after which their love transforms them miraculously lighting cosmetics and the removal of fake scars into beautiful peoplea magical change that they attribute to the enchantment of living in a seaside cottage that has been the abode of generations of honeymoonersbr br if the story stopped there fine it would be a fable with a proverbial message beauty is in the eye of the beholder but it lurches ahead reaching for reality when mr and mrs scarface greet their public it comes as a painful shock to them that theyre still homely you see they only appear beautiful to each other a situation which the audience is well prepared for because all the secondary characters have been sermonizing that illfavored people really need to lower their expectations and find other ways to be happy you know take up hobbies spinster does woodcuts for instance scarface considers collecting driftwoodbr br the original playwright arthur wing pinero and the filmmakers have zero faith in human nature their message is youre either ugly or pretty and no pretty person would ever love an ugly one whats even worse ugly people evidently need to imagine their lover as pretty reality just wont dobr br one wonders what elaine mason saw every day when she looked at her husband stephen hawking
