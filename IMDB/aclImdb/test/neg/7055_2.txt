the films title makes it sound like a porno but its not even a sex comedy instead hot summer in barefoot county is about an official sent from a southern state to a small town to locate and arrest moonshiners the moonshine though is coming from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful daughters almost anyone can guess what happens next but oddly the film is very tame it hardly even qualifies for a pg rating whats more the low budget is obvious in pretty much every shot and the acting is sooooo amateurish this film was probably intended for the drivein crowd but its unlikely that it satisfied them even in 1974
