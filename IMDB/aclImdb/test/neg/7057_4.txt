one of the most pleasant surprises of this early 3strip technicolor short was that a ballet dancer that appears here was named maria gambarelli i half wondered if blake edwards was naming the character played by elke sommer in a shot in the dark after this nowforgotten performer though the spelling of the sommer characters surname was actually gambrelli i watched this on youtube mainly to see an early judy garland appearance as we watch her in profile with her two older sisters singing la cucaracha that was the highlight for me which otherwise showed some dances like that of ms gambarelli that were enjoyable and some lame comedy between andy devine as a great bullfighter yeah right and buster keaton as a bull owner who provides one that is obviously a man in animal costume only funny part of those two is when they crywith buster providing handkerchief to bullduring the sad part of la cucaracha also lame was seeing ted healy without his stooges dealing with a crasher who keeps mistaking healy for other movie stars healy himself didnt know zeppo had left the marx brothers since he puts four between the and marx speaking of a marx it was interesting seeing harpo without his wig though he is wearing a hat to hide his bald head also interesting was seeing ida lupino among the cowgirls in the beginning though i also recognized toby wing from her part in murder at the vanities last year at least when announcer pete smith identified her oh and smith himself wasnt funny with his wiseguy narration other famous stars you may or may not recognize are also in cameos and not all are mgm contract players either so with all that said la fiesta de santa barbara is worth a look for anyone curious about judy garlands early film appearances or the early use of 3strip technicolor
