i like a lot of myrna loy movies this film was produced before her character actor personality was developed it would be an okay short film but seems to go on forever in its complete formbr br myrna loy it seems is told what to do with her acting and does the job that is about all you can say about herbr br her gypsy character is shoddy and the film has many flaws such as the jewelry shop scenebr br this film will probably be interesting to myrna loy fans but even as such is something of a disappointment
