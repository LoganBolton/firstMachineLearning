into a happy household comes the gypsy girl played by myrna loy with her amazingly wild hair and voice that sounds very highpitched and weird its hard to believe this is loy she bears no similarity whatsoever to the refined and funny character nora charles who she played in the thin man movies instead she overacts so badly that youd almost expect her to be in an ed wood movie what a huge difference a few years made in the quality films she got as well as her acting ability on top of the horrendously silly character the film also fails because it just isnt interesting or excitingjust very very stagy and stupid the only thing good about it is the vitaphone sound systemmaking the sound quality of this turkey about the best i have heard from 1929 heck it was even better than most 1930 films so the sound technician at least has something to be proud ofall others forget itbr br this is a movie that even the host of turner classic movies referred to as a guilty pleasure because the movie is so bad and after having seen it i disagreeslightly the movie is simply bad
