no one is going to mistake the squall for a good movie but it sure is a memorable one once youve taken in myrna loys performance as nubi the hotblooded gypsy girl youre not likely to forget the experience when this film was made the exotically beautiful miss loy was still being cast as foreign vixens often asian and usually sinister shes certainly an eyeful here it appears that her skin was darkened and her hair was curled in most scenes shes barefoot and wearing little more than a skirt and a loosefitting peasant blouse while in one scene she wears nothing but a patterned towel i suppose im focusing on miss loys appearance because she is by far the best if not the only reason to tune in to this creaky antique and to keep watching you sure wont be attracted by the dialogue which is hopeless in one typical passage nubi gazes out the window at the departing caravan and waxes poetic always the gypsies they sing weird and sad when the big sun have breath of fire that burn and when the pale moon look from behind cloud and breathe air cold as death they sing poetic or what lovers of purple prose will have a field day i cant help but wonder though if in her later years miss loy preferred not to recall her involvement with this projectbr br like so many early talkies this one was an adaptation of a recent broadway success the stage version opened at the 48th street theatre in november of 1926 and ran for over a year the play provoked a famous episode involving the humorist and theater critic robert benchley who was known to have an aversion to characters who spoke in thick dialect or pidgin english according to a muchrepeated anecdote mr benchley squirmed uncomfortably through the opening portion of this show the spanish village setting moved to a village in hungary for the movie for some reason gave the actors leeway to practice their accents with varying degrees of success but benchleys patience reached its limit when during a family dinner sequence a door burst open and an actress dressed as a gypsy girl dashed into the room shouting help help he keel me she then threw herself at the feet of the mistress of the household and exclaimed me nubi me good girl me stay here at that point mr benchley rose and announced to his companion me bobby me bad boy me go now and left the theaterbr br the film version offers numerous examples of unintended humor but never comes close to benchleys level of wit the melodramatic plot concerns the lajos family father josef mother maria and son paul a student at the nearby college we would consider this prosperous family uppermiddle class as they are landowners with servants and all the comforts of life but their comfortable existence is abruptly thrown into turmoil when a gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their home is invaded by yes nubi the nubile gypsy girl she arrives at their door during the storm of the title symbolizing stormy emotions i daresay the girl is fleeing an abusive relationship and begs for sanctuary after considering the matter the lajos family agrees to hide her from her angry lover who shows up shortly afterward but is turned away nubi becomes a servant in the household kindness motivates the familys decision to take her in but soon enough that conniving little goodfornothing nubi has paid them back by seducing every ablebodied male in the vicinity starting with the lajos servant peter then working her way up to son paul nubi breaks up pauls relationship with his fiancé irma played by loretta young still a teenager causes him to flunk out of school and then prompts him to buy her jewelry by stealing the savings of the familys maid lena zasu pitts lena for her part is still mourning the loss of her own fiancé peter seduced and tossed aside by nubi when she turned her attentions to paul ultimately nubi sets her sights on the pater familias josef and i suppose if the running time had been longer she also wouldve gone after uncle dani maria the village priest and god knows who elsebr br i guess it goes without saying that a scenario like this one easily lends itself to parody but during its first half the squall nonetheless exerts the undeniable fascination of a daytime soap we watch hypnotized as the bad girl works her spell on the menfolk and wreaks havoc like an irresistible force of nature almost like a storm ahhaa another metaphor but as the plot machinations grind on the campy fun fades during the later scenes nubi is deemphasized and the focus switches to the dysfunctional dynamics of the lajos family and after awhile these people get to be a real drag the son in particular behaves like an absolute heel yet the parents never acknowledge this or face up to their own shortcomings everything were told is the fault of nubi that nogood trampbr br the men of the cast are dull aside from miss loy the only actress who can handle performing in talkies is zasu pitts terrific as usual the mother of the lajos household is played by alice joyce a longtime silent star who was out of her element with speaking roles and who retired soon after this loretta youngs fresh prettiness provides a nice contrast to nubis dusky allure but her line readings are so awkward its kind of endearing no theres only one reason to watch this flick and thats nubi herself i cant think of another actress who couldve played this silly role and managed to come off half as well im not an objective observer however i have a desperate crush on myrna loy and will watch her in anything even the squall
