this film was such a mess i actually reimbursed my friends who i dragged to see it the only reason i went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shootbr br im sure that this film was meant to be campy but the approach was so heavyhanded and selfreflexive it turned out really flat judd nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side his life is hell and made worse by his obnoxious and overbearing companion bill paxton who i feel embarrassed for  this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor a freak accident alters nelsons career course and mayhem ensuesbr br the attempts at humor were corny predictable and often base and tasteless wayne newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but he adds nothing  comedically or otherwisebr br overall its a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes over like a lead balloon at least you could laugh at plan 9 from outer space this one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film one of the all time worst bombs youll ever witness
