ok fans its out on dvd but the only reason to watch this is 1 to say you did due to its notoriety or 2 if youre a hardcore bill paxton fan i am not a hardcore bp fan but he was fun to watch and it was the only thing that kept me from turning this off from sheer boredom its a shame because this could have been a good movie with some script work and if made by someone with some intelligence and with a cast led by someone besides the totally miscast and talentless judd nelson sure its gross but its bad and not in a good way if after reading all the comments on how bizarrely revolting and dystopianly filthy this movie is you are still interested do yourself a favor and see some good bizarre revolting dystopian filth instead films by john waters david lynch peter jacksons braindead henenlotters basket case etc all come to mind theres lots better out there
