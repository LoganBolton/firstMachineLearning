i saw this movie and i do like horror moviesbr br i did not know what to expect but as soon the movie was on his way it was nice to watch it the idea was pretty original and the acting was nice especially jenna dewan as the excitingevil tamarabr br the hardest thing about horror movies is to make a good ending but there the movie failed for a change a endscene in a hospital where suddenly all employees are gone first you see doctors and nurses running around but then they all went homebr br no cries for help while being chased by tamara escaping to the roof also a smart movenot and off course a kind of open endingbr br nothe movie started great the main part was nice to watch but they really messed up the ending using all clichés from bad horror movies jeffrey reddick failed in my eyes with this movie after making some really quality movies like final destination 1 and 2br br if you like a good horror full of cliché endings tamara is a good movie to watch for me i like movies which surprise me
