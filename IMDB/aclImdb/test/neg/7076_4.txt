i am working at a video store so i got to see this one for free thank god had i paid for it my review would be less forgivingbr br well the major idea of the film geeky girl takes bloody revenge isnt all that original there are several parallels to carrie playing a mean practical joke on a loser except for one nice girl that is actually sorry for her tamaras and carries bad family background i still think its a fun idea for trashy teen horror flick unfortunately they didnt take much advantage of the potentials that are here and rather put an emphasis on all the wrong thingsbr br what worked i liked the actress that played tamara she looked great when she was hot and her catty lines were fun sean cant come to the phone hes fking patrickbr br what didnt work the whole wicca thing was silly i generally prefer rational explanations she could have ploted the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to get her revenge there were a lot of logical wholes and the gore looked really bad when the boy is cutting of his ear and his tongue pleasebr br the whole idea wasnt bound for oscar buzz but i just think they wasted the comedic and the suspenseful potential they had it was bearable but far from good
