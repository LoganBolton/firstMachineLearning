the biggest problem with in search of historic jesus is that there is very little search to it at all shicksunn produced these documentary films in the 1970s and just into the 80s which featured interviews with experts and discussion of science and facts to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in onbr br sadly historic jesus is really little more than a thirdrate dramatization of the life of christ unlike shicksunns more superior in search of noahs ark which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence the famed shroud of turrin is mentioned but little other detective work is given much screen timebr br for fans of these quasidocumentary films like jupiter menace and in search of bigfoot etc this movie doesnt offer much
