as a documentary this is laughable in a campy sort of way  a schlocky collection of recreated biblical tableaux mixed in with solemn interviews of socalled experts think of it as an infommercial which pushes jesus instead of thighmasters br br however the detailed crucifixion scene is in terms of historical accuracy superior to similar scenes in such widescreen hollywood extravaganzas as benhur king of kings and the greatest story ever told rather than dragging his entire cross to golgotha for example john rubinstein simply carries his crossbeam strapped across his shoulders to his outstretched arms nails arent driven through his palms but instead through his wrists his feet arent nailed separately but one is placed over the other so that just one nail need be used incidentally rubinsteins flogging prior to his crucifixion ranks 35th in the book lash the hundred great scenes of men being whipped in the moviesbr br of course rubinstein and the two thieves wear modest loincloths which probably isnt true to the shameful reality of roman crucifixions but allowances must be made curiously the good thief is positioned on the left hand of jesus which goes against a longstanding tradition just why this thief is played by a pudgy overweight man is however a mystery especially in view of the fact that the bad thief is something of a hunk
