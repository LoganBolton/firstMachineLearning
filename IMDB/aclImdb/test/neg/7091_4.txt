in trying to keep up with the hipness of youthful audiences as the 70s approached oacdycsf was the product of odder and odder material selected for musicalization here its past life regression esp and hypnotherapy pretty loopy the real problem with the concept music or not are the extraordinarily low dramatic stakes just where can a movie go and what can happen when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl he cant stand it cant go any place new but strangely it cant even go any place old indeed if it could audiences would still have no interest in the union of yves montand playing a much older arrogant french ass and streisand a much younger girl we never become invested in them their situations or outcomes montand is miscast and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics unintelligiblebr br its all been given a shallow 60s veneer that makes it eminently disposable despite efforts here and there from minelli that are respectable its not even adapted from a nonmusical story that met with any previous success thats just too passe streisand occasionally has some funny business to offer as when shes trying not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance but she overrelies on her ingratiating translation irritating kooky jewish girl shtick she can however sing very well at both the gentle and powerhouse ends of the range amidst a score of musical dross she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs of much higher caliber than anything fanny or dolly had to offer he isnt you is a sweet trifle as sublime as lorenz harts my funny valentine but the movie isnt able to realize any impact from it because the lyrics dont seem to be referring to anything in the movie and nothing remotely suggests a great love is blossoming between chabot and melindabr br the only cut we can view is a poor hatchet job of a much bigger film strong research shows a longer betterexplained and more decorative but not necessarily a better film at httpbarbraarchivescomfilmscleardaystreisand2html you can be sure theres be more babs in that version but more importantly thered be more thoughtful work from minellibr br in the end montand sends babs off to sing the title song after she discovers hes a total dick who feeds her a selfesteem homily to allow himself off the hook and she takes the bait so uh hooray for thatbr br hurry its lovely up here love with all the trimmings he isnt you  the title song
