its as if the editor and screenwriter only had 40 minutes of real running time this is supposed to be a remake of a chinese film which is obviously far superior to this trash its clear that some brainless hollywood suit or writer decided that this movie would be mano a mano man against man instead of just letting the story play out with the personalities of the characters that were built in the first 40 minutes at this point in the film the characters just dont act like regular people and not even like their own personalities it makes little sense its quite clear why this film flopped its just not believable at all and thats too bad  it started out with promise dont be fooled
