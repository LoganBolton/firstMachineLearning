tank girl was i suppose meant to be the buckaroo banzai of the 90s and was marketed as such the comparison is admittedly appropriate both movies have so many things going on in any given frame of film that as impossible as the story is to sort out it certainly isnt boringbr br tank girl is a fun enough ride if you turn your brain off before the movie starts otherwise youll end up with a skullcracking headache like me
