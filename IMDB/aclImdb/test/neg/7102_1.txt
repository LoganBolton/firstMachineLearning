why lori petty was cast as tank girl ill never know her acting performance is lackluster her voice is grating its almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie isbr br there are several modernpop references in the film which i found to be very strange given that the movie was supposed to take place far in the future it wouldnt have been hard to make this premise interesting either some better writing would have helped loadsbr br naomi watts makes an appearance in it as a mild mannered technogeek i think they should have probably switched rolesbr br ill never know why anyone would like this movie unless they were a petty fanbr br try not to see this movie total waste of time
