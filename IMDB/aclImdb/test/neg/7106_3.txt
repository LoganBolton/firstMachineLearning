i made the mistake of buying this since i collect comic book inspired movies even at 6 it was too expensive i thought there might be some campy fun in it a so bad it becomes good vibe perhaps i was wrong i had watched it once long ago and didnt remember any of it now i know why i was bored out of my mind and was looking for distractions to do something else im all for grrrrl power punk attitude and absurd humor but tank girl does not work on any front the script is bad you dont care about the characters and the humor is mostly lame except for a few amusing oneliners the special effects or locations are poor or often replaced by comic panels or animations that are just too jarring compared to the liveaction its like they didnt have the money to shoot the cool stuff and so resorted to drawings however cool they might be an uncensored animated feature would be way better for tank girl now that i think about it the action scenes were cheesy but not in a fun bmovie way the tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic although it was interestingly decorated as a matter of fact the best action scenes involving the tank were in animation br br it does have some interesting songs by known artists such as bjork hole and portishead but instead of improving the atmosphere they just dont fit most of the time once they even break into a ludicrous song and dance number that was just senseless and horrible i think thats when i totally tuned out i suppose tank girl played by lori petty looks the trashy punkette part but beyond her attitude and sometimes barely amusing retorts is more twodimensional and superficial than the worst comic book characters jet played by naomi watts is probably the only saving grace of the film and its amazing how such a good actress was involved in this mess malcolm mcdowell wasnt too bad playing his usual villain role it might be a cult movie for some but please consider that its really different from the original independent comics and the original creators were disappointed with the movie themselves check out the entry for tank girl on wikipedia br br rating 3 out of 10
