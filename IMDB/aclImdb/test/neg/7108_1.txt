my poor tank girl they ignored everything great about you why does it have as little to do with the comics as possible i would have loved a movie that followed the plot or at least had the characters rightbr br why was tank girl american shes austrailian dammit and shes not living in a post apocalyptic war zone either she lives in the outback with booga like a savage she does it because she wants to live that way not because she has to because malcolm mc dowell is acting the git and whys she looking after those kids the only children in the comics end up violently being choked by her its terrible that they made her into a lame mother figurebr br and my poor jet girl and sub girl in the comics jet is a sarcastic wisecracker and sub girl is another sarcastic wisecracker with a weird sense of humour in the movie jet is this mousy little thing and sub is this ditzy middle aged hag and booga doesnt look or act anything like what hes meant to be either though maybe hot roohuman love was too much for the usa box office the humour was so lame too whatever happened to all the stuff about the smiths and that brilliant slang they used all the time what sort of line is will this take long i dont wanna miss baywatch even programmes for tiny children can come up with better material than that
