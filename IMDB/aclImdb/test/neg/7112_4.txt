a lowrent cheaply made police thriller thats kept bearable by some fair humorous bits the nice chemistry between the two leads and especially by james remars satisfying turn as a narcissistic psychopathic and naturally indestructible villain obviously a lowquality picture both visually and dramatically with a rather resigned burt but not unwatchable
