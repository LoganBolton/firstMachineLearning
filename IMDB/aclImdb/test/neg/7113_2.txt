live action version of dragonball via taiwanbr br evil lord comes to earth to get the seven magic dragon ballser pearls which when brought together will cause a dragon to appear and grant your wish lots of action and bad comedy ensuebr br what can i say that the best way to watch this film is with lots of drunk but witty friends doesnt i dont know this is a really bad but funny in the way that really bad movies can be come on this is one of the few martial arts films ive ever seen where you actually see the wires its a live action cartoon and not so far removed from what ive seen of the show that it makes me fearful for the big budget american version now filmingbr br if you have some drunk friends and feel like picking on a movie see this film if youre going to see it sober like me avoid it
