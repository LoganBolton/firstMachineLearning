ok so its not great either but only because of how great laurel and hardy have been in the past if this film received a total overhaul with picture quality enhanced add new dubbing to the badly dubbed voices and added a nice unobtrusive background music then this film would truly start to take shape as it is it does have its problems people do slate it for how old the boys look quel surprise they were in their 60s and had led a life however to me they still came across as having bucketfulls of charm and while this doesnt even come close to tickling the feet of their classics i gave it a 4 its worth a watch simply because its them to think otherwise would be impostorous
