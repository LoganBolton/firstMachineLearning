all the way though i was thinking to myself oh god why at the very beginning i thought right it might be average but the acting and plot on most parts was atrociousbr br every part in it was so predictable even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the ring it was a half decent movie but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves eg the part were geller falls off the building had me in stitches my girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next and more times than less i was rightbr br why does going into the house make her come after you it doesnt make sense it was a poor excuse for a lot of killings and no really depth was seen at allbr br you can see everything coming which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching oh shes behind her  didnt see that one coming yawnsbr br surely these people must have thought to oh i dont know carry a knife round or at least try and fight back instead of being eaten but someone hair at best during the movie i was very mildly scared and i mean mildly i was just crying out for the credits as they rolled i exhaled a short oh thank god if you havent already dont waste your time and money on this pointless plot less sorry excuse for a sequel
