this remake is a complete disgrace so mediocre cheap and prosaic it wouldnt deserve more than a couple of spiteful linesbr br its also a cheat with a laughable script served by such contrived and amateurish acting youre always aware theres a set a camera a fake no direction no suspended reality whatsoever to allow you delve into the storybr br the claustrophobic stifling tension of the small spaces and rooms in the original japanese masterpieces juon 1  2 is all but lost here in overblown sets and spacesbr br but worst of all the moral enormity and unbearable suffering which both imparted a ruthless logic to the original mother and child victims turned into relentlessly vindictive ghouls is completely ruined by utter nonsense and hollow boogieman style scaresbr br if american audiences arent willing to read subtitles and rise above the lowest common denominator preferring to swallow this kind of patronizing hogwash instead they fully deserve this pathetic curse the movie itself
