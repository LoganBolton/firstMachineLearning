let me start off by saying that i loved the original grudge it was bar none one of the scariest most hairrising experiences ive ever had in a filled movie theatre im not kidding being a selfdeclared japanophile also made the flick look better in my eyes if the setting had been changed to some american suburb i probably wouldve ended up hating the filmbr br that said this movie is a complete mess i wont say it sucks because a the movie does have some good points b it sucks is the lamest putdown in the history of lame putdowns so what does the movie have going for it well for starters it has a pretty cool look through filters and the use of bleak washedout colours takashi shimizu almost recreates the downbeat angstridden atmosphere of the original a few scenes are genuinely shocking and unpredictable unfortunately the rest of the film is just plain bad periodbr br the story is all over the place needlessly told tarantino style ie the scenes are out of chronological order this technique is pointless in the case of this movie and it merely makes things more confusing frankly a straightforward plot wouldve worked better the original was also lacking plotwise but it did make sense and the film more than made up for its thin plot with lots of scares and a genuinely tense atmosphere grudge 2 has none of these elements and is just a waste of timebr br lets not forget the tvshow acting skills which make the cast of the original grudge look like emily watson and katherine hepburn simply put the movie doesnt work its too slow too dull and just not scary enough to make up for the confusing plot which adds nothing new to the story by the way so not even grudge fans will be pleasedbr br oh and what is it with the old man playing japanese peekaboo on the bus is this supposed to be comic relief artistic statement or what
