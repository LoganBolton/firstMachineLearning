i liked the first the grudge it really creeped me out and it had something to it that made me want to see it twice that something was missing from this sequel there was no creativity nothing new or original nothing that really sticks to your mind its people dying because a scary ghost comes out of the shadows and says boo and most of the time it wasnt even all that scarybr br plotwise this movie is a dead end amber tamblyn is a good actress but she was given nothing to do and karens death seemed really unsatisfactory because it came so quickly i was also disappointed in the kayakos mother subplot i was thinking that she might provide some way to fight the grudge but she dies in the hands  hair  of kayako that was such a stupid twist all in all its difficult to feel for characters that you know from minute one are going to die all in the same way and theres nothing they can do it doesnt feel like a cruel destiny awaiting them its just boring because you know whats going to happen if they had anything to fight it with that would have added suspense even if they failed if there was any hope it would make the scares more justified now youre just waiting for them to diebr br kayako was really scary in the first movie but this time we saw her too many times and that took away some of it i was still scared during some scenes but i actually got used to the huge eye and blue face the makers obviously realized this would happen as they added other scary ghosts yes i was scared at the school psychologist scene  even if i knew where it was going as soon as she said ive been to the house a nice touch toshio however was not scary at all in this movie i was much more creeped out by the nonblue toshio with black eyes and a blank stare that sometimes appeared in the first movie a blue boy sitting in the corner does nothing for mebr br some of the characters seemed really unnecessary  the notorious milkscene with the girl whose name i cant even remember comes to mind i wasnt scared it was just huh im not sure if the schoolgirls were even really needed karen could have brought the grudge to the us with her it could have killed people related to her life everyone at the funeral or something like that even so it would have been dull to watch them all die but being introduced to so many unrelated people really felt annoying hated the i wont call you mother scene aubreys mother issues were equally dull the little boy was a touching character thoughbr br the juon sequel was much scarier than this one it had some new twists  dreams and reality blurring much more for instance  and even if it left me feeling quite down i was also somehow satisfied i got to think a bit and be left wondering this movie only provided cheap scares
