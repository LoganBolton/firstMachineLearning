the grudge 2lets see dont get me wrong im not a japanese horror film or horror or grudge basher i loved the first one and the original juon i feel that much more justice could have been done for this one aubrey only existed to fill in what needed to be discovered in the ending which if youve already seen juon before this you already know the whole movie all it was really was a complete remake of juon just more closely followed than the grudge though everyone may have thought that its coming to america was a bit interesting it was expected as the house burning in the end of the grudge left the 2nd hungering for a new plot br br save your 650 and wait for this to come out on dvd rent it watch it then decide if you want to buy it this movie is good for a fall asleep at 2 in the morning film but overall id say a 4 out of 10 sorry grudge fans its justthey just failed at this one
