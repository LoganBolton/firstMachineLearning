okay first the good thing  if you saw the trailer then you know about 100 of the scaryjumpy moment of the movie and yes its a good thing because you should just stick to the trailer and not go see the moviebr br i now understand why sarah michelle gellar did not stay alive in that movie for very long she did not want to associate her name with this production i wish her the best for the returnbr br you have to follow 3 different story in this movie and they are all disconnected in time and meaning until the very end and even then its a very bad climax and god forbid even open the door to another sequelbr br yes in this movie the rage and fury is on the move no need to visit the house anymore just be close to someone who when inside and youre done its not a curse anymore its kinda like a virus go inside the house get scared return back to usa and spread the joy in your apartment buildingbr br its not that difficult to follow but you just dont really care about anyone the plot line is slim to none and you have many scene in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head milk anyone i saw juon 2 at the fantasia movie festival last summer different story completely but much better than this dud its not a remake but this time maybe they should have simply done a remakebr br if you must see it wait for the dvd
