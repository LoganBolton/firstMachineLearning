hey the grudge 2 what up man i have a friend i would like you to meet the grudge 2 meet johnnys worst of 2006 list johnnys worst of 2006 list meet the grudge 2br br whats going on here i was under the impression that this was supposed to be a sequel to the grudge rather than a remake if thats the case then why does it do nothing but rehash the original this floater doesnt even feel like a movie its just a 90minute soundtrack of the weird contortionist chick making that annoying croaking soundbr br a sound on which id recommend you not get me started it was kind of creepy the first time i heard it but ive heard it about 12367 times since 2004 so its pretty much run its course and its made even more annoying by the 20 people in the audience who thought itd be funny to imitate the sound whenever there was a quiet spot in the movie sighbr br folks youre not funny so just shut up i promise you every single time that a character was walking slowly through an empty room which is approximately 97 of the movie somebody in the audience would start it up uhhhhkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhhkkkkkk yes i know thats a horrible way to replicate the sound with letters but you get the gist so then some dude in the audience would giggle and not to be outdone deliver his own rendition i was very close to just walking through the audience and punching random peoplebr br i told you not to get me startedbr br theres absolutely nothing about the grudge 2 that i can recommend theres not a single original scare or idea in the entire film theres not one memorable acting performance are you a sarah michelle gellar fan welp enjoy her two minutes of screen time and one line of dialogue are you an amber tamblyn fan i hope you can deal with the fact that shes given nothing more to do than walk around looking like shes suffering from a pinched nerve can you believe the story if you can call it that is even worse than the grudges br br at least the original was fairly creepy and boasted a few effective jump scenes i didnt jump once during this lametrosity yeah i made the word up deal with it thats right not a single time the scares are so manufactured and they are so blatantly telegraphed that there is absolutely no shock value once the gotcha moment arrives watching this movie is like playing a good game of chess  youre always four or five scenes aheadbr br there are also some weird scenes thrown in that make no sense whatsoever one that immediately comes to mind is a scene where a girl drinks a gallon of milk and then begins to regurgitate it back into the jug huh i say huh the audience laughed i shook my head and sighed there was a lot of that during the movie laughing sighing head shaking falling asleep i did twicebr br the movie even makes a 15thhearted attempt at a plot twist wow its so bad that i dont think we should even dignify it by labeling it a twist did they really think anybody would be surprised at the revelation of who was hiding under the hoodie please it was as shocking as elton john coming out of the closetbr br and of course the ending goes the whole nonclosure look we might have another sequel route as soon as the credits rolled the audience booed my sentiments exactly had the audience paid money for this turd burger then things would have most likely gotten violent and i wouldve gladly led the chargebr br we learned from the grudge that theres a japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage then a curse is left behind much like a ben affleck movie its a stain that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred well in the grudge 2 we learn that when a horror movie covers its budget during its opening weekend then its sequel will be rushed out and more often than not it will be as bad as this and will leave a stain on any theater where the movie showsbr br the gist br br if youre a total wimp and never saw the grudge then this might provide a few cheap scares but i strongly recommend saving your money otherwise theres a good chance youll be the one walking out of the theater with a grudge
