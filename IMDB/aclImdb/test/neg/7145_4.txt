theres nothing new in this movie nothing you havent thought about before nothing you havent heard before the story of a gay man who is brutally murdered in a small town and the reaction of people can be broached in many ways and this movie has chosen the most demagogic and slushy one one of the biggest flaws in this movie is that it isnt neither a movie nor a documentary the director has used the transcriptions of the original interviews and made the actors play them as if it was a movie the result is weird and finally i read in previous comments that stated that people who dont like this movie are antigay im pretty sure this comments come from people who consider themselves tolerant but dont tolerate that other people dont like this movie this is a funny world
