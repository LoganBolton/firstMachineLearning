throughout this movie i kept thinking why on earth did they make this as a documentary yet not include real footage of the people who were interviewed sure it would have been just like any other documentary but then it would have been up to the film makers to find the meaning for the movie to deliverbr br using a host of well known movie stars many of whom apparently asked to be in it to portray real people gave me the feeling that there was a predetermined message to be delivered and the director was so intent on it that real people couldnt be trusted so actors and rehearsed scenes were used yes i know this was also a play but a documentary should be a documentary i really found myself getting put off by the various stars and kept expecting one of them to drop character for a moment and say im a good person because im in thisbr br this movie could have had a much more powerful social commentary had it been more objective or let us see matthew shepard and his murderers as people rather than symbols the much superior boys dont cry had an unflinching view of those involvedgood and bad instead the laramie project gives an almost relentless lecture that someones sexuality should be accepted regardless and little else
