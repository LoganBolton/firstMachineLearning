this screened at sundance last night to a receptive if mute crowd clearly the story is worth relating its powerful and true but did the director have to cast every single role with a recognizable face i mean really you spend have your time saying oh look its the guy from armageddon or hey its easy rider and you lose sight of the story perhaps its the only way this guy could get his movie made but its a little distracting sort of like the love boat or those old towering inferno movies that were chock o block with stars i wish hes just told the story simply with less famous faces also the camera work seems kind of lazy like there wasnt any thought about where to put the camera to best tell the story all in all i thought it was okay but could have been really good
