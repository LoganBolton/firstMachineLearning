i find herzogs documentary work to be very uneven fata morgana a companion piece of sorts to lessons of darkness lacks not only the harrowing spectacle but mostly the discerning eye of an author it is by comparison amateur looking aimless pans left and right across the desert the kind of which you would expect from any german tourist equipped with a handycam the camera left running from the window of a car picking up all kinds of meaningless images wire fences derelict buildings and patches of dirt going through the lens in haphazard order intercut with shots of sand dunes at one point herzog encounters a group of starved cattle rotting away in the sand yet the image is presented much like you and me would perhaps worse the camera peering handheld from one cattle to the next for a documentary that attempts to be a visual feast a hypnotic surreal excursion in uncharted landscapes it lacks the visual orchestration and conviction of a disciplined author its all over the place halfhearted and tedious mayan creation myths recited in voiceover then some other text herzog fancied for literature its not until near the end that fata morgana jumps alive through a series of bizarre encounters first with a man and a woman playing music in a room the man singing in a distorted voice through a mic both of them apathetic in their task a man holding up a turtle a group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the ground other than that this one seems to have very little of substance to offer or visual splendor to offer
