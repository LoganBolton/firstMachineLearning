i really hoped for the best with this one but it just didnt happen financed at a very nondutch manner and still looking great with a style and pace thats very much like hollywood what i dont understand is howwith all these great benefits the directorwriterproducer still managed to make this film a completely horrible picture to watch filled with bad jokes cheap nudity and actors that just cant really talk act in the english language kudos for pulling it off but what was this guy thinking
