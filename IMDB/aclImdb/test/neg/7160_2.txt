this film was strongly recommended by a friend and being a great fan of brando i ordered this film from harrods and eagerly waited for it to arrive i have seldom been so disappointed by a film brando was good as a german officer but the rest of the film was simply unbearable you never get to like or care for any of the characters except brando maybe the acting was ok story what story maybe thats the point its war after all but ive seen far better war films lawrence of arabia apocalypse now even star wars it was so boring i kept checking my watchbr br overall this is one of the worst films i have seen please dont waste your time and money on this may i also add that this is the first user comment i have written i just had to let my feelings about this film knownbr br by the way my all time favourites are casablanca the godfather 1 2 one flew over the cuckoos nest pulp fiction and amadeus if you havent seen them yet please spare the time to do so and amadeus must be in widescreen 2351
