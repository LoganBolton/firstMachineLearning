after the book i became very sad when i was watching the movie i am agree that sometimes a film should be different from the original novel but in this case it was more than acceptable some examplesbr br 1 why the ranks are different eg lt diestl instead of sergeant etcbr br 2 the final screen is very poor and makes diestl as a soldier who feds up himself and wants to die but it is not true in 100 just read the book he was a bulldog in the last seconds as well he did not want to die by wrecking his gun and walking simply towards to michael  noah br br so this is some kind of a happy end which does not fit at all for this movie
