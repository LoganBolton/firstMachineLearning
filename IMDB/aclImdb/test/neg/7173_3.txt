you gotta be a fan of the little man but i found burlesque on carmen dull unimaginative and totally not funnybr br chaplin is retelling the story of carmen and plays a big role himself as don jose its a story about men and the women they love although its unclear why one would love such a woman as carmen as she is playing the men against each otherbr br as i said i didnt think much of it chaplin made dozens and dozens of better movies so you can leave this one on the shelvebr br oh and im curious what the difference is between this movie and the 1915 version or is it just an imdb mistakebr br on the whole 310
