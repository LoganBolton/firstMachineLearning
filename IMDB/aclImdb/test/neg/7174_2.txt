this is a awful remake of a very good movie called up in the air starring frankie darrow mantan moreland and marjorie reynolds i was only able to get through about 20 minutes before turning it off almost all the lines are identical i have no idea why they would redo the movie i totally disagree with a previous post that dislikes the songs  there the same also in the original the singing is first rate im not sure if marjorie reynolds actually did her own singing its hard to tell since the vocals were usually added later and the songs are very good surprising in a b movie if you get the chance see the original its available on dvd youll be pleasantly surprised
