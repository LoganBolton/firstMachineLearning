this is a bottom of the barrel type of bfilm from one of the poverty row studios monogram in the mid40s the kind that filled out a double billbr br only reason i watched was to see what jackie moran was like in a leading role as a page boy at a radio station who attempts to solve a murder he played phil meade in gone with the wind only two years earlier and this was one of his last teenaged roles hes no mickey rooneybr br the script is as hapless as the production values and is full of clich√© ridden situations with a cast of uniformly untalented individuals wanda mckay is the switchboard girl who is discovered by a radio producer and sidney miller is the nerdy friend of the hero whos afraid of his own shadowbr br mercifully its over in an hour when the murder is solved after a roundup of all the suspects terribly overacted the only quiet performance of any interest is given by jon gilbreath as tex the cowboy but he bites the dust after too brief an appearancebr br there are several songs but all of them are forgettable as are the lame jokes and dialog
