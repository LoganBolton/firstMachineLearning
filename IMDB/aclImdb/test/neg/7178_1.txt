yes it takes a norwegian to ruin and slaughter two great books and a concept that would work well on film  this film truly is the worst swedish film of all time i hated it so badly that i even considered walking out on it something i have never done but it was so awful i was almost compelling i just had to sit through to the end much like some early80s stallone action reel this one really takes swedish action back to the stoneage so full of logical errors and stupid mistakes it is almost amusing  but who could ever see anything good in the terrible acting mark hamills surviving a minefield or the dumbass useless and irrational actionbr br let me ask you arent we through with clocks ticking down to zero the hero escaping in the nick of time and two friends become enemies reuniting by the end stupidbr br and one more thing the product placement in this film is unbelievable while other countries have understood that it shouldnt be so obvious the swedish film industry apparently hasnt understood at all just look at the credit card hamilton uses to open a window or or or this film really makes me mad
