despite the fact that the plot follows the wellknown recipe of who did it which has characterised all the perry mason movies so far the characters of the present film are not so welldeveloped and the selected cast fails to give them flesh and blood of course in general the perry mason movies are not significant but even for their low standards this one is weak
