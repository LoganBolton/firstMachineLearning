this film just doesnt work no two ways about it i saw it for the first time back in 98 when it was released and i didnt like it i just bought it on sale a couple of days ago cause i thought whatta hell ill give it a try i dont regret for the money i put out for hamilton but the fact remained the same this movie is pointless dull and uninterestingbr br stormare is usually a delight but thats when hes making films in the us back home he doesnt do the trick sure the movie is well made if you forget the odd stock footage herenthere but in the end the only thing that really lifts hamilton above one star garbage is hamills turn as the bad guy hawkins he seriously has fun with the character and is also responsible for the only two good moments in the movie swedish intelligence huh now theres a contradiction in terms and when he allows hamilton to have a word or two with his wife over the phone towards the end of the flick and thats really pretty much itbr br
