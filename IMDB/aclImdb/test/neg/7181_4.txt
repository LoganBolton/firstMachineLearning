if this is the best commander hamilton movie i have no curiosity about the othersbr br a movie actors greatest tools are his eyes but when peter stormare wants to show great emotion he closes his so for five or six seconds we get to admire his eyelids while his feelings remain unknown behind them lousy acting techniquebr br stormare also flinches sometimes when he fires a gun turning his head away and clamping his eyes shut watch carefully james bond can rest easy with competition like thisbr br there are some interesting supporting performances from other actors but not enough to hang a whole movie on the cinematography is goodlooking doing a fine job of capturing the nordic cold even the sahara winds up looking cold perhaps hamilton carries his own climate with himbr br there are some individual good action sequences here unfortunately the only sense of humor on screen belongs to the villain which turns the hero into a big pill james bonds jokes may not be particularly good but at least he doesnt look constipated all the timebr br one positive point in the movies favor is that the psychotic contorted vicious hatred of israel in guillous books has been left out what has been kept in is worship of a noble heroic plo that he shows us functioning in libya without the dictator khaddafis knowledge or supervision this fantasy is hard to believe since khaddafi actually threw the plo out of libya for four years at a time and at the end of the film hamilton gives the plo a very disturbing gift where will they use that gift hamilton doesnt carebr br were a long long way away from for whom the bell tolls herebr br commander hamilton will remain a local phenomenon while henning mankells books sell well around the world jan guillou will never have the same successbr br as for this film bleeeeaaahhhhh
