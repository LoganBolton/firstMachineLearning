i would not be giving away too much of the film to tell you that there are many many many many scenes of lucas the young protagonist walking and looking at things yep and youll be happy to know that the first third of the movie is pointless meaningless and pretty much ignored for the rest of the filmbr br this movie is populated by dull people who do dull things and the dullest person of them all is young lucas who is going blind and needs an operation you see he has delusions terrible delusions he thinks a killer is preying on blind women he walks around a lot and acts like an insufferable jerkbr br patience does not pay off with this film by the end the plot and events are just as confusing and lethargic and it is very hard to care one way or the other about what any of the nightmarish images meant nothing is made clear the film moves at a snails pace and it left me with the same effects of a hangoverbr br judging from afraid of the dark the british dont make stupid thrillers like the americans do they make boring ones
