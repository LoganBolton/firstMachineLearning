afraid of the dark left me with the impression that several different screenplays were written all too short for a feature length film then spliced together clumsily into this frankensteins monsterbr br at his best the protagonist lucas is creepy as hard as it is to draw a bead on the secondary characters theyre far more sympatheticbr br afraid of the dark could have achieved mediocrity had it taken just one approach and seen it through  and had it made lucas simply psychotic and confused instead of ghoulish and offputting i wanted to see him packed off into an asylum so the rest of the characters could have a normal life
