theres not that much to say in the end one would have expect much more from a director who made way better movies in the past it just seems like he did it without actually caring the actors are doing their job though belmondo is far from amazing but you just dont get hooked in a word its boring this is even more disappointing since i heard several time that this movie could be considered as a reaction to all the big american blockbusters which are considered to be a threaten to the french exception by those who just cant admit they should turn to another job i tell you if thats the best reaction were supposed to get boy im going to be really depressed soon
