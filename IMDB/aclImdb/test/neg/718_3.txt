this movie was recommended to me by some academics from their comments i had some pretty lofty expectations but this movie was nothing but disappointing the aim of the director is obviousto use an interweaving of speechespoems as a way to argue against the bush doctrine but the director fails miserably at this also i seriously question the directors choice of main character its a bum who is definitely not worthy of being heard the rise of corporation power so what most importantly this movie gets a failing score in its persuasive power its clearly intended for those whove already formed their opinions its true that the movies aesthetics are quite pleasing but pretty much everything else in the movie simply sucks
