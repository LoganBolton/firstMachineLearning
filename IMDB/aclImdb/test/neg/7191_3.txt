when you read the comment on this film that its smart and funny political comedy based on true events  the only true word here is that its a comedy if youre told its insider movie about russian politics  its not theres probably only 2 in the movie from what really happened in russia during that electioncampaign in reality of the 1996 it was thousand times more interesting to follow the situation and that was a real funky electioncampaign well there were pradvisers from the us working in the yeltsins staff but their role was just minimal the whole campaign was totally different from what is shown in the movie it would be much funnier showing all the presidents people riding across the country with paper boxes full of cash and the celebrities giving the shows to support yeltsin all over the place  at least that would be true i give it three only because of the respect to jeff goldblum antony lapagglia and liev schreiber and about the machine guns on the streets of moscow i was living in the place that had the highest amount of hard crime in russia in the middle of 90s and never seen a man with the gun on the street
