well dont bother this film looks so tired the acting is so oldfashioned and the plot and characters so drab that it should be studied instead of watched it is really a horrible waste of film stereotypes clich√©s nonsense and amateurish filmmaking i watched it in unbelievable awe with my mouth wide open how could such a film be made and more interestingly how could anyone find it funny or watchable old tired sloppy a juniorhigh skit at best there is nothing watchable there except for a study of very ancient film not good film just ancient this is not abbott and costello or laurel and hardy this is nonsense the acting is so bad that maybe it is worth it to watch just for the laugh some films are so bad that they are good but this one goes all the way around the corner and back to bad again
