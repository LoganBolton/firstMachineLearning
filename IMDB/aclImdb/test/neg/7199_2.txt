this is the first film ive watched from the italian ed wood demofilo fidani aka miles deem the above title was superfluously added later on since there exists another similarly titled 1961 movie starring richard basehart which was hammer films michael carreras one and only stab at the western the genuine italian title was originally translated as his name was sam walbash but they called him amenalthough it was actually wallach in the italian variant which of course implies a tribute of sorts to hollywood actor eli br br while certainly not unwatchably bad instances of clumsiness and ineptitude abound so that i was often cracking up into howls of laughter a horrid number by a wouldbe irresistible french chanteuse a totally irrelevant barroom brawl actors doing somersaults when being shot an aged villager doing an impromptu dance routine ineffective use indeed abuse of slowmotion and easily the most preposterous seeing gordon mitchell and lincoln tate play two gunfighters sporting the actors own names hired by the villain to kill off the title character and then never having them appear in the rest of the film at all br br lead actor robert woods is just that even down to ineffectively whispering the amens over the bodies of his victims supporting actress simonella vitelli actually the directors own daughter as the villains broad is quite a looker but unfortunately she doesnt get to do much in the film  despite having a change of heart towards the end the main musical theme is actually pretty good but again the title song is in itself quite lousy
