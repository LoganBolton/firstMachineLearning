if it were possible i would have given this sorry excuse for a movie a zero star it was by far the worse i have ever seen it was as if it were a home movie that some bored highschoolers decided to make as a joke the acting was horrific the actors didnt even react to the fact that they were being murderedbr br honestly i bought this movie by mistake the spanish title said jeepers creepers 3 so i thought hmm maybe itll be ok wrong it was honestly the worst ever i didnt get past 20 minutes of the stupid movie i skipped through chapters and nothing interesting ever seemed to happenbr br the cameramen were also terrible it was like a home movie i would never recommend anyone to watch this terrible terrible moronic movie
