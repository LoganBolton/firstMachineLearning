i rented this movie under the impression that it was scarecrow 3dark harvest thinking it was a continuation in the scarecrow slayer series another extremely laughable and all together awful series of movies i wasnt disappointed though it was just as awful if not worse than what i expected i was laughing throughout the entire movie every piece of bad acting poorly shot and cut footage and terrible special effects is what makes this movie worth rentingbr br the special features include a pathetic view into the cast and crews six months of filmingbr br favorite line the sins of my forefathers theyve trickled down to this very moment of time
