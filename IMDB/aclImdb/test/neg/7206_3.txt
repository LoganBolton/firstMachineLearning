ok i gave this a three a three it deserves only one star no questions askedbr br if your going to look at the movie seriously and take it as a legit bhorror movie than yes it will get one star but i believe it is apparent within the first minutes of the movie what we are dealing with is a piece of crapbr br with this movie me and the buddy i was watching it with could of turned it off and put on something more hollywood but instead we just decided to rip this whole movie apart from start to finish we laughed so many times it was almost if i was watching a comedybr br the acting is terrible the effects and death sequences are so bad the story complete crapbr br but the fact they are trying to make a serious horror moviepricelessbr br the most memorable part for me is when two of the characters are walking in a supposed dark basement which is clearly lit and they pretend to not be able to see bumping into bones hanging from the ceiling bahahahaha just terriblebr br so if you want to laugh at how crappy this movie is along with the fact it was made in 2004 than see this moviebr br wait why am i writing so much no one knows about this moviei doubt anyone will even read this hahahaha
