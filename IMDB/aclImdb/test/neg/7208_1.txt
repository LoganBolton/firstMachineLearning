dark harvest 3 scarecrow 1 out of 10 in einsteins theory of relativity time is of the perspective of the one that views time or so ive heard in other words this movie feels a lot longer that an hour and change even on fastforward and you will be reaching for that fast forward button it clocks in somewhere around eternitybr br if you are familiar with lionsgates own version of project greenlight this is where they buy a home movie but a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror section of your local walmart you will not be surprised by the complete and utter lack of entertainment value contained withinbr br the line reading i refuse to call it acting is uniformly awful this is a collection of deadbeat dads and strippers pretending to be in a movie between cans of schlitz the camera work is drunken father shooting vacation film quality and while the special effects are okay the scariest effect is the breast augmentation scars in the nude scenebr br the story is awful the sets are from a haunted halloween put on by adhd middle school students and once again the line reading remember this is not acting anymore than sinking to the bottom of a pool is swimming is distracting beyond mere words avoid
