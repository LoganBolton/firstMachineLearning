spoilers the original road house is one of those movies that i know is clich√©d and unoriginal yet its done so well im embarrassed to admit i really like it turns out many of my friends whose movie opinions i respect think the same way so when they attempt to make a sequel to it and its as if it was written by some high school kids who were given the rights to do a sequel its just bad really really badbr br oddly johnathon schaech is listed as one of the writers and i can only hope his wga membership is revoked the writing was just bad and all the writers of this film should retire for complete lack of originality and some of the worst dialog in this millennium schaech already appearing to be the king of the straighttodvd sequel 8mm 2 poison ivy 2 and now after seeing this and 8mm 2 im thinking his acting ability is nonexistent he was awful just awfulbr br and its not the terrible fighting scenes that make this movie terrible but take it from me theyre bad every fight scene is a slowly delivered punch yet still making the wiff sound in the air that is then blocked by the opponent who returns a punch that sends the first guy to the ground this is repeated throughout the film worse than any bad 1970s cop show or the fact that many of the people involved in the fights seem to have a mouth full of cherry koolaid for some reason and were supposed to believe will patton is a fighting machine his fight scenes look so amazingly fake i was honestly embarrassed watching br br its the complete lapses of logic in this ridiculous movie that make it terrible for instance johnathon schaechs character is in town for a day and already tells some girl he barely knows who he has no idea what side shes on im with the feds but dont tell anyone the female villain who fights the good girl in one fight scene with acrobatics that rival any super hero yet is easily held down by the will patton old guy in another scene by simply holding both her hands while he utters some ridiculous line stab me once shame on you stab me twice aint gonna happen whew thats bad and then headbutts her jake buseys villain shoots at the feds while caught in the middle of a drug deal yet no dea agents or anyone simply go to his place and pick him up after in fact hes simply let go because this is the sheriffs territory busey wants the bar because its in a great location for drug deals yet his own house appears to be just as good apparently offering all the perks the bar is supposed to have johnathon schaechs character is supposed to be the son of patrick swayzes character in the original yet swayzes characters last name is dalton and schaechs isnt nor is the supposed brother of swayzes character and johnathon schaech looks about 50 in this movie i looked it up hes 17 years younger than swayze but he looks awfulbr br but my favorite absolutely stupid scene in this movie was the most stock fight scene ending in movies the villain is knocked through a window on a second floor and as they pan down im thinking please dont tell me hes impaled on something and sure enough my worst fears were realizedbr br actually i could go on for another half hour about the things i hated about this movie suffice to say lets put an end to these ridiculous straighttodvd sequels to theatrical movies at least the ones with johnathon schaech
