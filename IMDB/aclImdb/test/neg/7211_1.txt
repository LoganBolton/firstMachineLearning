directtovideo is a phrase that never sounds promising to the consumer unless its a directtovideo sequel to something that went directtovideo in the first place despite this studios have insisted on releasing numerous directtovideo sequels over the years to cult hits i dont think it even needs to be mentioned that these sequels rank among some of the worst titles of all time including the hitcher ii starship troopers 2 and cruel intentions 3 its fitting that road house 2 was helmed by scott ziehl as he was also the man in charge of ruining the cruel intentions series like his entry in the cruel intentions trilogy ziehl takes elements that made the first road house a great guy flick and rehashes them with no success whatsoever this is no sequel this is a remake all the way various lines from the original are repeated plot points cut and pasted and scenes are replicated almost shotforshot from the first one the one thing that could not be duplicated were the amazing fight scenes which made road house what it was here we get clumsily directed fight sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly planned out and shot within an hour compare that with its predecessors fight scenes that look like they took months and months to prepare ziehl is capable of directing action as he did well with the 2001 remake of earth vs the spider but none of the talent shown there comes through in this mess its not completely his fault as the screenplay is very very poorly written and clunky i dont care if something goes directtovideo a good script is still required someone should keep that mind while continuously churning these lowbudget directtodvd movies out skip it entirely 110
