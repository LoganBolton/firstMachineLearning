i happened to see a promo for this movie on spike channel last night it was grouped with a patrick swazy rerun of another movie he made and thought swazy was in this sequelboy was i wrongi see the screen writer also starred in it and im thinking the budget was a bit tight i am surprised to see will patton in the film he has far better credits to his name to be playing in a c movie like this bussey jr was trying so hard to portray the image of his fatherone of the best bad guy actors ever that failed miserably the only redeeming qualities in the movie was the chicksgood looking and with lots of ta just not worth the time or your hard earned dollar to rent it
