the original road house was a classic cheesy 80s movie which although it didnt have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting was a very enjoyable and popular film largely due to the presence of star patrick swayze and the great supporting cast along with some excellent fight scenes and eye candybr br 16 years later and mgm  sony attempts to recreate the magic which left us all quoting one liners and reciting the three rules of bouncing with a movie which quotes all the originals best one liners and recites the three rulesbr br were this an amateur fan made film it would be seen as a loving homage to one of the most popular of swayzes movies as a professionally made film it falls flat on its face right into the dvd bargin bin with its continual reuse of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than cool references to the originalbr br having said that with new lines such as im gonna kill you just like i killed your father no wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original scriptbr br i knew this was never going to be anything special being a straight to dvd sequel but i had at least hoped that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh things included to live up to the road house name but what you get is simply just a 2006 remake of the same film with a little narcotics added inbr br were i the director id have removed all references to the first film so as not to tarnish the original and its characters as it is we got patrick swayzes character now supposed to be dead killed off screen in a lame way by jake busey and his brother and son now the main characters who strangely enough have completely different surnamesbr br my favourite part was that daltons son drove the same car his father did a genuinely cool homage although it was later ruined by having the car meet its end exactly the same way as its predecessor did thats a good example of how this film goes too far in including sequences and ideas from the 89 moviebr br also of course who can forget the legendary moment where wild bill promises to kill shane just like i killed your father and then proceeds to attempt to dispatch him in a completely different manner amazing writing there i see schaech is listed as coscreenwriter stick to acting or preferably nothingbr br overall though this is an ok film if theres nothing else to watch and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and a half or if you havent seen the first road house but hardcore fans of swayzes classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the first as someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film even jeff healy is glad he wont be seeing this one stick to the original road house and relive the good old swayze days
