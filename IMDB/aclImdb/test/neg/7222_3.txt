riggs and murtough are back but the magic of the first film has disintegrated the story line is just awful i mean really south african diplomats smuggling the mythical krugerrands into the us its just painful and the accents are absolutely abysmal can no one get an afrikaans south african accent right or will we forever hear the british or americans making them sound like drunken hollanders the only guy who got the afrikaans accent right was tim robbins in catch a fire another thing about this movie that i disliked was when danny glover so artlessly describes an afrikaans accent as being shitty i mean what a slap in the face to the afrikaans theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit i mean mel gibsons character is like so against the diplomats but then sleeps with their pa type dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film if you want to see a film that doesnt completely insult a cultural group then rent die hard 2
