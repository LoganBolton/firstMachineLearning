has some really good music and performances kid creole and the coconuts james white and the blacks dna tuxedo moon the plastics melle mel vincent gallo lydia lunchetc but aside from this there isnt much more to it the dialog especially the narrationby saul williams is actually pretty good but the performances are all pretty bland or outright bad no matter how many hipsters are thrown in debbie harry and jean micheal basquitthe latter being the leading role both still dont have enough cultural cred to keep this film from being a novelty item it goes for the a jack kerouac style roving spontaneity but doesnt have the insight to keep it moving along which is where the band performances come in i guess its pretty balanced in that regard between great music and bad acting and i did enjoy it but i just expected more though it does have a fairy tale ending
