as if the world hadnt already got enough cheap jaws imitations writer boaz davidson decided to make the sequel to his ropeybutreasonablyenjoyable creaturefeature octopus a complete ripoff of spielbergs classic right down to having a concerned cop who noone believes and a mayor more worried about his 4th july celebrations than peoples livesbr br even in the hands of an extremely skilled director it is unlikely that this derivative rubbish could have been anything other than hokey bmovie garbage but with yossi wein yes the yossi wein calling the shots behind the camera a man with a fraction of mrspielbergs talent i estimate about 110000th octopus 2 is guaranteed to be every bit as bad as one might imaginebr br the predictable and extremely clich√©d plot isnt worth describing in much detail substitute jaws amity island with new york and bruce the shark with a giant rubber octopus and youll get the gist although several points about the film are definitely worth mentioning simply because they are so funny all of the octopus attacks involve the actors struggling to make incredibly fakelooking giant tentacles look real which is hilarious to behold bulgarias capital sofia unconvincingly stands in for new york and overuse of stock footage makes the illusion even less convincing best of all a silly dream sequence that sees the rubber octopus attacking our hero atop the statue of liberty is not only gutbustingly stupid but also features some truly dreadful special effectsbr br davidsons script also doesnt know when to quit there are several points in this film at which it couldve and probably shouldve ended but the action goes on and on with the octopus surviving several explosions and causing a tunnel to collapse trapping the films love interest and a bunch of kids before finally being blown to smithereens by the herobr br sometimes very silly always awful technically but never actually scary this stv stinker may find fans amongst those who actively seek out cinematic trash most normal people however would be advised to steer well clear
