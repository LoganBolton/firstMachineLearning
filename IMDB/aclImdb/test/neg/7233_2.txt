i purchased this film on dvd for Â£4 but it was a waste the film is very bad the plot is your average monster film where it kills a few people the mayorchief doesnt believe it and they fight it at the endbr br on the plus side the film quality is very good and the setting of new york is impressive for a budget film  as opposed to a small coastal town the acting is reasonable toobr br however the special effects mainstage in a monster film are laughable and the addition of a random bus load of kids to the plot half way through just gets weird the ending is just badbr br in summary whenever you have a chance to see this dont  there will be something better onbr br rtc true horror films dont have a pg rating
