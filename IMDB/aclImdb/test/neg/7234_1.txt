greetings moviegoers as i watch octopus ii i contemplate the inherent lameness of the octopuscrocdino horror genre many moviegoers may blame the poor acting nonsensical screenplay or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the ocd movie to flounder these reasons may indeed be floundering factors but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an ocd movie that is at the heart of the lamenessbr br you see the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic lifesize ocd and the cgi technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters even with clever cinematography you can only film the semidark depths of the seasemidark forestsemidark cavesemidark corridor so many times before the scifi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely the ocd subgenre that isbr br what can be done you ask i wouldnt suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness but another avenue needs to be explored we cant really go back to the days of the fadetoblack cue that someone has been killed or can we if we cant reach the goal of realism we have to compensate in other ways such as plot twists innuendo and photoingenuitybr br it will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness so common to the ocd subgenre will be cured
