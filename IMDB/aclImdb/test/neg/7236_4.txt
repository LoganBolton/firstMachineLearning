this is the sequel to octopusbr br pff ok a lot of stock footage but pretty good im surprised that they actually had a giant robot octopus that actually didnt look that bad i was actually quite surprised by thatbr br the movie overall was just ok fun it never explained how the octopus got so big and isnt linked it anyway to the first but it was still funbr br the ending me and my friend laughed at basically after blowing the octopus up once the two main characters launch a bomb and five explosions most stock footage appear on screen we joked that they went to the dollar store and bought a five missiles in one toy believe me it has to be seen to believe overall just stupid fun worth giving a chance buying if its cheap
