the salena incident is by far the director dustin rikerts best film  which isnt saying much in his past films and i use the term films loosely the director takes ideas from hollywood blockbusters and severely marginalizes them the salena incident is no different the movie is basically con air meets aliens done with the semblance of your average film school production the film is riddled with outoffocus shots and plagued by special effects that would have trouble rivaling most high school computer animation classes for example almost every onscreen explosion is the same fire effect matted over the screenbr br the weak effects and production value are only compromised by a flawed plot and rocky dialogue in a sentence the story strings together like an exposition of overused hollywood clich√©s the movie begins with the worst cgi alien ship ever made crashing into the worst cgi earth ever made and a team of army somethings going down to investigate next a bus of prison transports carrying the worst of the worst from across the state is overthrown by the prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with silicon implants the prisoners escape and run into the town of salena where they encounter the aliens who shock have escaped from an alien prison transport carrying the worst of the worst from across the galaxy the prisoners and their captive police armed with only guns and sad puns have to fight off the aliens and escape the town before the international space alliance rolls eyes bombs the city into oblivionbr br the only real enjoyable parts of the movie are when the actors who are clearly undermined by the script are given the freedom to improvise and also when they fight off the smaller of the alien creatures in a flurry of gun fire other than that the movie really isnt worth anyones time let alone the plastic that the dvd is made out of how awful was it lets just say the secretary of defense is about 90 years old works in a room that is about as high tech 1950s real estate office and is wearing a looney tunes tie yes if that wasnt clear enough before the man in charge of the pentagon is wearing a tie with bugs bunny and the road runner on it the movie basically culminates hahahahhaaa did i say culminates with the last remaining soldier running into the group of prisoners and guards and the new formed team fighting their way away from the vicious aliens  which for some strange reason leads them straight back to the alien ship yeahbr br the movie has heart but is riddled with horrible direction and even worse camera work someone seriously needed to slap the dp and tell him there is more to cinematography than repetitive stagnant chestlevel shots this movie really isnt worth renting if it ever makes it that far being that its not as horribly bad as the last films made by the director which reduces the laughability but its nowhere near watchable cinema
