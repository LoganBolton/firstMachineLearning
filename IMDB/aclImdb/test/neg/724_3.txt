this is one of four 1970s movies by tv writer lane slate about sensationalistic murders in small towns they feature likable tv personalities as police chiefs and quirky characters as town regulars including lighttouch love interests the others are they only kill their masters james garner 1972 and the girl in the empty grave and deadly game both andy griffith 1977br br aldas is set near vermont mount angel next to horse creek the others in california garners at seaside eden landing and griffiths in the mountains jasper lake all try to capture the feel of a small town to move at a relaxed pace among comfortable characters and to tell a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turn to it on that level they are somewhat entertaining that they were often rerun itself suggests they have some appeal but they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue slack pacing bland settings flat or exaggerated characters and offputting forced attempts often juvenile or crude at color or humorbr br aldas and garners are the most serious about story characters pacing and tone they have the best supporting casts though aldas is put to better use the griffith casts pale in comparison aldas has the best directorbr br shocking has some surprise and drama the killers method is inventive the tone is more even and the dialogue more natural than in griffiths aldas film does not suffer like the others from smug bigcity transplants to the town or from hokey exaggerated local characters both of which come across as figments of a hollywood scriptwriter not as genuine the worst offender is the griffith movies pipsqueak mumbling moron whit who we are told tried to hook a jeep up to and make off with a trailer serving as a temporary bank branch dragged away the dock for the police boat stole tomatoes from a farmers truck only to get nothing for them and filled out 11 on the withdrawal slip of spiro t babylis only to be discovered by the teller mercifully absent is the clunky heavyhanded repetitivestyle dialogue from the griffith movies you going to lunch im going to take out the boat you going to take the boat to lunch im not going to lunch youre not going to take the boat to lunch there arent any fish in this lake why are you fishing here its illegal in horse mountain its posted here too youre breaking the law some law there arent any fish in this lake then why are you fishing here i told you its illegal in horse mountain please call me lloyd my name is lloyd okay lloyd call me lloyd thats my name my name is lloydbr br but alda is too lowkey and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a smalltime police chief certainly not a redhot lawman in demand by a rival town slate has the character admit as much when he comes late to the scene of a by then obvious clue as a result of an accidental name recognition rather than detect or investigate barnes strikes out blindly in emotional denial his secretary lasser feeds him a key clue why didnt i think of that he says an embarrassing funeral scene plus a plot contrivance leads to another gift cluebr br worse barnes is more interested in deriding the militarystyle helmets of the county police sent to help him deadly game also suggests slate has something against the military than leading them or his own men effectively he allows a late murder by incompetently guarding a known target barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer fleeing one crime scene without drawing his gun or trying to take control again he is ineffective and nearly killed in the climactic scene which results from multiple errors on his part that are only partially corrected by accident the erratic northeastern accent that alda affects does not help believabilitybr br there are plot holes why would the killer strike after all these years and committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible but they are nothing compared to later ones  a couple together a shopkeeper in his store during business hours a fully clothed deputy seated in his office and unbelievably his dogbr br aldas movie also suffers from some offensive elements that slate injects into all the movies barnes first appears in a motel clerks bed he then treats her rudely at every turn and insults and tries to avoid her kids this and talk about the female doctor smack of a crude meanspirited pattern garners film has been described as sleazy including a scene where he and a deputy laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy in the car with her griffiths feature an ersatz ropers routine in which the woman embarrassingly tries to coax the man into the supply closet a gratuitous lockerroomtype exchange with a deputy in discussing a young womans car accident death did you take her out i took her in once a reference to bank teller bernice as swollenup in places and to sticking a pin in her and to hating and firing secretary maude because she was too hairy a description of the female doctors practice as two stirrup tables and a flashlight a humiliating scene in which fran ryan propositions griffith offering some home grown and an insulting subplot in which a woman pursued by a deputy played as a drippy buffoon seems to sleep aroundbr br finally aldas film has a grim bleachedout colorless lifeless look and feel only louise lasser adds spark at least the other films had some spirit scenery and pleasant music griffiths got out onto the mountainside onto the lake and even out into the big city you feel more like rewatching masters or empty grave than shocking
