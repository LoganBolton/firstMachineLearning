this movie starts by showing you a map and then explaining radar and it is quite awhile before you ever see the deadly mantis probably a better movie in the 50s this dated piece is a bit to slow moving and the pay off in the end isnt very good though it has its moments like when the guy from perry mason argues with an old man and when he says i have narrowed the possibilities to one excuse me but when you narrow something down you have a couple or more possibilities not oneif you get it down to one you havent narrowed it down but you have in fact figured out what it is the monster is standard 50s scifi fair better than say the grasshoppers in the beginning of the end acting is subpar and the heroine is the most unattractivein fact in some shots she does look like a guy in drag you see plenty of fighter plane stock footage and other things but you wont see much at all of the deadly mantis
