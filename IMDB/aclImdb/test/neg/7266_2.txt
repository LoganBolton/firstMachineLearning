what can i say about the pleasure planet that i havent said about umpteen other tedious soft core porn films  very little  its just another movie with a very weak plot used to set up very unconvincing set scenes between male non actors who spend too much time in the gym and bimbos who have obviously had silicon implants  actually the sex scenes in this movie are somewhat less convincing than you usually see in this type of film as the cast members grind their hips together giving pained expressions like theyve got constipation or something  no wonder a lot of people claim sex is over rated  theyve probably watched too many of these films on late night cable stations
