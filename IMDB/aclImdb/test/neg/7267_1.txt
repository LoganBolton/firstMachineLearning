honest to god the outline pretty much says it all the planet andromina not to be confused with aunt jemima is represented by a cheap la stripclub theres no strippers so the most recent male visitors go off to recruit strippersbr br the men get mistaken for kings or arrested for spying on women although despite the fact its a planet of women we only get two women who participate in any girlgirl sex scenes and eventually as always happen in science fiction cliche movies everywhere the women become convinced that men are good for something well not the men who made this movie at any ratebr br but boy do we get to see a lot of that something in prodigious amounts of softcore sex and nudity this one has less plot then usual for such flicks so change the channel if you dont like this kind of movie and grit your teeth if youre into this kind of thing
