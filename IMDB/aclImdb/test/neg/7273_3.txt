i decided to watch this ultralow budget film from the poverty row studio prc because it costarred the exciting character actor lionel atwillplus i really liked the title even though atwill often played in these cheap movies his excellent style of acting always made the films seem a lot better as his screen persona was great his real life is also quite interestingsort of like a bizarre soap opera the reason i use the term poverty row is that this was a nickname given to the very cheapest and worst production companies of the era many of these werent even real studios but production companies that rented space and sets from the major studios at night yes there is a good chance this was filmed after normal working hoursa common thing for such studiosbr br the story begins with lionel atwill telling his friends a story about something that he was involved with years ago a doctor falls in love with a lady but hes afraid to tell her about himself thats because his job is putting people to death on death rownot exactly a glamor job the doc asks his friend atwill for advice on how to break it to her but regardless she wont have the man later you realize its because her own parents were criminalsbr br later a man is killed and the lady is implicatedthough its obvious to anyone with a brain that her sister was involved and is a bit of a nut and the evidence against the lady was poor but apparently the jury was filled with brainless people and she was convicted and sent to death row even more brainless is that her old boyfriend was the man who was responsible for her execution dont you think someone else might just be able to handle this case until this fateful hour her friend atwill spends much of the film trying to prove her innocenceand prove that the flaky sister knows far more about the case than shell admitbr br overall the movie is only mildly interesting and a bit silly while it is watchable and atwill is good as usual the rest of the film never really rises above the mundane and some of the acting is pretty shabby its subpar and about what youd expect from such a lowbudget flickand nothing more despite the cool title
