lord this sucked theres a particular sort of sexual revolution flick from the 60s that manages to confuse sexual assault with sexual liberation this film is an example i lost track of how many times women are slapped hit whipped or spanked in the film and then there are all the times that women in the film fantasize about being slapped hit whipped or spanked you know they want it right sometimes it is ostensibly part of safe fetish playacting other times it plainly isnt but you will wait in vain to see the heroine report to authorities that she has just been raped instead we get to hear her being lectured by her rapist about her inability to let gobr br every scene of this film reeks of misogyny speaking as a straight white married man in his late 30s not a teenage lesbian womens studies major with a chip on her shoulder lest you get the wrong ideabr br perhaps the one good thing about this film is that it provides a stark reminder of just how bad things really were for women only a few short decades ago
