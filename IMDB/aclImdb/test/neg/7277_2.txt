the hills have eyes is not a great film by any stretch of the imaginationfor one the villains look almost normalnot what you would expect deranged lunatics to look likefor another the pacing is very slow at times and there are many scenes of the characters repeating themselvesby thati mean there is a lot of filler in the movie with a lot of running around aimlesslythe film didnt have a clear directionthe plot of the movie is hardly originaleven for its timethe texas chainsaw massacre came out a few year earlier and is a much more effective film as far as horror goesthe film has little in the way of scares and the pounding soundtrack just served to be both grating and distracting all at oncei suppose the music was used to cover up the fact that not much happens through much of the movie though it failed in its intended purposei basically kept looking at the time every few seconds hoping something would happen or it would end when something finally did happen any promise the film had was ruined by mere chaos and loud noisei sat through it because i like to give a film the benefit of the doubtyes there is some loud screamingand yes people diebut who caresmuch too slow getting to any sort of pay offif you can call it thatmy buddy enjoyed it so at least one of us got something out of itthe hills have eyes isnt the worst film we could have watched but i doubt i will watch it againthis film was remade in 2006 and i will also have review of that versionanyway this movie was painfully slow at times while other times was chaotic and repetitiveunless you like watching paint dry occasionally interspersed with someone running around your block screaming their head off stay away from this moviea better bet would be the original texas chainsaw massacre197315 out of 10 which is being generous
