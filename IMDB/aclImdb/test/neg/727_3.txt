when i first watch this series the impression i got was that the characters were charming and funny lorelai and rory in particular were witty and intelligent conversationalist albeit a bit too talkative after watching it for some time however my opinion changedbr br the main characters slowly revealed themselves to be selfcentered selfobsessed narcissists who treated tiny wounds to their pride as the worst insults in their existence for example rory wouldnt speak to her mother for months when lorelai didnt consult her on her impulsive marriage while lorelai dumped luke for simply wanting a little time to adjust to his new life circumstances these people are shallow see themselves as the center of the universe where everyone else should behave exactly according to how their own rigid rules and if they dont they will hold grudges against them for an eternity they dont want to see other peoples problems and treat the smallest slight as the gravest offence most of the characters appear to lack the ability to behave in a grownup way they think they should do whatever that they wanted and everyone else be damnedbr br the series is characterbased so when the main characters became so unlikeable the show also became impossible to watch i still have the rest of the series but i doubt if i will ever finish watching them i will also hold anyone who think highly of the show and its awful characters with the greatest suspicion  they must just as horrid as lorelai et al
