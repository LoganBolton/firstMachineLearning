infamous horror films seldom measure up the hype that surrounds them and i have yet to come across a worse offender than wes cravens the hills have eyes having held back from watching this for years i was really pleased when i got it for christmas and waited for an evening when my girlfriend was out to settle down and watch it  knowing her extreme dislike for anything genuinely horrifying i neednt have botheredbr br after a promising  if familiar  start that firmly sets the film in the desolution usa world of survival horror things rapidly go to pieces when the protagonists and antagonists meet in the deserted wastelandbr br looking like it was shot on a budget of 5 with the cannibal clans costumes hired from a dodgy fancy dress shop that specialises in faux caveman and red indian attire the story follows an annoying bunch of unsympathetic wasps who take a detour on a road trip to california to look for a silver mine in a nuclear testing zone  when they break down they are set upon by the local family of flesheaters and have to fight to survivebr br while hoping for another deliverance texas chainsaw massacre wrong turn or devils rejects i actually realised id stumbled across something that should have remained dusty and unwatched in a backstreet video stores bargain binbr br with gallons of tomato ketchup for blood and a couple of gruesome wound closeups i can kind of see how an 18 certificate in the uk is justified but with those closeups trimmed this wouldnt have looked out of place as a saturday afternoon thriller on itvbr br the whole silver minenuclear test site subplot is just a mcguffin to justify pitching the civilised family against the primitives but given how easily the savages get their asses whupped it stretches credibility to think that they had survived for a generation preying on passersbybr br and then theres the ending  or lack thereof the hills have eyes seems to be missing either a third act or at the very least a satisfying denouement instead i was just left wondering yeah and
