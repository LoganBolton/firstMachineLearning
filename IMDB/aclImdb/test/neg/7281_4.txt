i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after i dont know how folks bleed over there in japan but i hope they have plenty of blood donors
