hanabi has many quiet moments and fairly slow pacing unfortunately during the many thoughtful interludes the viewer is left to ponder about the recent scenes just watched and many questions surface and annoybr br for example why didnt the wheelchair guy drown in the ocean when he was stuck in the sand and the tide came up around him there was no rescue seen or hinted atbr br can it be true that japanese police are so inept and unskilled at arrest procedures as to not first remove the suspects ability to reach for a weapon these detectivelevel japanese police seemed to have no experience dealing with a suspectbr br why doesnt the right eye of the lead character blink having one eye blinking was distracting and it went unexplainedbr br what exactly was the lead character spending all his money on to have to borrow so much from loan sharks he was not seen gambling being a non entrylevel government employee his wife must have had full health insurancebr br what was the single man doing all by himself in the middle of nowhere in the nature park what was his reason for being therebr br how in the world could the gangsters find the lead character and his wife up in the far off nature reserve it made no sensebr br and again how could the gangsters later find the lead character and his wife up in the remote mt fuji resort there were absolutely no clues available for these gangsters to even know which country the lead character and his wife were in let alone the correct specific location at the correct specific timebr br and a third same question how could the junior detectives know which few feet of the japanese coast line to find the lead character and his wife the japanese coast line must be vast were all of these characters supposed to have psychic powersbr br two final questions the cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach  where did she come from she seemed to have no transportation or companions with her and why in the world did she still keep attempting to fly what was left of her kite after it was ripped in pieces this was weird unintentionally pythonesquebr br on the positive side i loved the background music it was dramatic and flowing and added much to this movie the photography imagery and art were pleasing to the eyebr br one final point the wife was overly pleasing to the eye not once did she ever come close to looking like a dying sick person she looked very healthy if anything these people seemed depressed and mentally ill and not physically sick the husband treated his wife as perhaps a newly outed gay man would treat a respected wife a love of friendship but not close tendernessbr br a mixed movie for sure
