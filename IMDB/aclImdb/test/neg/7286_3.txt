hi there i watched the first part when it came out and i dont remember having left such a bad impression on me as this onebr br first the animation is choppy wooden not worked on lacks naturality  i understand the drawing style was to be of some atlantean kind but it could be done with the usual disney finesse see tarzan to see what i mean if i didnt see the disney logo in the beginning i would never say it was a disney moviebr br second the plot was more like a pc game style like a good old quest not that it was bad but it lacked a story that binds the viewer to the characters and their goals it was inconvincing at least the film was meant for children but this was waaay to childish at timesbr br third the music i would say it was improper but it just fits the whole scene with the plot and animationbr br overall i think this was some kind of an amusement just bytheway kind of project by several apprentice animators just to fill in the count for disney movies sorry to hear that from myself a big disney lover
