i am finding that i get less and less excited about disneys sequels to movies yes i do understand that the budget for the direct to video movies are not the same but these movies dont even try some examples are hunchback ii and tarzan and jane if anyone has seen the previews for stitchthe movie you will see my point but i digress this movie reaffirms my point the animation is sloppy the story lines resemble saturday morning cartoons and not all of the original voices are there i was very disappointed not to hear michael j foxs voice it was so glaringly obvious that the person doing milos voice was trying to sound like fox but didnt come close to succeeding br br if it says anything my children ages 10 and 6 didnt even sit through the whole movie
