this movie was horrible and it doesnt even deserve to be called a movie the way i look at it its more like three mediocre daytime disney cartoon episodes strung loosely together to make a single video that pretends to be the sequel to the first atlantis movie which was way more wellmade and enjoyable and where do i even begin with the problems of this dvd the story the characters the picturesanimation to me theyre all bad and unwatchable firstly the story in this directtovideo dvd is ridiculous and pointless the only good thing about it is that it is consistentthat is consistently bad from the beginning to the end after the films over i still dont know why milo has returned and how the incidents occur in the three small stories are related to each other or to atlantis itself and all i could remember about this movie was how bad it makes me feel after seeing it the characters feel wooden and lack personality and the drawings look a lot different than that in the first you can tell theyre obviously not from the hands of the same animators from the first one as the dvd played on i found myself caring less and less about what might happen to the characters and just hoping the film would end soon besides the story and the characters mentioned above the picture quality is poor in this one too probably one of the worst in those directtovideo products that disney has ever released as a fan of the the original atlantis the lost empire i couldnt be more disappointed in milos return which is a total waste of time and money thank goodness i rented it first instead of buying it even so i still wish id never seen this crap or even known its existence
