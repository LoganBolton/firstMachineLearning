i wish i could find some good things to say about this animated sequelbut not really a sequelto atlantisthe lost empirebut this would be a very short commentthe magic that the first one had is nowhere to be found herethe animation is pretty poor all overthe characters themselves are not very well drawnthe backgrounds and the foregrounds are also not goodtheres very little attention to detail hereand instead of a compelling and engaging storywe have 3 short stories which are boring and dont make a lot of sensei sweareven the characters sounded like they were boredand would rather be somewhere elsewhich says that the voice actors were bored and wanted to be someplace elseat least thats the impressionsome of the same actors return for this dismal effortbut an integral par of the success of the first one was michael jfox as the main hero milo thatchi get the distinct impression this movie was just thrown together to capitalize on the success of the first onewithout much thought or carebut at least cree summer returns as the voice of kidathats probably the only good thing about this movieand even she doesnt seem to have her heart completely in itmind youi guess you couldnt blame any of the cast for not giving their allconsidering what they had to work withor rather not work withthis is a straight to video movieand i use the term looselywhich should have went straight to the nearest landfillanywayshame on disneyconsumers deserve much better than thisthis one gets a 010 and a well deserved one at thatpu
