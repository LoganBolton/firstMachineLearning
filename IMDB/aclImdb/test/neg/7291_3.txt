what the beep is going wrong with disney the last years are there totally run out of good ideas where is the magic where are the good animators the good songwriters the good directors the good okay i know walt himself and the famous nine old man cant come back but is this a reason to crank out countless of those cheap sequels and slowly but surely destroying the ideals of walt disney i never rent or bought a disneysequel of what movie however because i had read much enough about its absence of quality but atlantis milos return was aired today on tv in germany and so i watch it it confirmed my doubts about sequels it was absolutely boring flaw animation primitive colorrotation simple characters some unsuccessful tries to simulate the famous multiplanecamera with cgi mediocre music and a patchwork of different simple stories it looks absolutely not like disney not like disney i know it looks like one of the countless cheap and simple animationseries like dragonballz beyblade etc that aired every day on tv for childrenbr br my first reaction after showing this crap was to load bambi in my dvdplayer to see disneys immortal magic depth spirit and charm again to see disney on its climax again to see the awesome art of handmade animation again bambi was the first and until today the only movie that i give 10 out of 10 stars but atlantis milos return no magic no depth no charm no spirit it deserved only 3 out of 10
