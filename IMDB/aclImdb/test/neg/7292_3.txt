when i put this movie in my dvd player and sat down with a coke and some chips i had some expectations i was hoping that this movie would contain some of the strongpoints of the first movie awsome animation good flowing story excellent voice cast funny comedy and a kickass soundtrack but to my disappointment not any of this is to be found in atlantis milos return had i read some reviews first i might not have been so let down the following paragraph will be directed to those who have seen the first movie and who enjoyed it primarily for the points mentionedbr br when the first scene appears your in for a shock if you just picked atlantis milos return from the displaycase at your local videoshop or whatever and had the expectations i had the music feels as a bad imitation of the first movie and the voice cast has been replaced by a not so fitting one with the exception of a few characters like the voice of sweet the actual drawings isnt that bad but the animation in particular is a sad sight the storyline is also pretty weak as its more like three episodes of schoobydoo than the single adventurous story we got the last time but dont misunderstand its not very good schoobydoo episodes i didnt laugh a single time although i might have sniggered once or twicebr br to the audience who havent seen the first movie or dont especially care for a similar sequel here is a fast review of this movie as a standalone product if you liked schoobydoo you might like this movie if you didnt you could still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do and i suspect it might be a good kids movie but i wouldnt know it might have been better if milos return had been a threeepisode series on a cartoon channel or on breakfast tv
