because disney more often than not ignores the animation quality and a need for a good plot in their sequels this was actually a nice surprise i dont know why disney does not pay more attention to their sequels the graphics quality is always inferior no backgrounds worthy of the name disney inane plots and worse dialog with little or no attention given to the actual story and the caricature drawings are almost always worse than saturday morning cartoons in detail and qualitybr br the animation quality is still poor when compared to disney originals and the dialog is quite trite the story line and overall execution was really quite enjoyable br br while it is not as captivating it does not completely fail to capture the charm andor mystery from the first there is some hint of it tucked away here and therebr br the children will like it at any ratebr br it rates a 4510 frombr br the fiend
