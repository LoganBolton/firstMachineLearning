if youve seen atlantis 1 then youd know that what made that film truly great was brilliant animation and a good script this movie was so sloppily drawn and animated the story is also dopey i was so disappointed in this halfbaked drivel that i couldnt make it past the first hour and man did i try the one thing this film had was that it expanded the mole character making him both more sympathetic and three dimensional take it from me judge this junk from the cover on the video box the cover is poorly drawn disney schlock clearly grabbing for an easy buck from an unsuspecting parent if this was a stand alone flick it wouldnt be so bad but riding on the coattails of a brilliant piece like atlantis makes it utterly inexcuseable
