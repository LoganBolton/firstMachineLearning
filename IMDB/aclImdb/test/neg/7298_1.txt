this film is far and wide and beyond any shadow of a doubt the single worst and most contemptible film in the history of the universebr br it really is that badbr br personally i have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible film and rented this one thinking it would be one of those to my immense disappointment it was notbr br the script is delivered in a way that sounds as if theyre reading the lines directly off placards the story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and the actual film looks like it was shot on a home video camera i couldnt even finish watching it it is even worse than witch academy and thats quite a feat in itselfbr br i cannot even begin to fathom how a director could shoot this film and then still have the sense to believe it was decent enough to releasebr br painful awful horrendous
