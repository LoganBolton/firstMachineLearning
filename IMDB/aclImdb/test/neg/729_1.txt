usually when i dont see a show on an original run i find it later on cable and realize its a gem the gimore girls is one of those rare exceptions im glad i missed itbr br i truly despise shows that fill every minute of the actors space with rambling stupid boring banter this is one hour of just that the mother lorelei made me wonder if she is bipolar and off her lithium she never stopped talking every minute every second talking to every person she interacted with worse yet her speech is childish and soooo like valley girl she talked about guys her hair her mother her clothes like whats the sitch for situation ive watched this show three times and still dont get the point of this series its not a comedy its not a drama it has no point except to make three generations of females in one family look like the girls from planet mars the males by comparison are smart and make the show somewhat watchable if lorelei ever existed and attempted to latch onto me with conversation id have to mace her to get rid of her she obviously doesnt know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else she also doesnt know how to really notice the existence of othersbr br in one show lorelei comes home from a date close to 10 pm she got the date after pursuing a guy she met at an auction she goes into her daughters room where the daughter asks how it went she dithers on about how boring the guy was her date somehow got a few words in edgewise lorelei complained about how the man didnt stop talking choke hopefully the date learned how fortunate he wasbr br one other person here commented on how the mother acts like a teen and the daughter is the adult personality lorelei even dresses like her kid this obviously 40something mom dresses and looks like she hit the mall with her high school pals in towbr br i thought that this show should have been followed by just shoot me because thats exactly how i felt
