a postapocalyptic warrior goes off to save some kind of nun and on the way meets some cyberpunks on skates who want to kick his ass this is one of the hardest to watch films ever there are scenes with silence that seems to last hours before somebody comes out with the next badly written badly acted line there are action sequences that keep repeating  and were not talking the quickfire 123 action repeat on a particularly good kick that was made popular by eastern directors were talking many many repeats of long bad fight sequences this is incredibly confusing at first but then quickly becomes annoying as youre watching a 30 second sequence for the 2nd 3rd and 4th time any kind of plot or vision is lost within the confusing continuity the only thing thats keeps this film in the videoplayer apart from the bet from a friend that i couldnt watch it all the way through without begging for it to be turned off and disposed off safely so it may harm noone else is the fact that although painful this film is unintentionally hilarious im not at all a fan of those so bad that its funny type of films but at parts i was in tears other points to note are the quality of the sound and picture but this is forgiveable as its obvious money was a major problem in the making of this film final verdict  king of the so bad theyre funny genre anybody having that kind of genre video night should get themselves a copy also lets not forget that it is actually the worst film ive ever seen
