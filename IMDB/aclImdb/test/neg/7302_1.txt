i bought this movie from a market stall three years ago i gotta hand it to you when i sat down and watched it i thought ok this is gonna be another big action bmovie obviously i was wrong while watching this film i began to realise that this movie was taking me to another planet full of crpbr br i began to get really bored and fed up with this film although i wanted to see was gonna happen in the end i really felt like it was really getting on my nervesbr br the people behind the film mayve brought some well known name actors into this project but what were they thinking even these actors couldnt save this filmbr br at the end of the film i felt like this was a waste of money just buying this low life sucker of film for a small amount of money a few months later i sent the tape off to charity i didnt want to see it againbr br sorry but if youre thinking of watching a movie and then nodding off to sleep i can highly recommend it you me ill rather go on proplus and watch something decentbr br disappointing 1 out of 10
