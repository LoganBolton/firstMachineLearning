okay lets cut to the chase  theres no way i can give this anything other then 1 out of 10 and yet you have to see it the acting is bad but is nothing like as bad as the script which itself pales before the production values cardboard axes yup weve got then car floor mats painted silver and used as armour here it isbr br the film itself pretends to be artistic but is just cheap the same shots are used repeatedly  especially in the drawn out fight scenes there is thankfully very little dialogue and there is much artistic music to ram home the horrorbr br and yet all this awfulness is compelling  you have to watch it through just so that you can say youve seen it ive not even got onto the barren sets the plot or the risible special effects this really is the how not to do it school of filmmaking this must be viewed  spread the word and let the world all join together in puzzling over what on earth is happening at the endbr br the best thing though is that they made a sequel
