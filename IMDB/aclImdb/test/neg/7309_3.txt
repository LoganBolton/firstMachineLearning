the figure of empress elizabeth of austria 18371898 is indeed mostly associated with romy schneider and the sissi trilogy by ernst marischka 1950s where beauty gentleness sweetness but also history are ever present this was the sissi perhaps myth for some however a powerful portrayal the spirit of the habsburgs grandeur as well as the spirit of the bavarian simplicity and straightforwardness influenced much those films simply they did have a soul however jean daniel verhaeghes film though made 50 years later appears to be a wrong depiction of the empress and her life it seems to be an attempt to show something different to reveal some realism as a cure to sweetness yet it does not occur to add a lot but rather deprives the whole story of much let me analyze that in more detailsbr br september 1898 sissi embarks at the port of geneva accompanied by her court maid she goes to visit dr mayer didier bezace whom she is going to tell the whole life story in order to find herself in this tragic life the action consists of flashbacks to important moments in sissis life yet these moments are chaotically presented and therefore someone not very knowledgeable of austrian history may get totally misled or confused much attention is drawn on sissis bad marriage with the emperor franz josef the scene of her wedding night is a failure no one treated an empress like that i mean undressing and payment the focus on sissi being misunderstood is right historically however the points that her views differ from the rest of the courtiers are not the true ones where is her desire for peace where is her love to her nation where is her charity sissi appears to be rather very elegant modern liberal from the 21st centurys point of view she foremost cares for her looks which is not true historically sissi had an inner life which is not showed in the film once women will wear trousers is a sentence said by her and occurs to be the image of the sissi presented in the movie sissi detests monarchy which is the films noticeable criticism towards austrian empire moreover she partly accepts anarchist movements and to my very surprise she blames her husband emperor franz josef for the death of rudolph their son where is any mention in history that sissi was present in mayerling sissis relation with sophie the mother in law is better shown however the scene of sophies death seems barely authentic and the conversation a bit of clich√©br br sorry to criticize so much but another crucial aspect of the movie which i find weak here are performances although arielle dombasle has her moments as sissi she generally does not suit to the role she looks more like a femme fa tale than a tragic empress her make up is seriously inaccurate as well as most of her gestures as the empress malik zidi is a bit better as rudolph and may be regarded as the one raising the value of the performances in general yet stephane audran does no special job as sophie you simply dont get the impression of why she detests sissi she did despise her for the sake of sissis young age while crowned for the sake of her behavior lifestyle and her believes partly it appears in the movie but definitely that is not enough but the greatest mistake is i think julien hans capua as andrassi andrassi was a count with pride honor patriotismhere he appears to be a sort of libertine thinking only to make love to his queen and the portrayal is so weak that this performance is very very pale the accurate choice is tatyana ivanova as catherine schratt she really fits to the role with her looks and her gestures but unfortunately her role does not require much time on screenbr br a good point of this movie are some costumes and pretty authentic locations the port of geneva is well presented and the moment of sissis death occurs to be a good surprise from the movie it does not appear to be how it really was however the moment is good from the symbolical perspectivethe empress walks and knows nothing that this is her final moment that is how she must have felt about it that is how one insane man destroyed a part of greatness of the world another good moment visually was when sissi talks to her son rudolph on corfu but these moments are rarebr br in sum its not a good film it distorts a very eminent historical figure a significant historical time it tries to cure the sweetness of sissi trilogy but appears to offer nothing creative charm is gone grandeur is gone and history is ignored not very worth seeking out 310
