this film was bad i believe elton or is it mike wong starred in it anyway it was the wong that didnt have that goofy grin and looks meaner he plays a man who is hit over the head and suffers brain damage he recovers and gets revenge gordon liu is the only one worth seeing in this film but he doesnt get to do much but what little he does seems to make thebr br others pale in comparison also the film has some cheesy rubber hawk that the wong guy controls this film is not worth renting or buying
