the credits at the end read all directed by shigeru izumiya thats a fitting way to phrase it because it seems like filmed material from several projects were thrown together somehow barely even attempting to make it all form one consistent work it more felt like one of those music clip things that are marketed as feature films to cash in on those video commercials just that here we have the marketable music and the live performances missing except for one scene which may as well be marketed as a weird music video clip in japan whateverbr br it makes zero sense visually it isnt too special either although it has its moments for example the female creature with the death powder who is strapped onto a bed base and some morphing sht throughout and it certainly has an industrialy feeling to it usually id call the effects dilettantish but what this film offers in this regard is baffling more than anything else you remember those cheap video effects from 70s and 80s music videos that make them look so dated like a picture within a picture flying through the screen there is quite a lot of these kind of effects in this and without any apparent reason the most halfassed seeming effort comes in the form of a picture collage the pictures sort of look like album covers whateverbr br i dont know whats up with the subtitles of the version i saw the chinese ones or whatever those hieroglyphics are sometimes seem to show up when nothing is even said and the english ones often show up without the chinese ones the english subs talk much about life without death is it possible and a mind without a body which provides what comes closest to a comprehensible conflict between characters in this film one guy a scientist dude says that life without flesh is death while another guy a metamorphosing dude who claims his mind is beyond his body now that he got the death powder blown into his face and that he now knows the secrets of the flesh and whatnot metamorphosing dude is visibly pssed off about the scientist dudes claim whateverbr br erm the end  all written by perception de ambiguity
