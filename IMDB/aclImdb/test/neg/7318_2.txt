oh boy this movie is so mediocre i dont really know what exactly to write about it br br i think its easier to write what its not br br its not very entertaining its not original and theres not one character in the whole movie i cared aboutbr br kind of reminds me of a certain reality tv show on mtv but without any interesting people it just drags on and on and i could hardly wait for it to end the only thing that kept me from switching it off was jennifer lyons cbr br i thought a long time about this movie to find one good thing to say about it what i liked was the reminder not to judge a person by the first impression you get as holly did when she accused nicole which earns it a score of 2 out of 10 instead of a 1
