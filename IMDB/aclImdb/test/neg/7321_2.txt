i saw this movie on video with a couple of friends as part of a teen comedy triple header alongside dorm daze and going greek obviously we werent going for quality but for airheaded entertainment and grossout gags generally we got what we came for but wild roomies really stood out for being awfulbr br first impression first the cover the norwegian release cover showed breasts covered up and a bunch of seemingly crazy roomies in the background brings up pictures of drunken seminaked teenagers doing bunches of funny stuff stuff doesnt it the crazy roomies on the cover were not even featured in the picture and the funny stuff you assume theyll be doing absent as wellbr br this movie was labeled comedy which is a bit strange since it not even remotely funny relationship drama would be more accuratebr br put shortly the movie is about a young couple inheriting a swanky house in la and are forced to get some roomies to make ends meet these roommates eventually put both the young couples patience and relationship to the test because theyre so wild problem is theyre not and here lies the problem of this movie the protagonist couple are so analretentive and neurotic that they manage to generate zero sympathy youll find yourself rooting for the antagonist roomies halfway through the movie add mediocre acting lame dialogue and boring direction and you got yourself a movie that is best left unseenbr br see something else
