this film makes about as much sense as an ozzie  harriet or a father knows best episode an old copy of readers digest circa 1962 would provide more insight into modern life or the relationship between a father and a daughter than this weird concoctionbr br i was surprised with diane keaton she appears to sleepwalk through the film given the films title i realize that hers was a supporting role but even martin short managed a distinct supporting characterbr br i can understand the attraction of an imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy but this film is the prozac version of an imaginary world im frightened to consider that anyone could enjoy it even as pure fantasy
