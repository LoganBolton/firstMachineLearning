i like kevin bacon and cathy moriarty and i love mary stuart masterson but the movie wasnt good at all there wasnt a likable character in the picture and the plot was nearly nonexistentbr br ms masterson is a great actress but she just didnt pull off the tough girl character she had similar problems with her character in the second day of christmas perhaps she should avoid these characters especially those with an obnoxious female child to play off ofbr br evan rachel wood was unimpressive her character was a brat plain and simple and no young actress could have given harriet any positive feelingsbr br in the interest of full disclosure i couldnt even finish watching this picture fortyfive minutes of my time is enough to waste
