this movie is available as a special bonus feature on the doubledisc of horror 101  horror 102 endgame it has nothing to do with those movies except it does show that producersdirectors dudelson and clavell are in a rut like those other movies this one features young people who go to a building where they get trapped inside and run down the hallways a lot while they get picked off one by one in the end one or more characters are revealed to have another identity this is by far the worst of the threebr br here people are invited to a halloweennight only opening of the museum of the dead the museum doesnt have very many exhibits and theyre all sort of ancient centralamerican related there are also flesheating infectionspreading zombies in the museum as well as an ancient cannibal warrior and two female warriorsbr br the movie is very repetitious it kills people off fairly quickly to the point you wonder who theyre going to have left to kill off  at which point some more people show up without explanation so that they can be killedbr br amazingly one of the characters does have a cellphone and is actually able to call the police who actually take it seriously and show up at the museum when one tries to pick the lock to get in the other tells him that would be forced entry if youve got people trapped in a building who are injured i think thats irrelevant the cops are also stupid in that when they shoot a zombie in the head it goes down but then they shoot other zombies in the chest and they dont go down they happen to shoot another zombie in the head and it goes down they continue to shoot the rest of the zombies in the chest stupidbr br the opening credits and a nightmare sequence are done in a sort of animationeffect over video a poormans waking life sort of thing but not so cartoonish it is sort of interesting however parts of some of the attacks are done the same way so theres no logic to itbr br dreadful
