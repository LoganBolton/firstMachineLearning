i will confess that once i started watching this movie it had a hold on me that forced me to watch it through to its conclusion quite possibly this was some latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero get it on with his victim or maybe fascination that they got funding to make distribute and show this film that kept me searching it for merit or possibly some bizarre wishfulfillment fantasy that there might be a point at the end of all the pain but no such luckbr br so you are warned to not start watching it in the first place lest the same thing happen to you theres nothing here worth wasting your hour and a half onbr br the firstperson mockumentary and the schtick about fabians quest to impregnate women of the falklands comes out even more like a sophomoric maybe freshman  high school freshman that is film student project than you might imagine the effect ends up being both sneering at the local inhabitants who other than the two professional leads are in fact real people as well as engaging in rather disgusting sexual politics no matter whether you take it all literally or symbolically its pointless and sexistbr br the reason i ended up watching it all the way is the same reason that once one starts to pick at a scab theres an irresistable fascination of continuing to do so until its completely off even when you know its bad for you you just want to see what happensbr br in the end this is rather dishonest filmmaking because it seems ultimately to have no moral center no elucidation of the local political situation nor any place in the type of politicalsexualpersonal film universe a la goddard in short its got nothing to say and spends a long time pretending it does smug would be the oneword taglinebr br id suggest the filmmakers rent waiting for guffman a few times or hell even blair witch project if they want to pursue the schtick with a little more style and a little more genuine emotion or at least entertainment value
