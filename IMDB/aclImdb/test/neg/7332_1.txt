this guy is a real piece of work an angry immature boy in a grown mans body packing all the charisma of a rock he goes around to places most people would only wish to visit and does his best to be as miserable as possiblebr br give this job to someone else who actually appreciates itbr br i could go down an endless list of all the stupid things this guy does in his episodes though ill just highlight the worst crete while the locals are putting up seaside picnics in his honour this clown has the gall to act like a petulant spoiled child he complains about everything including the fashion sense of the people who live there what an imbecilebr br when he went to sweden he spent at least five minutes feigning incredulity at a bunch of chefs who probably had better things to do than talk with some dimwit american like work because they didnt think abba was horrible everywhere he went he brought up abba this is the kind of talk youd hear from 13yearolds who watch too much mtvbr br when he was in new orleans he got upset that a certain restaurant had bettertasting fries than his so he accidentally spilled some wine on them in order to ruin them what a strange emotionally unstable personbr br the worst of it all are his clumsy voiceovers where he attempts in vain to add some kind of perspective on a situation he was too thick and ignorant to appreciate he tries to use all these big words in order to sound like an author but hes really just a pretentious hack whose lack of awareness has convinced him he has something to say that by the way is probably the one good thing about this jokers tv show it goes to show you no matter how inept you are as long as you take yourself seriously enough the world will as wellbr br then theres the way he speaks with local guides whose english is obviously only rudimentary hell use vocabulary any writeras he believes himself to bewould instinctively know will most likely not be understood by these people does he care no selfimportant schmucks like this bourdain clown do not use language to communicate they use it to make themselves look importantbr br mcg13jthms review on this same page is a perfect example of the kind of mind bourdain attractsthat of a low iq social misfit observe how the reviewer attempts to justify bourdains sociopath nature with simpleminded childish excuses that hardly make sense bourdain may complain but he goes through a lot and not only that he was forced to do this show but is trying to redeem himself a dolt attracts dolts and reading mcg13jthms review should let you know perfectly well whether or not you are the kind of person whod enjoy this utterly useless pointless showbr br finally to add a bit of fairness to my diatribe i admit bourdain would have been momentarily amusing had i met him in a bar but as a tv host of a travel show whose purpose is to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures bourdain is a miserable abject hopeless grim and depressing failurebr br a failure
