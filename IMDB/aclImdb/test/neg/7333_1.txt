a man wonders if his hunky coworker is gay at a yard sale he finds a ray gun called gaydar you point it at a person pull the trigger and it tells you how gay they are he tries it out it works and he sets out to find out if his coworker is gay like himbr br promising idea ruined by an unfunny script after a promising beginning and terrible acting the entire cast overacts and basically scream their lines at each other constantly it gets annoying and really embarassing after a while the saving grace is thats it is short theres a scene stealing cat love her fall out of the kitty bed and charles nelson reilly is hysterical in his brief bit but none of this saves the movie i cant recommend this at all
