the film starts out great with a mock instruction film about the habits of swedish housewives after that we get a detailed reconstruction of postwar scandinavia with lots of amazing cars electronic equipment and interior design a minimal jazz score nice cinematography and stylish titling also theres some funny scandinivian rivalry like in von triers rigetbr br sadly after the set up kitchen stories collapses like the twin towers on 911actors who try to portray the emotion jealousy by just staring in front of them corny dialog filled with stale gay symbolism in the vain of i dont like white swans i prefer bears and wolves u ever tasted bear meat the music becomes cheesier than yann tiersen at his worstbr br its a pity the director put all the effort in this great setup just to screw it up afterwards
