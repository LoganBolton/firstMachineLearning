what a dire film i cannot believe that i actually sat down and watched it a very very very very very very pathetic effort with no redeeming features whatsoever hateeeeeeedddd ittttt the socalled racing sequences are laughably awful and the plot was so bad ive forgotten it part of the film was made at the spafrancorchamps course in belgium in i think 1988 during the actual grand prix there i was there and am glad i didnt appear in any of the paddock scenes shown in the film it could have been goodwhat a pity
