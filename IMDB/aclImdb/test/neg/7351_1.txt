i agree with the user specialagentfoxmulder that this episode is awful posisbly thr worst of the entire show now im not keen on many episodes of the later series but this one takes the biscuit it was unfunny and unoffensive as for the ending im sorry but it disgusted me more than any other episodes combinedbr br i mean the boys think they meant well but the ending was so upsetting that they think the whale belongs on the moon and over the credits we see it has died wht could have saved the episode was if the pranksters were able to confess for what they didbr br there seem to be no outgoing message okay south park may be guilty of preaching too much and its always nice to see an unpreachign one such as make love not warcraft but this episode was just wrong avoid at all costs helen xxxxx
