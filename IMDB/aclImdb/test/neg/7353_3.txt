why would burt lancaster allow himself to play a poor schnook who is ultimately undermined by femme fatale anna dundee played by yvonne decarlo in criss cross the same reason why robert mitchum allows himself to be cast as another loser who falls for femme fatale faith domergue in the 1950 noir where danger lives perhaps they both felt it was a good way to show that they had range as actorsthat playing against type the usual toughguy role they were known for would enhance their image as actors who could play any role but the problem was that roles like steve thompson the pathetic lovesick milquetoast in criss cross did nothing to enhance lancasters career not only is lancaster completely miscast in the onenote role of thompson but theres something inherently unlikeable and may i say pathetic about the films protagonist in the first placebr br criss cross is an interminably slowmoving film among the many unnecessary scenes in the film is at the beginning the flashback which chronicles thompsons confrontation with dan duryeas dundee at the nightclub everything that occurs in that initial flashback is explained later in the picture the illicit affair between steve and anna steves strained relationship with martinez the cop and his bad blood with dundee if director siodmark felt compelled to begin the film with a flashback why not keep it under three minutes i think it would have been more effectivebr br in criss cross it takes quite awhile before the protagonist commits himself and steps out of the ordinary world of act one thats the scene where hes passing by and runs into anna at the nightclub and notice how siodmak spends so much time cutting back and forth between anna dancing and steve staring at her in addition to the crosscutting he also spends a great deal of time focusing on esy morales and his rhumba band than moving the story alongbr br up until the crisis of act two the story plods along with thompson having various uneasy encounters with anna and then drowning his sorrows at his usual watering hole at the midpoint of act two he learns that anna has run off and gotten married to dundee its becoming more clear at this point that one of the films central weaknesses is that dundee is never on screen throughout most of the second act there are no confrontations between thompson and dundee during this time and were left with the rather unexciting machinations between the two lovebirds as it turns out and anna explains this later to steve the reason why she left was not only because he disappeared for eight months but she also felt pressure from steves mother as well direct threats from martinez the cop who implied that he would see to it that she ended up in the womens house of detention anna goes back to steve because she realizes she made a big mistake with dundeeit turns out that hes been beating her and shes now scared of himbr br one of the silly refrains uttered by more than one character in criss cross is that you can never hijack an armored car but everyone acts so surprised when steve points out it can be done if its an inside job you would have thought that dundee would have known about steves profession as an armored car driver and propositioned him beforehand but of course steve needs to make the proposal so that dundee wont kill him after discovering his affair with anna if theyre so afraid at getting caught why do steve and anna meet at his apartment where dundee can so easily find them i really got a kick out of finchley played by alan napier the brains of the operation dundee is so dumb that he has to hire this alcoholic exprofessor type who plots out the heist on a map oh there is the matter of procuring the ingredients to construct the gas bombs used during the robbery and of course finchley is good at that toobr br the only really well done scene in the entire film is the armored car robbery the editing was quite good as it depicted the rising action of a heist gone bad as the gas bombs go off the brutality of the gang is shown in high relief when dundee murders the innocent armored car guardbr br the climax of the film is as drawn out as the rest of the film why does it take so long for one of dundees goons to kidnap thompson theres that nurse then the goon is waiting outside then he comes in and pretends that hes a friend steve falls asleep and finally after he awakes the goon kidnaps himbr br when steve finally meets up with anna at the house we wonder how anna got her hands on the cash did she somehow steal it from dundee after the heist when he went out to dinner its never explained even worse anna suddenly becomes the evil femme fatale out of the blue before her selfishness and attraction to dundee can be explained by her perceived rejection at the hands of steve and martinezs threats but after going back to steve because she fears dundee she inexplicably turns on him when he is most vulnerable just as there is instant coffee you have instant femme fatalebr br in film noiran encyclopedic reference to the american style by silver and ward the authors hail criss by cross as one of the most tragic and compelling of film noir i beg to differ in order to have tragedy you need characters that have great depth and in order to be compelling you need a story thats plausible criss cross has neither its an overrated b movie that somehow has found itself in the pantheon of art house noirs once again the herd mentality has triumphed in evaluating the pictures of yesteryear
