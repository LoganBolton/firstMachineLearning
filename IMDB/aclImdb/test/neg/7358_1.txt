if you saw the grudge a another mediocre ghost movie then you should know what to expect just worse a lot worse this time instead of being in japan with all english speaking people we are in spain with all english speaking people it is interesting that not one shot of this movie actually looks like spain and could have been entirely filmed in a studio back lot oh and a place with swings cause theres a good 5 mins of footage of swings with no one on them oooohhh how spookybr br this one is terrible in every way imaginable the acting by the lameinator mom and dad dont help matters at all anna paquin is the only person that delivers a decent performance in the film but i hate anna paquin so you can imagine my own private hell viewing this filmbr br there is one good moment in the movie however when a villain is trying to explain the convoluted plot to anna paquins character and she doesnt understand any of it and asks a bunch of stupid questions and he blurts out you idiot you have not understood anything lol well i happen to understand this film is a piece of garbage 0 stars
