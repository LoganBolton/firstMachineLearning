horrendously acted and completely laughable hauntedhouse horror flick that has an out of place anna paquin playing a neurotic teenager fighting off the thingsthatgobumpinthedark that are plaguing her and her family shortly after moving to their new home in spain little more than a geographically replanted ripoff of the shining and most notably the others the weakplotted darkness is basically your typical runofthe mill bhorror feature with a few predictable lame scares that can be seen by audiences a mile off so to speak in retrospect i suppose i shouldnt have set my personal expectations quite as high for this movie to actually be good considering the wellknown fact that it was shelved for nearly three years before finally being released around christmas of last year in american cinemas across the country to what was ultimately lukewarm ticketsales and very harsh reviews from critics when will filmmakers ever learn that theres more to making movies be it horror or otherwise than just the fey possibility of a little financial gain turkeyzero stars
