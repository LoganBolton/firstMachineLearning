what starts out as a passable movie degenerates into one of the most incoherent unscary incompetently made stupid attempted horror films of recent yearsbr br absolutely terrible its such a derivative mess ripping off every decent fright flick you can think of without successfully producing a single scare whether its copying the recent trend with creepy kids or ghosts walking past the camera or the old school horror of fulcis gates of hellbr br the worst thing is theres not even a cat jumping out of a cupboard to make you jump to be avoided
