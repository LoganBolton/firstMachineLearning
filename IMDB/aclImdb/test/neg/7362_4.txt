see i really wanted to enjoy this movie there were moments when my heart beat faster when the hair on my neck began to stand up when my muscles began to tighten but just like a strip tease i was left with no real action no resolution and money missing from my walletbr br jaume balaguer√≥ and miguel tejadaflores apparently dont know the correct recipe for making a horror movie and as such utilized the old amateur cooks method of throwing everything into the potbr br this movie is really the shining poltergeist amityville and hellraiser all rolled into one amazing i know but true all the flavors are there you can taste each of them they just dont mix well im not gonna go down the list of every thing wrong with this movie in short good cinematography mediocre acting worse dialoguebr br the real problem with stealing from so many movie plots and combining them into one movie aside from the resulting confusion is while you can have several plots running at one time you cant have several endings and what does jaume do when he runs into this problem just like a freshman in english 101 you end your story with ellipses the little car vanished into the darkness and  the end oooh spooky not really and very anticlimactic the ending left me confused and disappointed almost emptybr br take your 10 go rent the shining poltergeist and hellraiser scare the pants off yourself have a great time and forget that the darkness ever existed br br bjamin
