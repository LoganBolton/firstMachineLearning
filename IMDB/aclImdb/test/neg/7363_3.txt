as a canadian history major my first thing to say  historical facts are not accurate how can a producer do that the deportation of the acadian wasnt in 1759 when we see franklin in london but in 1755 how can he pass that in the movie the scenes in londo were useless too then for the story for anyone that read les anciens canadians you have the story line right there its the story of la coriveau that witch add a love story too and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter ending sure it brought tears to my eyes but thats it then theres the fact its apparently set up in québec city but its mostly shot at the forteresse de louisbourg sure its a historical site and its accurate to the time but it was obvious that the scenes were not all set in québec city overall if youre looking for a documentary of new france go get candad  a peoples history a real documentary on the history of canda and new france if you want a love story that will bring you tears a story set up in a wonderful forest watch new france
