from the second the music swelled second one of the movie and it was moviehack tripe i knew i was in for a very long ride horrendously clich√©d  i laughed a lot and knew how the plot ended well before the ending  they didnt use louisbourg particularly well and the costuming and hair were kinda awful my particular favourite makeup moment is that the only way they age depardieu as far as i could see was by putting a straight hair wig on him instead of wavy i could go on about the ridiculous unsuitability of the music for a long time  the movie could be improved massively by an 18th century score br br eta ah its that horrible moviemusic guy patrick doyle whos responsible for the score  say no more he should not be allowed near historical movies  he should stick to 20th century settings br br the visit to the notable people portion was also hilarious particularly his little visit to madame pompadour who was not particularly convincingly played br br i thought the only actor who appeared grounded in the century at hand was michael maloney as james murray he absolutely stole the show for all 30 seconds he was on screen tragically he made you see what the movie could have beenbr br the love scenes did have some heat  the two leads were stunning togetherbr br the most awful scene for historians is where theyre at the big leavetaking dinner in britain before wolfe sails and he lifts his glass and says the first two lines of how stands the glass around aka why soldiers why as if its a toast absolutely excruciating failure at historicity much better to leave it out thousands of people know the damn song and thousands more believe the rumour that wolfe and company sang it probably drunk not all stuffy like this bunch daft
