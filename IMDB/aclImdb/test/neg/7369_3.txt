despite decades of tax incentives in terms of international visibility the canadian film industry still lags behind most central african and islamic states surprisingly few canadian films are released outside their native shores and nouvellefrance aka battle of the brave is another example of why more than any other country commercial canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other countries failures on paper this historical drama could look vaguely promising theres certainly a rich vein of untapped material in canadas history as the french and english warred over and bought and sold the colony though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blinkandyoullmissit scene of characters saying wolfe is dead or nouvellefrance is no more before getting back to the soap operatics but while this isnt a history lesson it isnt a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either there is no battle in the film unless you count 10 seconds of shelling by a halfdozen reenactors and one collapsed shed the town square that is all we ever see of quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior giving many scenes an old tv miniseries look as does director jean beaudins reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors what you do get for your money is a simple but drawnout harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise is that fabio doesnt turn up in the cast its the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace or waterfallbr br an anglocanadianfrench coproduction that doesnt so much unite oncewarring nations as throw any country with a decent tax break into the stew this massive boxoffice disaster was clearly intended to be canadas titanic  though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film not the ship  but turns out more like revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes crowds or the few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds the montreal mirror described it as so bad that one cant even find the strength to mock it thats rather unfair because while for most of its running time the film looks like a belowpar 80s miniseries the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps dastardly husbands declaring youll never see your handsome lover again cuckolds honor youll pay for this both of you and our heroine accused of murder and  gasp  witchcraft in a trial funny enough to have been in demi moores version of the scarlet letter throw in caddish british governors devious slaves and celine dion singing at the end and youve got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that timbo hines was aspiring to and still managed to miss wildly with his legendarily inept period version of war of the worlds albeit without the staggering technical incompetencebr br leading man david la hayes versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film he starts out looking like andy garcia briefly adopts the al pacino revolution look flirts with the cleanshaven tch√©ky karyo style before turning into a younger ted danson as his character ages while his opening scene where he reacts to news of his fathers death with an expression that looks like hes waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor whos lucked into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed he shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isnt there billie piper lookalike noemie godinvigneaus leading lady doesnt exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying centerstage as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly vincent perezs corrupt and perverted intendant le bigot that really is the characters name the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey sebastien huberdeau and saddest of all gerard depardieus bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky greyhaired wig its a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions looking like hes not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it he clearly couldnt be bothered to stick around for the english dubbing sessions or even a couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled small wonder he talked of retiring around the time of the films brief releasebr br some brief comic relief is provided by jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who overplays wolfe of quebec rather like an asthmatic alf garnettarchie bunker played by timothy dalton on speed while tim roths william pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one whos being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off though like colm meaneys benjamin franklin theyre both in the film for less than three minutes voltaire and madame pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression comic or otherwise the supporting actresses are generally better juliette gosselin and bianca gervais as the heroines real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene jacob looking for all the world like a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better
