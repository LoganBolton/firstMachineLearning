a film about an interesting and sensitive period of history filmed in beautiful surroundings managed to present an appallingly trivial and clich√©d production grossly clumsy script poor continuity intrusive slushy music sugary casting and pallid acting br br it was a toss up between the script and the acting as to which was worse the script probably won  the historical background backstory and character descriptions were spelt out in painful detail in the dialogue  actually words cant describe quite how bad this film isbr br in a prerelease screening there was a massive exodus from about thirty minutes in at about an hour many of those who remained were laughing loudly i should add i am a francophile i am fascinated by canada and love historical film this really was a one off
