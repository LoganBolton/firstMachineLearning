thats the worst film i saw since a long time historic accuracy is totally nonexistent for example james wolfe who his depicted as an antifrench canadian is shown in london during the summer of 1759 natives are like indians of a bad hollywood movie of the 60s  they wear deerskin clothes and ride horses the montagnais had never ride horses the film is taking place in quebec city but footage is set in louisbourg showing the atlantic oceanbr br the original scenario was supposed to include the battle of the plains of abraham but the producers drop this idea saying that costs for uniforms and participants would be more than 4 millions dollars  i think they never heard about reenactmentbr br all the movie is planned to be a new titanic  an impossible love during an historic tragedy the fall of newfrance theres even a song performed by celine dion at the end of the movie yes i stayed till the end of the movie but i deeply regret but the worst thing of all is that this movie cost 30 millions dollars i just dont know how they spend all this moneybr br sorry for my anger but im just too irritated
