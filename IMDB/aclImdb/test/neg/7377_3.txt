this show has been performed live around the country with a wide variety of casts i saw it first in the provincetown production the first summer it was in ptown 2001before it was curiously enough banned in that overwhelmingly gay resort the codes which resulted in its closing have since been amended i saw it again later in the offbroadway longrunning production in new york oddly enough the ptown production was far better than the new york onefresher cuter more spirited and funnierbut that was only in the 2001 showing subsequent attempts to clone the production bare naked lads in 2007 were definitely thirdrate this filmed production features a los angelos production cast and it is as other comments have suggested not the best i would rate it somewhere in between the topnotch 2001 ptown production and the thirdrate bare naked lads ptown show from last summer
