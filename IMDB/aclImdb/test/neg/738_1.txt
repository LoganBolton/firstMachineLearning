it is hard for a lover of the novel northanger abbey to sit through this bbc adaptation and to keep from throwing objects at the tv screenin fact if jane austen herself were to see this she would be somewhat amused and possibly put out maggie wadeys adaptation has made northanger abbey into what it satirized the gothic novel and the readers of gothic novelsbr br the role of catherine morland in the adaptation is portrayed fairly closely to austens catherine a openhearted generous girl whose imagination simply runs away with her but the henry tilney of the novel is not a snufftaking canewielding sappylinemaking hero of a gothic novelhe is a tease a nearlyhandsome man with a messy room and a living thats right henry tilney is a clergyman a charm that is completely dropped from the script some of the best scenes from novel when henry completely deadpan outrageously teases the literallyminded catherine on diction journals mrs radcliffe etc are not portrayed in the adaptation a large section of henrys personality is lost when those scenes are not adapted besides peter firths appearance is not accuratehenry tilney is supposed to be 24 or 25 dark hair and a brown skin not 35 or 40 and blondbr br there are so many other absurdities within the adaptation that invoke surprise and disgustwho is the marchioness and what is she doing in the story why is john thorpe less of a dunce and more of a schemer why is northanger abbey a castle catherine of the novel with her romantic visions expects hidden passages and dark tapestries but is very disappointed to discover that northanger abbey is actually a comfortable modern houseanother element of satire why portray general tilney as a drunk why does catherine have those strange visions of mrs allen threading her finger etc catherines imagination only runs away with her at northanger with henry there to correct her gently and lastly why are so many facts concerning the tilney family and mrs tilneys death altered unnecessarily to make the story more horrible all of these oddities and more simply are too strange to be overlookedbr br
