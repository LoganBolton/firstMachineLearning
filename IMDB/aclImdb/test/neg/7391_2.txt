this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen can somebody please explain the plot of this movie to me yes i know the bus ran out of gas in the middle of the desert after the driver never noticed that his compass wasnt functioning but what then and how did it end maybe im to stupid to understand this movie but to me it was an absolute waste of timebr br my recommendation do not bother there are far better movies to be seen this movie ranks with my other all time lowlows going overboard  adam sandler and fire on the amazon  sandra bullock
