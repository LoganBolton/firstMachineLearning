well they sent it on tv between midnight and 200 am  it seems like the right time to watch it and then go to bed afterwards br br no it was not really living up to my expectations i think the dogma concept is good because the film then gets closer to whats really happening between the involved characters when you cut all the unnecessary effects and moodmaking music out but then again this concept requires some interesting action between the charactersbr br i cannot say that i know king lear the shakespeare version very well if i had known the play i would probably have been able to predict much of the filmbr br well a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a character on display  and we certainly see some bad sides oh yes the paint of civilisation and culture can be very thin and behind this paint you may find an animalbr br if you then compare it with italiensk for begyndere italian for beginners or mifunes sidste sang mifunes last song you see the same but opposite thing a crisis can certainly bring people to view their life in a more constructive way and if you dare do you may winbr br when the film had ended i thought to myself oh thats why i havent seen it before  the film has its own beauty the quality of the work of the cameraman actors etc is good but the script could need something more a plot maybe wouldnt hurt
