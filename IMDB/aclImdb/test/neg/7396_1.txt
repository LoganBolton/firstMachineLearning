the movie is being televised as i writebr br i simply forgot how horrible an experience i had watching it in the cinemabr br the whole idea of the movie is flawed the fact that intelligent europeans and americans stranded in the desert forget all concept of morals and civilization within a couple of days is laughable the madness of lord of the flies was longer in the makingbr br details that annoy are plenty one is the single african godlike character that mysteriously survives the horrible climate and have done so for ages without losing his mind and he seems to have no supplyproblems either ridiculous so too is the rescue attempt from the tour guide an indiana jones lookalike whose rescue attempt ends in tragedy and death a 5 minute walk from the hut then theres the choice of lear imposed onto the group by a gurulike joke of an artist he reminded me of my hippie high school art teacherbr br the worst thing though is levrings choice of lear obviously is an intellectual brainfart how that ever was going to be an passtime is never clear to mebr br positives are few and far between its a beautiful movie but thats never importantbr br high school intellectualism weird for the sake of weird its a complete waste of time unless you like thrashing useless art movies
