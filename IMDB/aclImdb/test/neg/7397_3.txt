this is one of those films with a great potential brilliant actors a debut from a very interesting director and a haunting survivorish plotbr br but it does not work at allbr br to start with the good thing the cinematography is stunning the beauty of the namibian desert shows itself as a merciless surrounding also in the pictures and then there is the acting quite allright jennifer jason leigh has never been better bruce davison also seems to have developed his character from altmans short cutsbr br then the disappointments janet mcteer romane bohringer and the plot why on earth does levring pick lear for their play the whole idea of letting shakespeare articulate their despair and inner longings does not work it seems like a facade and it is clear that the tragedies takes place because of the choice of lear they just needs to fit in in the script by levring and academy award winner anders thomas jensenbr br and the sex it takes about three days then more or less all of the characters are sexually frustrated dahh sex is always the easy way out when you are in need of a crisis in a plot janet mcteers part totally falls apart mainly because of that ridiculous idea the sex makes the plot fall promptly to the ground instead they could have focused on the dialogue there must have been conversation between all of the characters but we mainly see them talking in smaller groups their talking though is as dead as lear and the rest of the filmbr br the king is alive still is not the worst danish dogme 95 movie yet but comparing it to the most recent of the homegrown dogme 95 films italiensk for begyndere by lone scherfig this one fails badly it is not a good film it is a bad one but it is beautiful
