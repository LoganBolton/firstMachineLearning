this is one incredibly standard western that features some bad acting dull storyline and silly actionbr br biggest problem perhaps is how incredibly formulaic this movie is it features all of the usual clich√©s yes even a bar fight and the movie really doesnt has any surprises in it it makes this a dull and a weak western to watch also not in the least because its such a poorly made onebr br its obviously a small production and the movie looks like it got shot in 30 days the directing and editing can be called bad and all of the action sequences featured in the movie are incredibly silly it perhaps almost becomes a bit humorous to watch for all the wrong reasonsbr br its story also isnt that interesting its a pretty friendly western so also no blood in which for some odd reason everybody seems to be against the younger brothers who in this movie are being portrayed as good and very friendly guys the story gets sillier and sillier as it heads toward its ending the younger brothers really existed and were part of the jamesyounger gang of which the famous brothers frank and jesse james were also part of of course they were not as friendly in real life as portrayed in this movie it just was custom for an early 40s to have likable man characters in it it wasnt really until the spagethiwestern age really that the main characters became rotten criminals themselves really strangely enough that approached has always worked out better than those early westerns in which the main character is on the good side of the lawbr br thing that does make this movie original is the fact that it was shot in color this was something pretty unique for an 40s western and still gives the movie something extra you can wonder though why they shot this western in full color the movie is still done in the style of a black  white early western after all and i actually believe that this movie would had been a bit more credible if it got done in black  white insteadbr br you could easily do without this westernbr br 410
