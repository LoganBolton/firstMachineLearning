this is a terrible movie that is barely recognizable from the book although they have sort of similar plots the time it takes to watch this movie which is only 15 hours would be much better spent doing anything else including watching grass grow the addition of poorly done fantasy scenes make catherine seem insufferably silly the actress who plays catherine also comes across ditzy as all goodness and looks constantly surprised even when shes supposed to be looking lovingly into her tilneys eyes honestly the movie ends with a catherine fantasylike scene where one cant help but wonder if its happened or if shes merely delusional and not in the good way that makes you think but in a perfectly horrible way that basically sums up the terrible movie the only good thing about the movie is the title which was written by ms austen herself i generally love the bbcs productions but this one is horrid
