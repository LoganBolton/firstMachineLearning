dresden had great expectations because of its spectacular theme and its high budget i was really looking forward to it and i really wanted it to be good but it is not the only good thing are the special effects that are very well done but like in a really bad hollywood blockbuster everything else is missingbr br it is poorly written the screenplay tries to fulfill genrerules with standard suspenselove story elements but there is no depth or originality at all its way below average the next thing it is also poorly directed it has this uninteresting tvdirectingstyle with lots of closeups and wannabegreataction by fast editing where actually no action or suspense is the actors are not bad but there is no performance that is touching in any waybr br i dont know they obviously try to do a typical tvmovie and not a film for the cinema where its alway good to have some edges and a clear visual style but why do they try to fulfill typical commercial hollywoodrules it really feels like the screenwriter did a weekend class with some american scriptwritingguru and then delivered this mess is there no producer who is responsible for the project who has an interest in dramaturgy visual style or plain in simple this magical cinematic moments that make some tvmovies great  do they think that an tvaudience is stupid and doesnt need to get a high quality movie experience the downfall was a very good example for a good tvmovie but there was probably some executive or producer who knew what he was doingbr br dont waste you time with this one rent downfall instead
