this film took up three hours including commercials on the history international channel last night but it felt like three weeks it wasnt the cheap stagy and unintentionally funny depictions of the bombing of dresden it wasnt that the film is stripped of almost all context surrounding world war ii it wasnt even that the bombing itself was often made to appear as nothing more than a major inconvenience for a goofy love story no it was the wooden featureless characterizations that sucked the life out of the story oh and the fact that if it is possible for a movie to be obsequious then dresden is that movie perhaps a better title would have been dresdenas uriah heep would have experienced itbr br it is especially the latter point that so irritates was the bombing of dresden a war crime the makers of this movie believe so but in the typically emasculated way that germans have come to approach world war ii they cant bring themselves to say so without braying about peace and no more warsanywhere like theyre mother teresa and also typical of german obsequiousness towards the british in particular there is an unwieldy effort to grovel before britishness while loading all the guilt for dresden on to one person arthur harrisbr br did i say one person well not quite at the beginning of the movie there is an exclamation from the leading character anna with whom we are all supposed to sympathize damned americans she screams while watching as far off bombs fall and a few minutes later a radio voice intones warnings about the american terror bombing being inflicted upon germansbr br note the word terror got that its really the americans behind the inhumane targeting of german civilians no matter that the american strategy for almost all the war in europe was the precision bombing of industrial and war manufacturing sites no matter that it was the british who enthusiastically adopted area bombing of civilian targets in germanybefore the germans had themselves even targeted english ones no matter that the americans bombed during the day suffering more casualties in the process than the british in order to hit precision targets while the british bombed civilians under the cover of night no matter that the americans essentially were brought into the rafs true terror bombing campaign kicking and screaming against it no matter that most american officials from fdr to gen dolittle opposed targeting civilians while churchill and his generals couldnt wait to do sobr br no in dresden both the germans and british except for bomber harris are innocent of a doctrine it is intimated created by the evil americans and only the might and power of a love story between a german nurse and a downed british bomber pilot can adequately explain the truth of the atrocity rightbr br oh by the way for the younger and likely less well read readers of imdb the first and still so far only major literary effort to give a thoughtful voice to dresdens bombing was the pacifist novel penned by kurt vonnegutan american pow in dresden at the time of the bombing i guess germanys zdf couldnt find a pretty nurse for billy pilgrim
