i cant believe how bad this film is for starters the movie deals with the legend of big foot and a group of people having a close encounter with the creature the premise is interesting and having lance henriksen in the cast aliensgave the untold a promising outlook unfortunately thats as interesting as it gets this looks like a direct to dvd releaseor so i guess this is basically a productionless affair with probably the worst editing with a constant fading to black in between every sceneive seen in my life and acting that will sure make you cringe why lance henriksen picked this is completely fathomless and the movie takes cues from just about any other genre movie from blair witch project the video scene and predator to alive this is supposedly based on true events but the only truth to be found herein is just how bad this movie is im usually not a harsh critic and believe me i did try to enjoy this trash but eventually did not do yourselves a favor and steer clear from this dvd br br ill try to put it mildly this movie is pure garbage and it made me want to take my gun and shoot my neighbors or ask blockbuster for a refundbr br and lance shame on you 1 out of 10
