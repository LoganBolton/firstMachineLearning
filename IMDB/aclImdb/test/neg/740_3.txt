this might have a spoilerbr br when i first started watching this movie i thought it was ok the music was good and that bizarro dream sequence i was willing to forgive but the lack of looks in the main character and all of the other characters for that matter made me uninterested in watching the rest of this film i know totally vainthe music at the beginning was spirited and fitting i thought for a mock gothic novel but come on saxophone music for an early 19th century film it totally didnt fit this movie was totally boring and if youre looking to watch a good period film or an austen dont rent northanger abbey i give it a 30 30  a failing grade
