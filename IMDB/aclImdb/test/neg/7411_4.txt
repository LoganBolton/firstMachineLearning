a big waste of time is all youll get out of this bag i rented this hoping for a suspenseful movie with maybe a few believable scenes but boy was i ever dissapointed i think the title shouldve been camping 101 or something to that effect well anyway stay the hell away from this film it numbs you to death dont be afraid of big foot be afraid of this crap
