a plane carrying a rich scientists daughter goes down in thick wilderness he assembles a group to go and find her and the others but the rescue party soon suspects that something is stalking them then ulterior motives for the expedition are revealed and that only adds to the already existing tensionbr br the movie is a decent idea and a take on the popular sasquatch legend was bound to wind up on film sooner or later however the films direction breaks a fundamental rule of horrorthriller directing and that is showing too much too soon of course the audience knows there is something stalking the characters just read the title but showing what should have been the films kicker that early just ruins most of the suspense and as a direct result much of the fun the film also lacks a good atmosphere and there are almost no landscape shots that show the expanse of the wilderness but there are plenty monster pointofview shots that add nothing to anything they actually knock off predator quite shamelessly the lowbudget horror film wendigo did what this film tries to do much betterbr br some of the character tensions and a nonclich√© ending manage to make up for this rise above the crap pile but it is still poor and given the premise and potential very disappointing  410br br rated r for some violence and profanity but its pretty tame compared to most rrated horror
