bigfoot movies tend to be bad so im not inclined to watch them however there were some good commercials on the scifi channel so i decided to watch a climbing expedition heads into the pacific northwest to find a a fallen airplane carrying the daughter of the expeditions leader played by lance hendrickson and have brought a revolutionary dna detector that could be used to prove the sasquatchs existence and it actually generates some suspense at first the sasquatch is unseen but sees the mountain climbers body heat like the alien in predator and i did wonder when it was going to strike the acting is passable as is the background music the dense wooded location is wellused and when the creature is finally seen the costume is not bad though nothing great but as the film grinds on it becomes increasingly annoying and absurd most of the characters are unpleasant people rude to each other and only in the expedition for money and publicity except for lance hendricksons character so that its impossible to care about what happens to them and their behavior become increasingly stupid one man shoots the creature not fatally then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark one female camper puts on a slinky silk negligee before crawling into her sleeping bag then barely escapes being dragged into the woods by the sasquatch without getting her hair and makeup messed up then the survivors conclude that the sasquatch is really after the dna detecting machine and will let them live if they leave it behind a creature knows what threatens it obviously the instinct doesnt apply to these actors or they wouldnt have appeared in this movie and the ending is so stupid youll want to kick the tv screen if it werent for the script it would have been a decent horror film
