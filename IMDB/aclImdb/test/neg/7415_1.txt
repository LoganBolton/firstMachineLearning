i think that this is one of my top ten worst movies i have ever seen theres like fade out every two minutes if this was on tv they would have a preview every 23 minutes but there is a seen i personally enjoyed which is when the blonde goes to take a bath in a pit of boiling water with a man watching and for about 10 seconds you see her whole body with no towel on that was the best scene in the whole film because you see sasquatch starring at them but the last 10 minutes is when we see his whole body plus most of the deaths are off screen and just the scream or roar and i was expecting the sasquatch to die but he dosent shoot him and only 4 or 5 people die in the whole film i was expecting 810 people to die dont watch this movie i give it an f dont waste your time
