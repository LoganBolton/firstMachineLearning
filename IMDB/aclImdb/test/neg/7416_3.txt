hey all i just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie i was actually one of the makeup fx artists that help create the beast for this movie and i have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing i remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poorbr br what actually happened though was that jason palmer did the original makeup for the sasquatch but for some reason they had to go back and reshoot much of the creature the sad part was that jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the redone creature was no where near as awesome as the original onebr br for me it was quite sad because this was jasons final movie and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad reshoots anyway i thought you guys may find that a tad interesing and if you would like you can head over to mmmyeahcom and check out some behind the scenes photosbr br later jeff
