the untold is one of the worst films i ever saw the story really seems original but it was badly bestow on screen lance henriksen a good actor ended up in this crap but hey he made a lot of low budget films you need to pay the bills you know kidding lance is a great actor but he ended up with this bunch of silly actors seriously andrea roth was there just to have a nudity scene and other actors well they were just there there was constantly a fade outfade in editing and that makes me sick that was the most horrible move that just keeps on coming and it really makes you angry it was also very predictable boring and slow it has a bizarre tempo that goes just wrongbr br cant say more dont rent it or buy it you can watch it if on tv
