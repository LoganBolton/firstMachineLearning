theres something about a movie that features female bodybuilders that gets me in front of the screen every time br br ive seen pumping iron ii aces iron eagle iii raven hawk and even the tv movie getting physical which featured some big names in the sport they were tolerable in their own ways mostly because they featured rachel mclish rowwrbr br then i went and watched nemesis iii prey harder on the sole basis that it featured such luminaries as sue price debbie muggli sharon bruneau and ursula sarcev love the ladies always will but after this im kinda glad i missed the first two nemesis flicksbr br well the first one anyway most of the footage here is lifted bodily and kicking and screaming i would guess from nemesis ii actually that one looked marginally entertaining from the evidence supplied herebr br but even though price and company flex and pose they dont get much of a chance to do anything else like say act in fact this whole film is an exercise get it haha in oblique storytelling ambiguous characters and openended moviemaking in terms of filming as well as the storyline br br nothing makes much sense but even if it did there would still be issues  such as making such small parts for such largerthanlife women as these what a crimebr br of course it was written and directed by albert pyun so what did you expect cohesionbr br one star only in consideration for all the hard work that price muggli bruneau and sarcev obviously put into their bodies not the craft work done within the movie itselfbr br thanks ladies
