this is going to be my first review on imdb and im glad that the standard rating is 1 out of 10 because then i dont have to change anythingbr br first there are awful movies movies you can make a laughter out of like island city battlefield earth or conan the destroyer that is totally acceptable they makes a great party enhancer then there are the worst movie ever i cannot believe how utterly crappy this steaming pile of dog turd wasbr br i found it on a second hand store on vhs and bought it quickly because i like scifi terminator postapocalypse and stuff like that everything on the box art was very promising then i loaded in the tape quickly when i got home and the first thing that i noticed was what there was maybe 10 minutes or more of switching between present clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect with sounds that makes you puke and it just continues over and over then some acting kicks in and you wonder why you were ever born in a world where this abomination of mankind actually exists and then i realized there are actually two prequels i didnt think about it first but the title says 3 in it and i was horrified but as i actually in great pain and agony watch it to the end i thought nothing could ever make me feel worse about myself and this universe but then a little text showed up saying next and nemesis 4 no please no
