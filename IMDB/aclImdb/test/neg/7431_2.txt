robert downey jr in a 17th century wig and dress was enough to make me shudder but i couldnt believe a great actor like sam neill actually took a part in this movie the whole thing was unbelievable i especially like merivels cure for the crazies they danceand hey presto everyones happy and theyre all better i guess i just didnt like the character merivel too much therefore watching a whole movie about his supposed transition from a whoring buffoon into a great physician was grueling br br also im not entirely sure but i didnt think the plague as well as the famous fire of london took place simultaneously
