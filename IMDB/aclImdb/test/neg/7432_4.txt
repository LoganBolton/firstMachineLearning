mainly a biography of a lustful doctor robert merivel  robert downey who has his way in the kings palace for the first half of the film and then helps out the downtrodden in the second half mainly katharine meg ryanbr br the good  fantastic set decoration ie the lush kings palace and costuming make this a visual treat the language is also very tame ian mckellen and hugh grant provide interesting supportbr br the bad  after 5060 minutes this movie simply gets too boring it desperately needed to be given some spark after an hour but it does the opposite it drags on and on the script certainly needed some badlyneeded restoration shall we say the film may look nice but its a long two hours to sit throughtoo long
