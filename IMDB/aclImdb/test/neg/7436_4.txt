the overriding problem with this film is that it cant possibly use bill murray to the best of his abilities simply because of the costarbr br if this was a road movie with another comedic actor it might work even if they were both trying to get the elephant across the country it would at least allow for them to share some amusing dialogue as it stands murray is left talking to an elephant who cannot answer back with witty banter essentially it means that murray is talking to himself and this makes the film more boring than it could have been had he had another character to bounce offbr br kids would enjoy this moviesimply because of the elephant but anyone wanting to watch bill murrays biting delivery and enjoy an excellent script needs to look somewhere else
