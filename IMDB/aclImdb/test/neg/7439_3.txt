a pointless cashin with nothing to contribute except nastiness this is a definite case of sloppy seconds for robocop irvin kershners numbing plot less and tired mess of a sequel is watchable and even mildly entertaining in a dubious unpleasantly trashy way but it has virtually none of the originals flair emotion intelligence or excitement instead we have just another empty spectacle of a blockbuster whose only reason to exist seems to be to nauseate the viewer with relentless violence which is far more brainlessly gratuitous than anything in the original omni consumer products who made the original robocop cyborg have turned into more of a totalitarian force than ever second time round what with the suspicious naziesquire banners stormtrooper guards and tanks for hire at the end as for the anonymous old man daniel o herlihy hes less of a benevolent protector and more of a hideous mr burns type surrounding himself with moronic lackeys who genuinely believe that putting the brain of a murderous psychopath into the body of the allnew robocop 2 is a good idea oh and the first robocop gets a look in somewhere amidst all of this mess though you wonder what on earth a fine actor like peter weller saw in the script the droll tom noonan has nothing to work with as the villain while nancy allen is badly wasted as robocops partner there are some hilarious moments throughout the opening magnavolt commercial for instance but this is a poor followup to the truly great original
