following which the touted update goes and shoots itself through the head rather apt considering the sorry state of this movie a sequel to a film which patently didnt need onebr br what really irritates about robocop 2 is that the makers obviously didnt understand why the original was so good in the first place robocop 7 was a witty vibrant satire of bad action movies robocop 2 is just a bad action moviebr br thin on dialogue particularly towards the tedious shootout finale it attracts little interest and possesses none of the energy or spirit of the original the spoof ads now a little tasteless warning continued use will cause skin cancer seem merely there as an afterthought and calling a new designer drug nuke is nowhere near as subtle or as funny as the originals family board game nuke embr br the stopmotion animation  the weakest element of the original  is used more extensively while this humourless sequel fails to include a credits sequence which makes it look even more cheap and hurried ah humourless you might say but what about the funny mayor or the way robo is reprogrammed to spout platitudes yes these are attempts at light relief as is robo tightening himself up with a screwdriver were only human for the films punchline but none are likely to induce laughter like the rest of the film theyre staid and moronic attempts at entertainmentbr br the third and final film in the series imaginatively titled robocop 3 5 saw peter weller leave to be replaced by robert john burke who does well in a undemanding role with toneddown language and violence it was an obvious plea to the kiddie market a robo action figure much plugged throughout with its social conscience too overstated and robocops newfound arm attachments and jetpack getting too silly the final film was never destined to be a masterpiece yet fluid direction by fred dekker and a flowing pace make this one enjoyably throwaway viewingbr br robocop then is the film proper robocop 3 is the sequel which you could watch if there was nothing better on which leaves the second movie hanging in the middle an unwatchable dirge of a picture a franchise vehicle that has nothing to say save for the pound signs that rung up irvin kershner is no paul verhoven just as comic artist frank miller and partner walon green arent the writers that edward neumeier and michael miner were a tragic waste of a good if limited concept 410
