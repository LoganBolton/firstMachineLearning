unfortunately producers dont know when to leave well enough alone or are into recycling to the point that every scrap of trash that hollywood generates is up for rendering into alpo it seems that every scifi action adventure flick must endure a sad list of followup films and robocop is a tragic example the first film under paul verhovens direction was a wild stylish ride even finding time for a little social commentary on what the dark side of biotech is capable of turning us into this film has none of that aside from maybe telling us that drugs are bad for you and could make you do things youd regret when sober robocop 2 lacks the vision the profoundly scary vision of what we are becoming and instead clumsily takes us on a boat ride into how nauseating drug dealers and their victims really are social commentary be damned this one really bit the big one for me if you dont care for anything but the sfx go to it my friend otherwise dont waste your time with this yeastless sour cake and preserve the first films accurately measured heavyweighted pumpernickle hot out of the oven its that simple
