star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning br br old detroit is back with the giant omni consumer corporation continuing to swallow everything in its path as construction of the new delta city continues and a new menace to contend with in the shape of cain a cruel drug lord with delusions of christlikeness peddling a deadly new addictive on the streets called nuke as he continues to struggle with the memories of his former life haunting him the tin plated hero sets out to bring this villain down only to wind up getting chopped into pieces of scrap metal with robocop out of action a ruthless ocp businesswoman proposes plans for her new android a stomping snarling beast of a machine that needs an equally nasty test subject to power it which cain fits perfectly after a brief glitch in his system robo returns to bring justice to the streets and settle the score with cainbr br the original robocop is a film that always manages to astound you each time you watch it no matter how many times youve seen it one of those films that just cant be done again that said its not surprising a sequel was made its even less surprising that that sequel really pales compared to the original empire strikes back director irvin kirschner has crafted an unpleasant slightly incoherent and overlong film that cant capture the magic of the first film no matter how hard it tries and it certainly does that the funny ads from the first film running none stop the corporate satire aiming to be that bit sharper and the action roaring as fast and furious as before but with bloodgore even meaner than the first film the first film earned a name for some nasty bloodsoaked violence including a mans genitals being blown off and a man being blasted to pieces but while that was more memorable the violencegore on display here is of a more sadistic and gratuitous nature with a very unpleasant and meanspirited tone to itbr br but overall the film leaves you with a feeling of general apathy why are you watching this when you could be watching the original again instead
