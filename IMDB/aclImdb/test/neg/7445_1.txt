i really dont understand who this movie is aimed at from just the absurdity of it not to mention the ridiculously bad acting cheesy dialogue and the fact that the villain is a child id assume this was meant to be a childrens movie but i think there may be more swear words than pulp fiction not to mention constant references to drugs and general mayhem and killingso which demographic is it trying to please this movie is too schizophrenic like trying to combine country music with heavy metal in the end no one is going to like it because its a bloody paradox i would recommend this movie because its so funny in a bad way except the actors are so patently unbearable that i wouldnt want to suggest otherwisebr br im completely serious when i say that i could not watch more than 15 minutes of this terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiible
