for most people robocop 3 is the film that really is the big disgrace for the robo series it has few fans and most people hate it for its shameless commercial pg13 approach now im not going to say that robocop 3 is any good frankly it pretty much sucks but as far as being a properly shot and executed film it surpasses this piece of circuit chaos yes the truth of the matter is that robocop 2 is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequels to a nearmasterpiece so what if robocop 3 turns robo into a cartoonish super hero in a ultra mainstream production for kids to enjoy  at least its doing it openly i dont know where robocop 2 begins and ends i dont know what or whom its about i dont understand whats going on in it i dont understand which jokes are deliberate and which arent i will go insane if i try to understand the characters i see nothing of any value in anything anybody is saying i cant believe anybody looked at the shooting script and figured it would work and i cant believe that irvin kirshner saw the finished result and figured that he liked what he see he probably didnt by the way neither miller nor weller nor allen did its not hard to see whybr br now robocop 2 has its fans i know this mostly they belong to this league of absolute antipretensions dismissing anybody who expected any depth or subject matter from the first film as academic roger ebert sith apprentices its just a lot of fun a good piece of action and great entertainment the argument goes yeah well i guess if you just dont listen to what any of the characters are saying you could fool yourself that we might as well have arnold in the suit instead of weller dont get me wrong i like a good action film with pure entertainment value as its only  most satisfying  virtue but robocop 2 sir aint no such thingbr br look at the first couple of scenes this horrible actor makes robo repeat that hes just a machine and then goes into this operatic speech about how he could never be a man whereafter murphys wife whos suing ocp for robotstalkings walks in out of the blue and have this sad little moment with him and then is never heard of again i surely would like to go in to this film scene by scene because every one has these kind of absurdities in them its like a twelve year old fan boy has done the screenplay the characters act totally random and first say this then say that ocp wants to stop crime with a new robo especially this drug called nuke but then it seems they really just want to become this big capitalist empire and control the entire city Â– politics are abandoned i guess understandable given the comic relief mayor the villain played by tom noonan who did a better version of this in last action hero and thats saying a lot is an addict but is still used for this machine the woman behind it all has an agenda which is impossible to understandbr br speaking of twelve year olds this film has the infamous role of hub this mad kid who swears and kills people played by a child actor im not going to be all moral about it its a free world and if you want a psycho kid in your action movie go for it i dont know how much of frank millers original vision was put into this but the credits at least acknowledge him as conceiver of the story and if i zoom out i could see this as being quite a cool character its grim for sure to have a maniac killer kid but then again this is the world of robocop and who would be surprised this whole business with the ocp trying to become this giant monopoly over everything is properly dystopian and good as well also the idea of robocop getting in touch with his wife and kid having them embedded into the story somehow  would also be great and as far as i can see a natural and logical step if they now had to make a robocop sequelbr br but of course these are just ideas as many people have already said the screenplay is 100 mess the kid has one scene the torture scene where its hinted that he in fact is just a stereotype messed up kid and then we have this unimaginable scene where he is dying and gets all soft and friendly towards ol tin head why doesnt he just take up his uzi and try to take him down with his last breath isnt that what his character would do does he give his life a little second thought there on his death bed not necessarily given that his last words are it sucks so why it really makes no sense and this can be said about everybody no everything in this film is there a strike in the police force is robocop machine or man whats the deal with turning robo into this community service machine for 10 minutes i mean sure its pretty funny i wouldnt deny that but why build it up and then discard it and why the hell is allen so criminally underused and what is it weller has an obvious urge to express with his character and yeah well the threads are many and the mess is enormousbr br this review is just as messed up as the film the only reason i give an extra star up there is because of the actors from the first film im sure they had good intentions with it i mean its something somewhat stable some kind of anchor in this sea of bad movie making
