i was a huge fan of the original robocopbr br but to say i was disappointed by this first sequel would be an understatementbr br the problems are manybr br glossy though the film may look there are plenty of bloopers on screen for all to see wires cameramen etc something i find wholly unacceptable from someone of irvin kreshners pedigreebr br robocop has become a robot there is no spark of humanity to be found in the character here a true disappointment when one considers that his soul had returned by the end of the first movie here his attitude shows no human side and makes him hard to sympathise withbr br caine is a poor villain ok i know boddiker from the first film was better than the average mainly thanks to kurtwood smiths performance but the usually solid tom noonan creates a character who you couldnt care less about one way or the otherbr br whats happened to the old man i appreciate that he didnt get to where he is by being nice but the change in his character here is nothing short of dumbfounding in the first movie its made clear he despises dick jones tactics and attitude and yet here hes no better than jones it makes no sensebr br doctor faxx is a poor replacement for bob mortons charismatic if unpleasant ocp resident geniusbr br the action sequences save the sequence where murphy is stuck to the side of caines truck are harsh and nasty and repel rather than entertainbr br and finally what is with the musical score dont tell me poledouris couldnt have done it simply because he was working on total recall at the time a series tv or movie soundtrack is part of its personality part of its character when you remove that it harms the familiarity of the characters were watching so its bad enough but shame on leonard rosenman his score here is lurid camp and downright cringe worthybr br the story has its moments to be fair theres a lot of originality in here but it tries too many new things to take in with one film hob is a well realised villain and the only truly dis likable villian in the move thumbs up to gabriel damon therebr br the final showdown between robocop and robocop 2 is fun as wellbr br but for the vast majority of its overlong running time this is a serious disappointment
