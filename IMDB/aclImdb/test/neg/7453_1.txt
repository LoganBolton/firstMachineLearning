you know i was very surprised when watching this movie it aired during the day once when i was sick and having nothing else to do i continued watching this is by far the worst movie ever but to my surprise i kept watching i sat there saying this is terrible but yet didnt change the channel because i was so amused at how bad it was maybe it was the guy that looked like big tom from survivor or the dreadful moustaches and mohawks these characters had that kept me watching however the girls werent half bad but if thats what you want there is far better oh and theres ninjas and pajama boysbr br so if you like ninjas bad acting hilariousand terrible dialogue and two twins who are five feet tall and killing everything in their sight then this movie is for you its so bad its good however i just had to give it a 1 out of ten i couldnt have put a 10 on it up there with lord of the ringsbr br enjoy
