this is by far the worst thing i have ever seen on film my uncles home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crapbr br the plot summary is basically that these twin kick boxers are playing some sick survival game with a man and his private army on some island the man has a very cheap paper mach√© looking handbr br the acting is atrocious in this movie there are scene changes at the drop of the hat for instance for at least 30 seconds we see some guy humming a song to himself which adds nothing to the movie this has the worst dialogue i have ever heard of in my life i dont think this movie could get any worse then it already is i would describe it as a want to be chuck norris action film gone wrong and i hate chuck norris
