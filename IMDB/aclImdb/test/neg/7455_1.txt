why is it that canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre other then action i caught dragon hunt on tv the other day and it was like a train wreck i just could not change the channel its sheer stupidity sapped my willpower its pretty telling that the cast imdb credits with this monstrosity apparently never worked againbr br bad acting bad writing bad narration bad music bad hair bad cinematography it just goes on and on the movie really has nothing to recommend it if youre looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out there are a tonne of other films that wont require you to scorch out your retinas afterwardsbr br i hope this film didnt get money from the government for financing otherwise im never paying taxes again
