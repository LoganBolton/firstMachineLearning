before seeing this film the 1998 version was my only experience of this dickens story i didnt enjoy that film very much but this 1974 adaptation moves on in a particulary tiresome fashionbr br the actors dont shine the main couple michael york and sarah miles are especially wooden cases the only character of real interest for me was anthony quayles intelligent jaggersbr br the so called plot is ridiculous but the story itself is a great one its a real lesson on how your distorted values and obsessive principles can destroy you live with an open mind and dont care what other people say you are what you are if others cant take it  em pip was told this early on but he didnt listenbr br the girl adopted by the weird old lady reminded me a little of the old kaspar hauser story not in that same horrible level but in the way she molded the child to create the executor of her personal vendetta against the entire opposite sex she thought had deceived her pips childhood didnt appear much better the ending didnt seem to fit the rest of the storys style the sets looked cheap and coming to imdb im not surprised to see that this was indeed a tvmovie which i had no idea of when i borrowed it from the librarybr br live and learn so many good movies so little time thats why the reviews are here so you wouldnt have to waste your time on this sort of moviesbr br 310
