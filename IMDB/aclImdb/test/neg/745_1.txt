the filmmakers were clearly on drugs thats the only explanation i have how else do you explain this travesty of a jane austen adaptation northanger abbey is a parody of a gothic novel but this film was made as if it were a gothic novel the bizarre music and dream sequences to me suggest druginduced hallucinations rather than a naive innocent girl with an overactive imagination as catherine of the novel isbr br the actress who played catherine just stands around bugeyed all the time peter firth looks at least 10 years too old to play henry and he actually seemed a bit on the gay side to me i dont see the attraction between him and catherine john thorpes portrayal was rather odd but isabella actually wasnt that bad but nothing could save this piece of crap movie one more thing this film invents a character not in the book a french friend of general tilneys the marchioness why exactly they added her is beyond me must have been the drugs she is scarylooking beyond belief with white foundation red lips and black lines randomly painted on her face dimplesbr br youd think this would at least be entertaining in a so bad its good quality but unfortunately its not its just bad
