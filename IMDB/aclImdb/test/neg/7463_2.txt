the attic starts off well the somewhat dreary story is helped greatly by the two main actors and theres a semblance of a character study going on here but the film goes downhill fast when carrie snodgress character buys a monkey not one of those cute little monkeys she buys a real big chimpanzeebr br this sudden plot device basically kills the movie its just not conceivable for a woman like the one snodgress plays who has a hard time doing anything because of her domineering father for her to out of the blue buy a chimpanzee i mean come on forget about it
