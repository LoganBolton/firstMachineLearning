not a terrible film  my 10 year old boy loved it and he would be the target demographic so i guess they hit the spot pretty dull for an adult thoughbr br hard to relate to animated lego characters even mod hightech onesbr br i thought the choice of the three great virtues of the bionicle world was a bit odd  unity duty and destiny am i the only one who thinks those sound just a bit fascistic especially destiny what about freedom equality justice etcbr br oh well it will sell lego kind of dull for a movie but not bad for a 74minute advertisement could have been a lot worse
