i saw grande ecole at its world premiere on the rotterdam film festival i had no idea what i was entering and if id had any idea i wouldnt have entered this is the most pretentious film ive seen for a long time it tries to be provocative yet deep with its full frontal homosexual sex scenes  it doesnt succeed its nothing but another bad excuse of showing naked persons on the big screen 410
