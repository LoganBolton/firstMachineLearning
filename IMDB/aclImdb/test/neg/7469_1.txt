i saw this film at the new festival in new york it was by far the worst film there its use of uncircumcised full frontal nudity and a wishywashy script and direction that neither commits to a remake of maurice nor decides its a neil labute flick left me feeling why would anyone ruin a perfectly good cast like this it lacks irony and fills the vacuum with sentiment which causes the times when the movie turns on itself to make you want to wipe your face as your mind and heart search for what could be going on in the film but isnt i wish the director and editor had reedited the film because maybe theres more story there that could be released from an otherwise unpleasant experience
