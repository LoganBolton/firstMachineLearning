grande ecole is not an artful exploration of mixed sexuality but if youre in need of it a movie for an xrated channel although i suspect theres nothing in this movie to spoil for a willing viewer the plot is simply an excuse for maletofemale and maletomale couplings set in the unconvincing context of a competition between a parisian school for future ceos and a major school for those seeking higher degrees in the liberal arts theres likewise a frisson of cultural clash between high status and lower status french youth plus a societal conflict involving native frenchmen and arab immigrants from north africa all thats missing is a femaletofemale coupling which could easily have been arranged with no more than a slight twist in the plotbr br the acting is at a somewhat higher level than in the usual pornographic movie  but grande ecole is to be blunt about it no more than pornography with artistic aspirations im not offended by the sex its just repetitive and before long boring wheres the hays office when you really need it
