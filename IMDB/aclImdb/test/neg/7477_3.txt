maybe the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps up right after conan obrien and late nights fans are all of a sudden unsuspectingly watching carsons show carson daly cant hold a candle to leno letterman obrien or any other late night talk show host and last call seems to miss more than hit in this hit and miss genre the shows only redeeming quality is that its so short but i wouldnt call it crap carson daly is sincere and doesnt hide the fact that his show isnt greatthat honesty is actually helpful here while some of last calls skits and material seem to be stolen they still find the mark sometimes actually some of carsons montages have been quite entertaining and the skits occasionally have their moments of decent comedybr br as an interviewer carson is okay even with only one guest not exactly late night material but still above the level attained by a high school av team however he doesnt have the quick wit that makes conan so hilarious i do not like his musical guests but thats more because i am not a fan of that kind of music so im not holding it against himbr br on to the house band i dont know joe firstmans band and wouldnt compare them to the cbs orchestra the tonite show band with kevin eubanks or the max weinberg 7 even cleeto and the cleetones are better but firstmans band mates do still the show in my opinion especially the alto sax player that sometimes shows up he has long dark hair and sunglasses and is always playing in the upper register if anything watch the show for him i dobr br in summary this show isnt even worth a full bag of kibble n bits but it does have an audience and appeals more to the younger mtv generation if you dont have cable and are up at 137 am there really isnt much more to choose from and surprise surprise there is worse out there in that time frame so if youre waiting for poker after dark to come on 30 minutes of last call wont kill you during the wait
