carson daly has to be the only late night talk show host that isnt a comedian what was nbc thinking hes not funny the writing is horrible to all of the sketches are painful to watch the current new karaoke isnt funny at all especially since he tells you what they are going to sing before they sing it the escalator interviews is just stupid and needless to say not funny at all all he jokes especially during the monologue are the least clever dumbest not funny jokes ever put on television i mean anytime he makes a jessica simpson joke he ends it with because shes stupid which cancels out any funniness that was in the joke which was already very low any 3 year old could have come up with any of the jokes and sketches they put on this lame excuse for a show seriously dont watch this show unless youre on the edge of suicide and want something to push you over the edge
