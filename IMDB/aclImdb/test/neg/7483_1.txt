i dont think ive ever gave something a 110 rating but this one easily gets the denomination i find it hard just to sit through one of his jokes its not just that the jokes are so bad but combine that with the fact that carson daily has zero charisma cant set up or finish a punchline and youve got a late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomachbr br i have watched the show never in its entirety but many times still it just creeps up on me after conan i usually watch a minute or two just to see if carson daily is still the worst talk show host everbr br actually if you ever do see him interviewing a guest its just that an interview i feel so sorry every time he has a guest on and their confused smiles try to mask their body language thats screaming get me the hell away from this freak i do recommend watching the show not for a laugh but to ponder how he got on the air and what hes still doing there watch as much as you can i think you will find its complete awkwardnessinteresting
