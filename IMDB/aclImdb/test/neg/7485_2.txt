jon goods wife simply one of the worst titles for a film ever or the red right hand another absolutely awful sounding title that means nothing  has no relevance to the film under which i saw it is set in salem massachusettes 1978 incidently the year i was born which was quite possibly the best thing to happen during those 365 days where five old college friends meet up for a school reunion gayboy fagot roger mather john kuntz is that surname for real just say it out loud martha alden kim brockington rebecca lawson jenna stern  her boyfriend jake stabler john doe alan hobbes michael kevin walker  his wife sandy megan rawa plus john good marc ardito why is the spelling of john different in the title  his wife sara abigail morgan from the word go there is an uneasy tension in the air  when someone mentions their missing friend calef jason winther lots of unpleasant memories come flooding back then comes the phone calls the mysterious nosebleeds hallucinations  guilt as the true horror of the events all those years ago finally comes to lightbr br produced executive produced  directed by kurt gioscia who also wrote the thing  kurt st thomas who gets the art direction credit too  if that wasnt enough they both act in the film as well personally i thought jon goods wife was awful i mean she cant cook or anything ha ha ha only joking seriously though i didnt think much of the film overall for a start its pretty slow going  the entire first 30 minutes is solid snooze material of the reunion consisting of lots of catching up with each other  dull character building exposition the film never explains itself whats with those weird nosebleeds for gods sake the mysterious phone calls the almost inconsequential death of one of the group that might or might not be natural  what the hell was sara all about she comes across as some nosey sex crazed dirty talking shameless bitter blackmailing knowitall whore who apparently sleeps with just about every man she meets some of the dialogue she spouts wouldnt be out of place in a porno  it just seems totally at odds with the rest of the film which plays out more like a drama than the horrorthriller it was supposedly meant to be then theres the ending if theres a worse way to end a film then to just leave literally everything hanging in the air with no closure whatsoever i have yet to see it the whole thing was very predictable as well i mean is anyone watching this not going to know that when they all mention their friend calef went missing there wouldnt be more to itbr br directors gioscia  thomas make an infuriating film on top of the predictability  annoying climax there is a retrospective narration by alan which i simply dont understand as he has no more or less significance than anyone else  at what point in time is he narrating from the reasons behind this narration is never made clear or elaborated upon theres no tension because the whole things so bythenumbersbr br technically the film is ok but nothing special  some of the locations  clothes didnt look particularly authentic to me this never convinced me it was taking place during the late 70s the acting was alright  what about actor john kuntz last name i suppose if his wife was standing next to him we could describe them as a couple of kuntz rightbr br i really didnt think much of jon goods wife a blow up doll would have been better ha ha ha  im not sure who it would appeal to forget about any gore horror violence scares atmosphere or excitement in fact forget about everything that would have made this film watchable because it aint here not recommended
