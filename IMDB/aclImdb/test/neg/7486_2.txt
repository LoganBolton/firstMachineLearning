id picked this one up time and time again in the rental store wondering if i should give it a shot today i broke down and gave it a whirl and i probably shouldnt havebr br while the writerdirector did give the film a respectable effort it fell far short of engaging the characters while you wanted to feel for them just didnt have enough development or depth for you to get truly involved with them saras sexual outbursts got tiring fast i dont mind sex in films and i dont mind bitchy characters but being a bad girl doesnt mean youre prone to excitedly ask people at random if theyd like sexual favors by the time what happened to the characters was revealed i was bored and ready to fastforward to the climax the end anything exciting and nothing delivered the things the folks in the story eventually inform you of seems forced and unrealistic and just wasnt played quite right if theyd have thrown a bit more anguish in there i might have been interested this should have been a more of a suspensedrama film and should have stuck to the title jon goods wife rather than the whole red right hand and horror filmlike cover hell this should have had suspense periodbr br either way watch this on a rainy day or a late night when theres nothing on the television though this isnt as great as id hoped i would go for this over some infomercials
