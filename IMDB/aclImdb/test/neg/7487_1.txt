i thought this was an extremely bad movie the whole time i was watching this movie i couldnt help but think over and over how bad it is and how that was 369 down the drain the plot was so jumpy they did an excellent job at the beginning of explaining who dated who in high school but they never really explained anything after that was it a supernatural thriller was it a regular thriller apparently you can decide for yourself because they didnt see the need to explain i understood basically what happened i think what i got confused about was all of it prior what was the deal with the bloody noses phone calls etc was this guy coming back was the wife channeling carrie or something who knows you certainly wont after watching this movie
