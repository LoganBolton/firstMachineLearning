this movie started off well enough sticking to the mood of the book fairly well even if the acting was not top notch the soundtrack was torturously bad saxaphone and electric guitars it was gratingly incongruous the female singer was positively dreary in the second half of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn too dark for austen northanger abbey is made a dark and scary place whereas in the book it was disappointingly tame and modernized to catherines eyesbr br who in the heck is this marchioness with the ghastly makeup and wig a totally extraneous and unnecessary characterbr br one of the key elements in the book is the general is not a gothic monster like the characters in catherines books his monstrosity is far more complicated in his oppression of his childrens spirits and his treatment of catherine based on money concerns alone he does not lock up his wife or kill her but he does send miss morland on a 70 mile trip alone in a hired carriage with not enough money to pay her way home only her friend miss tilneys thoughtfulness in handing her some money on the way out the door saves her from being stranded this whole point gets seriously muddled in the film they make the general too dark from the outsetbr br peter firth should have not sung this part was painful to watch his depiction of tilney wasnt too bad but it was a shade dark in places henry tilney of the book made sport of miss morlands imagination on trip to northanger but he was never dark firth would have benefited from better direction the young lady who played isabella needed a better acting coach john thorpe was appropriately odious the striped waistcoat and coattails combo he wore was ghastly it certainly fit his characterbr br i think the film would have fared much better with a completely different soundtrack it cast an oppressive pall over the entire movie if i watch it again it will be with the sound off and subtitles on perhaps i would give the film a 4 thenbr br the sound quality of the dvd was quite poor the picture quality was not much better this is glaringly noticeable on a digital televisionbr br when i think of what this film could have been i think of persuasion with amanda root and ciaran hinds
