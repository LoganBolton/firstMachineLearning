maybe its unfair to dislike a movie for what it isnt rather than what it is but i approached this hoping that finally a filmmaker would make a movie about smalltown rural gay men and women instead the focus is primarily on the outrageous bigotry big news of the locals and those in outlying areas and the really gruesome torturemurder of a young gay manbr br so much time devoted to stupid people squawking about aids sin hellfire and perverts so much time devoted to the ghoulish preacher ranting about the bible and gay people getting what they deservebr br i wanted to see more of the people that came to the small town gay bar not those who opposed it in addition the young man who was murdered isnt even from this townbr br the whole movie works as a warning rather than a celebration and its very suspect
