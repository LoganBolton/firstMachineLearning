hello allfor what its worth im in a doctoral program on indonesian politics and returned this semester after about a years fieldwork most of it in jakartabr br im a big movie fan generally so i went out as often as i could and bought tons of local vcds while i was there this one i saw in the theater since it opened while i was there and thankfully closed soon after br br who was the intended audience for this film the spoiled wives and daughters of the indonesian superelite whose antics are weakly and ineffectively parodied the vast majority of indonesians who could never afford even a single dish let alone a full meal in the films central restaurant location or gay indonesian males whose dilemma in the countrys muslimdominated society is reduced to absurdly simplistic howtorespectyourself preaching br br if all this wasnt bad enough the soundtrack was either recorded or mixed so ineptly that even nativespeaking indonesians couldnt hear many of the linesbr br in brief if youre looking for a cuttingedge gaythemed film from a region of the world that seems among the least likely to produce such an animal forget it westler from the early 80s or my beautiful laundrette from the same era succeed far better in putting a happier face on dealing with homophobia and do so by showing not telling through incessant wordy scenes br br overall an unfortunate waste of money in a country that still cant educate all of its children nor keep them healthy
