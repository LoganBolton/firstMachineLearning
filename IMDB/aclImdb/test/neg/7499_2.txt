am i the only one to think that this is a bad moviebr br i admit that horror movies often lack things like a big story or good acting or even good special effects but the way these deficiencies come together in this movie is surprisingly pitifulbr br miserable story the idea of a raped vagina that takes revenge by turning into a man eater sounds quite funny but what the writer made out of it is stupidbr br bad acting the actors move like marionettes they play and look like people who really try hard but completely fail to actbr br bad fx especially the explosion of the van looks unspeakably cheapbr br it is surprising that a director who made some nice movies during his carrier changes over to such messy stuff
