my mom my cousins and i are pretty big jane austen fans we know all the words to the 1995 pride and prejudice masterpiece and have watched gwyneth paltrows emma an embarrassing number of times ive read all the books and ive even sat through sense and sensibility and persuasion a few times so my mom and i thought it would be nice to see northanger abbey on filmbr br bad idea this is just about the worst movie ive ever seen its even worse than the 1998 version of alice through the looking glass or the 1939 nancy drew movie i bought at walmart for 1 my previous worst movies the first thing wrong which you notice in the opening scene is that the heroine catherine has a gruesome and weird imagination inspired by trashy novels that a jane austen heroine would never touch throughout the novel she has dreams day and night in which she is carried off by some hideous man with a greasy wig dragged across a field headed for godknowswhatall and suddenly rescued by a dashing guy on a white horsebr br the second thing any viewer of the movie will instantly notice is the highpitched wailing and saxophone music that is supposed to be the soundtrack no dainty classical music or english country dances here it is also evident almost at first glance that the actress for lack of a better word chosen to play catherine is completely off first she is rather unattractive and is rendered even more so by her unaustenlike behavior her looks and movements are just wacky plus theyre completely affected and unbelievablebr br this sad lack of acting skills affects pretty much all of the actors in the film not even mr tilney the supposed dashing young suitor is decentbr br as more and more characters are introduced a strange taste in costumes on the part of the filmmakers becomes evident huge marie antoinettestyle headdresses clash with the for the most part correctly styled empire gowns a french woman apparently a friend of general tilneys is made up all in black as some sort of ancient goth nightmareshe bears a striking similarity to michael jackson in a black dress her appearance is made even sillier by a huge halfmoon beauty mark on her cheek i also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all of the women were wearingbr br another anomaly that kept my mom and i howling with laughter for about ten minutes was the bathing scene the first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing in a big bathhouse togetherprobably not very likely in the early 1800s then we saw that all the women seemed to be wearing large china or plastic plates worn around their necks with strings the plates floated horizontally on the water containing some mysterious pieces ofsomething we guessed it was soap then aromatic herbs then finally when the mystery substance began disappearing between shots we deduced it was food but im still not surebr br and thats not even half of whats wrong with northanger abbey my warning to anyone who is considering renting this movie stay your hand and if anyone is considering buying itwell i dont even know what to say to thatbr br youd think that when the actors and others making this film got about 14 of the way through theyd realize what a monster they were creating and stop unfortunately they didnt and northanger abbey was let out into the world
