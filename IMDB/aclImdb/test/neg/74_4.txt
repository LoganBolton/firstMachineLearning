talented screenwriter alvin sargent sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in los angeles despite moms flighty behavior apart from several good sequences i didnt quite buy susan sarandon as a flake shes too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devilmaycare lady and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent natalie portman fares much better as her kid and yet theres a creepy aloofness to her work and some of her scenes such as the one where she asks a boy to strip are misguided and uncomfortable to watch certainly not an incompetent piece anywhere but here does have moments that work but it isnt an embraceable film nor has it proved to be an important one  from
