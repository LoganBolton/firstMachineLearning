i live and work in lexington kentucky the town where zombie planet was filmed id heard about the film forever ago from various people who claimed to be a critical part of the production then for several years i heard absolutely nothing imagine my surprise when i found it sitting all by itself at the local video store just itching for a rental so being the cinephile that i am i decided to give these local filmmakers a shotbr br bad ideabr br zombie planet is overlong boring poorly acted miserably shot  and thats just the good stuff i tried my hardest to enjoy it which included removing my brain and setting it on the table so that it wouldnt get in the way of the horrible storyline alas nothing worked zombie planet is so bad its pathetic and the very idea that theyre planning a sequel leads me to believe that the director and his henchmen have listened to none of the criticisms im sure theyve heard move on you guys please in fact refrain from filmmaking altogether or attend a few classes on pacing storytelling and well basic directionbr br otherwise for the love of god hang it up
