now im a big fan of zombie movies i admit zombie movies usually arent all that good but i like them anyways despite the crappy acting and worthless dialogues that occur in almost all zombie movies this one is by far the worst see there are a few ground rules with zombiemovies 1 zombies are suicidal tactics is seldom used and never do they act like a boxer they dont dodge a blow to the head they take it with a ugly smile they dont try and hit you in the face they grab a hold of your arm and bite it 2 zombies cant speak only in evil dead otherwise they do not speak 3 you dont fight zombies with meleeranged weapons you loose in a melee fight against zombies firearms are used in this movie however melee is the way to go which is wrong very wrongbr br it had no redeeming qualitiesbr br if you wish to see a zombie movie see one with an average score higher than 3 on imdbcom
