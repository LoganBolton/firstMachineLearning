once a month i invite a few friends over for a retarded movie night we look forward to movies that are either so bad theyre funny or movies that know they dont have a plot and just show a lot of chests last night we were unfortunate enough to have zombie planet as one of our movies the cinematography is on par with what were used to but the acting was a different story the lead role is played by a johnny depprob zombie wannabe who couldnt get a role in a high school play let alone a lowbudget horror film our indecisive hero who couldnt tell whether or not he wanted to be a badass this scene or a whimpering coward was one of the reasons why this was the first movie of 30 that i have ever had to stop early during a retarded movie night it had the possibility for greatness with a great twist on the standard zombie infection but they took it an entirely different direction based on johnny zombie i personally would not recommend this to any of my friends however its unfortunate that i already invited a few over last night to suffer through 80 of this movie with me
