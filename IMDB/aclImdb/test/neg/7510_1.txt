i work at the video store that rents this video in lexington and i must sayit should have never been made i even know some of the people who worked on it who regret doing so bad effects horrid acting bad script especially i swear the dialog wouldnt have passed for the original psx resident evil its that bad if you want to know how not to make a movie watch this film to learn a thing or two if not dont waste your time and even the director know it sucks because he keeps coming in to try to get us to upsale the movie no sir ive watched twothirds of the horror section and this rates even lower than plan 9 from outer space even ed eood would have said nope thats too stupid even for me
