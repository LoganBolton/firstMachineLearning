i saw this film in a cinemaclub in germany in 1970 most of the attendees were from the local private school at which i was teaching i had seen a few godard films previously while i lived in france and though they hadnt been my favorites i could at least make sense of them being able to speak french helpedbr br the fairly innocuous beginning of le weekend soon turned into a kaleidoscope of images very well maybe too well photographed that soon made no sense to me for me films like books must have some clear sort of meaning this didnt for me i suppose im not into artsy films images still haunt me from the film to this day i refuse to eat rabbit meat wellloved by the french those whove seen the film might realize why yes the theme of materialism came through but the cannibalism the car wrecks and all the other scenes of destruction and horror only sickened me im not sure if i walked out before the end but i certainly felt like it i promised myself that id never watch another godard film and i havent and never knowingly willbr br my rating nothing it was the most disgusting film ive ever seen others may have been more inept silly or stupid ive forgotten those while scenes from this one will haunt me forever
