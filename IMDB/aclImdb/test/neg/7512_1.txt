if you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school try to convince your teacher to see something else believe me anything is better than this movie it is slow paced confusing boring poorly constructed gory gringy do i need to go on its message is good but i have seen them been handled better in several other films the acting isnt even any good this movie is just even more awkward as it start off as being funny not intensional thoughbecause of its surreal story than at the end just becomes uncomfortable to watchbr br i honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life has been robbed why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a threesome for 10 minutes than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear witness a sort of rape than see the female lead role eat her husbandbr br honestly this movie deserves nothing but a 110 and if your not happy with my previewseriously im an open minded guy and i like movies that protest through symbolism but this movie was just awful make any excuse you can to avoid this film
