this movie is a disgrace how can you take one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into some kind of halfassed love story the entire beginning of the movie was not in the hg wells story and didnt need to be also the eloi were done completely wrong they did build houses or form any kind of real society they didnt care about each other at all that was an important part of the story the way they had formed a world that was without hardship or complex emotions they were barely even aware of the morlocks i dont know why this movie was made the way it was but some stories should be told as they are or left alone
