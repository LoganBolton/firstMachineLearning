if you loved the early60s version of the time machine dont waste your time as with last years the planet of the apes this has been reimagined and not for the better and just as with planet its lead actor is woefully miscast and leaden guy pearce a terrific actor of great range is all wrong for this role giving a onenote performance that elicits zero sympathy hes so dour and serious and lacking in awe of the supposedly amazing things he sees that you dont believe for a moment that hes experiencing them worse yet whose idea was it for him to resemble the love child of david spade and calista flockhart a handsome actor here he is sickeningly gaunt which is believe it or not a major distraction frankly the man looks gravely ill and is photographed cruelly he shares absolutely no chemistry with anyone on the screen a direct result of a performance that is out of sync with anyone elses sadly even with a proper leading man this movie doesnt stand a chance for it is fatally burdened with both a totally inept director  whole scenes go nowhere and are poorly realized  and a screenplay that is utterly inferior scattered and at times incoherent  not for a single moment do you care about anyone in this film for the single fact that there is nothing in the way of character development in the original you got to know the eloi so therefore you felt for them and felt their terror of the morelocks here as the movie stresses several times they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly unless youre a member of peta scared sheep are hardly the stuff of entertainment br br samantha mumba does as well as possible in her movie debut but like everyone else in this mess most especially jeremy irons if hes the leader of the morelocks who look like rejects from the mummy returns why then does he look like edgar winters longlost brother is completely wasted also wasted was the money spent on the endless special effects which belie the 70m spent on the film they are uniformly lackluster obvious and unconvincing and then theres the look of the film poorly photographed its art direction and sets are just there and its costumes are typical in design there isnt an original thought or idea expressed behind or on the screen most of all it isnt even fun the filmmakers use the nowubiquitous orlando jones as comic relief but as usual jones is irritating and just how does his electricallydriven character survive in a world seemingly devoid of electricitybr br all in all this is an empty lifeless dull sterile and confused affair didnt they already remake planet of the apes at least that had the fortune of some strong performances br br spoiler the final insult beyond a headshakingly terrible not to mention convenient ending not only do they barely feature the changing dressstore figures they make even the time machine itself an anachronistic gaudy glassnchrome bore if the sopranos had a time machine this is exactly what it would look like pathetic
