is it possible to give a 0 out of 10 rating because this one deserves it while im not a big fan of jane austens books i sat through this one with two women who are well at least we had a big laugh about how bad this film is robert hardy was the only actor with any charisma in the whole thing though he overdid it as he usually does nearly as bad as william shatner but that wasnt enough to save this stinker from total suckitude its often hard to separate the girls dream sequences from what is really happening and so many holes are left in the story that you can barely figure out what is going on too many loose ends and the ending feels like a tune in again next week climax the lead actress is too ditsy and weirdlooking to be a heroine the leading man is too goofylooking and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some kind of cheap newagey pet project of the directors hippy daughter i mean saxophone mixed in with some kind of spacey operatic female wailing so in conclusion i suggest you blow the budget and order a dvd of this one as soon as possible especially if you like disappointment
