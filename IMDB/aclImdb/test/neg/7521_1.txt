i was one of the many fools who were sapped out into paying for this at the theater even though i payed 4 bucks for matin√©e before 6pm pricesbr br the remakes story was hohum the cgi morlocks were lame the eloi were rastafarian to mimic todays fads no i did not think the chick was hot at all the rekilling of the heros modern girlfriend was somewhat cruel overall just a sad bad remake br br ill take rod taylor weena and the fat glowing eyed surfer morlocks over this junk any time my estimation is that many of the reviewers who like this awful remake are young kids which does not account for either good taste or a true value of the old classics which are largely unappreciated by todays confused and everwantingmore youth br br when the 60s version came out i first saw it in the 70s for summer fun it was pretty damn impressive and still holds up you dont have to have an over abundance of cgi in a movie for it to be better too much of this looks fake i cant say enough of how disappointingly bad the morlocks looked and they ran and jumped around like they were in a childs video game 3 stars out of 10
