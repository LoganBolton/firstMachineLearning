worst movie ever i cant believe they had to hire jeremy irons to give this piece of crap some credibility  and still failed did they think that if they stuck to the plot of the book that their target audience wouldnt be able to figure it out on their own probably hey lets make lots of things explode and give mina big boobs and have her speak in an adorably fake broken english thatll make the morons watch but sir thats not how the book went at all i think were mot being faithful to mr wells message fck it were going to the box office here never mind some dead authors ideas on human nature also lets add in orlando jones with some classic black attitude as a supporting character and never mind the interesting conclusion to the book  guy pierce has to get some pssy at the end
