hg wells is spinning no doubt about itbr br really this would have been a decent scifiadventure movie if it hadnt been based on a classic novel and directed by the authors grandson i kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel what resulted was a pathetic and simpleminded bastardizationbr br the novel is a great scifi story but what a lot of people miss when they read it probably because they read it when theyre very young is that its overflowing with social commentary the eloi and morlocks are a satire of the class distinctions of victorian england and the overall message of the film is that everything decays and degenerates a satiric jab at victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever theres no love story no romance with a beautiful eloi womanin the novel the eloi are 3foottall childlike beings with a mental capacity not far above that of an animal the time traveler does befriend an eloi woman but its clear he thinks of her more like a pet and anyway shes killed before the novel endsbr br this movie first tries to give us a totally stupid backstory as to why he wants to travel through time the treacly romance and the lessons he must learn are enough to make film fans vomitbr br the journey into the future is punctuated by a future disaster ok not bad but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that mankind just generally degenerates as in the book more a reflection of the times i guess as the george pal version had a nuclear war take placebr br the general story ugh a total misrepresentation of the novel the eloi are too competent and warlike the morlocks are too intelligent the ubermorlock is an embarrassment and theres no setup he just shows up in time to be killed yawnbr br samantha mumba does ok guy pearce is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and in pain reportedly he broke a rib while filming this he also looks unhealthy and overly thin as if he had been ill for a long time before making thisbr br a sad sorry film version of one of the worlds classics h g wells deserves bettermuch betterbr br
