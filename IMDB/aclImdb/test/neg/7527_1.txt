the 2002 version of the time machine is just the latest in a string of terribly disappointing hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite extravagant special effects br br what a lousy uninspired bland story with no imagination why so totally rewrite such a wonderful scifi classic are todays movie audiences too hip for the hg wells writing largely as is the 1960 george pal version told a much more endearing story even with clunky lowbudget effects beachparty looking eloi and morlocks that looked like smurfs on steroidsbr br the 2002 version must have hg wells turning in his gravebr br 1 the idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old scifi cliché this totally distracts from the love affair with mara what happened to weena that made the 1960 version so endearing this sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie dour if guy pearces character was so brilliant either he or his buddy einstein would have realized the time paradox dilemma  not have it dawn on him 800000 yrs in the future  from a morlock no less doh whats wrong with timetraveling just for fun  adventure  curiosity  as embodied in the 1960 versionbr br 2 only if you saw the first movie would you realize at all what pearce was doing with the time machine when you first see it the george pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of travel though a 4th dimensionbr br 3 the director goes out of his way to make pearces character look geeky a worn out old stereotype of scientists in the 1960 version rod taylor was a little nerdy too at least around weena but managed to be swashbuckling playful and charmingbr br 4 among the key themes of the 60s version  abandoned in the remake  is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity blowing up the moon to destroy humanity is pointless  and doesnt do much for science literacy for over 4 billion years the moon has suffered vastly more powerful asteroid impacts which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker yes science fiction needs artistic license but this is just plain dumb and meaninglessbr br 5 destroying the time machine is stupid too apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing blowing up the machine to kill morlocks is sort of a copout machina ex machina disappointingly pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends a key part of the wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and backbr br 6 having morlocks running around in the daytime totally ruins hg wells wonderfully spooky ghoulish portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night a true cinematic opportunity lost also wells depicted the eloi as frail and childlike these guys in the movie looked like they could take on morlocks if they werent such big baby wussesbr br 7 the one smart morlock  kind of a bleachedout star wars evil emperor  had potential but is so lame and aloof he tells pearce to take his machine and go home  boy what a dramatic high point in the book the morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it and fight to keep itbr br 8 the goof ball hologram at the ny public library is too much it makes light of the idea of human cannibalism the 1960 version simply had the talking rings that delivered a chillingly somber eulogy for humankind derailed evolution is serious stuffbr br its sad the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a weary contrived clunker of a script save the cost of a ticket  popcorn and go rent the dvd when it comes out soon no doubt at least you can fastforward thought the dull parts just like our time traveler
