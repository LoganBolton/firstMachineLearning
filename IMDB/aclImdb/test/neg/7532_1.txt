this is a really really bad movie that may seem like an oversimplification a fickle childish retort comparable to a petty unsubstantiated insult the truth is there is not enough i can say about the confusing senseless plot the really atrocious acting im talking nasty here folks or the random images of violence toward women that make up the chaotic pastiche of radically horrendous filmmaking mistakes that propel this affront to all that is good and decent in the world of cinema nay human culture please take my word for it dont watch it ever im serious stop youll thank me for it later
