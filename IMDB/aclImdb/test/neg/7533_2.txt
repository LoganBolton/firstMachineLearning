with pep squad receiving an average of 47 on imdbcom no wonder steve balderson slanders this website so but the fact is that pep squad is a poorly crafted black comedy both words in quotation marks for a reason its a movie full of overacting cherry beths mother coupled with a couple of lethargic performances beth and julies boyfriend a movie where you can follow cars from twenty feet away in a gaudy red jeep and never be noticed a movie chock full of notsoappetizing cleavage and nudity shots that make you wonder does the director think this is funny or clever most of all the characters are so paperthin and poorly developed that the film becomes quite unpredictable but probably not on purpose pep squad cant decide whether to be a comedy or a drama or a satire patriotic music i get it the movie fails at being serious because the idea of killing for any school position this being prom queen crosses the line into insanity not to mention shots of flag burning and driveby shootings a poor attempt at being controversial and edgy and fails at being a comedy for all the forced and awkwardly placed jokes big butt mama funky black principal and excessive cussing delivered poorly by the principal cast watching the documentary wamego making movies anywhere only made this film more cringeworthy with praise lauded towards it by the director and the directors father hmmmmmm not a black comedy or anything for that matter i guess kansas will have to wait
