think of an extremely lowrent version of heathers and youve got pep squad that sums up the flick in a nutshell i must give credit where credits due though the film has a nice visual appeal to it i liked the cinematography i liked the wild color schemes i liked the costume designs but without good acting a film has no redeeming value id rather watch a film with little visual appeal with good actors and sharp dialogue ie the brothers mcmullen or any edward burns film the actors either recite their dialogue in monotones or scream it out like theyre in a bad soap opera this is why i dont badmouth most mainstream actors lets face it most actors who are mainstream are mainstream for a reason if theyre not great actors theyre at least competent people badmouth leo dicaprio but when was the last time you saw a movie where he recites the dialogue as if hes reading it off the page its a shame because the director seems like he knows his stuff when it comes to mis en scene sp at the same time i cant totally praise steve balderson the director he did write the screenplay which contains some horrible dialogue he might be slightly racist too since theres a black principal in the movie who inhabits a culmination of africanamerican stereotypes
