two teenagers in the northeast of england are desperate to raise money and buy season tickets for their favourite football team they go through a series of comic misadventures but come up smiling in the endbr br the trailer for this film sells it as a comedy and includes most of its lighthearted moments however the tone is increasingly grim and the end result is a depressing story peopled with familiar stereotypes the two heroes have no problems with lying cheating and stealing their adversaries are a callous teacher a pantomime villain of a father a psychotic skinhead and a wellmeaning but incompetent social worker the other female characters are a drug addicted teenager a pregnant schoolgirl and a battered wife who seems to be smoking herself to death there are no likable characters and the audience can only feel either pity or contempt local actors tim healy and kevin whateley both play against type as baddies but the writing and direction of their characters are so onedimensional that they have no more than novelty valuebr br chris beattie and greg mclane give good performances in the two young leads however they are miscast because they have the wrong accent to anyone from the north east it is obvious that they both come from the sunderlanddurham area and yet we are expected to believe they are natives of newcastle as a geordie myself i can assure you that the accents are by no means the same take the phrase let the poor lad speak we say let the pooa lad speek while they say piwer lad spiyk with two distinctly different vowel sounds this discrepancy creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene in sunderland football ground where the two lads are trying to disguise the newcastle accents they dont have and pretend that they come from sunderland  which they clearly do in a gentle comedy this kind of criticism might be seen as nitpicking however the films bleak tone makes it clear that writerdirector mark herman is aiming for gritty realism that means near enough is actually way offbr br i had hoped for humour and optimism from this film and instead found tired old clich√©s tyneside is not a grey wasteland populated solely by losers and in telling us it is herman should have known he would cause offence its interesting to compare the film with the same directors little voice  also largely downbeat and populated by onedimensional characters little voice at least has a talented heroine and doesnt wallow in misery to the same extent ive heard belter ranked alongside this years billy elliot but that film is a vastly more enjoyable and lifeaffirming experiencebr br incidentally i may be just too old but having lived on tyneside for 42 years i have never heard anyone outside this film use the expression purely belter
