contrary to most of the comments in this section i have to say this film just barely escapes the definition rubbish the only readers who seem to be aware of what a catalogue of clich√©s it is are those who like me live in the northeast and know at first hand what the area is like i am totally sick of films that are supposed to be realistic yet portray the working class of wherever as stupid criminal lowlifes but then excuse them because of their social background and funny i smiled briefly twice and laughed once but that was at the incongruity of two boy actors with sunderland accents supposedly trying to hide their newcastle accents from sunderland football fans there was only one likable character in the whole film and that was the senile grandfather played quietly but very competently by roy hudd  the only nongeordie in the castbr br as for the writing  well i just wonder what university sociology department the author studied at he certainly had no ear for the local accent and i too have never heard the expression purely belter  and not only am i a native im a linguist whos written articles on the local dialectbr br dont waste your time and eyesight on this garbage it isnt funny it isnt realistic it isnt entertaining and it is fundamentally dishonest
