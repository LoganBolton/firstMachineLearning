yep this has got to be one of the lamest movies ive ever seen its utterly tasteless has no style whatsoever the story is so thin that you can watch television through it and the whole film has so many holes you could drive an oil tanker through itbr br sure i appreciate a good bmovie as much as most male white homo sapiens do but this has got to be the worst ive seen in fact its so b that it lacks everything that makes a bmovie interestingbr br the whole movie is based around such charming artefacts as the characters beating the crap out of each other various bodily functions and the complete lack of sanity of anything onscreenbr br its not even funny in fact its quite the opposite i found it even boring at times due to its extreme predictabilitybr br i find nothing good to say about this movie it was a waste of time watching it and i hope others dont do the same mistake if you also pay for it you should get a serious brainscan done
