wow this film was terrible it is as simple as that it is actually the first time that i walked out early as far as i can remember this turned out okay though i had a very nice chat with two most charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up on that crap they called a moviebr br where to start bad acting bad jokes faecal humour which i simply cannot stand sorry but snot pee and scat are not funny you have seen the title picture that scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes with the two heroes hitting and mutilating each other which is supposed to be humorous all by itself it is notbr br apart from body fluids violence and crossdressing i do not remember much about this at least not much good i was really really disappointed by this piece of garbage or let us be honest here given that i am actually a big fan of british ie black humour i was angrybr br so want my advice three words do not watch
