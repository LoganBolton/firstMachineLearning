sometimes changes to novels when theyre made into films are not only necessary but a good thing however in the case of northanger abbey its a very very bad thing not only is the story itself ripped to shreds but the satire is almost completely absent from the film and its mixture of romance and intrigue doesnt even touch upon the biting commentary that austen put into her work it fails to be amusing or satirical at all and instead turns the characters fascination with her fantasy world into mostly a dramabr br this affects the romance as well its meandering and aimless chemistry and interest are never established the reasons tilney is attracted to catherine are completely absent from the film leaving the audience to wonder what it is he sees in her at allbr br hopefully some day soon well get a more faithful version if austens satire
