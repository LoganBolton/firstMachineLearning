the first time i had heard of guest house paridiso was in the er washroom after having just seen fight club in each urinal was deposited a small round black circle when the circle came into contact with moisture to put it delicately it caused a colour picture to form with photographs of the two stars and the tag line youll p yourself laughing when youd finished washing your hands the circle had dried and faded to black again waiting to spring its surprise on the next victimbr br okay maybe the punchline wasnt terribly sophisticated but you have to admit it was innovative in fact i think i can honestly say ive never seen anything like it in my life before and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing thats a real feat what a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promisebr br i hate to pan guest house paridiso and i am indebted to rik mayall richard twat and adrian edmondson eddie elizabeth ndingombaba for many years of laughter through their appealing television series be it the invention of the young ones 19821984 the sitting room plays of bottom 19911995 or even solo work such as rik in the new statesman 19881993 in fact this would have made an hilarious 45 minute tv special unfortunately its an 89 minute filmbr br theres definitely some merit to be had and i laughed continuously throughout the protracted finale which spoofed the exorcist and raiders of the lost ark and involved well youll have to see that bit for yourself yet often the pace is leaden and a sterile atmosphere is throughout the two stars edmondson taking his usual backseat this time due to the fact that he adequately directs never really get into first gear mayall only sporadically showing the foulmouthed mania that makes us love him on the small screen indeed the writers presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being underdelivered to the audience the slight hints of depth seen in the series richies effeminate failed socialclimbing for example are not present here and instead we are left with parodies of parodiesbr br the fawlty towers accusation does pass water complete with drunken chef and unseen calledfor waiter pasquele which uncannily rhymes with manuel some of the ideas such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a childrens swing hanging over a cliff face are very very funny but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen the two constantly looking for a studio audience that isnt there and all the dead laugh areas patched up with incidental comedy music that would have been dated in a carry on film two decades agobr br paridisos brand of puerile sadistic perverse humour is funny and i feel sure it will make you laugh  just not as often as it should
