no wonder so many young people have attention deficit disorder it seems that stage dance productions these days are all about how many cameras and camera angles a director editor can squeeze into a 1 hour show is there a special emmy category for this feat try counting them sometimes for something different to do with this otherwise completely unwatchable show br br i tried to make out at least a few faces of some of the other dancers in the production that was impossible they didnt appear to have any faces just blurs  it was just michael flatleys face michael flatleys bare chestnice sheen michael flatleys feet and that patented flatley overtheshouldercomehither look repeated infinity squared since he was an executive producer of this cut and paste job i guess that was to be expected one doesnt have to wonder too much as to who his target audience is br br riverdance was a much better production as it tried to present the show pretty much as one might see it from the audience not the catwalkside wings or floor nail perspective if im not mistakeni believe sir michael has retired thank god for small blessings
