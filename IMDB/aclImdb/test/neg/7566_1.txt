there have been many movies on living the american dream and this is one of thembr br first of all on the technical side there is a lot wrong the audio is bad i had trouble understanding the dialogs here and there and the camera positions could have been betterbr br they really tried to come up with a good movie but for example the part where they show how jonathan is loosing himself in the dreamwith girls drugs and alcohol is done very badly the acting is very poor as well from all the characters in the moviebr br i had a hard time watching it from the beginning till end and couldnt wait for the movie to be overbr br if your expectations are low and youre bored on a sunday with bad weather watch it if you in for a deep story with action then this is not your moviebr br normally i would not have give a score of 1 but of 45 for this movie but the reason i gave it a 1 is because of the bad audio and camera uses not to mention the bad cut scenes with cheesy effects
