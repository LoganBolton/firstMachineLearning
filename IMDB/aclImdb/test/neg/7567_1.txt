if i could give this movie less than a 1 i would certainly do that i had read a review of this film in the la times and i found myself walking by the theater and remembered the review my wife and i were game and we thought it cant be as bad as the critic said  you know critics sure enough give me a break with the awful acting horrible camera work poor use of the budget that has been mentioned over and over again as an excuse ive worked on films with smaller budgets that are 100 times better its the director and the producer that makes films work  they choose the teams thats it if they dont put it together and make it workit simply wont so they didnt  and it doesnt i dont think they can i just had to take the time to write this reviewthough im sure the film crew doesnt appreciate this review  i hope im doing you all a favor with my wish for you to do well but  in another career good luck
