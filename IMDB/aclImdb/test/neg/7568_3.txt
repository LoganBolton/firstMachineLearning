i like jhorror anime and even kinda dig the pink movement which some have claimed this a member of but this did nothing for me i willing to go a step further and label this one of the biggest let downs of my film watching careerbr br three young rockabillies go around getting their kicks out of raping girls one of the group starts to develop a concisions about their passtime when his kid sister nearly catches them in the act invariably the group turns on itself as the once friends begin fighting with each other it ends on a down note befitting the film as a wholebr br aside from watching the friends yell at each other which they do a lot there isnt a whole lot going on here the film is littered with long continual shots that only exacerbate the issue on top of that even when the film starts to do something interesting it suddenly gets bogged down in ethereal philosophy that never makes any sense for instance after one of the buddies has his change of heart about assaulting girls he goes out and does it again but then stops his buddies from taking their turns huh the cinematography is slow and lighting is poor the writing is ok as is the acting which makes this a subpar cinematic effort from the start mix the lack of technical prowess with the flimsy content and you have nothing more than a waste of timebr br oh and one more extra note at least one of the girls that appears in the buff does not look old enough to be doing that kinda stuffbr br 310
