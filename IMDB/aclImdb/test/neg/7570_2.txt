this has to be one of the most awfully scripted films ive ever seen its basically a remake of the beast from 20000 fathoms 1953 but done with your standard snakelike puppetmonster instead of a sleek ray harryhausen creation combine the plot of that classic monster movie with the production qualities and acting level of the creeping terror and you have an idea of what this movie is likebr br the movie is dubbed although by the original actors i think that the movie was originally dubbed in italian for that countries audiences then redubbed for us release which just makes the movie seem weirdthe sounds like in a japanese monster movie just dont quite match properly to the action on the screen even if the actors lips are moving properlybr br poor ray millandhes certainly come a long way down from the lost weekend or dial m for murder or any of the number of excellent movies he was in add this to his other scifi travesties panic in the year zero x the man with xray eyes and you can see a once good actor fallen into a boris karloff syndromestuck doing really bad horror films in foreign countries just for the work
