and abysmal overthetop acting you might enjoy this rubbish flickapparently atomic bombs makes life mutate in about a day or two or according to other viewers wake them up or so it seems and apparently massive atomic explosions off the coast of spain doesnt make anyone ask any questions at all coming to think of it the plot doesnt make sense in any way whatsoever why would evil sock puppets attack lighthouses so the nukes going off for no reason at all doesnt stand out too muchbr br ok getting past this and the fact that the monster is a glorified thing you make of socks in kindergarten you may actually be able to stand this but for once the complete lack of gore doesnt help leaving the monster attacks in all their naked rockbottombudget glorybr br i doubt youll be able to watch this though so better stay well away
