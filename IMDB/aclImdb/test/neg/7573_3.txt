this film has me seriously doubting again whether armando de ossorio was a good filmmaker or not his blind dead films are praised by many fans this i can understand but wannabe gothic vampire trite like malenka doesnt show any signs from a gifted filmmaker and that also goes for serpiente de mar it features horrible acting a dumb plot stupid events a lot of other things you can expect from a bad monstermovie and also veteran actor ray milland who does his best to mumble his way through this film while not having much of a clue about what hes doing in it apparently milland was already very ill while shooting serpiente de mar his last theatrical feature and going out with a ridiculous stinker like this makes it all the more sad one last appearance alongside peter cushing in a madefortv film directed by roy ward baker also in 1984 doesnt change much about itbr br but the sock puppetsea serpent is a hoot to behold watch it swirl up a lighthouse and crush it see it destroy a harbour with miniature boats look at it demolish bridges and munch on charming miniature trainsbr br good badness yes 310 and 710
