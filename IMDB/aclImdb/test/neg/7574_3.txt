amando deossorio was never one to let a lack of budget get in the way of telling one of his stories his blind dead series started off great but had some truly laughable moments such as shots of a small model boat in a water tank for the ghost galleon in the sea serpent he hits rock bottom and takes some notable actors along with him telling the tale of a silly sock monster that brings googleeyed terror to a few water tanks and miniature aquariumsbr br a vague opening sequence sets the stage and demonstrates an aborted military mission where american pilots for some unknown reason drop an atomic bomb brazenly cartooned into the frame of the film somewhere in the ocean off the coast of spain the military commander gives this order from an office that features a prominent american flag and a portrait of a derangedlooking ronald reagan one of only a few things that makes this movie really seem like the eighties the other two are the hilariously inept subtitle that declares the year to be 1985 and tyria powers dated sheena easton hairdo which would have looked really cool next to some ripped neon sweatsbr br one of the kookiest monsters you will ever see rises from the depths disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb we learn that the errant atom bomb has killed off a great deal of the local fish unfortunately for our cast it has no effect on the sea serpent which swiftly descends on the coast of spain for some miniatureset mayhembr br now when i say the monster is unrealistic i am not exaggerating its not just sort of fake looking im sure the filmmakers did the best with the ten dollars that they seem to have been allotted but most of the time it looks like it was made out of crayola markers a ping pong ball and an old sock not only that it has this ominous music that accompanies it wherever it goes music that sounds so much like the jaws theme that its a wonder nobody got suedbr br along with tyria power timothy bottoms and ray milland are caught slumming and the dialogue could not have been any more dismal through a series of plot contrivances our leading actors are thrown together in a quest towell im not sure what the purpose is bottoms and power have got to prove the serpent is real in order to save their butts he is blamed for a serpentinduced shipwreck she is locked in the loony bin after a sighting none of this matters because by the end of the movie nothing has been resolved nobody admits the serpent is real and its not even dead furthermore power and bottoms are still on the lam from the law br br as illogical as it seems nobody but our heroes knows that the serpent exists despite numerous disappearances a trashed lighthouse and a crushed railroad bridge and they embark on an extended nonadventure to track down and chase the monster awaynot kill it since they know they are no match for it their big plan is to use flares to scare it off although their scheme is botched the serpent causes a big explosion in the water after it attacks a bridge support dont ask and the giant sea snake is so frightened that it swims away the critical viewer would wonder why the serpent wasnt frightened off earlier in the movie when it caused a couple of big explosions after crashing into a dock but never mind it swims away and our heroes are sure its gone forever the endbr br i can only imagine the horror that the stars felt when they saw the completed film they just worked on a lamebrain script and a couple of dim reaction shots could never have prepared them for the embarrassment of sharing screen time with a splicedin sock puppetstop motion beastie at least the supporting characters got to have fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed by a giant serpent head im not sure what was going on when they made this movie the monster is cheap but there are some rather elaborate miniature sets so somebody did spend some time making those not to mention the stopmotion animation involved its seemingly played straight although maybe this films sense of humor went over my head in the end the film is nothing more than an easy target for a drunken commentary watch it at a party for best results
