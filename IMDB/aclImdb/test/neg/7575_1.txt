i absolutely positively cant believe my fellow imdb reviewers all the praise about how original this movie is its like theyve never seen ring or the million of imitations thats come out in the 10 years since that movie and some of them claim to be horror movie buffs i think not shutter is okay average id say i give it 5 out of 10 but theres just no way its original and great and the most frightening thing ive ever seen as one reviewer said puhleeeze people this one is plain its predictablebr br i swear if i see another ghost movie where the hero traces the past of the ghost in order to find out why shes so mad and after them im going to screambr br original give me a break you people need to get out more or at least stop calling yourselves horror movie fans
