one of my coworkers recommended this one implying that it was one of the most frightening movies she ever watched i checked it out together with my girlfriend and we gave up after 50 minutes or sobr br yesterday i had a long talk with my coworker were still friendsbr br this movie is as original as the latest film starring steven seagal it brings absolutely nothing original to the table the spooky parts have been done thousand of times beforebr br the biggest fault however is the painfully slow pace of this movie the periods between the scares are completely wasted with meaningless dialog and a lot of nothingbr br 1 of 10 molotov cocktails
