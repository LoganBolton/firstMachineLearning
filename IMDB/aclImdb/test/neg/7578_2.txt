i dont know but the movie was just too similar to other movies ive seen the ring the eye dark water theyre all the same to me dont get me wrong its beautifully made lovely camera work great graphics but that story is just too too common in the end its the score that makes the suspense you know the screams rumbles the characters in the movie are also not reacting very naturally moving very slowly surprised by anything they see i know some people that love this kind of film and if you do being a well made movie i guess it doesnt hurt to watch it but if youve seen the movie ive mentioned above and didnt like them then id suggest you dont bother
