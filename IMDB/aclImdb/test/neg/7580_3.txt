i decided to watch this movie because it has been noted as the scariest movie ever so thats what i expected unfortunately what i found out is that the movie didnt have a single scary moment in it and im the kind of person who jumps very easily the movie was nothing but terrible clich√©s and every time there was a jumpmoment it was incredibly obvious the pros of this movie would be the music and the odd scene thats actually shot well like the very last scene when she opens the door and you see tun in the reflection and when it swings back to him you see the ghost on his shoulders overall this movie really added nothing new to the jhorror genre and allaround lacked creativity and scares
