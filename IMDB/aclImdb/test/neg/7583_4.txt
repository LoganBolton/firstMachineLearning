roger spottiswoode isnt the worst director and he did a good job on the underrated scifi thriller the sixth day aka the box office downfall of mr schwarzenegger however air america has to be one of his most inept projectsbr br it comes across as an amalgamation between drama comedy and war film  its not a very convincing mix in fact i found it to be overbearingbr br robert downey jr during his heyday stars as a pilot recruited into a top secret cia organization operating during laos in the vietnam era mel gibson plays his copilot and he stumbles upon the knowledge that theyre trafficking drugs and what notbr br the movie was hyped on release because it starred two famous faces and aerosmith had rerecorded the doors classic love me two times for the soundtrackbr br the redo of the song is pretty poor which suits the film
