i normally wouldnt waste my time criticizing a useless movie such as this however im off of work this week so i have plenty of time to wallow in meaningless trivialities to start let me say that i frequently enjoy noncommercial nonmainstream nonamerican cinema feel free to click on my user profile for a supporting filmography that said there are plenty of bad movies that are released in countries outside of the us trust me ive been tortured by hundreds of them lost in beijing is one particularly bad filmbr br the opening half hour is an impressive nonstop exhibition of moral degeneracy this film provides some classic morals that belong on the same level as kim kiduks bad guy 2001 br br 1 women actually enjoy being raped 2 rape should be glorified praised and respected 3 feel free to rape any woman you like because while your doing her shell eventually start to like it and reach orgasm 4 if youre wife gets raped make sure you blackmail her rapist for lots of money but if he doesnt pay just repeatedly bang his slut of a wife as compensation 5 if youre wife gets raped be sure to screw and degrade her the next day while playing the role of the rapist taunting her with lines like did he fuk you like this 6 if youre husband is a rapist just accept it 7 after you personally get raped befriend your rapist and hang out with him whenever possiblebr br how can anyone in their right mind care about any of these characters theyre nothing more than a bunch of degenerates who not only live their lives in careless ways but actually revel in their meaninglessness and support each other dont misunderstand me though im very capable of enjoying films that depict lifestyles and morals that are contradictory to my own ichi the killer 2001 and moonlight whispers 1999 are very interesting portrayals of sadomasochism strange circus 2005 is an exceedingly perverted play on child sexual abuse marriage is a crazy thing 2002 is a scathing indictment on traditional marriage even religiouslybased movies like running on karma 2003 and samsara 2001 have entertained me on occasion the difference is that those films actually have some interesting psychological content and character development to them whereas lost in beijing has virtually nonebr br its known that people with unorthodox mindsets exist on this planet but without some kind of character development or psychology behind the acts themselves you end up with a superficial exposition of despicable behavior why exactly does bing bing eventually befriend and care for her rapist why does the wife of a rapist accept his behavior unconditionally the filmmakers never bothered to tell us even the obvious juxtaposition of rich and poor classes was ineptly conceived and in the end served as a mere situational ploy it all feels too bland and forgettable after the filthy opening half hour subsides br br other reviewers here seem to have confused moral ambiguity with complex characterization the reason you cant choose which person to root for is because they werent developed properly dont think that this movie has complex characters just because theyre not clearly defined on the contrary the reason theyre not clearly defined is because we know nothing about them or what theyre thinking this is hardly a positive attribute of this movie br br on the positive side the camerawork and acting are quite good but everything else just gets duller and duller as the film progresses you can place this alongside trash like turning gate 2002 what time is it there 2001 irreversible 2002 and the aforementioned bad guy
