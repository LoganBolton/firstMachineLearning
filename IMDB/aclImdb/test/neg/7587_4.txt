i do not generally appreciate lightweight attempts at creating humourous stories which means that anita no perd el tren cannot score very high for me the story is good a middleaged but still goodlooking woman finds a new love but the attempts at making this film as a romantic comedy only managed at times to be somewhat comical br br rosa maría sardà has ably demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in such productions as amicamat qv todo sobre mi madre qv las amargas lágrimas de petra von kant qv and el embrujo de shanghai qv however the powers that be have over the years dished her out a lot of trivial stuff for the cinema and for tv something similar could be said of josé coronado perfectly able to produce serious performances maría barranco belongs safely in this groupingbr br such that in the end i was left with the feeling that i would be real pleased to see a new making of this film in a serious tone which would allow the actors to really show their performing skills and the curious thing is that it should be done with exactly the same leading actors wasted talent on a rather silly film that could have been very promising indeed
