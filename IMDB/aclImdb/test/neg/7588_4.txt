it just so happens that ivan the terrible parts i and ii both had entries in the 50 worst movies book by harry medved now i do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an overstatement though they are still both pretty poor filmsparticularly the first one as it featured more eye rolling and googly eyed looks than i have ever seen before director eisenstein and an awful lot of other people out there thought this made the film artsy and profoundand since i am legally sane i must say that i hated this first film the second while still very incompletelooking is a vast improvement as eye rolling is minimal though overacting and long boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1 while part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour especially since it never gets to ivans insane behavior later in lifelike killing his son and heir while in a fit of anger since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him its no surprise that ivans life story is left very incomplete even without all the truly awful behaviors of ivan apparently the supremely evil stalin still didnt like the film and wouldnt allow its release during his lifetime maybe he didnt allow this because he was more worried people would see what a huge waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing stalin as a crazy guy just like ivan br br by the way there was one segment of this tedious film that was just so cool that the film merits a 4 without it a 2and thats the scene with prince vladimir at the banquet it is welldone and pretty funny in a dark way and the scene was done in a russian version of 2color technicolor this is very odd by the way because by the mid1930s a vastly improved true color process was developed by technicolor that no longer made everything look all orangyred and greenishblue so this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film very odd indeed for the 1940s
