its not just that the movie is lame its more than that this movie is just unnecessary do we need another western how about a western with afroamericans in the titles roles sound stupid implausible and a lame attempt at modernizing the genre it is incredibly lame and simple minded its like that lame baz luhrman film romeo and juliet where he set it in modern times to attract young folks and create some hype with his revamping of a classic tale well baz luhrman failed miserably and so does this mess the story is actually not bad however the whole idea of removing the racism out of a racist genre by casting an all afroamerican cast is racist in itself its also puerile and simple minded like baz luhrmanman hes a bad director hey i hear you say this was directed by mario van peebles hes also in the film how can it be racist its not i said the idea of casting all afroamericans instead of caucasians was the film isnt racist its just pointless stupid and very very boring
