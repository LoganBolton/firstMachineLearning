it has been a tradition since my first vhs recorder for me to collect several of the incarnations of the old chestnut by charles dickens and i taped this one and karrolls christmas this year fortunately when this one was run on the hallmark channel at the ungodly hour of 3 am i was spared having to edit commercials from it this was however its only saving grace br br the writing was excruciatingly dull with almost no clever scenes to save it from being anything more than a teenybopper soaper like beverly hills 90210 in this one a good man who was cast aside for her celebrity seems the only logical explanation for her transformation into a scroogelike tv talk show hostess it wasted dinah manoff who just plays bitch goddess to the other bitch goddess tori spelling who by the way had more coats of paint on her face than some colonial houses and bill shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this otherwise dreary adaptation br br some of the best opportunities are wasted like the entrances of the ghosts aunt marlas entrance could have been spectacularly funny in the hands of a decent writer but this christmas turkey didnt have one evidentlybr br tori spelling may be a lovely person but she has all the acting skill of a mannequin and that makes for a bad show all by itself br br yes it was good to see gary coleman work again but the script gives him nothing to do really except roll his eyes and spout truly lame dialoguebr br and what is most infuriating was that the transformation from scroogedom to tori sweet and light is as convincing as a passionate conservative now if anyone wants to write the ultimate scrooge tale of a george bush and karl rove we might have a refreshing change from the usual bad christmas carol clonesbr br i suppose if youre a fan of ms spelling andor 90210 this might be your cup of christmas cheer id prefer a stiff shot of scotch and a cold beer to wash it down myself this one i just may cast away before it is with me here for a long long timebr br god save us everyone
