unfortunately this is not one of those movies which at least make you laugh at their unbelievable stupidity it has no entertainment value at all it just plain sucks i dont know where to start to explain how much this movie annoyed me i think what really takes the cake is the unbearable soundtrack it sounds as if someone took a simple beat and then for the rest of it let a 5 year old child run amok with a synthesizer and taped it its really that awful and as if thats not enough theres not one scene in the movie without music noise by the end of the movie youre either deaf or already cut off your ears earlier which would at least keep you from falling asleep since there is nothing happening in the movie to keep your attention just a lot of bad acting a few cheap and unconvincing kills no story at all it just jumps from one scene to another and you as the viewer can try to make any sense of it and in the last 30 minutes or so you can witness some of the worst special effects ever its extremely boring do not watch this movie you could do something much more entertaining like staring at a wall or reading the phonebook did i mention how much the soundtrack sucked
