this was a real let down for me the original bride with white hair is a great kung fu fantasy film but this one was pretty weak i didnt care at all for the new characters who unfortunately dominated the screen time and the story wasnt well developed while the first film was tragic and involving this one was tedious as i merely counted the time to the end when the illfated lovers would actually meet the action was poor in this one as well the fights were not choreographed very well and there really wasnt much kungfu at all just a few weak sword fights between the highly dislikable lui and one of lins henchwomen lin herself mainly uses a sort of telekinesis to throw people into walls and sometimes her hair a far cry from the impressive showing with the whip and kungfu she displayed in the previous film i still gave this movie a 4 because at least it was fast pace and i did want to see what was going to happen at the end though i as most anyone who watched the first one predicted it would go down the way it did and after seeing it i found it anticlimactic and wished they had either made a proper sequel or just left the story alone i really recommend the first one but as for the sequel only fans of the genre and those who really want to see lin as the bride one more time need apply
