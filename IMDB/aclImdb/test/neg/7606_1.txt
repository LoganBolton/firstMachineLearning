i made the mistake of watching dark star 1974 late one night many years ago it was one of the stupidest movies that i have ever watchedbr br 1 bad actingbr br 2 bad writingbr br 3 scientifically stupid plot destroying an entire planet because its orbit is unstable or in the way will only make matters worse instead of having one large easily avoidable object youll have thousands of smaller but equally lethal and more difficult objects to trackbr br 4 completely unrealistic characters a painted beach ball as a space alien the writers must have been doing too many drugsbr br not surprisingly the majority of actors that starred in dark star never did anything else of those that did do anything else the majority never acted again after dark star therefore having dark star on ones acting resume was a death star to ones acting career
