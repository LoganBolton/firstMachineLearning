i watched a movie called dark talon dated 1974 the credits to this movie are exactly the same as dark star so im going to presume it was an alternate title dark talon was nowhere near as funny as everyone else here states the acting was lame the editing slipshod and overall stupid at the beginning theres an annoying 1970s trucking song called benson arizona that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie basically the plot revolves around a small crew of an interstellar bomber that goes around bombing places that are unstable the bombs are sentient and respond to people the obligatory disaster disrupts communication between the bombs and the crew one of the crewmen goes out and has an absurdly idiotic existential conversation with the bomb that made no sense whatsoever the movie i saw was done in under an hour and a half with commercials thrown in so i suspect that dark talon is an overedited version of dark starbr br the alien is an inflatable red beach ball spray painted with a pair of monster hands that it walks on it was silly and unconvincing as an alienbr br its hard to believe that john carpenter had a hand in this his other movies were so much better
