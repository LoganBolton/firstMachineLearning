an awful film badly written badly acted cliched hackneyed dross the premise is such a good one and a chance to educate about black cowboys but the film is truly dire it is a curious mix of a bad 1950s randolph scott b movie and a bad 1970s spaghetti western the villains are cardboard the flashbacks laughable the dialogue excruciatingbr br the deliberate anachronisms such as victorian rap singers and modern swear words like motherfer are irritating to the extremebr br a frankenstein monster that died on the lab table
