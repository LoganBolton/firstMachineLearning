i really seldom give either one or ten stars to any movie but this was so awful i had to make an exceptionbr br i am a scifi fan and have seen a few comedic takes on scifi that i genuinely like there just wasnt anything here to likebr br i realize this was started with an extremely small budget by a film student but even considering that the sets and effect are bad the cinematography is mediocre but may be the best part of the moviebr br the acting is bad a sad state when the female voiceover for the computer is the best actor the dialogue is bad the script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost nonexistentbr br the humor is not just subtle and sublime its nowhere to be found as an example a whole 20 minutes of the 80 minute film is spent on a lame 2 punch combo joke with the alien mascot and the elevatorbr br this was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50s scifi to 2001 what we end up with though is just a slightly updated version of an old 50s scifi cmovie at least those movies were funny because they took themselves seriously
