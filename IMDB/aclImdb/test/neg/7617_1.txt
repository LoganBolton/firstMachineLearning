ive been a fan of jim henson and his characters since the very beginning the most beguiling thing about them was the love and innocence and camaraderie shown kermit was a role model of deep thinking and problem solving a spiritual character yet sweetly and believably so all the other characters were slightly eccentric but it demonstrated how different kinds of beings can coexist in a caring manner together respecting each others differencebr br following movies have somewhat kept the same vibe yet this its a very merry muppet christmas movie would have jim henson spinning in his grave these characters have been completely rewritten to be horny nasty selfish and cheesybr br the cast goes on to portray god as an uncaring corporate head with a mean streak angels as spineless nonspiritual corporate staff and the movie was so bad i had to stop watching i had bought it for my greatnephew but fortunately i preview anything i give a childbr br this movie deserved the trash bin instead and has no socially redeeming content or charmbr br shame shame on the people who rewrote the characters and departed from jim hensons original heartcentered socially conscious version it does a terrible disservice to a great hearted man who is no longer around to defend his creations
