i saw this movie for the first time on nbc friday 112902 it was a pretty good movie but i dont think it would be the kind of muppet movie jim henson would make i mean first of all pepe using the word sexy every now and then and pepe saying it would suck and i defenitly know jim henson wouldnt allow kermit yelling i wish id never been born thirteen time a minute this movie just isnt like a classic muppet movie sure i can understand nicky holiday stealing the baseball diamond from the great muppet caper but a business lady cheating the muppets in a contract for their theater to turn it into a smokers nightclub if jim henson was here today he would hate this movie
