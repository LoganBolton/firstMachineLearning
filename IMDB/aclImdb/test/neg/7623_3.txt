i purchased a dvd of this film for a dollar at the big dept store thats probably the best and kindest comment i have to offer on it at least it didnt cheat me out of the cost of lunchbr br the problem with chiller is cravens problem as a director the man has his apologists who claim his traveling papers prove hes a really smart guy and allaround sharp conceptualist but its no secret that as a director he has never possessed one iota of the visual and storytelling sense of a hitchcock as vigorously attested by chiller hes much closer to that legendary flatfoot hershel gordon lewis what craven lacks as a director is the main ingredient that would lift him from director for hire to a higher plane of film makingbr br lets be specific the transitional moments of this film are sleek the establishing shots give it the feel of a quality production the film looks professionally put together in the way a film shot by a tv commercial director would a thought the films only visual distinction these transitions that at least look professionally handled may very well be the work of some second unit directors its the parts between the bridges and smooth transitions  the drama  that fall flat br br the core of the proceedings are invariably perfunctorily handled the critical shots after say the departing car drives into the wellpositioned camera then we cut to the night exterior of a hospital then to the waiting area and hallway then to the phone booth in the corner that will figure in the next bit of action are quickly dispensed so we can hurry up and get to the next part craven never comes anywhere close to exploding the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment the net result of all this misplaced attention to the least important parts and the fumbling rush to keep things moving is a film that feels like the work of the fledgling art student who sharpens all his pencils fussily adjusts his easel and lighting setup grinds all his pigments stretches and primes his canvas and then has nothing to say craven like the art student never gets to the meat of the exercisebr br for craven apologists who will point out that this film was made for tv i will point to spielbergs duel and say no more
