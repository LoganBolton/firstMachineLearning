after his success with a nightmare on elm street in 1984 director wes craven for some reason decided that his next project would be this tv movie im not a big fan of this director on the whole early exploitation flick the last house on the left as well as his modern slasher scream sit well with me but the rest of his work is very hit and miss and id hesitate to call him the master that others have labelled him as the main theme here is cryogenic freezing although its more a springboard for the plot rather than an important part of the movie the main influence here is obviously the excellent 1974 zombie film deathdream and we focus on miles creighton a businessman cryogenically frozen for ten years before an accident that means he has to be thawed out immediately miles is a part of a project for people that are ill they pay to be frozen in the hope that they will be revived in the future when their illnesses can cured miles is successfully revived and its seen as a miraclebut the person that wakes up is not the person who was frozen as miles returns without a soulbr br this film could actually have been quite decent judging by the idea behind it but instead were given a plot that doesnt really have a lot to it and it has to be said that craven doesnt make the best out of the potential of the film the soul is the main focal point but it would seem that not having a soul and simply having a murderous intentno compassion are the same thing which feels a bit unimaginative the film was made for television so its not particularly nasty and its obvious that not a lot of money was spent on it as the whole production feels very cheap michael beck never became a very popular actor and that isnt surprising judging by his performance here while he is passable he largely lacks charisma and is not formidable in the central role the plot doesnt flow too badly but theres a real lack of suspense andor tension and things slow down too much too often which results in the film being rather boring on occasion it all boils down to a predictable ending also overall i have to admit that i was not impressed at all by this film and as far as cravens filmography goes chiller would have to go down with shocker the scream sequels and the hills have eyes ii as a miss
