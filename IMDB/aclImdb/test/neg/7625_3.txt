weirdthis is a tv movieyet the rating on the box says its rated rtheres nothing in the movie that would remotely qualify for an r ratingaside from thatthoughthe movie is very slow and pointlessi mean the idea was goodbut nothing was done with the storylineit just wasnt developedits mildly creepyand the acting is actually quite goodbetter than the movie deservesi dont see myself watching it again anytime soonif everthere have been other movies dealing with the same concept which are better made than this onei havent seen too many wes craven filmsso i cant really compare it to any of his othersas for this movie itself thoughi think it is poorly conceived and poorly executedfor mei cant give chiller a higher rating than 310
