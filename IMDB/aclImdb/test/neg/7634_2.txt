man is this lousy it doesnt deserve much in the way of comment so keeping it brief rebecca demornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls for latin lover antonio banderas in a wine store he of the ponytail and jailhouse tats when she cuts loose she really cuts loose other than this torrid affair shes having and we must admit the affair has its speed bumps shes a pretty cold fish her broke ailing father shows up for the first time in years and she boots him out shes also adept at keeping her horny upstairs neighbor dennis miller at bay and theres prisoner harry dean stanton whos trying to maneuver her into giving him a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder so he wont have his privates nailed to the wall for the serial murders hes committedbr br all these people and perhaps more are immediately suspect when strange things begin happening to her somebody sends her dead flowers somebody does unspeakable things to her pet cat the next time i see a household pet turn up in a parcel or strung up in the closet or boiled in a pot im going to puke so whos doing it guess no power on earth could force me to reveal the ending but maybe a hint will help childhood abusebr br the abuse excuse is an interesting business in itself far more interesting than the movie what does childhood abuse mean do we mean sexual abuse physical both how about whacking a kid over the back with a wooden cooking spoon hard enough to break it thats what happened to me and my brother when we were kids just as similar things happened to all the other errant boys in the neighborhood sexual abuse that never happened to any of us as far as i know although im not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation in the samoan village i studied for two years there was one case of an adolescent boy found playing sexually with a much younger girl the girls family beat hell out of him the boys own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village an exile that lasted two years by the time he returned the incident was forgotten by everyone including the child by the way the little girl we see here is under five so its unlikely that shed remember dads nighttime visits in any case since longterm memory isnt really established until about that time demornays experience leading to her mental disorder can be called the social construction of trauma its not there unless we put it there enough of the psychiatric lecture that will be fifteen centsbr br you want trauma ill give you trauma the film absolutely forces us to identify with rebecca demornays character right from the beginning then when she has her first tryst with antonio banderas and pio donnagios score is pounding the eroticism into our heads the camera gives us a shot from over her shoulder of the baretorsoed antonio crawling over us with his hairy chest now thats traumatic it makes any male viewer feel as if hes on the floor of the laundry room at the california mens colony in san luis obispo dont get me wrong i dont dislike antonio banderas its just that im not in love with him there arent enough nude shots of rebecca demornays elfin body in the entire universe to compensate for that kind of anxietybr br heres an engaging way of surviving this movie instead of just sitting there puling try picking out the scenes that were filmed in toronto and separating them from the ones shot in budapest its a challenge really and may for all we know preserve your sanity
