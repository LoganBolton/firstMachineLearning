im surprised over the number of folks that have rated this entry as their favorite chan didnt they ever see at the opera or at treasure island the latter ironically written by john larkin who dropped the ball here this plot is a train wreck and overloaded with pointless characters first viewers are required to recall the sordid details of steve mcbirneys played by venerable thug and huac squealer marc lawrence 1929s murder spree lets not forget he escaped a capital murder rap at the courthouse with a lone policeman on his tail theres also a victim that was fished out of a river 11 years earlier that no one ever seems concerned about then theres the suspension of disbelief required when all the characters are seemingly trapped in the wax museum although inspector omatthews manages to wield his fat wet rear end inside through a window why is joan valerie as creams assistant in this movie she cant even handle pliers properly i realize chan suffers the same booboo but yeesh hes 66 years old here and has less than 10 lines and her characters motivation is too weak to ever be adequately splained excuse me when im on a rant i write like ricky ricardo the mary bolton marguerite chapman character is written to as a eager wideeyed moron apparently existing only for the vapid romantic interest of horndog lawyer tom agnew played by the ferretfaced ted osborne why is willie fern a character why couldnt mcbirneys henchman pulled the switch at 820 not a spoiler okay one wonders how with the iq of lint he manages to dress himself or why he hadnt stepped in front of a bus years ago toler himself is given a little more acting rope than usual a plus and the real kudos go to set designer thomas little and cinematographer virgil miller who created some genuinely spooky atmosphere but this entry has less logic than a ritz brothers film im still boggled by how a toothpick can be used as a blow gun
