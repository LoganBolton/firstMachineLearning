this movie was horrible and the only reason it was even made was because the story appealed to the farleft i consider my self a moderate so i was able to see this film as the pile of garbage it was while im not a bush fan your dislike for gw is not enough of a reason to see this moviebr br to start the movie was shot on such lowgrade film that it comes off as cheap rather then artsy additionally the characters are seriously lacking in depth chris coopers character was a poor parody of george bush better suited for saturday night live then a dramatic film the rest of the characters are walking clich√©s and are poor facsimiles of other characters from much better moviesbr br avoid this movie at all costs
