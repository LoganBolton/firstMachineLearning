apparently the film has a harsh antibush message if it does i didnt get it thats all it is its boring and useless periodbr br its too serious at times to be a comedy too slow to be a thriller not funny not gripping not exciting not film its too everything to be the opposite and vise versa i was amazed at how bad a film could suck dont even think of watching itbr br i have watched literally hundreds of films and never have i been so obliged to write a warning on imdb avoid at all costs you have been warnedbr br even the making of is painfully boring its just people talking gibberish with loads of inside jokes infront of a camera sort of like a home movie there even is a part where a guy takes you on a tour of the food that was consumed on the set by the film crew still beats the movie i guess
