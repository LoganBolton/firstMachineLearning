i dont really consider myself a conservative so i wasnt personally offended by this film but it was pretty clear that the plot and the characterization in this film were secondary to the message and the message is that all conservatives are either evil or stupid or both the characters are onedimensional  either good freedomloving americans or brainless greedy evil conservatives theres nothing clever or creative just anticonservative i dont really mind the political bias itself but it shouldnt be the only purpose behind the movie and clearly it isbr br on the positive side the cast is wonderful and chris coopers impression of w is funny the first two or three times but after that its just the same old joke being told over and over againbr br so if you really hate the conservatives youll probably enjoy this film but if youre looking for something with realistic characters and a story thats less blackandwhite then youd be better off watching something else
