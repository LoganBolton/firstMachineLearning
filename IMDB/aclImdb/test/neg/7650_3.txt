john sayles what have you donebr br silver city had moments in which i could see the glimmering hope of a good story welldrawn characters thought provoking dialog and then those moments would quickly be covered over by layers of poor writing clumsy direction and abysmal acting i truly love almost all of john sayles work but silver city is ghastlybr br i got the feeling that sayles may have been working on the beginnings of a good story involving the illegal labor and industrial corruption plot lines but then he got rushed and stuck the secondary plot line satirizing the bush administration onto it the two stories dont really connect with each other and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first 34 of the movie causing me to lose patience with the whole affairbr br the other major flaw is danny hustons acting his dialog in every scene is delivered with a gawping grin regardless of its appropriateness to the mood i hated this guy by the end of the film having been reminded of every bad actor in every high school play ive ever seen not having seen huston in anything else i dont know whether to blame him or to blame sayles direction of him more regardless hes the unfortunate focal point of a very unfortunate moviebr br right down to the last sledgehammersubtle final scene i was disappointed by silver city sayles at his best or heck even sayles at mediocre can be so very much better than this film see any of his other works instead this isnt even worth a rental
