this film isnt a little bad its not even kind of bad its horrid you know youre in trouble when charo shows up in a film she must have had the week off from love boat george kennedy at least hes a gamer  hes in there trying actually hes all right and its good to see martha raye jimmie walkers okay theres slightly better acting than in airport 75 but what film doesnt have better acting than airport 75 one thing i liked about this film is that it had more going on than a lot of other disaster films plotwise at least they made an attempt at subplots what really hurts this film is the special effects  ugh not too special if you ask me this is the kind of film that at 2am is truly truly funny if youve been up having fun with your buddies and youre looking for something to laugh at
