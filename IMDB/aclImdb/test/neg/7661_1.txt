prior to airport 79 these movies were rather good they had decent special effects allstar cast and good acting this movie destroyed the franchise and there are many reasons for it lets talk about the special effects wow they are horrific what was the director thinking about i know its only 1979 but lets look at other very good special effects movies such as star wars1977and moonraker1979 i like the idea of the concord and this could of been the best airport movie but they did too much with it how about joe patronigeorge kennedey shooting a flare out of the cockpit window to prevent a heat seeking missile from hitting the concord also he is doing 90 degree dives and loops this completely far fetched and unrealistic wow believe me the special effects dont help this scene and really are beyond poor they almost look like a cartoon and this is how the whole movie isfinally lets talk about the acting which in my opinion is extremely poor to fair at best over acting is a major issue in this movie especially george kennedy which i really like as an actor but just doesnt cut in this movie the full blame has to go on the director who did a very poor editing job and really whacked out the airport franchise too bad the concord isnt still used today it was a marvel of air travel
