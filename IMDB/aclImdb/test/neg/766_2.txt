tom and jerry are transporting goods via airplane to africa but being white men theyre worried they wont be safe so they put on blackface to fit in once theyre wearing it they adopt black dialect and fully inhabit their new characters they crash into the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft before reaching land they suffer the advances of an overaffectionate octopus and more serious danger from sharks a swordfish and a whale once on land theyre frightened by fantastic creatures and duck into a cave inside its even worse when they encounter living skeletons in blackface and upon exiting the cave things are even worse than that when they are discovered by cannibalsbr br plane dumb is an especially sloppy effort from van beuren studios one example a lion unknown to tom and jerry enters the cave before they do but the animators must have forgotten about it because the lion never appears again another example is the ending thats not an ending its just an arbitrary stopbr br according to a youtube poster the cartoon was originally intended to feature the voices and caricatures of a popular negro comedy team known as miller  lyles but aubrey lyles died of tuberculosis before the recording session was completed and codirectors john foster  george rufle were forced to rework the animation into a tom  jerry storybr br they shouldnt have bothered the crude animation and poorlyexecuted gags make the film a loser from beginning to end
