i gave airport 79 only two stars because its a truly lousy film nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise except for charos chihuahua who does a pretty good job in his role this is not to say that the film isnt worth watching it helps if you have a buzz on but this is not essentialbr br a79 really does seem like an early version of airplane every scene has a setup and a payoff and the scenes blunder after one another as if they were totally disconnected one of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers crew and airplane get to keep going no matter what youre a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence the hitman then chases you onto your greenhouse roof no problem you can still catch that earlymorning flight to parisno need to get the cops involved your plane dodges one unmanned drone missile four heatseeking missiles and cannon fire from an unidentified phantom fighter doing barrel rolls an unpowered dive and a crashnet landing without thrust reversers in the process no problem well have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours its truly funnybr br and ill admit that theres a bit of the anarchist in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin attendants the highlight is when the attendant tells jimmie walker hell have to put away his saxophone god spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz prior to takeoff jimmie basically says nope later in the flight the sax is damaged during a barrelroll and jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he wont put away this aspect of the film is just fun one passenger actually obeys the attendant when charo is told she cant take her dog on the flight she leaves the plane naturally this is because you cant get a good view of her ass and boobs while shes seated br br in summary a terrible movie but terrible enough to be a bit amusing unfortunately the filmmakers and cast deserve no credit whatsoever for this as it was probably entirely unintentional
