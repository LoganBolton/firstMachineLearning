some slack might be cut this movie due to the fact that it was made in 1979 that much said it really is pretty direbr br never mind the laughable backprojection or the awful awful cameratracking of supposed inflight objects its the stunts that the concorde pulls off that will have you blinking in disbelief at the absurdity barrelrolls looptheloops and violent evasive maneuvers left me wondering why the airforces of the world didnt just fly concordes as their main fightersbr br so here are the important lessons i learned from this celluloid cheesefest br br 1 the concorde is at least as agile as a phantom 4 jetfighterbr br 2 you can fire a flare gun at mach 2 simply by opening the cockpit window and sticking your arm outbr br 3 if the flare gun fails to discharge do not drop it as it may then go offbr br 4 the concorde can dodge up to two sidewinder missiles fired at it at oncebr br 5 a flare will distract a heatseeking missile every timebr br 6 switching off your jetengines is a surefire way of throwing heatseeking missiles off track if 5 above failsbr br 7 when performing a crashlanding in the concorde it is apparently impossible to jettison your fuel beforehandbr br 8 concorde pilots are all combattrained veteransbr br as you might imagine this film is not very realistic the effects are primitive by todays standards and that coupled with the nonsense acrobatics the concorde performs makes this a movie deserving of little but scornbr br not recommended not recommended at all
