oh you pilots are such men they dont call it the cockpit for nothing honey dialogue like that is just one of many reasons why the concorde airport 79 or if you saw it in the uk where it dragged its heels getting released there airport 80 the concorde was the last and by far the least of the series the disaster movie was in dire straits in the late70s what with the swarm having offered much unintentional hilarity and beyond the poseidon adventure when time ran out and city on fire simply offering much boredom and the desperation to find a new spin on the genre is all too apparent here this time its a conspiracy plot with susan blakelys news anchorwoman discovering billionaire boyfriend robert wagner has been selling arms to terrorists and the north vietnamese naturally she decides to tell him everything rather than make the story public but he fobs her off by explaining im a very rich man i have everything in life i could ever want why would i jeopardise that by doing something so incredibly stupid just in case she doesnt buy that line rather than say hire a hitman to kill her on the ground he decides to do things the smart way by planning to destroy the concorde while shes flying to moscow via paris ive done a lot of things ive been ashamed of but i am not a murderer he insists indignantly on his way to reprogramme a guided missile to destroy the plane so nothing incredibly stupid there and when that fails he sends a jet fighter after it and when that fails br br dont even think of looking for anything resembling logic here this is real bottomofthebarrel stuff that even the studio gave up on and marketed as a comedy in the us after critics laughed it off the screen where the previous three entries all had the look of glossy bigbudget entertainments this smallscreen friendly effort the only one not to be shot in 2351 widescreen doesnt even manage to make the concorde look good which is quite a feat tv veteran david lowell rich presumably got the directing gig because he was fast cheap and had previously directed tv movie sst disaster in the sky where peter graves supersonic airplane found itself unable to land due to sabotage and senegalese flu which was not intentionally at least a comedy despite the presence of a young billy crystal in the cast and seemed like the natural choice for what looks like a 14m tv movie that somehow escaped into theatres when noone was lookingbr br cast like a bad episode of hollywood squares stars are in very short supply this time round and most of the few vaguely familiar faces seem to have been rounded up from rehab clinics and busted sitcoms alain delon gives the hollywood career that one last shot as the pilot happy fish dont ask george kennedy moves from the executive suite to the copilots seat in the hope of reminding people of the other movies while the rest of the ensemble includes a couple of veterans of the towering inferno wagner and blakely a softporn star sylvia kristel trying to go respectable an ingmar bergman regular bibi andersson  and shes the one playing the hooker david warners navigator on a diet having nightmares about being chased by bananas the voice of the devil mercedes mccambridge charo and her seeing eye chihuahua dohn misconscrew me martha raye and her weak bladder jimmie walker playing the sax in his seat and smoking weed in the john in the few moments its not occupied by martha raye cicely tyson kissing her credibility goodbye as the obligatory mother with critically ill child and a frozen heart in the overhead locker airline owner eddie albert and trophy wife sybil danning occupying the best seat in the house ed begley jr in goggles and the russian olympic team and their lovable coach val avery and his deaf daughter ahhhh on a goodwill tour of the states who knew about the boycott just to add a touch of the simpsons to proceedings harry shearer voices one news report in the same tones hed later use for smithersbr br highlight despite the impromptu wedding ceremony during a crash landing it just has to be george kennedy diverting a heatseeking missile by opening the window sticking his arm out at nearly twice the speed of sound and firing a flare  while the plane is upside down and then alain delon turns off the engines so there wont be a heat source for the missiles to home in on yes someone actually got paid for writing this and that someone was future oscar winner and screenwriter of munich and the insider eric roth hey everybody has to start somewhere although in his defence it was producer jennings lang who came up with the plot still what do you expect from a film that credits stunt balloonists and ends with a shot of the concorde flying off into the sunset amazingly in one of those wont admit defeat moments studios used to be prone to universal shot another 20 minutes or so of footage a couple of years later to include in the network tv showings not included on the dvd sadly its boxoffice failure led to the fifth entry in the series the laughriot that would have been airport 1984 ufo never getting off the ground even more genuinely tragically it was the concorde used in this film that crashed in france 21 years laterbr br oh and if youre wondering what charo says to her chihuahua in unsubtitled spanish when its not allowed on board its what do you think dont worry when the revolution comes i promise you will fly on anything you want i promise what a shame my love what do they think they are
