the real star of the last of the airport films is that big supersonic carrier the french created called the concorde if you bear in mind that the whole film is dedicated to showing what that needle nosed plane could do in the sky than the whole film kind of makes sensebr br but if youre expecting some serious drama here than by all means take some of the evasive action the concorde shows here when some nasty folks try to shoot her downbr br susan blakely plays a television news reporter who also happens to be the mistress of military industrial tycoon robert wagner one of wagners aides just happens to bring her information on some of wagners dirty business dealings selling arms to folks not friendly to the usa when the source macon mccalman is killed in front of her and shes nearly done in by a hitman whom she escapes from of course she confronts wagner with the information and of course he denies it but right before blakely boards the concorde mccalmans widow kathleen maguire hands her the necessary documents br br but on the way to moscow with a stop in paris wagner and his minions try to put the big bird down but the fearless crew of alain delon david warner and george kennedy is up to all their tricks its quite a bag full as youll see if you want to watch the filmbr br if youre an aviation enthusiast you absolutely wont care about the plot its like the film le mans with steve mcqueen which has a legion of auto racing fans who have made it a cult item maybe le mans is better at that because they just didnt bother with any kind of storybr br among the passengers is a pot smoking saxophonist played by jimmie walker a distraught mother accompanying a new heart for her child played by cicely tyson and martha raye a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from washington to paris in the loo shes actually the best one herebr br robert wagner must have been psychic though because im sure on the strength of this film he got the part of doctor evils number two in the austin powers seriesbr br im sure all concerned got a big pay day out of this film but it seems to have killed the airport saga of movies
