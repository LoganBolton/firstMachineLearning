this movie is scary at times perhaps no more so than when a naked george kennedy tells his hooker girlfriend he wants a little more sugar thankfully his nakedness is covered by a blanket but the image is still more horrifying than anything youre likely to find in for example schindlers listbr br the dialog in this film was inspiring it inspired me to watch another movie in one scene when a stewardess remarks about male pilots kennedy asks why do you think its called a cock pit charmingbr br and yes contrary to what some have written this film is very very bad
