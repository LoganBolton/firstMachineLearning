there are bad movies movies that are horrible and then theres a tiny rarified body of movies that are so horribly bad that even after seeing them just once the sheer awfulness makes it impossible to forget them even decades later this is exactly such a movie and its hard to believe that the original film in this series was actually quite good lets see george kennedy the cigar chomping tough guy mechanic of the original has somehow been promoted to airline captain and after the concorde comes under missile attack dont ask he resorts to stunts like shooting a flare gun out the cockpit window despite presumably flying at mach 2 all the while doing the sort of wild highg evasive maneuvers that would have ripped the wings off any real airliner never mind the effect of the passengers but the absolute worst part of the film at least to dedicated airplane buffs like myself is that this atrocity starred one of the coolest sexiest and most technologically remarkable planes ever to fly the concorde or just plain concorde as its pilots refer to it deserved far better this abomination is the equivalent of taking a high class beauty like audrey hepburn and putting her in a porkys sequel thankfully the release of the ever hilarious airplane the following year brought the whole airport franchise to a well deserved halt as anyone even contemplating a fifth installment would have been laughed to death by studios and movie fans alike br br 110
