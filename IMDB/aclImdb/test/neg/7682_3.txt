sorry folks i love ray bolgers work but the one thing he aint is a leading man maybe if you pretend hes the last man on earth this romantic plot might work but comeon now br br heres a movie that exists simply to showcase the title song which was a big hit for the basie band the year before 1951 and some pretty nifty singing and dancing save it from being a total disaster br br however the story line is pathetic even by 1952 musical comedy standards and the other songs are equally as forgettable as evening in paris cologne the dialogue embarrasses the stars day  bolger only claude dauphins boyeresque charms keep his character three dimensionalbr br so how to enjoy this movie on video  br br a fast forward through all the dialoguebr br b surrender yourself to doris days vocals and ray bolgers looselimbed footwork and dont miss dauphins hilarious take on a rainsoaked windswept reprise of april in parisbr br c finally keep a couple of bottles of cabernet chilled and handybr br bob raymond
