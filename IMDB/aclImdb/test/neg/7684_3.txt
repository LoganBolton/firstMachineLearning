well i will come clean and admit that i was forced as part of my history degree to watch this film and then write a short film review as part of my gradebr br yet even if i had watched the film alone at my own discretion i found it extremely boring and absurd the style is dated beyond its years and the acting is farcical rather than use dialogue they instead exchange eye popping glances at each other or sometimes into thin air for me such over the top acting does not convey any greater emotion and after seeing an extreme close up ivans face for the hundredth time i was praying for the film to endbr br the most disappointing though is how wrong ivans character is this man was nasty his bodyguards murderous thugs and his character cowardly for me the film was nothing but a piece of stalin propaganda inaccurate and dull
