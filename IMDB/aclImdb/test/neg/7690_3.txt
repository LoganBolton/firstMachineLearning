the amount of hype and the huge success this film has encountered is evidence how desperate our people are towards a good independent saudi film in fact the huge success of tash ma tash is also an evidencebr br im not going to start of how important film making is as it is obvious to those with half a brain how films have changed the worldbr br and im not going to say how much our society needs a bunch of films to clear out a lot of issues we have in our country religion politics womens rights education general health terrorism law and many many morebr br along came news about the fist saudi movie which shouldve been a remedy to some of the issues we have especially towards the youth instead we experienced a bald movie for that matterbr br the ignorance and naivety of the script was obvious it was as if a 13 year old had written itbr br now ive heard that the budget for this film was huge i would like to know where the money went huh the effects were really ugly the editing was poor the script was kharabeet you really dont know what the story is and what the director aims at from this filmbr br a note on the actor who played the religious brother his performance was good but with bad direction another thing with the role of the religious friends he had that is not how religious guys act here in saudi arabia they are not evil as this film intends in fact they are some of the nicest people youll ever meet with some really uncommon way of living and that is what shouldve appeared in the filmbr br the youth are following the religious here because of a reason and that is the youngsters are the most passionate and sentimental and with the well formed principles the religious live on the youngsters follow them again this is what shouldve appearedbr br we need another first film with a saudi writer actor director composer even cameraman so that they all work with passion towards their experiment not just for the moneybr br and we should do what shakespeare did hundreds of years ago we should include phrases from the quran in the script of the movie as the people in our society still see art as a form of sin the challenge a saudi movie maker is facing is changing the mentality in that angle
