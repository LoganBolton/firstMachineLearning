total disgrace truly awful the screenplay and dialogue is a joke and combined with a director who doesnt have a clue about life in saudi arabia its not a surprise quite saudi film ha the director is palestiniancanadian the writer is lebanese the lead actress is jordanian and the shooting took place in dubai and all those elements show very well to make the film far from representing the saudi society yes it contains some saudi clich√©s the stuff we see in cartoons in the newspapers everyday but thats about everything the film had the opportunity to show real problem with saudi society or at least give us something new and genuine about the youth troubles and concerns in saudi arabia instead it copied and pasted from here and there and the result was a mess even the supposedly love story in the movie doesnt exist or at least we havent seen it the only bright side in this total debacle is some good acting from the supporting cast the veteran khaled sami was funny in a badly written role as the grand father which he is clearly got miscasted for he looks younger than the actor who plays his son also the actor who plays the fanatic brothers role turki alyusuf has done well in fact he was the best actor in the film the rest of the cast being professionals for long did an ok job but the lead actor hisham abdulrahman was just bad he had one look of a little adorable bobby for all situations he couldnt even say his lines in a proper manner he has charisma that made him win the title of star academy a very famous reality show and he is good in interviews and tv shows but he was just the weakest link of this film the lead actress i didnt mind very much but even she acted badly in some scenes and overplayed her sensuality in unneeded waybr br the film was a huge hit saudi flocked in thousands to neighboring bahrain and dubai to attend it when it was screened there and it made a tone of money then it was screened in pay per view then in broadcasting tv and that was in a span of a few weeks this was to cash on saudis eagerness to homegrown entertainment but alas the film was neither homegrown nor entertaining
