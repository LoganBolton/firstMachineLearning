i saw this short film on the dvd for ridley scotts film the duellists there was no introduction by scott before the film it just started right upbr br  boy and a bicycle is hardly an example of ridley scotts other work it bears no resemblance the film shows a boy played by tony scott riding around on a bicycle guess what thats pretty all that happens the boy rides around rambling on and on with pointless confusing dialogue the film was shot in black and white and since it was directed by ridley scott i expected some cool cinematography or visuallystriking sets instead i was treated with nothing this film isnt even good for a first effort however i recommend that any fan of ridley scott should check it out at least once
