the trouble with this film like so many other films that fail is the scriptbr br the script is so unfocused it flounders around all over the place what is the story here ok its a biopic but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire life can be condensed into 100 or so minutes some selection and editing is required but this script just didnt select or edit enough it didnt render hoffmans life down to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and through them get the bigger picture of the whole manbr br the movie wanders from being a straight plodding troubled genius biopic to semidocumocumentary using new shots faked up to match archive footage to sub true life sob stories movie of the week the whole im bringing up a son who doesnt know im his dad shtick to political conspiracy theory movie etc etc it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be and the halfhearted citizen kane like narrative structure reporter interviewing people from hoffmans past is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts outbr br the movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave room to expand something more important the whole scene in the psychiatrists office after vincent donofrio pounds the window screaming im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im acting im acting im acting could have easily been cut all that happens is the psychiatrist says you have bipolar disorder heres some lithium and the two women in his life say we could see you weekends more often and bang thats it no more mental health problems it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene it could easily and should have been dumped before it was shot the scene where they all get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god pointless tells us nothing about anything yet when it comes to a pivotally important moment like the drugs bust the film making is so hurried the situation just comes out of leftfield and doesnt make any sense to the audience suddenly hes dealing in heroin where did this come from why what is going on here br br i being a middleaged leftie would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but even i got fed up with the portrayal of the man the pigs the fuzz etc as brutal besuited unthinking hippiehating androids it may have been like that in 60s america i dont know i wasnt there but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemicbr br having said all that vincent donofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could watch janeane garofalo in anything even reading a bus timetable though she just wasnt right for this part
