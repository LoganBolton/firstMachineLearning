this fake documentary is flawed on a lot of points its badly made has uninteresting characters but the biggest problem i have with it is the basic premisebr br this film uses the idea that hp lovecraft has traveled to italy and that some of his work is based on real supernatural events that he witnessed im willing to go along with the notion that he traveled to italy only for suspension of disbelieve but that some of his work is based on reality and that insmouth exist is total nonsensebr br first of all lovecraft didnt believe in the supernatural in his letters he clearly states that he considered himself a mechanical materialist his monsters where there to show that humans werent so special after all another myth used in this film is that lovecraft was an expert on the occult he wasnt all his knowledge on the subject came from the most basic sourcesbr br so we end up with a film about people jelling at each other a lot and when we finally see the monster its so bad that you cant even laugh at it you just feel a pain in your love for horrorbr br after seeing the film frankenstein lovecraft said that he felt sorry for mary shelley because he felt that her work was butchered i feel sorry for lovecraft
