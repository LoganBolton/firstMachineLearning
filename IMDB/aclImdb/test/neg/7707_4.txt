a college professor is working on creating zombies and wouldnt you know it things go horribly wrong next thing you know the whole campus is overrun thank goodness theres a pair of ubercommandos trained for just such a situation too bad they must be accompanied by a group of moroncommandos lead by a rapper he doesnt even bother trying to play a military guy he just responds to his superiors as if he were rappin wit da homies in da hood the high point of this part of the movie is the locker room scene the male and female moroncommandos share the same locker room and apparently military regulations require all females to wear black bras and panties hey if you cant make a good movie at least you can have women in their underwear my hats off to the film makersbr br so after much discussion of how well prepared these moroncommandos are for the job bosnia afghanistan iraq they all get killed off in fairly short order their biggest downfall seems to be that it never occurs to them to turn any lights on a typical encounter has them walking into a room and seeing someone at the far end human or zombie cant tell flip on the lights no moroncommando protocol requires them to walk up to the person making sure to hold their gun in such a way that it can be easily knocked out of their hand and well you know the drill the demise of sergeant major sticky fingaz is especially fun  my favorite scene involving a rapper in any movie ive ever seen luckily and again hats off to the filmmakers the hottest babe among the moroncommandos manages to survive her and the female ubercommando both wind up in tight tshirts for the remainder of the movie now this is how a military operation should be performed theres a bunch of running around punctuated my humorous stuff like the ubercommandos being unable to get through a simple ventilator grating it obviously is a thin piece of aluminum that you could easily put your fist through this necessitates a plan to rub zombie guts all over themselves and even though weve seen nothing in the movie to indicate that zombies locate their prey by smell theyre good enough to immediately begin sniffing the zombie guts and let our heroes gobr br a few other funny bits  the paris hilton gag the can you hear me now gag and the fact that although the zombies immediately bite secondary characters main characters are able to fight their way through dozens of them without being nibbled on another chuckle is provided by mr fingaz who cant seem to pronounce the word tourniquet toenokitbr br overall its somewhat amusing could have used some more interesting characters but for a scifi channel original i was mildly impressed
