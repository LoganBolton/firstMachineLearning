isnt it strange how crapmovies always tend to be a little better when you start watching them with an attitude like boy this is going to suck harder than few things have ever sucked before its pretty much impossible for anyone to rent this movie with high  or even remotely positive  expectations as house of the dead 2 is a sequel to something that is generally considered to be one of the absolute worst genre disasters ever to be released the abysmal reputation of the original actually turned out to be a great advantage for director michael hurst as it was really easy to surpass the quality level of its predecessor and exactly how embarrassing must this be for uwe boll huh having to acknowledge that a straighttovideo sequel without star power or promotional campaigns is much better than his own pretentious video game interpretation in case anyone still doubts no house of the dead 2 dead aim isnt a good horror movie at all but yes its definitely better than the first and even worth renting in case youre looking for an undemanding splatter film with loads of gory butchering sleaze and stupid humor theres no real connection with the events in the first film another advantage and this part two opens like a typically rancid sex comedy set in a college campus the male fraternity club plans to attack a sorority house inhabited exclusively by blond coeds with enormous breasts but the party gets interrupted when an insane professor sid haig who runs his car over a girl and takes her back to his lab to turn her into a zombie this is the beginning of a quickly spreading and deadly epidemic but no worries as the government is prepared and sends their best scientists  soldiers to the campus to search for survivors and to bring back blood samples for an antidote hunting down zombies seems like the most common thing in the world for this squadron they even named them hyper sapiens but their constantly increasing amount eventually endangers the lives of the most hardened soldiers director hurst thankfully found his inspiration in the more eminent classics of the genre like james camerons aliens and  of course  george a romeros deadtrilogy particularly day of the dead he luckily also didnt made the same mistakes as uwe boll who inserted footage of the actual video game in his movie why and slightly exaggerated with the use of cgitechniques hotd 2 contains heavy images of violence like chopped up female corpses and detailed amputations but it never really becomes nauseating or shocking naturally theres isnt the slightest bit of suspense to enjoy and every dreadful horror cliché features here as well the film is very enjoyable as long as story writer mark altman doesnt try to explain the origins of the zombie epidemics theyre walking corpses with their brains hanging out of their skulls so we really dont need to know what caused their deaths especially not when the explanations are given by a blond sorority slut who clearly hasnt got a clue what all the medical terms mean just avoid getting bitten sweetheart
