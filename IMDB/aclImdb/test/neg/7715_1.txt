i used to work in a video store i saw this title in the horror section and took it home as a free rental one nightbr br this movie was truly awful there is no redeeming quality about it because it actually takes a well respected sub genre of film and just goes about destroying it if the first film wasnt low budget enough then this film truly takes the biscuit being housed mostly indoors and at nighttherefore avoiding the scenic cost setting of the first film in the first 5 minutes of this film a college lecturer comically runs over an attractive student rather than be mortified the lecturer half heartedly apologises and the girl mentions that despite being thrown across the cars bonnet he sped up as he approached her that there is nothing to worry aboutafter which he attacks her with a crowbar and kills her if this isnt strange enough he wants to perform an experiment upon her bringing her back from the deadand so feels the need to remove her clothing to do sobr br soft core female nudity and pubic hair is rampant throughout the film and is to be honestthe only real thing to hold the average male viewers interestlike the swimming scene in the first filmbut even having said that this film goes from bad to worse with its bad character acting crappy dialogue and absurd plot turnswhy introduce a pivotal character who has survived 29 days from zombie attack only to kill them within 10 minutesits just a very very bad film
