terrible boring zombie sequel is only marginally better than uwes horrible first film it consists of a group of soldiers going into a zombie plagued college campus to find a certain type of blood which could assist in finding a cure for the infection these soldiers are your typical lambs to the slaughter and none of them are that drawn outor at least arent very interestingso you dont feel a sadness at the pit of your stomach when they are disposed of the film has the typical zombies biting humans and blood splatter it even has the same munching on guts it just doesnt do anything for the zombie genre to give it memory and the storys climax is rather anticlimactic and ridiculous one wonders how two people can submerged in an army of zombies and not get bitfor they are the main stars who seem to always manage escapabilitywhile others seem to get bit rather easily the film sole motivation is to show people getting bitnothing else just go watch a romero film for lasting effect
