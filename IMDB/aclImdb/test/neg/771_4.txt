someone else called this film a fablehorror movie and i think that fits pretty well thats the concept at least a group of teenagers each with their own vice catch the eye of a twisted sideshow barker he decides to teach the teens a lesson by making them part of the freak show a cool idea but could have been executed better the fate for some of the teens is shoved in your face too obviously while other characters could have been fleshed out more also the ending was a serious let down no resolution or big twist or anything br br but as a low budget horror movie its pretty fun to watch if youre into cheesy spookfests you should have a laugh watching this one i think one of its faults though that it takes itself too seriously its a silly movie and if it was a little more selfaware when it comes to that i think it would have been better but at least theres enough neat carnival themes and bmovie monster makeup to keep you watching
