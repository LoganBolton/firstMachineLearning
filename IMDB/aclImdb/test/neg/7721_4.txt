house of the dead 2 dead aim 2005 is the sequel though you really dont need to see the first house of the dead to get this film that said the production value is definitely here with great zombie effects and its edited quite nicely with very effective sound design however that said thats about all thats good herebr br the story and script are awful    theres blatant plot holes everywhere its also funny how the soldiers dont mind if they get blood on their faces unlike in 28 days later where blood in any part of the body will infect you also realistic how theres little order with the soldiers here unlike the usual us military disciplinebr br a 4 out of 10
