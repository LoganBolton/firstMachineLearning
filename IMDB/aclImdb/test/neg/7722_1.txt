this is one of the most awful movies ive had the misfortune of picking up dont get me wrong i love a good zombie flick but this wasnt one of thembr br might as well from the opening scenes at least been called titty zombies from outer space it had absolutely nothing to do with the other movie or the video game as far as i could tell br br the best aspect of the film is how the two main characters can get covered with so much blood and remain so nonplussed i would certainly suggest giving this one and miss and staying with a safer zombie pleaser like 28 days later or dawn of the living dead the remake of course unless youre into some serious campy action
