im sorry but they did leave the impression that these commandos fought zombies before but they sure didnt act like they even seen a zombie before jumping and turning their backs on them like amateurs second the characters are pretty badly written the actors did the best they could with what was given i blame bad writing and bad directing lastly and here is where the spoiler warnings are highest they loose the sample twice and the girl jennifer holland doesnt know if shes been bit or not how stupid is that as much as it hurts to be bitten one would think you would know plus gallons of blood leaking from your body is a good clue dumb the first movie had its flaws but it has rewatchablity unlike this disaster of a movie which i could barely get through once i give the house of the dead 2 no guts all stupidity the crapolantern
