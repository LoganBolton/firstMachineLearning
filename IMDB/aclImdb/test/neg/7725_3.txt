i saw the first house of the dead and expected a root canal to be more pleasant to attend so when it wasnt as bad as that i was delightfully surprisedbr br unfortunately i then got my hopes up that the second one might be okay as welland i was wrongbr br apparently im one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was badbr br i dont know whether to watch it again and force myself to see whatever all the people who gave it good reviews saw or wonder if i saw the wrong moviebr br ed quinn as ellis and emmanuelle vaugier as alexandra nightingale morgan did a great job in roles that were way beneath them they deserve to be in better moviesbr br the special effects were okay and some of the characters likablehateable and that made for a tolerable watch but for the most part this movie was just a waste of timebr br oh and i have to ask this because i found myself asking it aloud all the way through the moviedid anyone not know how to close doors behind themselves so zombies wouldnt just wander into the rooms only once did it happen zombies wandering in and i found that a little convenientsoldiers walk into a room leave the door wide open pay little to no attention to same said door so the zombies can just walk in if they feel like it with the hapless livings being cornered with no way to escape and yet only once did zombies follow them inbr br nitpicky maybe but honestlyif i was fighting for my life the last thing id do would be to walk into a room and leave the door wide open so zombies could swarm in and eat mebr br that is really the only thing bothered me throughout the movie and just the movie for the most part was a bad sequel to a not totally abominable original
