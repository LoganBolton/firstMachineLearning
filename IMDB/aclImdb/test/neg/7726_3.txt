i was on a mission to watch uwe boll movies to see if they were really as bad as all that the first one i saw bloodrayne was not a complete loss i liked it more than most people and actually rated it a 4 out of 10 next up was the first house of the dead movie now that was horrifically bad i could stand watching ten minutes of it and fastforwarding a bit and that was it i could see where it was going and i didnt need to see any more of it in order to rate it a just 1 out of 10br br but i had access to the sequel too which however is not by uwe boll but mysteriously written by the same guys who so incompetently wrote the first one and since it got a higher rating at imdb than the original i thought id give it a chance and i actually managed to watch all of it it started out with some funny references and cool lines like how the president got his orders from the vicepresident and actingwise it is lightyears better than the first here we have cool muchachas like the ultrahot emmanuelle vaugier whose coolness is in league with carrieanne moss claudia black and evangeline lilly man i hope some matrixstyle movie comes along for her sometime and the always delectable superaerobicized victoria pratt i love athletic women and there was also nadine velazquez catalina on my name is earl who performed quite wellbr br the story wasnt much and the action wasnt great either and the ending was a disappointment as they didnt succeed in their mission oh well at least the two mains survived guess thats some small victory toobr br good cast but a pretty bad movie the actors make it watchable but theres no real substance therebr br 3 out of 10
