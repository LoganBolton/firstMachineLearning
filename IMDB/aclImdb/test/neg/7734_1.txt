it is impossible to avoid comparing zhang yimous hero to ang lees crouching tiger hidden dragon they were both bigbudget chinese kungfu films with breathtaking cinematography of chinese landscape and a cast of superstars but aside from the obvious there is in fact nothing else to compare hero fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters proving that bigname stars beautiful scenery and action effects are no replacement for a directors artistry and visionbr br all the marketing hype preceding the premier of hero has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one much anticipated hero drew moviegoers in throngs when it first opened at theaters in mainland china and hong kong making it an instant boxoffice success however though the script pleased government censors chinese audiences went to newfound heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain online critics both professional and amateur proclaimed the film ideologically disturbing from the viewpoint of deep servitude written either by an amateur historian or someone with ulterior motives one article was simply titled hero you make me sickbr br the deepest failing of the film is in its plot which is not only morally reprehensible and based on unforgivable historic fallacy but  worst of all for a film  is boring all blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history but hero goes beyond artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to glorify an emperor that was as brutal as stalin or hitler hero does not make up for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or fun instead it is makes a woefully poor attempt at being deep and merely manages to be pretentious and preachybr br though historians agree that the first emperor of china was ruthlessly violent mao zedong was known to have admired this ruler  no surprise given maos own tyrannical rule likewise the communist government in beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the first emperor and its own ironfist methods so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by zhang yimou tony leung one of the stars of hero remarked during an interview to promote the film that the beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing the student demonstrations because it was needed to maintain stability in china for these remarks tony leung received shocked criticisms in his home city of hong kong but he merely stated out loud the underlying message of the moviebr br director zhang yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass the values of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kungfu novels and movies to reveal a higher wisdom unfortunately his version of wisdom turns out to be the oppressor is right in china where thousands of years of historical reality have rammed this message through art was the last sanctuary where the individual could actually find freedom from such tyranny the great popularity of the kungfu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternate world one where kungfu warriors roamed the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice free from fear and winning against all odds with their superhuman skills only in the novel did the individual ever win over institutionalized power in china and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions going against this tradition of the kungfu hero zhang yimou has not gone upwards towards a higher truth as he had hoped but downwards to the level of government propaganda its no wonder the government was so pleasedbr br some film lovers may secretly wonder all moralistic judgments aside is it at least entertaining fortunately the answer is a resounding no because the same tale is told over and over with only slight variations it becomes tedious to watch moreover the three conflicting versions of the same story serves only to confuse the character development since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them once the real version emergesbr br the film is not without its beautiful images however all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect to or enhance the storyline the use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the tale comes across as simplistic and contrived and the cinematography appears selfconsciously rather than truly beautiful great for a trailer but a disappointment once you are there to watch the entire filmbr br for those in china who showed disdain for crouching tigers unrealistic kungfu much was expected from hero jet li who plays the title role is a real kungfu artist who held national titles before beginning his career as an actor his previous movies have revealed limited acting abilities but many hoped that zhang yimou could use lis lithe body movements to full effect while casting him properly in a role that would not task his acting abilities but it was not to be hero attempts to go beyond the kungfu genre so there are not many fighting scenes and jet li is expected to perform a difficult piece of acting an inner transformation leading to profound wisdom and selfsacrifice as the casting director ought to have expected li fails miserably meanwhile the only fighting scene that reveals any true kungfu skill is the first one of the film between li and and donnie yen all the scenes that follow are a disappointment so hero fails to satisfy even on that levelbr br though most audiences outside china are unlikely to be aware of the historical mangling of the story of the cruel first emperor it seems even more unlikely that they would accept zhangs version of chinese wisdom which is anything but perhaps the only time an audience coming out of a screening of hero was seen smiling  instead of yawning or frowning  was at the special screening for chinese government officialsbr br
