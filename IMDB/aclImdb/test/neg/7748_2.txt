this movie had a very convoluted plot and very contrived setting that i frankly could not follow which is surprising considering the acting and dialogue could have only been the product of a kindergarteners writing if you like kathy ireland then maybe youd want to see this the movie was probably made as a vehicle to try to get her into hollywood but if that was its goal i would have to say that i hope she didnt invest too much money in its production
