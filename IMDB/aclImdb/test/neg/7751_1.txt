this movie is a bizarre fantasy tale that im sure doesnt appeal to anyone over 10 but is too strange for children the plot is stupid and the acting is some of the worst ive ever seenbr br 25year old kathy ireland plays a teenage girl who acts like a 9year old she seems to have gotten her characters voice by listening to alvin and the chipmunks her high pitched screechy baby voice gets annoying the second she starts talking all of the other acting is bad but really kathy ireland is by far the worst the plot is also terrible and is kind of a mix between alice in wonderland and mad max wanda saknussemm ireland gets a letter saying her father who left her a long time ago fell down a bottomless pit in africa and when she goes to find him she falls into an underground world full of strange australian accented people its one of the corniest movie youll ever see with terrible lines throughout br br its annoying the effects this movie uses for character development kathy ireland is a nerd who wont do anything or go anywhere she flies to africawow what development she drops her glasses and then doesnt need them why does dropping ones glasses represent them not becoming a nerd it should represent her descent into blindness its just stupid the only positive i can think is there are semigood special effects and camera work and the musical score sounds okbr br overall this a ridiculous family fantasy that will only appeal to those who expect nothing from a moviebr br my rating 12 out of  84 mins pg for violence
