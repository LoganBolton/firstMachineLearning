my only regret is that one cannot grade a movie on imdb with a 0 a cena would definitely deserve that at leastbr br spoiler the movie starts with a bunch of people entering a crypt to awaken an ancient vampire when a guy cuts himself and his blood drips and falls onto the putrid and dried corpse that is supposed to be a bloodsucker the metamorphosis takes place and the vampire in an animationlike effect would you believe it quickly takes on a more human formonly to reveal that hes wearing a tux and a bowtie a bowtie yes red if my memory serves me right i tried to check out random scenes by skipping through a bit but it did not get any better than the opening sequences thats the point when i turned the movie off cursing it for having made me hope to see a vampire movie this is surely not oneunless youre 5 and could take such stupidity seriouslybr br so if you like vampires and dont want to feel revolted or even disgustedlearn from my mistake and dont even try to see this garbage
