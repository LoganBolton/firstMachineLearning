yes i couldnt stop yawning nor could my partner incredibly boring  90 minutes seemed to stretch to at least 3 hours  and im not even a fan of action films but this just falls asleep on its feet  unless you are a 70s polo neck sweater fan br br  some spoilers follow  if you were expecting anything to happen dont hold your breath  it doesnt br br but seriously it totally fails to convince or involve the watcher its like a long boring and rather disjointed dream frederic floats through it able to leave work whenever he wants and with attractive secretaries bringing tea and messages constantly obviously not real life and an office with virtually no paper or files  just a giant calendar to let you know that the film really is taking 6 months to watch br br frederick never seems to be touched by any real emotion neither does his wife and the children behave like rag dolls  in stark contrast to any real life even chloe despite her strong views never gives the appearance of really feeling anything the only 3 seconds of any real feeling occur between a couple overseen in a cafe and have nothing to do with the plotbr br okay so maybe there are some moral considerations but if its entertainment or even good cinematography you are looking for i think this film is incredibly overrated by most other viewers
