sex and the city has some great things going for it the problem is that its saddled with a number of negatives that really hurt the ultimate rating and review for its six seasonsbr br the good things about satc is that a lot of the conversations ring true to life the romance stories are interesting and the characters are funbr br the bad things is that few women act like complete whores these four women have so many partners even going lesbian in some episodes that you have no choice but to roll your eyes at the utter absurdity men on the show are for the most part depicted as shallow degenerates liars cheats and buffoons the foul language these women use is far in excess as to what a normal conversation entails why do the writers do these things clearly to be overthetop and to get your attentionbr br another thing that bothered me without spoiling is how some of the relationships ended they simply didnt ring real to me or to others i discussed this withbr br but even though i gave the show 2 stars in the end im glad i watched the show ive actually watched every season multiple times i do recommend the show to anyone that wont be offended by strong profanity and softcore pornography i could have done less with the offensive language and the nudity and sex acts but the romance was very good and the saga ends pretty well
