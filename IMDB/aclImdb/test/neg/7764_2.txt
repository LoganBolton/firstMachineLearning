i know that this show gave a lot of liberation to women in the late 90s and early 2000s but come on you have a whiner a buzz kill and an overanalyzer this show really made women look bad i cannot stand carries analyzing every little thing on this show and thats what really killed it for me also charlottes whining about her nonexistent predicaments made my ears hurt and mirandas cynicism was a complete buzz kill i mean cant she just be happy samantha was the only cool one on the show and the only one worth watching there was also a good episode when nathan lane was on the show but that was the only one worth watchingthe rest of them were pretty much the same the humor was drier than a bucket of sand and not very interesting plot line all in all not a very good show and im glad its over
