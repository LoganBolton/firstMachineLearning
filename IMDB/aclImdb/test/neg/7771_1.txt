in 1970 feminists invaded the miss world beauty contest in london and brought the occasion to a halt by pelting the stage with flour and eggs why because rightly or wrongly they felt the event to be demeaning and degrading to women i offer no criticism of their actions its a free world we live in what i want to know is why dont their modernday equivalents invade the studios where shows such as this are made and do likewise br br sex  the city is all about four selfabsorbed women from new york carrie is a slave to fashion who turns into a pussycat when a man so much as claps eyes on her charlotte yearns to find the perfect man  they dont exist love  so she can use sex to ensnare the poor devil lawyer miranda scares men away by wittering nonsense like out of touch with my emotions and lastly we have samantha the living embodiment of the old martini ad anytime anyplace anywhere feminists hold up these characters  particularly samantha  as a shining example of modernday womanhood well if shouting rude words in busy restaurants is progress i think the feminists should take a long hard look at themselves and what theyre supposed to representbr br had sex  the city been the creation of a man it would have been pulled from the airwaves for being sexist instead like charlies angels before it it has conned supposedly intelligent women into thinking it has acted as a positive force for good theres something very clinical and coldblooded about the show the benny hill show was sexist too but at least it was funny
