the problem with this movie is that it isnt funny it isnt scary it isnt dramatic it isnt intriguing it isnt stimulating it isnt it isnt exciting it isnt even the slightest bit interesting i saw this film recently on tape and i was glad i didnt spent any money to rent it its basically a poor attempt at filmmaking i wont even bother to tell you the story story what story
