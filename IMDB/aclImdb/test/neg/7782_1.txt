look no further this is it the worst movie ever made there may be others that are tied but there are none worse there cant bebr br i found this movie on a clearancesale laserdisc for 325 and thought no movie with those actors could possibly not be worth that price turns out its worth triple that  as the minimum they should have paid me to watch itbr br im virtually certain that the girl in the picture on the cover of the package is not the girl in the movie they substituted someone else someone younger and cuter to make it look more appealing whatever plot there was amounted to about three minutes of actual movie the rest is filler and i dont mean the kind of filler that you only realize is filler when its over or that is some kind of eye candy you dont mind having there i mean filler that has you thinking about your shopping list i think the music must have been made up by somebody with a friend who had a radio he listened to once its terriblebr br if there were a shot of a nice mountain a river valley a forest anything there would be something positive about this movie there isnt even with the speeder button on the remote even at top laserdisc speed you cant get it over with fast enoughbr br after years of thinking about commenting on movies being tempted but not registering with imdb i finally cracked because i had to do my part to push the user rating on this stinker down as far as possiblebr br the guidelines ask that you focus on the content and context i cant there isnt enough content to focus on and thats exactly my point sometimes bad is just bad and this movie would have to be much better than it is to aspire to being only that
