a friend of mine once rented this thinking since peter fonda starred in it it couldnt be bad wrong its bad as anything can be there is so much to laugh at and its not the jokes for instance in one scene hawken walks into the forest and when he comes out he is suddenly wearing a completely different outfit where was the directors brain when he shot that scene probably the same place fondas was when he agreed to do this flick its truly a shame one has to see such a fine actor go dumb in this poor excuse for a filmbr br nobodys performance in this movie can be called acting jack elam is brought in just to bring up the star count here but all he does is looking startled in a very dark and awfully shot scene in some kind of bar not to mention the indians the girl was so godawful i wanted to shoot her just to end her misery and mine as well if i could give this a 0 i would shame that mark doesnt exist here this truly reminds of a bad joke or an amateur footage made just for fun this should serve as a proof of how bad bmovies can get
