i hate a movie that doesnt have an ending i dont care how good or bad the rest might be i dont like to be left without a conclusion such shows should insist upon a disclaimer  something like the movie you are about to watch has either no ending or is so ambiguous as to not be conclusivebr br in the movie the last scene we are left with is dee and dominic having a bit of a row and he says almost regretfully i thought that it couldnt be him because the fingers were either that of a girl or a child then it ends well sure the smoking gun so to say is in the hands of the dees son but what about dominics daughter i actually thought we might discover it was her anyway unless you like inconclusive movies then id avoid this one otherwise i thought the movie generally good
