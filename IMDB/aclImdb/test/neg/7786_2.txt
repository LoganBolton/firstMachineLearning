when a bbc murder thriller is this rife with heterosexual dysfunction you know who the killer must be the homosexualbr br who murdered the sexy blonde teenager whos also a pathological liar on her way home from school lets see could it be the mother who against all common sense is letting her teenaged son make unchaperoned visits to his serialkiller father behind bars could it be the moody son whos impressed by his dads nononsense attitude about women could it be the serial killer himself who seems able to manipulate events from behind bars a la hannibal lecter could it be moms boyfriend a teacher at the school whose affair with an exstudent led to his wifes suicide or could it be boyfriends daughter who goes blabbing everyones secrets at school causing untold misery no its none of these likely suspects itsthe homosexualbr br the only mystery for the viewer is guessing who the homosexual is of course it could be anybody since the only characteristics of the homosexual are shameful secrecy and a propensity to murder and otherwise make life complicated for the normal folks the homosexual is the invisible root cause of societys ills only when this person is exposed and eliminated can the fractured family come back together and things can return to normalwhatever that isbr br as for the cast both jemma redgrave and robson green are now officially past their sellby dates the world could get by marvelously without ever seeing either on screen again but as long as the bbc has roles for the aggrieved woman and the misunderstood man i suppose theyll keep coming back in movies like this one
