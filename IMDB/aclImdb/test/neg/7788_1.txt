its difficult to make it through this movie without choking on your own vomit to be honest the shoddy animation doesnt help as it makes this look like a decadesold video youd find in morrisonss 99p bin still its better than the abysmal screenplay which spends about a third of its length on superfluous extras like belles present day problems stuff about scrooges dad and plenty of charmless fannying around with  choke  two anthropomorphic mice these bizarre additions eat up screen time at the expense of elements youd think would be quite important like dickenss dialogue and key chunks of his plot  the movie buggers up the game of twenty questions for example and at times fails to put scenes in the right order absolutely hopeless
