this appears to be one of noel cowards lesser known films and it is easy to understand why taken at face value its not a bad film but theres nothing terribly good about it either nothing much happens at all throughout the course of the film its simply the story of chris and leonoras illfated affair and barbaras reaction to it the only thing that keeps the film interesting is the fact that we already know its going to end badly for one reason or another owing to the first scene oddly there are many perfect opportunities in the story for conflict and yet none of them are utilised for example it wouldve been much more interesting and believable if barbara hadve fallen out with leonora but instead the two remained on good terms throughout the film the notion of barbara having been betrayed by her friend was not explored at all  in fact she didnt even seem to feel betrayed by her husband she even encourages him to go on a holiday with leonora similarly chris two secretaries at his practice susan birch and tim verney who also happen to be close friends of both chris and barbara are never forced to take sides in fact tim shies away from conflict by telling chris that hes terribly fond of both him and barbara despite the strange lack of conflict the biggest flaw in the film is the fact that we dont care whether chris ends up with leonora or barbara the two womens personalities are indistinguishable anyway so we dont know which of the two is better suited to be with chris and besides this barbaras permissiveness gives the impression that she hardly cares about the affair anyway furthermore i found chris and leonoras relationship somewhat unconvincing i can overlook the ridiculously short timeframe in which they fall for each other because that is so common in films of this era but even then the relationship seemed shallow cowards character was too austere and cynical to be the object of leonoras affections he reminds me of the socially inept genius sir earnest pease from the film very important person  im sure the two wouldve gotten along well chris coldness and austerity made his love for leonora seem insincere i think coward shouldve sat this one out and given his part to a younger man  as it is i was constantly wondering what this young beauty saw in such a sombre mostly emotionless balding middle aged man despite all my criticisms the film still manages to be interesting  just not terribly compelling the fact that none of the characters are particularly well developed gives them an enigmatic nature which is somewhat intriguing the astonished heart is certainly worth watching but it is a flawed piece of cinema
