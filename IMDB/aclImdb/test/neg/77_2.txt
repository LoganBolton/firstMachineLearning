ok so my summary line is a cheap trick but the movie is full of them and it gets absurdly praised sobr br i caught this one on tv uncut as tv here shows all movies thats for you americans who might say i didnt like it because i saw a cut tv version  fortunately thats only an us thing and had no idea about what it was i switched on caught the last minutes of a show and the movie began within a minute i was begging it was a comedy given the particularly ridiculous clich√©d beginning yes its a bad moviewithinthemovie i know but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested i dont even know why i didnt switch channels and yes in fact the movie turned out to be a comedy albeit an unintentional onebr br marina zudina is pretty enough but gosh what a dreadful performance while casting a foreigner in the role is smart enough she doesnt talk so bye bye language barrier yet sorry marina baby playing mute doesnt mean impersonating harpo marx her acting is unintentionally funny in many moments just look at her when she draws an x in the air while stalked by the killer he wants to kill you its no time to play zorro we get plenty of running upstairs stuff passing for tension as in the worst slashers and things like pulling a carpet and a bad guy shots the other ugh will hollywood ever learn yet the bestworst pearl is having a guy electrocuted in a bathtub and well i have never seen anyone being electrocuted to death in a bathtub but im sure you cant see the blue cartoon rays in real life do you and how about immediately trusting a meanlooking guy because he says hes a cop and not asking him to show you his credentials ok so he turns out to be a real cop but still not asking for the badge makes no sense plotwise we could always think the credentials might be phony or he might be a crooked cop screen writing 101 and how about the big twist dont tell me you didnt see that coming from 200 miles awaybr br i feel sorry for poor old alec guinness and his useless stock footage cameo now i think about this whats the point in giving him a mystery guest star credit in the end titles the movies over theres no mystery anymore and everybody and their brother have identified guinness even nonmovie buffs will recognize the old guy from star wars yet better off this way so we can pretend its not the late great actorbr br people keep comparing this to of all people hitchcock i suppose it has to be john hitchcock the milkman as the late sir alfred would feel embarrassed out of watching this let alone making it and this gets a 6810 its bottom 100 material but then were talking a rating system that allows the lord of the rings the return of the king to appear as the third best movie ever made check top 100 sobr br 210
