this one is a real stinkerbr br the story just isnt up to par with most other tz episodes its pretty boring though seeing peter falk made up as a fidel castro lookalike is kind of amusingbr br whenever twilight zone would be aired at an unannounced hour in my hometown id grab a sandwich and a drink and settle in for some quality entertainment 9 times out of 10 it wound up being this episode strange thing this often happened to my mom another tz fan like me as well there were so many times that one of us would say to the other i was all set to watch the twilight zone and guess which episode was on the cuban dictator episode obviously some people like this episode as it gets a 67 rating  how that happened i have no idea  but that in and of itself would make a great twilight zone plot
