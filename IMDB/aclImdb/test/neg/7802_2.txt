while the twilight zone was a wonderful show it was also very unevenwith some great episodes some lousy ones and many in between dont believe the diehard fansthere were some stinkers and this was definitely one of thembr br in a plot that is obviously meant to be an attack on fidel castro a near lookalike peter falk in lots of makeup and a beard obtains a magic mirror that allows him to realize who all his enemies are so he can liquidate them while i do believe that castro is a thug and dictator and tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners will attest to this its amazing how this sort of preachy episode actually makes audiences laugh at the american efforts to marginalize the creep and actually makes castro seem okay think about itserling and company wanted to hurt castro but instead only seemed to be obvious preachy and silly in the processbr br its indeed badalmost laughably bad when seen today
