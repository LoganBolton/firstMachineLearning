patsy kensit and some random australian bloke star as a duo of wannabe tough coppers in the middle of investigating a series of artgallery related murders but in between they can still find the time to shoot juvenile shoplifters and suspect the brand new wife of the male cop of being adulterous the serial killer suddenly isnt important anymore when the supposed lover of the wife whos basically just a coworker of hers is found murdered and the male cop becomes prime suspect tunnel vision is a really dull implausible and tensionfree aussie thriller that obviously imitates popular sexthrillers like fatal attraction disclosure and basic instinct the characters are extremely onedimensional and pretty much every goodcopbadcop cliché is extendedly described in the script the struggling position of police women in a corps full of men the shootfirstaskquestionslater mentality alcohol problems through stress etc etc even the unhealthy eating habits of cops are a running gag yawn kensit really tries her best to make this film more bearable but she lacks the credibility and talent of a real cinema heroine the endtwist is more or less interesting not at all original mind you but by then you stopped caring for the characters a long time already the scenes filmed inside the sex clubs look ludicrously fake and clive fleurys directing is completely uninspired what a total waste of time
