yet another recent comedy that shows that hollywood cant even do the basics when it comes to filmmaking that it used to do in its sleep for decades if the writerdirector had any brains they would have based the film around stamps character of tyrant boss jack taylor when hes in the film early on its nothing special but it is mildly promising and occasionally amusing once he departs for the majority of the film and kutcher has his hilarious adventures housesitting with guest after boring guest dropping in the film totally disintegratesbr br as a result what should have been a passable timewaster turns into an inept stinker
