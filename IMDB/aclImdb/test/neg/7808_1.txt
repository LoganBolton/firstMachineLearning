this film made me so angry because of its stupidity that i felt the need to create an account on imdb to share with you my opinion i liked ashton kutcher in a lot like love and this is why i still wanted to see this film despite its current 42 rating it is highly overrated i trusted that an actor any of them would judge the script and would not agree to participate in such lownow quality production it is very disappointing the theme of homesitting was much better used in deuce bigalow male gigolo things that did not make sense here fist of all the house owner leaves his precious pet with somebody who doesnt know anything about taking care of it secondly the rule is not to let anybody in the house but the housesitter fails to follow this simple rule the door is not locked and so on
