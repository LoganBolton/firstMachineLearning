oddly i have very little to say about the box so this will be pretty brief i have never read the richard matheson novella button button from which the film is based but considering what i saw in this adaptation there couldnt have been much semblance to such a legendary authors work the box is about a family who discover a strange contraption on their doorstep that has a button on it frank langella shows up and explains how they will be given one million dollars if they push the button  the only catch is that it will automatically kill someone somewhere spoiler they push it end of spoilers that whole concept was interesting on its own but somehow they managed to extend the movie into some convoluted stargate knockoff that pads it out until a pretty decent ending with a pretty profound message while im trying to be as fair as possible i still must say that this was not my cup of tea and it bored me severely i guess its from the same director as donnie darko which i remember liking when i saw it years ago the box wouldve worked well as a short film but since it was so lifelessly adapted this way i cant come close to recommending it
