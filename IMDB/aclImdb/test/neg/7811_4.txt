it was dumb sort of like an adam sandler movie br br there were a few funny parts but not that funnybr br i liked some of the actors in it though br br there were some sat night live people in the movie but i wouldnt recommend this unless there is just nothing else better on and it was still better than any jennifer lopez movie
