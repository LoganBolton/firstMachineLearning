there are some things you just dont do so says the tagline of this a 2003 david zucker comedy about a young man caught up in one horrendous situation after another entitled my bosss daughter and its the tagline which should speak for both the people that made this junk as well as those contemplating watching it there are indeed some things you just dont do with the placing of mostly all of the sort of content to be found within my bosss daughter counting as wholly items you just should not do to the medium of cinema by including them in your picture my bosss daugther is a sordid creepy grotesque experience a clunky and heavy handed piece which is infantile beyond words and disgusting beyond expression to see it is to endure it to endure it is to survive it and to survive it is an accomplishment all by itself Â– if any of the cast writers extras hell even the guys that worked as runners on the set aid in producing anything as earthshatteringly poor as this again then itll be either because theyve been sent here by the devil himself to destroy the medium of film or itll be because theyve most probably garnered employment on behalf of the friedbergseltzer mobbr br my bosss daugther which im pretty sure ought to be titled my boss daugther grammatically speaking revolves around its hapless male lead named tom stansfield kutcher and a night in at his boss house as he chases that seemingly elusive goal that is his young blonde daughter lisa taylor reid  someone whom works within the same department as he does in a towering chicago office block whilst under the strict eye of jack taylor stamp tom spies lisa early on shes taking the subway to work with all the other shmos despite the fact she owns a car and that her father is the boss of the damn company after trying to talk to her but having his attempts foiled by a puking baby and a dog for the blind more interested in toms crotch than anything else he finally gets his chance in the office when talk of an afterdark party elsewhere arises and that he ought to come round to her house to visit her  and yes she does still live with her father think hitchcocks 1960 film psycho with the gender roles between norman bates and his mother reversed and then played for laughsbr br the distinct establishment of character is made painfully apparent in the opening scene in which tom sits on the subway train and travels to work with his yuppie cohorts they are a ruthless and smarmy bunch whom its made apparent swipe the briefcases of those unfortunate enough to get them stuck in the door in the ensuing morning rush without ever returning them one day it happens with tom there and his wish is to return it thus pounding into us that hesnotlikeotherguys this as he first sees lisa down the carriage and is somewhat shy to approach her as the other men treat the whole situation as if it would be a breeze if they were in his position this rather obvious and flatfooted attempt to try and get us to side with tom sits uneasily with what it supposedly takes to earn a place amidst these coworkers in this companybr br it is however as close as my bosss daughter comes to any level of filmmaking from a seemingly harmless premise of a boy meeting a girl and wanting to get to know her arrives the comedy from hell toms arriving at the house will not see him invited to the party instead he is charged with house sitting jacks pet owl and generally keeping out of mischief whilst maintaining a spotless house its been established terrance stamps character means business in the strictest of manners firing people for the smallest of things such as the making of a bad cup of coffee its not that jack is a shrewed businessman hes a cleanliness freak obsessed with control and a borderline sociopath in his placings of bear traps in the garden so as to keep the children next door off his land you can imagine that when were let into his large and exquisite house with the orders that nothing should go wrong theres obviously going to be troublebr br the film has fun with this premise of danger for about ten minutes the first time someone uses the worktop to crack open a beer thus marking the pristine top you may smirk but by the time half the house is wrecked and michael madsen has shown up urinating all over the rug youve got your head in your hands each joke in the film is set up in an almighty clunky manner before it is played out in a way that is closer to slow and excruciating than slick and faultless the only thing missing as it follows through to the next gag is the sound effect of someone incorrectly changing the gears to a car as it clunks and creaks onto the next pratfall inbetween the grossout wackiness the film takes time to roll down a route of yucky saccharine driven romance as lisa and tom bond whilst talking of inworkplace and outof workplace personas and that maybe they have more in common than first thought by the hour mark the films opted for gross out gags and hate filled jibes more than anything when theres an entire scene that exists purely to target paraplegics and a dumb subplot to do with a headinjury sporting neighbour on a blind date in which some truly unwatchable sight gags are unfolded throughout stamps character enjoys putting people down and asking if the simplest of tasks are too difficult for them to which the commonplace reply ought to be whilst channeling jack taylor was reading the screenplay first too complicateda concept for you stamp
