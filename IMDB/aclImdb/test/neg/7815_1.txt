this is by far the most awful movie i have ever watched i have never before rated a movie 1 out of 10 my advice is dont watch it this doesnt even classify as a moviebr br youd be better off sitting on the couch bored rather than watching this movie acting was terrible but what was worst by far was the storyline highly unlikely sequence of events which arent even funny they are actually very lame and stupid very foolish choice by ashton kutcher and tara reid to act in this movie might even upset their careers a littlebr br when i walked into blockbuster the main focus was on this movie  so i decided rent it i sincerely regret itbr br once youre 10 or 20 minutes into the movie you could basically predict what was going to happen i was hoping it would get better  but instead it got worsebr br i am not exaggerating this the movie is terrible dont watch it hope this helps
