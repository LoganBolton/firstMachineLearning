this is the first time im entering a comment for a movie i havent viewed till the credits reason for this is simplepeople need to be warned this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium i usually stay away from a good deal of comedies that are in bad taste but i reckoned this to be watchable a regrettable decision which was based on other ashton kutcher comedies that were semi enjoyable such as a lot like love and guess whobr br where those two movies had their charms and laughs this had none and i mean none the acting is horrible especially the boss tara reid was no surprise how dare she call herself an actress the premise is thin and the plot doesnt thicken at all not a problem if you manage to keep it funny andor sweetbut as you probably already guessed this was not the cast at all the script felt like it wasnt quite finished and i wouldnt even be baffled if the director did some rewrites while shooting my dog couldve written a more coherent script seriously and hes not exactly lassie either br br stay away from this tripe even if you like silly goofball comedies at times like i do this low quality movie will not be enjoyed by manybr br i almost never give a one so thereforea 2
