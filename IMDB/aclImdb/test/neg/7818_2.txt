for years i hesitated watching this movie now i know why it was even worse than id expected ashton kutcher makes the worst movie mistake of his career since dude wheres my car tara reid costars as the girl of ashtons dreams who asks him to babysit her father and his bosss pet owl for the weekend the rules 1 no shoes in the house 2 no people in the house 3 the boss son stays out of the house 4 dont touch the furniturebr br well you can pretty much guess by the end of the first twenty minutes how the rest of the film is going to turn outbr br you know there are films like meet the parents where bad things happen to someone but its entertaining to watch and its delivered in a way that you cant wait to see what happens next this is not one of those films you know right from the start that bad things are going to happen and theyre mostly stupid things that would never actually happen its an extremely frustrating movie to watch and there were about three times when i nearly turned it off because it was so bad but i paid the rental fee and figured i had to watch it nowbr br tara reid was good and i would like to see her in more films though im not surprised if this had a hand in hurting her careerbr br the end result is a happy endingbut of course with the kind of film it is you would expect nothing short of thatbr br dont watch it youll sincerely regret it
