the story is disjointed and poorly written we are given threads and a possible hook in act one only to see it vanish had the writer bothered reading his work carefully it wold have been apparent that madsdens characters initial problem and meeting with the bad girl suggests that there will be a troubled alliance between them as they try to solve his problembr br the problem goes nowhere the relationship goes nowhere and there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships noone digs anyone and noone is appealing the writing and directing is laughable you can feel someone struggling with the mess and shifting the story focus about trying to extract some excitement there is none the writerdirector is simply a beginner whose muddled efforts somehow became a movie from simple errors such as they took polaroids  in japan in 2007  to insulting errors such as nudity for eroticism this movie is an insult you cannot make them much worsebr br and by plastering madsden on the talent list the producers thought theyd have some success he is hardly acting asia certainly is and the result is some heroinchic pantobr br give it a big miss
