if youre an average guy like me and enjoy good acting good plot good scripts novel ideas or being entertained you might want to skip this one i was honestly bored from the opening credits to the very end but tried to give the film a chance and watched it all the way through  only to be disappointed at every turnbr br the acting was unbelievably sub par but im not sure if the actors themselves are to blame or if it was the ridiculously wooden and horrible dialog coupled with an even worse script the plot is very vague and underdeveloped and i think the audience is supposed to derive some kind of deeper meaning from it or be able to look past it in some way but honestly to do so would be a waste of timebr br the film has a kind of crude sexuality to it which doesnt serve any purpose other than to show off some tattoos and lingerie no one seems to have any motivation except making money off of some kind of investment deal that is never really explained the connections between the characters arent terribly clear and there is little to no character developmentbr br this is either some kind of subculture film meant for a very specific audience to enjoy or absolute crap but you can decide for yourselvesbr br i gave it a 2 because it is definitely one of the worst films ive ever seen but probably not the worst
