jean claude van dammes movie career seems to have gone to hell in a handcart so how ironic to see him playing a character who meets the same fate in a literal manner at the very start of the movie  its also interesting to note how very  very similar the plots of his movies play out regardless of who the producer  director or screenwriter are  van damme usually plays a character who is living in france then due to a set of circumstances finds himself in another part of the globe where he has a brother who dies and its up to van damme to get revenge helped by a character hes just met  look at awol or legoinairre or many other films that feature the headline  starring jean claude van damme  and they all feature nearly the same type of story structure  this doesnt mean theyre identical of course  just very similar and if youve seen one van damme movie youve basically seen them all  its the same with maximum risk
