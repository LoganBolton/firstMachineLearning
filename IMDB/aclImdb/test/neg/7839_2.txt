this is not a good filmbr br i can usually sit through a van damme movie if i have to as they are usually a bit of a laugh and dont require much thought this one has no redeeming features br br it has a distinct lack of plot humour acting direction etc etc a real stinker on all levels br br i have never walked out of a cinema during a movie although i came damme close here br br avoid at all costs
