how truly sad that this sprung from the same mind as donnie darko possibly one of the best films in this genre where do i even begin i think one of the must infuriating aspects of the film is that we are supposed to be critiquing humanity and yet we see no humanity in the film no more than 5 minutes of the film is spend agonizing about the possible death of another human these are horrible one dimensional cardboard cutouts of human beings sadly thats how they are played with what can only be described as dreadful acting is this truly how kelly sees humanity judging from the reaction of viewers this is a horrible encapsulation of humanity why dont the characters in the film ask the questions that all the viewers have this is not an indictment of humanity its an indictment of the straw men that kelly sets up who bare almost no resemblance to real humans in this situationbr br to those who say this was a wonderful thoughtprovoking film to what are you comparing it armageddon i even saw someone compare this to the works of kurosawa how truly deprived must you be to think that this would promote good existential discussion for the love of all thats good in film even indecent proposal is ten times the indictment of humanity that this is there we see people truly agonizing about greed and the human condition yes even indecent proposal puts this film to shame for philosophical discussion and yet it gets 53 vs 60 for this mindless tripebr br rarely have i seen a more pretentious pontificating and self aggrandizing film fall so flatly on its face this has the depth of a high school film project and a poor one at that truly thats about the level of the discussion promoted by this film if you want to see good psychological film making do yourself a favor and check out das experiment if the box had lived up even to this one goal i would have been willing to forgive some of the atrocious acting gaping plot holes and sheer nonsensical storyline sadly it cant even do thatbr br the true indictment of humanity is that there are people out there who think this film is a deeply delving introspective look into the human condition this is not sartre this is not even the cliff notes version of sartre this is a hastily conceived and hackwritten 9th grade term paper on sartre based on some internet message board ramblings if sartre were alive he would sue kelly for defamation
