tycoon will never be listed as one of john waynes better post stagecoach film its good in spots has some fine action sequences in the cave in and also in the flood at the climax but the plot leaves a lot to be desiredbr br what we have in tycoon is two men who thoroughly dislike each other and that dislike prevents them from working as a team multimillionaire cedric hardwicke has hired john wayne and james gleason to build a railroad but then he refuses to give them the needed funds to do the job rightbr br things get really complicated when wayne falls for hardwickes daughter laraine day after a night when they have to spend time alone in an inca ruin by convention in south america wayne and day get a shotgun wedding even though nothing happenedbr br what should have happened is these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours together to work out their differences one way or another their petty spites cause some fatalities among waynes crewbr br but what tycoon is most known for is another piece of pettiness laraine day was married to leo durocher the manager of the brooklyn dodgers when this was being filmed he was a constant presence on the set insanely jealous of john wayne who he thought might be having an affair with his wife nothing to it but he made his wifes life miserablebr br not one of the dukes better efforts
