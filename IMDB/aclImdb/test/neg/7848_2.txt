this must be one of mgms and frank sinatras worst films an oddball musical comedy that fails in almost every aspect silly plot has sinatra trying to carry on his fathers reputation as a kissing bandit hes no bandit and doesnt kiss he does play the nerdy character as well as could be expected given the dialog he has to speak the scene stealers are j carroll nash and mildred natwick too bad they didnt have more scenes together ive given the film two stars because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs sung by kathtren grayson love is where you find it is sensational could have had a repirse of that one also a comic type dance number by ridcardo mantalban cyd charisse and ann miller if fun so for those reasons and those reasons only it is watchable kissing bandit is part of the frank sinatra early years collection
