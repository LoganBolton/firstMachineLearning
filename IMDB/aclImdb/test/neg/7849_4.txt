perhaps the director was trying for another pirate good garland and kelly musical  but this lame musical epoch falls flat sinatra and kathryn graysons voices do not blend well  and their chemistry together lacks spark the premise of sinatra as a sweet guy who tries to impersonate his late bandito father is okay but he seems awkward in the role whats amazing and wonderful here is how sinatra can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special  his phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again when grayson sings the same songs its hard to believe shes not singing something entirely different and not nearly as interesting she has her big moment with love is where you find it which suits her perfectly and shows off her abilities the photography is lucious and both stars look appealing as do the costumes and sets costars mildred natwick and j carroll nash put lots of energy into making the impossible work aside from sinatras singing there is a strange menageatois dance with ricardo montalban cyd charisse and ann miller its fascinating and weird montalban and charisse were a wonderful dancing team and this number is a real oddity
