the kissing bandit was the third and final film that frank sinatra and kathryn grayson costarred at mgm with the first two were anchors aweigh and it happened in brooklyn and in both sinatra wooed and lost grayson i guess the third times the charmbr br for romance maybe but definitely not for screen image sinatra in his fortys films once again plays the nice little schnook only this time in toreador pants poaching on tyrone powers territory laid out in the mark of zorro sinatra plays the son of a man who was a hotel owner by day and the kissing bandit by night hes gone and left california for an education and has come back ready to take dads place but in the hotel business only and where does he learn the hotel business bostonbr br of course some of dads former gang members grown a little old and paunchy led by j carrol naish want him to lead the gang again but franks just not cut out for the outlaw life but he does make a good impression on the governors daughter kathryn graysonbr br somebody must have had it in for sinatra at mgm to cast him in this after the bad reviews he got in miracle of the bells franks in a part that was more suitable for red skelton but since this was a musical i guess the brain trust at mgm figured kathryn grayson had to have a singing costarbr br in fact the best number in the film are for her love is where you find it also ricardo montalban ann miller and cyd charisse do a dance specialty that is nice franks songs are nice but nothing spectacularbr br in later years sinatra would wince at the mention of the kissing bandit and with good reason
