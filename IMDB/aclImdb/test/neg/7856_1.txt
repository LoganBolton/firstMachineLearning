cétait complètement minable  à fuir absolument br br this was an idiotic attempt to destroy classic source material and thoroughly succeededbr br do not see this film under any circumstances unless you wish to have your ten euros torn up and shoved up your nostrils by a bunch of vapid atrociously unamusing charactersbr br this type of film clearly illustrates the gulf that still unfortunately divides directors and audiences if the individual heaven forbid a collective could have conceived this dross behind this had been considerate enough to watch the version currently playing in french cinemas he or she would have endured what i was forced to endure and mercifully rewritten it or just scrapped it altogether the vein of adult humour being mined here dates to my mind back to fritz the cat but lacks that films avantgarde status or even its base attempt at social commentarybr br with the proliferation of remakes and increasing reliance on preexisting source material to fund storytelling these days one would hope that choosing snow white and thus not having to worry about conceiving characters or a radically new story would have allowed more time for oh i dont know interesting animation smarter jokes perhaps a coherent film that has something to say and doesnt telegraph its vacuity from the opening frame br br a manifestly appalling production
