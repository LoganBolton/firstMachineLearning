heaven can wait is a crushing bore and a candycoated misogynist lie i cant imagine anyone but film students sitting through it today don ameche is in almost every scene and while he has a mellifluous voice that no doubt contributed to his successful career in radio he doesnt have the charisma to carry this film ameche plays henry a womanizer lubitsch wants to make henrys sexual incontinence adorable and amusing and so he directs ameche to play the part as blandly as possible the combination of ameches lack of charisma and lubitschs insistence on blandness results in a lead character who is both deadly dull and completely icky you wouldnt want to spend any time with this man hed put you to sleep you wouldnt leave him alone with your daughter no matter her age something creepy would happenbr br the movies look is quite boring scene after scene consists of static overly lighted dioramastyle shots of fastidiously dressed gilded age stuffed shirts and bustles lounging in excessively busy victorian parlors theres so many ruffles and frills and curlicues so much lilac and sky blue and pink you need dramaminebr br this movie hates women as much as hardcore porn but it presents that hatred with a candy coating and a sweet little bow on top the contrast between the content of the message and its delivery is sickening in one of the movies most hateful scenes an elderly woman is sent to hell because shes not physically attractive
