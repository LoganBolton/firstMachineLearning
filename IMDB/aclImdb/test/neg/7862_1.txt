curse of the wolf starts as reluctant werewolf dakota renee porada manages to escape from her pack  into the city where 6 months later she is working in a vets the rest of dakotas pack are unhappy  want her back their leader michael todd humes says she will come back to them but fat werewolf franklin brian heffron picks her scent up  the pack decides to force the issue  get her back using her affections for her human friends including her boyfriend danny dennis carver can dakota save danny  finally rid herself of her werewolf pursuers i doubt you will carebr br executive produced written  directed by len kabasinski who also had a fairly large role in the film as stick i was dreading watching curse of the wolf since kabasinski was the man behind swamp zombies 2005 which is surely one of the worst films ever made ever unfortunately my worst fears were confirmed  one has to say that curse of the wolf is a truly horrible film in every way both conceptually  technically curse of the wolf is the sort of film where the low budget dictates what happens  the script rather than the script dictating the budget you get the impression that everything was written  conceived to take advantage of the few sets  actors they had you can almost imagine the makers saying weve got a few actors some basic equipment  a couple of locations so lets make a horror film around them the story is awful michael finds the location of dakota by looking at a large dog two women are taking for a walk the characters are awful a big fat werewolf guy who farts a lot the dialogue is awful just about every line in the thing  theres never any motivation for anything that happens why are the pack so desperate to get dakota back people just do seemingly random things  since director kabasinskis background is in martial arts he insists in inserting lots of random martial arts fight sequences into the plot no offence but this is meant to be a horror film not a martial arts one isnt it in fact apart from the presence of a few werewolves you would be hard pushed to describe curse of the wolf as anything approaching a horror film at almost two hours in length it feels like it goes on forever  is so slow  uneventful its just not funnybr br director kabasinski was obviously working on a low budget but filmmaking this bad should be a crime theres no continuity between shots the fight scenes look awful  are so poorly staged its untrue  its sometimes impossible to follow whats going on be it because of the choppy editing  poor camera angles or the fact that it is sometimes so dark that you literally cant see a thing seriously there are times during curse of the wolf where the screen is totally black  you cant see a thing i would hate to have to sit through this watching it on a fuzzy low resolution vhs the sound is awful too you can hear the wind  breeze against the microphone there are also lots of other unpleasant  unwanted ambient sounds during just about every scene did the production actually have any lighting gear while making this it doesnt feel like it the special effects mostly consist of werewolf masks that look like the sort of thing shops sell at halloween for the kids basically they look awfulbr br technically curse of the wolf is as bad as they come im sorry because i know this had a low budget but its truly horrible to sit through  try to garner some entertainment from this is high school film student quality im sorry if that sounds unkind but its a fact the acting is well you can probably guess so ill stop myself right here before i say something else negative i mean ive done enough of that already  i really take no pleasure in itbr br curse of the wolf is terrible both conceptually  technically this is a real chore to sit through curse of the wolf is the type of film where while your watching it time seems to stand still its the type of film that lasts for almost two hours yet feels like two years one of the worst films you or i am ever likely to see definitely one to avoid
