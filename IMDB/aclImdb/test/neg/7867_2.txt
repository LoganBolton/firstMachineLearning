i hate to be too critical but this one really was bad i like the baldwin brothers i just wish there was more talent evenly spread between them i did like the general plot but there was just too much trying and not enough actual doing as far as quality acting was concerned br br my favorite character out of the whole thing was bald cop he reminded me of dmitri valtane  jeremy roberts i believe  from start trek 6 undiscovered country just without the hairbr br if you have hollywood videos mvp program and are really trying to get your moneys worth then through this in with one of the three mvp movies you pick up its worth it for a few laughsbr br the single most impressive special effect in the whole show is the sound of stephen baldwins rifle firing i suppose that lets you in a bit on the quality and excitement of the rest of the show
