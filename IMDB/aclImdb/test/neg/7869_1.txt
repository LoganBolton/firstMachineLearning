dear movie directorbr br in the future when trying to create a sense of urgency it might be best to have your hero run instead of jogshuffle especially if youre trying to reinforce a time line for example if youre trying to convince the audience that the bad guy really will kill the hostage if the hero doesnt find her its probably a good idea to convey the feeling that your hero believes it may actually happen lets face it though making a good movie obviously wasnt your goal your goal was to pump out some garbage that will make more money than it cost otherwise you might have hired some actorsbr br sincerely bored viewerbr br this is the worst movie ive seen in a long time i cant say that its the worst ever because i was able to finish it it was bad bad bad though dude wheres my refund
