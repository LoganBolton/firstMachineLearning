this movie sucks the acting is worse than in the films we made when we were 10 years old with a camcorder the effects look like some 80s computer game and the plot is worse than terrible even the worst van damme movies make this look crappy the accent and speech rhythm of the bad guys is so bad its funny br br i wouldnt recommend watching this unless you are a big time fan one of the actors 1 out of 10
