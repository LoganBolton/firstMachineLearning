i never really understood the controversy and hype this movie caused especially in french and the neighboring countries in belgium where i am located for example baisemoi was announced as the most shocking and the most thoughtprovoking social drama you could ever experience yeah right it might be a little shocking maybe how often do you see someone getting shot up the arse but the weak and pointless plot surely didnt cause me to think much baisemoi is another one of those blame everything that goes wrong on societyfilms and theyre generally not very convincing about 99 of the people functions perfectly well in this society so why would you blame this exact same society for the vile and hopeless acts of two deranged nymphgirls the two main characters and their miserable lives are introduced separately and in flashes nadine just killed her roommate manu shot her brother and the two meet in an abandoned trainstation late at night they decide to travel around france together leaving a trail of sex and blood behind wherever they made a stop although were constantly exposed to pornography and violence this film is very boring to sit through like the girls are indicating themselves all the time the dialogues are lame and the people they run into and killÂ… are very uninteresting if people want to make porno movies thats fine by me but please dont pretend that its arthouse filmmaking if you leave out the swearing and the hip camerawork all there is to see is not so arousing pornography cool soundtrack though
