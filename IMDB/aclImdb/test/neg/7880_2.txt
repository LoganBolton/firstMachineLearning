im sick of the open mind argument im generally quite openminded but this sort of line is basically made by people who enjoy things that should not be enjoyed you know what there is a reason so many people are disgusted by this and just because someone out there isnt doesnt make it less so there is after all a reason for the existence of the feeling of disgust and no amount of open mind or pushing the envelope should eliminate that feeling otherwise were no better than senseless living thingsbr br back to the film another argument is that this film puts women in the roles normally reserved for men which may be why men dont like it but just because it proves revolting for more men than would otherwise doesnt make it great maybe men shouldnt be turned on by whats dominating the movie industry but is the answer for women to do the same maybe if you dont like movies tv and entertainment having so much sexual objectification of women so much violence dont watch thembr br and if youre a director dont make thembr br otherwise some day someone will ask for an open mind when what happened in this movie happen in real lifebr br heck some people seem to like it so much
