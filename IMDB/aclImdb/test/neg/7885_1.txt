this is one of the rare movies that i did not immediately discuss with my friends after watching it this wasnt because it had particularly entranced or impressed me the contrary it had given me nothing at allbr br why because somehow everything was so much overdone that i couldnt take this film seriously anymore there was so much sex and violence that i got the strong impression that the film was trying very very hard to be offensive as if it was aiming at superlatives in ugliness rather than in telling a convincing tale about two women caught in a spiral of crimebr br baisemoi had been described as thelma  louise with actual sex to me well it is true that the main idea is similar there are two women traveling through the country because theyve committed crimes and know that their lives are finished now that the police are going to catch them and they decide that now that everythings over anyway there is no way to hold backbr br baisemoi had been described as a feminist film where women who had suffered from male dominance in the past exact revenge upon the men that they encounterbr br this is something that i had never interpreted into this film simply because none of these women had ever been innocent and because they do not just kill irresponsible violent men but also men that they seduce themselves men that show the sense of wanting to do protected sex and they kill women no they are in no way better than the characters that they encounter and murder in hideous brutal waysbr br how easily the heroines decide to murder and how much pleasure they take in it made it absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way or even take them seriously it was just all too much too much sex too much violence i got the feeling that sex and violence were only there in order to create a superlative in ugliness rather than in conveying a story or making a pointbr br baisemoi left me with no impression hadnt set me thinking because it was so far removed from any real world so constructed unrealistic and over the topbr br there was nothing that i could do with this film there was simply nothing about it to think about other than why did they make this terrible film had the intense unpleasantness going on in this film served a purpose id easily accepted it but since i found nothing since the films story appeared to be not more than an excuse to squeeze as much and as ugly sex as possible into one film i filed it away under unnecessary torture decided to never ever ever watch this film again and i now consider this to be the worst film ive ever seen br br worst not just because it really isnt my cup of tea to watch people get raped rape have sex in other forms and kill one another but because whatever it was that the makers wanted to tell the world with their film if they wanted to say anything at all it just didnt work and theres nothing else that could save this film because its also filmed in such an ugly style
