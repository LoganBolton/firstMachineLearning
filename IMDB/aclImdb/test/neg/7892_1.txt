alright lets break it down why is this one of the worst films ever because there are so many answers to that question im having a headache come oncracker world mr honkee the part with the arab guy its just awful i didnt really care about the whole white racism crap but when they did that thing with the arab guy i wanted to get the names of all the writers its really not worth watching 3 seconds of this movie it isnt even funnybad which was my first interpretation i hope the person who directed this movie doesnt commit suicide but it seems likely i dont see any other optionsdont ever watch this movie if you watch it u cant say u died with no regrets
