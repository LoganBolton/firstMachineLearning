i like to like movies but i found nothing to like about the box i was interested in the hook of the plot but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow anyone who states that they understand this movie is probably faking it so that they can feel like they are a part of something well i have news for them the emperor has no clothesbr br the only undertone in this movie is that women are to blame for original sin and corrupting mankind ive heard that story before and it makes less and less sense every time its true that this movie is different than a lot of films currently showing in theatres but that doesnt make it worth the ticket price
