i gave soul plane the benefit of the doubt and thought there would actually be something of comedic value in it im not black but that does not mean i cant appreciate black comedy i know that because i happen to enjoy watching the wayans bros good times and other series br br ive seen crap movies and im not easily repulsed as for soul plane i didnt even bother finishing it dont know if they managed to land the plane and i couldnt care less it would be unfair to say i didnt find some parts funny as i did laugh but i also laugh at youtube videos of skateboarders falling on their nuts so that doesnt say much the men in the movie were like a bunch of howling horny hyenas in mating season looking to get some whenever and where ever possible and we wonder why all those stereotypes dont seem to disappear to summarize soul plane makes the harold and kumar series look like the godfather
