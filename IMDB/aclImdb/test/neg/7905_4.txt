this movie wasnt too funny it wasnt too horrible either just a fun ride aboard the soul plane its a blackowned flight service with a kickass disco beautiful bar and pumping stewards the plot takes you through the whole idea of a black not race or color but style owned plane with the same style of black humor at times there are some great rare scenes like when the main character uses the normal lavatory in the normal plane check that out there are lulls however and i find it most in the character who played the soul pilot watch to find out who it is all in all its a fun movie tom arnold adds to the fun with his cracker attitude this is one movie to watch when playing poker when youre drunk or just vegging
