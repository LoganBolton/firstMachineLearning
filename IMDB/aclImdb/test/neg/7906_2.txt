soul plane is a horrible attempt at comedy that only should appeal people with thick skulls bloodshot eyes and furry pawns br br the plot is not only incoherent but also nonexistent acting is mostly sub subpar with a gang of highly moronic and dreadful characters thrown in for bad measure jokes are often spotted miles ahead and almost never even a bit amusing this movie lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties the only thing it really has going for it is some pretty ladies but really if you want that you can rent something from the adult section okbr br i can hardly see anything here to recommend since youll probably have a lot a better and productive time chasing rats with a sledgehammer or inventing waterproof teabags or whateverbr br 210
