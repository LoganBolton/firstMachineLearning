i hate to comment on something i didnt finish but if i spare one person what i sat through for almost an hour before turning it off in disgust it will be worth it br br i decided to watch this with an open mind knowing it was on the bottom 100br br bad idea i usually love crude humor or can at least tolerate it i love socalled black comedies im not easily offended either br br it started off okay and quickly went downhill i laughed a few times for example when the main character got stuck in the airplane toilet but that was it and didnt compensate for the strong disgust i feltbr br i didnt laugh when the dog got sucked into a jet engine i usually cant see the humor in animals dying except in animal house i didnt laugh at much else of the nastiness either i turned it off after an incident involving a blind man and a baked potato that i dont care to repeat the details of only that the wave of nausea still hasnt passed over me br br simply put it was smutfilled and simply not funny with barely any plot this is one of the times when if you dont have something nice to say you should get the word outbr br dont say i didnt warn you
