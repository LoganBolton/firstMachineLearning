i wholeheartedly agree with greg in ontario i saw this movie today with a friend who actually went to the theatre manager afterwards and told him that was possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i have seen a lot of movies with this person and hes pretty forgiving so i was actually shocked the manager gave him a free passbr br i was offended by much of the humor in the film yes the baked potato scene was on the top of the list my friend and i are white and saw the film with a primarily black audience for awhile i thought maybe i just dont get this movie because im white then i realized no one was laughing the writing was bad the direction was bad the timing was almost nonexistentbr br there were a few funny moments there was just way too much time between them even airplane two was funnier than this and thats saying a lotbr br i was so dazzled by snoop dogg in starsky and hutch as huggy bear that i felt i was sure to enjoy this movie nopebr br dl hughley was funny as usual but his role was rather small tom arnold had a few funny moments as the white guy but most other attempts at humor fell far short of the markbr br sadly i was not able to award this film a rating with negative stars
