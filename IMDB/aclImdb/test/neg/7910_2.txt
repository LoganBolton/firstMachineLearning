after a humiliating experience on an airplane nashawn wade kevin hart sues the airline and uses the money he wins to start up his own fullservice airline what makes his different is that it has sexy stewardesses an on board dance club and no less than captain snoop dogg in the cockpitbr br soul plane is a very racist comedy except it is only occasionally funny soul plane has been described as an urban version of airplane the problem is that soul plane doesnt even come close to achieving the laughs of airplane the jokes in soul pane are too offensive and they are mostly unoriginal i would be lying if i said i didnt laugh since there were some funny moments however i was expecting more and i left the theater disappointedbr br i would compare soul plane to airplane 2 the latter was just a rehash of the first film while the former is just a rehash of outdated crude jokes there is really no creativity behind the movie and there are only a few fun spots however i dont think soul plane is bottom 100 bad right now the movie is ranked at number 82 and thats a little harsh im not saying this is a good movie but it isnt a terrible on either the running time is only 86 minutes long so it isnt too much of a pain to watch for stupid comedies you can do a lot worsebr br no one in the cast is very good but they all seem to be having fun and this helps kevin hart was very annoying as nashawn he had a few funny lines but he is a very poor leading man snoop dogg who was mildly funny in starsky and hutch completely flunks here tom arnold was actually tolerable and that was the films biggest surprise the most annoying person in the movie was ryan pinkston he was not funny at all and he will never be funny the funniest cast members were missi pyle and monique they gave the best lines and they made me laugh the most in the end soul plane may fit the bill if youre looking for a stupid comedy but it would probably be better if you just skip the film rating 410
