having watched all of the star trek tv series episodes many times each since the 1960s most being quite good to superb and only very few being mediocre my opinion is that this one is the worst of allbr br in fact i think its so poorly executed as to be an embarrassment to the series its not that the story is so bad although its not particularly outstanding in any way but the acting is just abysmal on the part of the two lead characters meaning those other than the regulars in this case barbara anderson gives her weakest performance ever as the daughter of a mass killer and who is on a mission of a sort she practically calls in the role from a phone and shows no real emotive abilities here although usually shes never used as more than a pretty face in most of her filmtv rolesusually small parts she has done much betterbr br arnold moss as her father gives new meaning to the term ham and is the only actor ever on a 1960s star trek episode that outdid william shatner in this area and actually makes shatner look superb by comparison and he gets to play a shakespearian actor no less which gives him more impetus to overact and he does sobr br other than these two leads being so weak the story is such that anybody with any sense at all can tell who the killer is within the first 15 minutes i say this because i told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as preteens his reply was yeah youre rightbr br skip this one and watch the much superior menagerie episodes which were originally televised right before
