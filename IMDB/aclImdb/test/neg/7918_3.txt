if you just watched all dogs go to heaven and learn that theres a sequel dont watch it its horrible its absolutely awful they rush the characters to develop sasha for example begins singing about how you can count her out for love and at the end this seems more like a dramatic romance flick than a comedyadventure film they rip charlie out of his character and replace him with a gushy soft but still rebellious version of himselfbr br the humor behind carfaces character is just completely lost hes a totally different dog he doesnt have a cool voice anymore he isnt that villain you love to hate anymore hes just a wimp voiced by none other than mermaid man from spongebob speaking of voice actorsbr br charlie has a completely different voice and while it isnt horrible i dont like it its terrible in comparison to the excellent job that burt reynolds did for the character in the first film dom deluise is wonderful as always as itchy that character stays true and thats why this film gets a 310 purely because dom deluise was still voicing itchybr br oh and my last complaint i know annmaries movie was done and gone she has parents now etc but did charlie completely forget about her or what no mention at all of her in the second film i mean even a small mention from itchy would have been acceptable ex charlie we have to get back you cant take care of every kid that needs rescuing or something of the sort i mean he died living with her she deserves some kind of mentionbr br dont watch this if youre looking for a wonderful sequel
