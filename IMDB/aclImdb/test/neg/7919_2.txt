i think that this is a disappointing sequel i miss a lot of the old characters king gator anne marie etc and i dont like it due to the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to do the characters a lot of personality was lost in charlie and the villain red is not even half as bad as carface was in the first one if youre a big adgth fan like i am its worth seeing just to see how the story is continued but dont count on it being 5 stars in your book
