all dogs go to heaven was a quirky funny movie with good name talent whos voices lended an adult familiarity to a cartoon basicly for kids it was just interesting enough to be likeable by adults aside from something good for the kids to watchbr br unfortunately adgth2 is a valueless sequel trying to make a bit of cash rideing on the coattails of the first charlie sheen is a passable replacement for burt reynolds in this second movie and sheena eastons voice in a few of the movies lovely but forgettable songs makes her a worthwhile pick as a costar for this add dom deluise from the first movie and youd think this would be a decent mix to make this sequel at least relatively decent compared to the first onebr br unfortunately even with the addition of other good voice actors such as bebe neuwirth in the horrible role of anabelle this movie cannot be saved from the atrocious production values and animation skills or lack thereof present all over this movie horrible editing syncronization of the voices and flat out spaces where characters mouths should be moving to dialouge but are not combine to make this movie look like a college interns animation project instead of the decent sequel it could have beenbr br all in all id say unless you were a very big fan of the first movie id give this a very large pass
