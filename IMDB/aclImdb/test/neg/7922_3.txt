how could they take such a beautifully animated gem like don bluths all dogs go to heaven and bastardize it with a charmless cheesy uninspired sequel the haunting music and delightful characters are gone now replaced with tacky animation and an unimaginative plotbr br the pros charlie sheen is sometimes fun as charlie but he lacks the charming tough guy attitude that brought him to life by burt reynolds i did particularly enjoy the songs i will always be with you and its too heavenly herebr br the cons there seems to be no connection between this and the original in the beginning charlie is chums with carface but wait a minute isnt this the same character who was responsible for charlies murder and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved i guess that all changes in heaven but why isnt annemarie even mentioned if itchy makes it to heaven wouldnt flo and killer make it too what is with annabelle the whippets voice in the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel it sounds like a whiny bitchy parrot the new characters arent all that great except sasha and the animation is better compared to a generic saturday morning cartoon the constant cartoony humor is flat and unfunny and the heart just doesnt work when compare to the original which had such a moving unsubtle touch that makes me cry every timebr br all dogs go to heaven is one of my alltime favorite films how don bluth allowed this sequel to be made is beyond mebr br bottom line not all sequels go to heaven
