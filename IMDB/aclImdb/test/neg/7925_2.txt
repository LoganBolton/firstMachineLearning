this movie is so stupid that i want my 299 back that i paid for first this movie starts off with a bunch of wooden actor geeks with fill in talent like they got picked off the street somewhere because the real actors either did not show up because of the laughable script or they just couldnt get anybody desperate enough to do this movie the music in this movie is enough to put you to sleep flute music made for faeries dancing in the wilderness wouldnt even be good enough for this movie and the guy dressed up as satan looks like hes all dressed up in a kmart halloween special costume there are no dead scenes except a few lame scenes when i saw what the terrible killers looked like in those bath robes with nosferatu faces i just laughed this is what the whole town is supposed to be running away from once a year this movie is one of the worst demonic movies i have ever seen avoid this one
