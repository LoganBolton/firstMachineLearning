ok here is the deal i love action movies and generally have no problem suspending a great deal of disbelief over plot holes or other implausible actions however this movie went far beyond minor flaws and went straight to the ridiculous let me get this straight the police send a notorious gangster and cop killer along with a number of other prisoners on a bus with a grand total of two guards they then are forced to stop at a precinct where precisely two cops are working one of which is a day away from retirement and the other is a burn out apparently the building was about to be shut down so somehow the police decided that everyone else in the entire precinct got the night off for new years eve right but wait it gets better gabriel byrne shows up to take out fishburne before he can rat him and other dirty cops out although we never find out anything about their relationship or dealings interestingly the cops launching the assault on the precinct are in full swat gear with night vision goggles assault rifles the whole nine yards later on they even bring in a helicopter with more people in full gear im not a cop but im pretty sure you cant just waltz out of the station with an entire swat platoon worth of equipment without someone asking what you are doing and the police helicopter in the supposedly terrible winter storm also no one near the precinct happens to hear or see this major siege going on with flash grenades and heavy rifle fire going off i mean seriously come on i know this is set in detroit but even there it would raise suspicion on a supposedly top secret mission i also love the fact that they find a tommy gun in the evidence room and somehow the gun still works and has bullets that are still intact and usablebr br i could live with some of these problems if there werent other glaring issues also for one the opening couple minutes of the movie are shot nicely in a very frenetic and hyperactive way and i thought was going to set the tone for the rest of the movie unfortunately i was wrong the remainder of the film has no sense of pacing or tension or drama the characters dont relate to each other in any way which is probably largely due to the fact that they arent particularly interesting there isnt enough interesting action to make this a good action movie and there isnt enough character developmentstorytelling to make this a passable thrillerdrama the relationship between hawkefishburn is the only thing that the director even tries to make interesting or intense oh and by the way the final scene in the wilderness uh i thought this was in the middle of a run down industrial section of detroit and suddenly we are in the woods the acting isnt terrible in this movie it is just that the directing and writing are atrocious i really enjoy some of hawkes fishburne byrne dennehys other movies but this one is terrible
