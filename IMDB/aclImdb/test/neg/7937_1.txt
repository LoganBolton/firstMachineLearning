is it just me or is this an awful film im going with its an awful filmbr br knowing full well that its a guy flick usually defined as full of car chases crashes gunfights explosions etc i still expect some small degree of credibility if i cant somehow believe in the premise the film will not work thus we come to the problem with assault on precinct 13br br not one for spoilers i never report details of the plot however i will make an exception here because the plot is so inane bad guy is jailed in precinct 13 bad guys buddies want to bust him out surprise the bad guys buddies are actually corrupt cops brooding troubled but heroic young cop saves the day while romancing the girl ugh yes it really is that simple and that dumbbr br assault on precinct 13 takes place in detroit not a bad setting for crime and corruption i spent 3 months there in late 2004 so i know what im talking about even so its outrageously violent and insulting to the police and the citizens of detroit i have spent a lot of time in downtown detroit but i cannot imagine how the final chase wound up in the downtown detroit forest i must have missed itbr br there are no refunds for watching bad movies save your money there were too many good films in 2005 to waste even 300 at blockbuster on this onebr br final rating 1br br only because i have seen worse films
