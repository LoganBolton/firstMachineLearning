i am a huge fan of the original assault on precinct 13 the ice cream scene haunts me to this day im 33 now and i still remember being horrified by it as a child when i heard they were remaking it i thought it might be good but when i saw the film its 100 not the same film its not a remake its a bad stolen idea it was completely ruined the cast maria bello laurence fishburne ethan hawke gabriel burne john leguizamo and drea de matteo are all great actors but even they couldnt save this film it was just wrong even the setting was completely opposite and how in the hell did no one in that city notice that there was a war going on next door why didnt help show up sooner stupid no sense
