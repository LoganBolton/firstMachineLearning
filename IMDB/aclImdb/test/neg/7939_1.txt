this was perhaps the worst movie ive seen in a long long time forget that its clear no research was done regarding detroit forest in downtown detroit bwahaha the writing was horrible the premise completely implausible and quite frankly the characters were embarrassing i cannot for the life of me understand why seasoned actors would stoop to such a low and participate in something this god awful now i have never seen the original and dont know if this movie pays tribute to its original form its my understanding that the original was not set in detroit why they would deviate from that without researching details about the setting only tells me that it was more than the cast that was looking to pay the rent br br dont waste your time on this junk unless youre from detroit and wish for some comic relief
