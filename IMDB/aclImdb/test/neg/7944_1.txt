i dont think its necessary to outline the plot for you because the site and other users have done a superb job of that already that said heres my take this is by far the worst movie of 2005 and there have been some really really bad ones i dont even need to go into detail because there is nothing redeeming about this movie bad acting bad plot bad directing bad special effectsyou name it if it doesnt stand alone as the worst film ever made its tied with some other piece of crap id be embarrassed to have my friends know i was in this movie but hey most people that are gonna see it will do so no matter what reviews it gets so more power to ya when you feel the gaping void between your neurons two hours into your evening dont blame me
