los angeles 1976 indie film brat john carpenter fresh out of film school and with one film  his class projects nobudget spoof of 2001 called dark star  under his belt finishes a gritty actioner called assault on precinct 13 the story of an almost deserted police station under siege by an unseen la gang it was a minor hit on the drivein circuit and garnered small praise from the few critics who cared but it hardly set the film world on fire unlike carpenters followup smash halloween 1978 on precinct carpenter was still learning how to exploit his almost nonexistent budget by using lowershelf actors keeping the action to the one hellishly small location and moving the film along at a tight pace with a combination of editing intelligent camera work and switchedon genre savvybr br noone wants or needs to be hungry in hollywood anymore particularly if the weeks catering bill on the 2005 version of assault on precinct 13 is more than the entire cost of the original it does translate into a certain kind of laziness on a filmmakers part  you have a stupidly large union crew a studio and a marketing firm all doing your thinking for you which is why twenty years after watching carpenters film i can still see every glorious moment from the small girl gunned down in cold blood while buying an ice cream to the relentless pounding synth score a week after assault 2005 i remember larry fishburnes unmoving ping pong ball eyes and little elsebr br forgettable popcorn actioner fits the top of the poster perfectly its new years eve at precinct 13 a station closing down with a skeleton staff to see in its final hours on call is jake roenick ethan hawke an exnarc now deeply troubled and hopped up on jack daniels and seconol after his partners were iced in the opening scene iris the sopranos drea de matteo a nympho with a thing for criminal types and jasper brian dennehy a crusty old timer one scotch away from retirement as in carpenters assault a bus with four heavyduty criminals is rerouted to the precinct all boozy eyes are on gangster kingpin bishop fishburne still beefedup from his time in the matrix who has narrowly survived an assassination attempt from an undercover cop and plans to blow the lid on the endemic corruption in the organized crime unit led by marcus duvall a tiredlooking gabriel byrne soon the phones are out the power lines are down and both crims and police find themselves heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and consumed with paranoia while waging war against a task force of duvalls corrupt cops sporting white balaclavas bullet vests infrared bazookas and more hightech gear than the skywalker ranch this were expected to believe as the helicopters buzz around the top of the police station shooting rockets into windows is a clandestine operation to cover duvalls tracks he may as well have taken out billboards on hollywood boulevardbr br as with the recent seventies genre reworking dawn of the dead assault 2005 takes the barest plot essentials of john carpenters original and to quote the seventies does its own thing man the main question is  why bother john carpenters 1976 is a cult favorite among genre buffs but is hardly branded in the publics collective consciousness carpenter himself was busy reworking howard hawks classic western rio bravo into a tight claustrophobic urban thriller for only 20000 french wunderkind director and rap producer jeanfrancois richet a selfprofessed fan of john carpenters work seems less concerned with making an homage to either hawks or jc  although the script is peppered with references to cowboys and injuns  and seems intent on squeezing in as much flash and firepower as the multimillion dollar budget can withstand the result some tense moments with handheld pov cameras an unexpectedly high and bloody body count a few neat plot twists but essentially a bgrade urban actioner with a much inflated price tag as for namechecking carpenter its pure conceit on the part of the filmmakers that doesnt pay offbr br to monsieur richet i say bon voyage and i wish you luck on your music career
