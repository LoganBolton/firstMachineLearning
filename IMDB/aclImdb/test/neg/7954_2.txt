what about scream baby scream is supposed to make me not feel like a fool for buying it i bought it because god help me im a sucker for old bcinema even as worthless as this nonetheless something about this movie irritates me its probably janet janet comes off cold  snooty seemingly with the intention of coming off as deep and noble with a look on her face that screams constipation she cant seem to agree to anything her uptight boyfriend wants im glad that this is her only role what really irritates me is that this is a 1960s gore film gone terribly awry and as we all know awry is floridian for zero gore its like the director started with a herschell lewis style but backed out of the gore scenes when his wife found out so instead we end up with one dull conversation after the other and basically a whole lot of irritating nothing in other words we end up with florida bore joseph adler should be embarrassed janets boyfriend jason is almost as ridiculous as she is this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything come to think of it hes probably the least likable good guy in horror history the only thing this movie really has going for it is that it carries that 60searly 70s bgore vibe that you can find in stuff like undertaker  his pals blood freak or most anything from herschell lewis even rodney from the gruesome twosome is in this i ithought his caveman comedy routine was irritating most everything from reel to reel is stupid even the trip scene was stupid the only positive thing at all is the small amount of beach scenery but that mostly includes janet whining about life not being perfect in the only real ironic twist scream baby scream gets even less interesting once the story finally gets started around the 45 minute mark if you happen to be indifferent to whether or not your entertainment is watchable but are offended by the color red you might not hate this why does troma distribute this wouldnt this be something weird videos area scream baby scream very well may be the worst in florida horrorgore of its era but i suppose underneath the unlikeable characters and the incoherent plot lies potential scream baby scream really just seems like it should follow the blood feast pattern so to steal a quote from janet if it doesnt fit i throw it out 210
