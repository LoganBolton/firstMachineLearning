before you dismiss my post as not getting it let me sayim one of the biggest richard kelly and the twilight zone fans out there donnie darko is one my alltime favorites and i even thought southland tales had its moments im a huge scifi fan i was very excited to see the box couldnt wait for it to come outbr br having said thatthe box is terrible behind drag me to hell this was the worst movie ive seen in 2009 and it just simply will not end whenever you think youve reached the end another change in the plot and youre off to more torture i was actually groaning in the theater by the end of the filmi could hardly take it anymorebr br the biggest problem with the box no matter how you slice it or try to justify it is that it simply makes little sense trust me i got it i understood what was going on but that doesnt mean it makes a lot of sense looking back on it take the basics for example the main couplecameron diaz and james marsden playing norma and arthur lewis diaz loses her finances at her job then bemoans to her husband that they are living paycheck to paycheck well sell that fing porsche your husband is driving then they live in a beautiful 2story house in a nice subdivision marsden is working what seems to be a highpaid job at nasa and diaz is an accomplished teacher and yes marsden drives an overly expensive car but they are somehow living paycheck to paycheck no need to press the button just cut down your highpriced lifestyle a bit the movie would have worked better if they showed the couple jobless and in serious debt instead they are seemingly desperate for moneyall the while living what i would call a luxurious lifestyle like i saidyou can understand whats going on yet it still makes little sense thats a rare combinationbr br there was an awful scene in a library that i feel will go down as one of the worst segments in movie history terribly acted too by the way it was idiotic illogical and out of place i cant even begin to fully describe it actually so i will move onto a subplot that involves nosebleeds and body possession by aliens yes im being serious unfortunately a kid is in diazs class with a wicked and smile on his face a sinister smile that seemingly goes by completely unnoticed by everyone in authority at the school he starts asking diaz personal questions literally embarrassing her in front of her class no punishment is given to the kid whatsoeverhe didnt even get asked to stay after class for a talk then diaz is at a partyand the same kid is one of the hired helpironed shirt apron and all i dont know many alienpossessed kids who appear to be in junior high that also moonlight as a busboy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officialsbut we found one here see what i meanyou can understand it completely but it still makes no sensea rare combo like many things in the movie the kid comes and goesno real explanation about him no ending to his character moving on a lady then approaches diaz in a grocery store telling her that experiments are being ran secretly and her family is one of the test subjects wellhmmmif aliens possess the powers where they can take over a body remotelyand the aliens dont want to help diazthen who was taking over this ladys body and giving diaz advice againthe lady was trying to help diazand the aliens werent interested in helping diazso who the hell was controlling her body never explained never talked about again no nothing it goes on and on and on like this for what seemed to me like 2 weeks it would not end i wonder if this movie underwent a massive reshoot at some point it was poorly edited diazs accent was there one minute gone the next subplots began but never ended the numerous pushbacks of the release date obviously shows the problems the producers had with the finished product its truly a trainwreckbr br pass on this onetheres no redeeming value in it whatsoever 3 out of 10 just because i like diaz and scifi but it probably deserves a 1 out of 10br br thanks for reading br br jd
