if theres one thing i want to distinguish myself from all the other great reviewers here its that i am the queen of finding strange movies in thrift and dollar stores that said you cant possibly imagine how happy i was when i found this one br br i can even remember that saturday morning when every station simulcast it so you were stuck if you wanted to watch something else then again i guess that was the idea as a kid i didnt know if i liked the way all the different characters were stuck together there are some crossovers that just do not work but i guess the special had its intended effect dont do drugs because you will have nightmares about the muppetsbr br now if you watch this as an adult on the other hand you will be treated to the strangest antidrug movie this side of reefer madness i think ill just leave it at that before i get into trouble
