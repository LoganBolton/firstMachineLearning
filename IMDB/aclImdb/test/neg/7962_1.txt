this film spends a lot of time preaching against marijuana however the plot and visuals are so insane that it seems more like the posterchild for lsdbr br plot the heroic struggle of michael as he battles his drug addiction while being subjected to the humiliation brought on by the likes of winnie the pooh and papa smurfbr br yea yea theres a good message but its obscured by the fact that the writers have taken a rather stale psa idea and tried stretching it into 30 minutes this includes a song sequence where youre told that theres a million rational ways to say no such as i cant smoke pot i have homeworkbr br the writers cant make up their minds what to do with the characters theyve brought in royaltyfree at first we see they all have to hide from the human characters but within five minutes we see them all running around in plain sight without anyone noticing soon they begin interacting with the human cast and the only one whos even slightly disturbed by this fact is not the drugabusers its the little sister who talks to her teddy bear pooh by the way further theres the little drug demon floating around because you know pushers dont give kids drugs he too is ambiguous  while he might be symbolic of michaels addiction and hence is not supposed to be seen by other people he laters goes and haunts little corey to get her into drugs so i guess hesuhhhmoving onbr br the whole plot finally culminates in some insane sequence in which michael is in what would appear to be the saturday morning carnival of souls aka a theme park from hell where the various cartoon characters beat him up and ignore him and stuff for example miss piggy eats him in a sandwich and spits him out if the writers were not high when writing this i must recommend they try getting high because they cant get crazier than this of course the film ignores the fact that michaels been having highs for two years by this point so why this tripping sequence would frighten him is beyond mebr br i realize im completely whaling on this film but i actually just saw it again because i went through the trouble of tracking it down on ebay because of its sheer infamy of being a bad cartoon the level of unintentional humor is is brilliant take this scene for example  michaels dad is rooting through the fridge for a beer he notices many of them missing and mentions it to his wife the everobservant mom tells him dont worry you probably just drank them last night watching football while were obviously supposed to be learning that michael is drinking beer in addition to the pot and crack we instead read further in and realize  hey kids its okay to have chemical dependencies as long as youre a grownup scenes like this are worth the tiny price tag of this film oh yea and the fact you get to hear simon the chipmunk say marijuana
