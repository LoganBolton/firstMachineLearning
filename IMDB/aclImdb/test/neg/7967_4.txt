this is unique in films of hitchcocks that ive seen in that i didnt really enjoy itbr br in fact i actually found this quite predictable and annoyingbr br cary grant and joan fontaine are a newly married couple hes the kind of lovable rogue character that youve seen in many films without ever being lovable as far as i am concernedbr br in fact it was a barely believable relationship at best and at times seemed particularly false and implausiblebr br unable to hold down a job and trying to live an opulent lifestyle grant is led to borrow money that he cannot pay backbr br fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her in order to get the money she is insured for and presumably what her late father was worthbr br average and rather uninteresting all round actually but as usual you can see the influence on films that have come at a later date
