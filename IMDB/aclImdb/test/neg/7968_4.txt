lina mclaidlaw is a bright solitary young women who falls unexpectedly in love with johnnie aysgarth a highly eligible bachelor with a penchant for losing money they get married but almost at once lina is subjected to johnnies addiction to lying gambling and getting into debt despite his flaws she is unable to resist his charming manner until she starts to suspect he may be harbouring murderous thoughts toward her br br this is a good movie wellmade with an attractive cast a good script and possibly the single lousiest ending in movie history okay thats maybe going too far but not by much lots of films change the ending of a book great expectations the shining etc but the last two scenes of this one not only manage to be horribly lame but also render the entire preceding plot completely meaningless the story is about a woman whose husband is driven by his greed and moral lacking  and what she knows about him  to kill her it should end as it does in francis iles  anthony berkeleys book before the fact with him attempting to murder her the reason it doesnt is that the studio forced hitch to reshoot the ending one of the first examples of the godawful process of preview audience testing hitch was canny and did what he was told this was only his third film in hollywood knowing that if he played the game sooner or later he would gain creative control of his films evinced by his masterpieces of the fifties but that still leaves us with a turkey of an ending this is a great shame because it really is a very good movie with an intriguing theme  does anyone really know their husband or wife that well  the script is excellent with many offguard moments such as when linas father dies and johnnie assumes shes crying about it a finelyjudged performance by grant who never played a villain again and fine photography throughout culminating in the famous glassofmilk shot fontaine won an oscar for this performance although personally i prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her earlier victimised wife role in rebecca i would like to rate this movie higher but i really cant forgive that ending this is what happens when movies are made for money not love which i guess is curiously the theme of the film itself look fast for hitchcocks cameo as a man posting a letter
