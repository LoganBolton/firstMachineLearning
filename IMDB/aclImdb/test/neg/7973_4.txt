when kristy swanson gets an attack of the guilts about what she does she wants out unfortunately madsen is her immediate superior in a company where giving two weeks notice aint an optionbr br as a teen killing vampires kristy did a very good job the valley girl image seemed to fit but as an assassin on the runwell keep running kristy run run far away this film is not a concept that hasnt been done before but it has been done betterbr br i didnt want to watch the rest of this film but i felt i should if i wanted to give a review of this movie ive always liked madsen and his character was a bit predictable but this movie was definitely a waste of time both to watch and makeno wonder it never got released theatrically
