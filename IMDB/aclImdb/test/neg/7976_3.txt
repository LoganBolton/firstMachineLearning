supreme sanction is a movie about a female assassin who works for the us government she has to kill a known tv reporter but spares his life when she sees that he has a little daughter because she hasnt killed him she becomes the next target of her employersbr br the script isnt good although ive seen worse bmovies a hitman with remorse the government killing innocent people in the name of fighting terror whats next aliens rescuing the victim no supreme sanction will never win any award because of the script and the acting isnt any better im afraid a few better known actors michael madsen and kristy swanson who clearly had a lot of bills to pay and therefor accepted to play in this movie together with some other actors who probably dont even know what a camera really looks like dont do any good to the movie eitherbr br so why should you watch this movie well if you havent got anything better to do but to watch some action flick and you are tired of the 10531st rerun of mc gyver or the ateam than this might be the movie you want to see otherwise you better leave it alone i give it a 310
