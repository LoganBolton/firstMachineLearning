this was my very first bollywood movie and i found it in the same way many other recent viewers did  through ghost world having done a little bit of reading up on the film industry of bollywood this week i understand somewhat why there are seemingly unrelated musical numbers and romance and comedy in a horror film but something for everyone doesnt always add up to a cohesive productbr br the ultragroovy musical dance number jaan pehechaan ho has captivated the world in a way it probably could not have done in 1965 its all over the internet now with many folks scrambling for a good english translation laxmi chhaya does an amazing job dancing take after take making it all look fresh new and fun even when any normal person would be exhausted she rules br br on the beach with miss kitty is a lightweight fun and pretty tune in total contrast to the horror plot still i find myself singing it in hindi a week later i found a rough translationbr br if you want to live in this life then listen to what i say leave your sorrows behind and join the party take my advicebr br those who want to live live with laughter and singing let your hair down and relax people of this world what do you know come to me and ill explainbr br whoever there is who will see me will stop worrying in this world fish swim freely here and therebr br my second favorite number in the film is the butlers dream where mehmood is entranced by miss kittys dancing the electric tikilike idols are just wonderfully tacky as is the entire set of this number online id seen it described as what would happen if liberace threw up way funbr br gumnaam is not a good movie as a whole thats why i gave it a rating of 3 its actually a real stinker of a film with some fun kitschy musical numbers that have nothing really to do with the murder plot
