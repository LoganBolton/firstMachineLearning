produced by international playhouse pictures it looks as if filmed in a doll house everybodys a liar everything is dreamlike toylike for no good reason im not saying everything in all movies should be totally realistic but such unbelievable fantasy things and situations in one movie are way too much how did they get these fine actors actresses particularly to this movie its nice to see mia again if we were meant to understand why her husband wants to kill her mia does do it well not funny not moving just fake stephen dorff briefly appears at the end fitting for a play maybe less for a movie but this isnt one to measure things at terrible
