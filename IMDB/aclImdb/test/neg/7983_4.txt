there isnt much about reckless that feels right beginning with the offputting title thanks to screenwriter craig lucas who adapted his own play bringing the title along with him and continuing with the casting mia farrow playing wife to tony goldwyn whos young enough to be her son the couple live in an idyllic winter world that appears to be the inside of a snowglobe but farrow gets a startling dose of reality after he admits hes hired a man to kill her she flees into the night taking refuge with a very strange couple who want to help her rebuild her life the production design and art direction of reckless are fine but they are services rendered for a completely inane often alienating screenplay its supposed to be a dark holiday comedy though the cast is at a loss with this unfunny occasionally offensive material 12 from
