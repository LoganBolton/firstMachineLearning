oh my god i was so expecting something more entertaining than this when i downloaded this movie seeing as 1903 was one of my fave years for movies ever but it sucked the plot although id hesitate to call it that is about some dumb elephant it slowly makes its way onto some platform and gets electrocuted to death lame even for a short film the plot was too thin to keep my attention edison is like the worst director ever plus the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever and the ending wow that wasnt predictable at all sarcasmbr br the picture quality is horrible too you can barely tell whats going on most of the time the only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other unscary horror flicks this didnt spawn eleven sequels other than that this is a complete waste of money and 1 minute of your life youll never get back
