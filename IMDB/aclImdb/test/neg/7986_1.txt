thomas edison may have done lots of great inventions but wtf is this i am sorry but this movie is simply awful the plot is that this elephant walks to a certain point  gets electrocuted okay the picture quality looked like someone used it for toilet paper i thought that the early charlie chaplin films were awful okay thomas edison may have been an inventor but why did he make this film he could have filmed a baby being fed  it would have been better people might say im being harsh on the times but would you enjoy something like this from what i have said edison may have made the lightbulb but why did he make this particular movie well i might sound like a complete ahole but watch this on youtube then you will see this abomination i still cant believe this film is completely awful all in all the worst short film i have ever seenbr br rating 110
