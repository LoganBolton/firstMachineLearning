i know that so many reviews on imdb are extreme with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or inarticulately tearing it to pieces i find neither of these kind of reviews helpful and so i do not give this film the awful review i am about to lightly the film is arthouse sciencefiction of the worst kind dressed up as a hollywood blockbuster the trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot but is actually just a tiny part of a wilfully baffling series of events which are never properly resolved i like films which challenge the viewer and i do not need to be spoonfed a plot and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow no  the film is just terrible as the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on cameron diazs wooden acting and a faltering plotline avoid
