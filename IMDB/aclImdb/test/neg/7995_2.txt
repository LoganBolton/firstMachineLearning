terrible action movie in which lead franco nero exchanges his cowboy hat gun belt and the coffin he dragged around in django 1966 for an allwhite ninja outfit with all the snazzy paraphernalia that goes with it despite virtually nonstop action the film is utterly clich√©d and unintentionally funny  with a campy villain to boot in christopher george susan george no relation is the attractive woman with a washedup husband neros wartime companion whom the villains are trying to push off her oilrich land  but the latter havent counted upon neros martialarts and stuntheavy gymnastics the solution to their problems is to hire a similarlyskilled ninja for themselves who as it happens turns out to be neros deadly enemy played by sho kosugi who appeared in two more sequels and is currently engaged in another the climax takes place inside an arena where oneman army nero eliminates george and what has remained of his gang from previous confrontations the subtle way in which he despatches his nemesis however is effectively done
