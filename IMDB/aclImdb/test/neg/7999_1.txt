any person claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before hes seen it otherwise i cant explain this classic ninja movie titlebr br the fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable instead of casting franco nero as the ninja they could hire some experienced martial artist instead in any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie neros fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar his kicks and punches are lamebr br theres enough of old action movies with good action this is just a waste of time
