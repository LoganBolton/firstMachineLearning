no no no no no no no this is not a film this is an excuse to show people dancing this is just not good even the dancing is slow and not half as entertaining as the mediocre dirty dancing let alone any other good dance moviebr br is it a love story is it a musical is it a drama is it a comedy its not that this movie is a bit of all its that this movie fails at everything it attempts to be the film turns out to be even more meaningless as the film progressesbr br acting is terrible from all sides the screenplay is definitely trying to tell us something about relationship but fails miserablybr br watch for the moment  when patrick stewart enters the scene and you think the film might get better as he brightens up the dull atmosphere for a second
