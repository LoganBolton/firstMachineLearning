enter the ninja 1981 was the first of several ninja films produced by cannon starring or costarring japanese sensation sho kosugi but the star of the first ninja film was legendary tough guy franco nero sadly not even mr nero or sho kosugi couldnt make this film watchable when you have two bad dudes in an action film and its neither watchable or fun somethings amiss but i digress skip this chapter and watch the next films in the series theyre more interesting and a whole lot of funbr br next is revenge of the ninja instead of playing the evil oriental i use that term tongue in cheek mind you hes the star strange for a western film watch that one insteadbr br not recommended except for die hard sho kosugi fans or cannon film buffs
