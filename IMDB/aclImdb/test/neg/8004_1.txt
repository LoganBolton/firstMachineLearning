this film could of been a hell of a lot better if they didnt use brian conley as a gangster and if they didnt start the film with christopher bigginsbr br when i watched this film i had absolutely no idea what was going on there were too many double crosses and plot twists to make the film believable the film deserves a 0 but seeing as i there isnt a 0 i gave it a 1br br i wouldnt recommend this film to my worst enemy i would rather poke out my eyeballs with some rusty scissors than watch this film again im telling you that was an hour and a half of my life i wont get backbr br if you want to watch a gangster film dont get this watch going off big time or lock stock and two smoking barrels instead
