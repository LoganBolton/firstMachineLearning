i think that saying this film has too many is not what makes this film bad the twists are not the problem of the film the story is quite clever and could have been very cool if filmed right the major problems why everyone is complaining about the twists in the film is that the film is just not fascinating enough to make people follow them the film is badly shot at least in comparison to its genre brother lock stock worse the characters are although often well acted just plain flat the characters dont have enough time to be introduced well enough to let the viewer get involved with a single one of them let alone understand them oh and the locations are just terrible locationsperson i didnt bother to watch the credits for your name  get another job maybe still photography or interior design
