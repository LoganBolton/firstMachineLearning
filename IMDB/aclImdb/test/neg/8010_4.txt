years ago ma2412 the feature film tried to be some kind of regional blockbuster in austria one things for sure i hope no one outside will ever have to see this one perhaps if you are familiar with the original sitcom it could be interesting to watch what director sicheritz made of his series i think he missed his chance and wasted time and moneybr br so far many directors and writers have failed to make a series concept compatible to a 90min movie consider alf inspector gadget you can see how hard this is by watching ma 2412 the result of this attempt in my opinion tastes like a neverending tvepisode and not a good one it fails to deliver a plot the humor tries too hard and the directing seems very unfocused  as holds true for the visual stylebr br so summing up id clearly not recommend this one
