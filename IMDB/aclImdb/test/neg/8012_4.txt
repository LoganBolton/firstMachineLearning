im a fan of judy garland vincente minnelli and gene kelly but this movie just left me cold i was expecting another american in paris from minnelli so perhaps i was expecting too muchbr br the movie was short on songs and short of impressive dance numbers i was impressed by the very expressionistic kelly dance as mococo on the ship i was also impressed by the nicholas brothers in be a clown too bad the song was so annoying i also enjoyed judy attacking kelly with bricabrac check lorna lufts autobiography for some interesting information on that scenebr br actually the movie has what must be some of cole porters most annoying songs especially nina also judy and gene yell constantly like screechy childrenbr br the plot is thinwhich is par for the course for musicalsbut it is not saved by impressive dance numbers or by memorable songs i suspect the best parts of this movie were left on the cutting room floor please some movie restorer find those bits of film and show us what the movie could have been
