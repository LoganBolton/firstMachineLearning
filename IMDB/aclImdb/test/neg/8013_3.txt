well the movie has catherine zeta jones in it its a hallmark television movie its from a thomas hardy novel it has catherine zeta jones in it she is by far the only one in the movie who acts better than in my high school theater class oh yes it has clive owen in it im not british so that means almost as much as being a thomas hardy novel except he was in the bourne identity and i liked that that just about wraps it all up folks that really all there was im becoming repetitive but i do like czj so i stuck it out to the end the computer is telling me that i dont have 10 lines and i keep counting them i always count 11 but maybe it just doesnt like my style but that is my opinion of the movie too
