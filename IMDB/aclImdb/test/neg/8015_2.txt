i rented this because i couldnt pass up the chance to see prehollywoodfame clive owen and catherine zeta jones together but it definitely wasnt worth it the only reason i give it two stars instead of one is for the novelty of seeing them before they made it big across the pondbr br zeta jones who is usually fun to watch even if she isnt the greatest thesp in the world is awful owen seems really uncomfortable to be in such a turkey plus he wears a ridiculous egregiously illfitting chinlength wig at least i hope thats a wig and not his real hair and the scene where he dances a country jig with zeta jones just makes you embarrassed for him joan plowright walks around in a daze the whole movie  shes probably wondering how she got herself into such a messbr br the actress who plays clive owens wife isnt terrible but just about everyone else is oh and the writing stinks too
