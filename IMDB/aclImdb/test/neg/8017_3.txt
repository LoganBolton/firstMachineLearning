remember the wooden undramatic literary adaptations of the 1970s at their worst you will when you see this broadly acted unintentionally hilarious piece of chocolatebox adaptation most culpable of all is catherine zj who while undeniably easy on the eye substitutes swishing a big dress and looking sultry for actually turning in a performance played pofaced like a melodrama or cold comfort farm without the jokes this effort is not helped by a scriptwriter with a tin ear for dialogue who misses entirely the novels sense of irony or tragedy a shame given the quality of the acting talent on offer  joan plowright claire skinner steven macintosh all deserve better than this
