a couple of teenagers have a little sex on the beach in the 1960s thats all they say they are fifteen while one of the actors is really twentyfive maybe this movie was somewhat revolutionary in 1978 in its way of touching taboo topics but i cant imagine that at that time anything shown in esmiko limon was regarded as tabooishbr br shallow dialogues are mixed with disco music that is even shallower the selection of songs doesnt involve anything but the very very wellknown classics that are still heard on every second radio station today the plot of american pie is not much different but it is at least a little bit funny eskimo limon is dull flat and not aesthetic almost unbelievable that it had six sequels
