its funny one day before i have seen this movie i had been watching a documentary about leni riefenstahl so comparison kind of came automatically of course there isnt any br br  this movie is weak in every aspect acting is not convincing especially the one who plays simona and unnatural editing in confused and always leaves a taste of unfinished shot music doesnt fit the story doesnt flow it gets boring and the movie comes out much longer as it is oh and the characters arent very well shown you actually cant tell much about the girls except what you see the movie also tries to shock with explicit cursing which is very laughable br br so 210
