after hearing that some of the people behind the lowbudget flicks terror in rocknroll önsjön and it came from outer space and stuff were involved in making this movie i decided to buy it unseen on dvd i wish i hadnt the other movies were funny tongueincheek and kinda stupid while kraftverk 3714 is devoid of any humor at all and it is so godawful that im getting angry just thinking about it the worst actors possible the worst script possible the worst special effects available and the most unsexy sex scene ever uhhh and the whole thing goes on for 2 hours and 45 minutes please do not ever make another movie
