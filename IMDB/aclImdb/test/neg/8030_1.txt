its the one film i almost walked out of and would have if my friends hadnt been in the movie theatre with me normally even if i dont like a film i think its still worth sitting through it to the end that way you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself but with the million dollar hotel it was so dreadful i just badly wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible i think i probably would not have been so sourly disappointed if this film had been made by a lesser director one i didnt normally like so much but coming from wenders it was all the more shocking to behold i know bono from u2 a good friend of wenderss wrote the script to this abysmal film and i wonder why wenders let him as buddybuddy as the two may have been stick to the day job bono is a sentence that easily springs to mind whilst viewing this mess pretentious disjointed a mishmash of every possible contemporary film stereotype a naive and transparent attempt at coming across as kooky and daring with the most irritating characters i have ever set eyes upon especially the leads jeremy davies milla jovovich and mel gibson none of whom i dislike normally the happiest ending i could have wished for would have been for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on their collective heads so as to get it all over with as soon as possible on a positive note the first five minutes of the film are extremely good with an extremely stirring soundtrack from u2 but the films opening shots make the rest of the film which takes a spectacular nosedive from then on all the more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality thats just never delivered not even close
