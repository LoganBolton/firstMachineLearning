riccardo freda may have a good reputation but since we now that many of his best films were in fact directed by the late great mario bava its clear that he wasnt one of italys most gifted filmmakers back in the seventies this film pretty much proves that as despite the simplistic plot its a sprawling mess and overall id even have to go as far as to say that tragic ceremony is worse than fredas insipid giallo effort the iguana with the tongue of fire freda apparently disowned this movie and i certainly dont blame him the plot simply follows a bunch of kids that run out of petrol in the middle of nowhere they happen upon a house while searching for fuel but it turns out to be a bad choice as the owner is just about to conduct a satanic ceremonyho hum the film features a lead role for camille keaton who would go on to star in the exploitation classic i spit on your grave some years later but fails to make an impression here despite acting alongside a cast of talentless performers the film features one decent gore scene towards the end but this really isnt enough considering that it takes eighty minutes of tedium to get there i have a high tolerance for rubbish italian films that dont make sense  but even i couldnt stand this one miss it miss nothing
