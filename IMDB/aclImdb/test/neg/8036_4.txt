this lateish effort from freda plays as a modern day 70s that is gothic thriller but comes out short of thrills certainly its not a dreadfully bad film its jut got that feeling which many of fredas later films have of someone who has given up when hes seen the first dailys it starts out good enough almost giallo like in tone then takes a turn into gothic territories with a decent albeit terribly clich√© set up then suddenly freda seems to have lost interest in the film and all we get is prolonged shots of camille keaton and burning candles then circa an hour into the film we get some sort of violent climax with decenttopoor special effects this is followed by a slow paced outro with a very obvious twist ending if its even intended to be a twist and throw a few very halfhearted explanatory scenes along the way and you got tragic ceremony thus in parts its got its qualities but then suddenly stumbles and collapses in front of you a pitybr br btw stay away from the sharoma dvd a useless murky pan scan edition which kills of what could be a good visual experience
