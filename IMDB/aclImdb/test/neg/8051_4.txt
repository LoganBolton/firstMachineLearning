the kindred opens to shots of a porsche racing along a highway it catches up with an old pickup truck and gets held up as it speeds past the pickup the driver benjamin jperry as ben perry shouts obscenities and honks his horn distracted he doesnt notice an obstruction ahead and crashes his porsche he is quickly freed from the wreckage and is taken to hospital on the way the paramedic randy

seem to know each other harry asks jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw last time jackson punches harry to the floor and throws a bundle of money at him the film then makes it perfectly clear we are in san fransisco by showing a shot of the golden gate bridge sharon raymond is woken up by a phone call for her boyfriend dr john hollins david allen brooks to inform him that his mother amanda kim hunter who has recently had a heart attack has regained consciousness hollins works for a company called the geneticell corporation and is delighted at the news and heads off to see her once there she asks him to go back to his old childhood house in a small town called shelter cove and destroy all of her notes and experiments especially the anthony journals which hollins has never heard of she also claims that he has a brother named anthony back at geneticell hollins talks with a dr phillip lloyd rod steiger about his mother as they had both worked together before they had a falling out with each other and questions him about her research and if he knows of anyone called anthony he claims he knows nothing when amanda dies after a visit from the sinister dr lloyd hollins decides to carry out his mothers request and try to find out who anthony is while paying his final respects at the funeral a woman named melissa leftridge amanda pays introduces herself to hollins and says she was a big admirer of his mothers work and research after she helped her because melissa seems to know so much about his mothers work he invites her to the house as she may possibly be able to help find some answers to various questions he has hollins sharon melissa and three lab assistants brad baxter peter frechette hart phillips timothy gibbs and cindy russell julia montgomery plus a girl with a watermelon named nell valentine bunki z great name what were her parents thinking they get down to business straight away but find little of any interest for some reason no one at this point thinks to look in the basement which is just as well as theres something down there something large slimy and has lots of tentacles first it kills duke the dog then it moves on to larger prey when hart is attacked by something in a barn hollins decides he must destroy all traces of his mothers work and whatever anthony is jointly cowritten and directed by stepehn carpenter and jeffery obrow carpenter also acted as cinematographer and obrow as producer this is a pretty poor film in my opinion the script is credited to five writers carpenter obrow earl ghaffari john penny and joseph stefano and with five people working on it id like to think they could come up with something a little bit better and more coherent than this nothing is explained that well why did amanda create these monstrous sea creaturehuman hybrids what is dr lloyds interest and his motives why does he steal bodies from the back of ambulances why does he have a basement full of mutants why do none of these socalled genetic scientists think to check the basement out could melissa act more suspiciously even if she tried why are none of the characters given any background why do people keep mentioning a substance found in sea creatures called hemocynine when 999 of the audience isnt going to have clue what their on about there is also a serious lack of blood and gore only one person dies on screen just one and all the scientists survive in a vomit inducingly mushy happy ending this is a horror film guys all we want to see is the slimy monsters kill and eat people in various gory ways the one on screen death is actually quite cool someone has slimy tentacles inserted under their skin in their ear and up their nose in the films only decent horror sequence to try and up the gore quotent there is a scene where dr lloyd is experimenting on a skinned animal but it only lasts for a few seconds and in the context of the rest of the film doesnt mean a thing melissa also turns into a fish dont ask theres no nudity either which isnt a surprise the film looks professional enough with decent production values but is just so dull and plods along at a snails pace we dont even get to see the giant monster in the basement until 15 odd minutes before the end which is far too little far too late when it does make an appearance the effects are ok and that makes it even more of a shame that it wasnt used more overall i was very disappointed and i was expecting a lot better a horror film with only one on screen death and only three in total whats the world coming too
