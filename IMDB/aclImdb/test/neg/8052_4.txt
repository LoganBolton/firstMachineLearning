i first watched kindred in 1987 along with another movie called devouring waves i remember back then i hated them both and i have never really bothered to watch them againbr br however i have recently started a crusade to collect as many 80s horror titles in their original boxed form that have been deleted for some time i have got myself quite a proud collection with many more titles on my listbr br the kindred although i have not as yet got a copy is high priority as all the old movies i didnt like back then i now own and have now rewatched and think they are brilliant and the bits i do remember of the kindred are now driving me to want to get hold of a copy asapbr br hurray for the 80s and long live horror
