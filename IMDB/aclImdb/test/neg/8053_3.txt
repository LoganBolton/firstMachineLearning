director todd verows unexpected turn into sentimental comingout drama yields a predictable result nothing new to see here attractive but unconvincing leads  these 20somethings are supposed to be in high school  dribbling out banalities about confused adolescent sexuality doesnt strike me as the best way to explore the promise of anonymous which was equally selfinvolved but also honest raw and by comparison not all that maudlin i have no idea what to make of this drab and uninspiring movie other than to hope that verow finds another career sure its unpretentious but sos mike huckabeebr br no single attribute however is as awful as jim dwyers chintzy electronic score which grates nonstop walltowall for the full length of this movie if id seen this and heard this in a theatre i would have walked out thankfully on my laptop i could scrub and hit mute
