drab dreary and a total waste of my time the plot is incomprehensible so dont think about it too much the acting is odd and wooden  i would have sworn that they were all professional body builders trying their luck at acting but that might be an insult to body builders there are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster but lots of fires explosions a gratuitous sex scene etc the only thing that caught my attention was that it takes place after a war between the us and iraq that somehow goes nuclearhmmm is roger corman psychic lets hope that iraq was just a lucky choice for corman and that the rest of his scenario doesnt come true br br
