first thing i note is the music its nothing as amazing as ruggero deodatos cannibal holocausts haunting theme or the masterpiece waltz from a tale of two sisters but i dont let that stop me so early in the filmbr br one must assume that the woman researching her hypothesis for her phd dissertation that cannibalism as a organized practice has never existed one would think they must take into the consideration that they are wrong and prepare for the trip accordingly right or why go at all if you already believe the hypothesis to be true before even being tested thats fairly unbelievably ignorant and makes the movie seem that much more unrealistic and badly scriptedbr br that actually is similar to the ruggero deodatos film just totally illprepared no guns no decent hiking clothing just nonsense through and throughbr br people dont go on trips like this for college without months of planning and preparationbr br but i digressbr br things dont get off to a very good start for our brave yet stupid adventurers as they swerve to miss a jaywalking iguana and their decoy pet ferret falls out of the truck nearly to its demise then to fall into a mud hole well i guess its time to walkbr br okay then they flip a coin to see whether they keep going or forget the whole thing how does that scene even make any sense all their conviction rests on the flip of a coin after they mustve spent time and money and preparation just getting out there this just keeps getting worse defiinitely some of the worst acting and scripting and music ever concocted for the film industrybr br mike talks about how he and his friends were captured by the cannibals and put into cages in mud pits with 3 inch long leeches sucking on their blood i found that interesting because if you remember the first cannibal they run into in the jungle a man they mistake as a simple native is sitting on the ground eating such leeches wonder if they are the same ones really though this movie is just terrible because the script is horrible and the acting is emotionless considering the content they just agree to off themselves rather then get eaten by cannibals like its no big decisionbr br obviously mike is insane but just like in the first movie they treat the natives with such terrible behavior its simply unrealisticbr br ruggero deodatos movie easily feels the americans got what they deserved while in this movie one can hardly blame the natives for what befalls the americans yet againbr br and because of that the movie feels somewhat pointless we already got the point from the first movie so why was the sequel made the lieutenants name is rizzo could it get any worse oftentimes with movies such as these when you look up the cast you find they havent really acted in much other films and their bios are all but non existent so you can imagine i was surprised to find giovanni lombardo radice in this movie who was in scorseses gangs of new york now lt rizzo looked familiar and i found he was in the 2002 movie spiderman as a very tiny role as a tugboat captain reminds me of how william shatner went from being the admiral on the uss enterprise to a cop in a car irony sometimes irony works out shatner never could get the music right until his recent album has been which is really good just like bono of u2 never could get a haircut right and dan marino never could win no superbowlsbr br sometimes irony is just sad like christopher reeve superman cant walk irony the man will always be a legend though because he was such a great guy i digress yet again thoughbr br at this point you can tell im fairly bored of even discussing cannibal feroxbr br cannibal holocausts message was about who are the real savages and what is truly evil what the savages do in natural living unknown to our moral records or what we do to others with malicious intent cannibal feroxs message seems to be be careful what you go looking for for you just might find it i will say this for cannibal ferox when gloria comes back and writes her dissertation asserting that cannibalism does not exist she saves others who would be curious and go where angels fear tread but overall this movie was really badbr br 10
