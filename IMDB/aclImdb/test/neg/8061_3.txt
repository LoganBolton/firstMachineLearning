one of the most notorious of the banned video nasties of the 1980s is also one of the most excessively overhyped make them die slowly is about what youd expect from an umberto lenzidirected jungle potboilerÂ–inventive yet poorly rendered native torture techniques some ridiculous social commentary yes even sillier than cannibal holocaust and lots of guts being chewed the films exploitative violence though is often only shown in brief closeup and never dwelt on for very long which diminishes its effect interpret that how you may the dialog is lenzis usual silliness as our male heroes show their affection for females by calling them twt and the like the cast of familiar faces including lorraine de selle giovanni lombardo radice zora kerowa and robert kerman does their best in the face of the escalating idiocy including a completely ludicrous castration preservation but cannot save this overworked lousy effort
