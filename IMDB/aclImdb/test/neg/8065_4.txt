this film is much the same as cannibal holocaust if it werent for the needless animal killing in the name of shock ooh look at us were hardcore weve added real death to our films these films would make their way onto my dusty classics shelf  im a huge fan of cannibal films and zombies but as it stands its another example of shock horror clutching at the last straws of the pile in a desperate effort to make a poor film generate more hype to sum up a crusty gore flick with limited appeal a fan of 70s gore should give this a try but anyone with modern ethics and tastes should pick something a little better written for their popcornfest
