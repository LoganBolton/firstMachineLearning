this movie was quite a mess there wasnt anything really going for it the only character that had any appeal was bobbie phillips maya and she wasnt even worth itbr br the plot is standard doublecross the doublecrossing doublecrosser with a few too many double crosses to make any sense sometimes that means it keeps you guessing in this case it keeps you waiting by the end i just wanted everyone to get thrown in jail or shot
