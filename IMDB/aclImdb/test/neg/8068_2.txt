so if a guy meets you and he says i want you to look at my erection dont be alarmed maybe he wants you to look at the film he made about how his house was to be built yes thats the only thing what happens in this movie its like the worst warholian beep i ever saw its like filming the inside of your toilet before you flush it in fact its less interesting to look at than thatbr br but if you do watch lennons erection be warned that he put a lot of background noise in it too i mean really its as if the building is being attacked by space mutants from hell or something in the meanwhile the building in progress is growing up as an erection can do too in almost 20 minutes what an accomplishmentbr br so if someone does ask you to watch his erection be sure he wants to videotape it all
