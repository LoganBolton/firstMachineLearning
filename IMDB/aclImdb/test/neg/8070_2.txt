rollerskating vampires im sorry but even for the 80s thats just way too cheesy to be remotely scary you can excuse the original the odd kitsch moment because it was parodying old movies and tv shows but thats been done once so the sequel needed to be a little less camp not even more outlandish plus the first movie had the presence of chris sarandon  a man who could even make stalking discotheques in casual knitwear seem seductive  that this one sorely lacks so there was no danger in anything that happened it just seemed sillybr br admittedly i only saw this once when i was 7 but by then already being a huge fan of the original i remember being disgusted to me there is no sequel to fright night just a tacky spoof that doesnt deserve any appraisal whatsoever
