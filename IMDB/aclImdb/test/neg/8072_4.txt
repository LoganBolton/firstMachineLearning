cuore sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired with a script that the screenwriters for touched by an angel might have passed up as being too impuissant ozpetek still keeps us interested at times in fact i wanted to focus on the positives but i found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that i think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate onesbr br this movie is at heart pun intended a story built on a big twiststyle ending this kind of tenuous foundation can result in a tremendous success like tornatores una pura formalità or godawful garbage like the films of m night shyamalan cuore sacro falls somewhat closer to the latter i found the cinematography in general to be above average the tracking shots of irene dutifully doing her quotidian laps in the pool were very impressive as was the atmosphere conjured by the interior of her mothers house for me the grotesque parody of michelangelos pieta when giancarlo comes in from the rain and irene poses with him was a bit of a stretch one big issue that i took exception to in this film was ozpeteks method of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions taking place this worked to fantastic effect in facing windows but when employed here it seems that bubolova is no mezzogiorno in fact besides the ridiculous story the main problem with this film is the milquetoast performance of its main character it made the final breakdown scene even more unconscionably bad br br in this movie ozpetek continues his crusade against our corporatedriven societies by urging us to be more spiritual not necessarily religious and more altruistic and while im certainly one who is very sympathetic to this view i felt as if the audience was being hit over the head with a blunt object could the characters have been anymore twodimensional i tended to find this movie very enervating and soulless was the evil aunt eleonora anything more than a caricature it goes for the people on the side of right too like the good aunt maria clara and the elderly doorman aurelio and just in case we might have missed ozpeteks point he decided to clothe his opposing forces in their own liveries br br this brings me to an interesting point about the directors use of color he clothes the opening couple who briefly take flight in all black as well as irene when we first meet her and after her lifeconversion the evil aunt eleonora and of course the good but confused padre carras black is a color that suggests a definite course the wearers mind is set and emotionless it is the color of choice for that indispensable item of modern day armor the business suit it is also the color of mourning such as the funerary finery sported by the suicidal duo finally black is the color of piety such as the simple robes of priests and nuns that irene emulates in the second half of the film br br the other main color and a very appropriate choice for a movie about the sacred heart is red it is a color that has an extreme inherent emotional component the character who wears red is bold emotional receptive to new ideas and indulgent red is a risky color in modern times it challenges our perceptions of the wearer and at the same time makes the wearer vulnerable yet red carries an enormous weight of history and mysticism as the earliest members of cromagnon man buried their dead in red ochre and indeed the first man named in the torah adam is named after the hebrew word for red red also has an anachronistic flavor looking back on the past where red and by association a less selfdriven attitude towards life was more accepted so when we encounter the redfilled room the mysterious frieze covered walls complete with a red accented menorah and a red painting of a whirling dervish of irenes mother good characters maria clara and aurelio wearing resplendent outfits of red and finally the painting of irenes mother in a formal red gown we can see where ozpeteks sympathies liebr br a word or two about the soundtrack i found the original musical themes to be excellently suited to the story the quasibaroque theme that signified irene was great for its monotony and feeling of restive malaise the absolute best use of a constantly repeated baroque theme such a this would have to be in kubricks barry lyndon with its masterful repetitions of an 8bar sarabande attributed to handel one absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds of an opera aria we hear as the power is flickering while irene is chasing benny through the house it is of the famous aria ebben  ne andrò lontano from catalanis opera la wally the aria is sung by the lead soprano who is leaving home forever as irenes mother was a dramatic soprano we can guess that this is a recording of her singing and that she is saying a poignant farewell to her daughter as in the movie irene is soon destined to never again see benny alive i just have one minor question of the soundtrack why include the famous tango yo soy maria i love the song and personally could hear it all the time but it didnt really fit here
