this is the worst movie i have ever seen the story line is a joke the effects are terrible the cinematography doesnt fit the tone of the movie the dialogue is cheesy and the actors do a good job at screwing up the rest people just dont act that way in real life situations my question is who would fund such crapbr br the movie starts where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a fireman fails to save them next we join some bikers in a forest who ride around doing stunts on their bikes one guy falls and breaks his leg or something the fireman arrives to help them meanwhile somebody starts a fire some more bike stunts bla bla blabr br i wasted my timebr br do not watch this movie
