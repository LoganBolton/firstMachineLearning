arthur hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man probably the ozarks who goes hunting with his favorite coon dog however the dog appears to be drowning when hunnicutt jumps in after him it becomes obvious pretty soon that despite hunnicutt and his dog roaming about after leaving the water that they both died in the wateras no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dogs death yet oddly hunnicutt is really slow on the uptake and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him i think this was actually done as padding as there really wasnt enough material to fill the half hour time slotbr br later in the surprise twist he comes upon heavenor at least his concept of the place hes invited in but since they wont allow dogs he has other ideas overall reasonably well acted but of dubious spiritual value with no twists or irony this episode is a bit dullnot twilight zoney enough for my tastes
