rare and auspicious are the moments in filmmaking when greatness stands as a defining monument for the rest of the industry to measure themselves against and for us to immerse in that glorious momentbr br some stories transcend their time and aspire to the lofty reaches of a classic and the stuff of legends throw in the refined skills of an ensemble cast of thespians who are at the very top of their gamebr br where has all the originality gone it is here as this story and its cast sashay through a plot and story that will not only educate but also entertain even the most seasoned of shakespeareanactionlove story connoisseursbr br i cannot begin to imagine where the writers dreamed up this extraordinary tale where do geniuses get this kind of inspiration i now have hope for mankind knowing that this kind of talent still exists gives me hope that we will make it to the stars and beyond perhaps to the very gates of heavenbr br i have like others before me dreamed of greatness though i did not write this movie i did see it and because of this movies noble greatness i feel as if i have been elevated to a higher level of being a higher level of spiritual wholenessbr br it is no wonder this kind of glory eludes most of us what would become of our world if we all could attain this level of magnificence we would probably be consumed in a white fire of supernova glory as we evolve into transdimensional spiritual beings capable of omnipotent creative powerbr br the most important thing to know with all your heart and the very essence of your being is that tomcats is nothing like what i have been talking about tomcats is the antithesis of all i mentioned it could very well destroy our world for as some reviewers rate a movie on a star system ie 1 through 5 stars or even zero stars im going to rate tomcats a black holebr br i am willing to donate money to a cause that will put a stop to these kinds of atrocities that as of late seem to be running amuck at box offices im not even adverse to the use of nuclear weapons it must stop how much more of this can we take before aliens from outer space come down here and blow up our planet because we have so many stupid crass vulgar unimaginative and degrading movies spewing out of hollywood im not even going to dignify this movie by mentioning anyones name that starred or produced it im not even going to waste my time describing the story since weve seen it a bazillion times and all of the past versions were at least a gazillion times betterbr br by the way my head nearly imploded during this movie but with supreme selfless effort and lotsoluck i survived to warn the public you have been warned
