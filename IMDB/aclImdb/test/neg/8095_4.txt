i mostly rented this movie to see shannon elizabeth she played well in this movie but the plot sucked the movie wasnt really about anything just about trying to stay single after making a pact when one of jerry o connells friends gets married the other friends put together this money and whos ever last to get married gets the money 10000 from all his friends anyway the movie just try to follow through by making no since and trying to make it more funny then making since im glad i only paid 50 for this movie it really wasnt good at all i rated it  out of 10 stars
