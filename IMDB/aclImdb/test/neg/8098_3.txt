when a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious mr coulomb fbi agent dick martin is assigned to the case as the deaths continue to mount mr martin obviously isnt having much success by the end of the movie the strange truth is revealed which i wont reveal herebr br one of the other users commenting on this states this is a classic film and should be enjoyed and not picked apart im sorry but i have to respectfully disagree with this opinion it is classic only in that it is old not in any sense pertaining to its quality ive enjoyed a lot of low budget b movies from around this time period but this isnt one of thembr br the pacing is unbearably slow the camera work is pretty bland most of the acting is fairly wooden even lugosi isnt great in this one in my opinion and the plot while it has an interesting premise seems to be thrown together in a very difficult to follow manner
