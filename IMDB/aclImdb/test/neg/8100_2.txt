bela lugosi is a real enigma in the early 1930s he was on top of the world after appearing in dracula yet again and again he made lousy decisions regarding his career perhaps he had a bad agent perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy regardless he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any filmranging from excellent horror films such as the raven to bigbudget flicks like ninotchka to gradez flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios interestingly enough although he agreed to do this terrible film he actually turned down the role that later went to boris karloff in frankenstein as for this movie it is a very silly an horridly produced wwii propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteursnot a bad thing at all but at the end we find out that he is himself a nazi plastic surgeon and all the americanlooking men he killed were actually japanese the funniest part of this is during a flashback you see lugosi talking to a group of japanese men before he changes them to americanlike men when the camera scans them the men are clearly asian but on all the other noncloseup shots they are all very western lookingmany with bald heads they looked absolutely nothing like japanese men i suspect the plot must have undergone a rewrite and this might account for the obvious mistake or it could just be shoddy production values and editing in fact early in the film they show a street scene in the city and all the cars circa 1942 are old model t fordsobviously from stock footage the bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull unlike plan 9 from outer space its hard to laugh at the ineptitudejust be put to sleep by it
