i probably have to blame myselfbut i sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title black dragons and revolves on secret wwii conspiracies nazi plastic surgeons and revenge this film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure the actual plot which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing only becomes clear during an explication near the end but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before we see how horror icon bela lugosi infiltrates in a society of prominent american politicians and kills them one by one the story is timed right before wwii and  especially after witnessing the ending  it surely is a premise with lots of potential so its quite a shame it isnt elaborated more proper there is however one great dialogue that i cant resist sharing man towards woman do you want to marry me why so i can beat you upits the only way youll leave this place its the only highlight in an overall very boring movie bela lugosi is lovely  as usual  but his spooky performance alone is hardly worth purchasing this film if youre interested in seeing other ghoulish performances of his in movies with decent screenplays check out invisible ghost the corpse vanishes white zombie and of course the 1931 dracula version
