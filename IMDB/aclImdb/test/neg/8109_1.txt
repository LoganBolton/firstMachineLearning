there could be some spoilers ahead but i doubt it i have no idea how the screenplay for this one made it past the shredder its horrible completely unwatchable i hung in there for 45 minutes about half the running time and just couldnt stand it anymore i was an elijah wood fan in the 90s see the war and i learned to enjoy mandy moores shifts from bubbly to serious this year see chasing liberty which is surprisingly entertaining ive seen bits of run lola run so with three leads i liked this should have been fine it wasnt nobody turned in a good performance woods jones was flat for an aspiring writer he had next to no imagination his violent fantasies looked like they were ripped off from a christmas story and his lustful ones werehuh a cross between boring and alarming potente is absolutely unlikable from the first second and id only know that she was supposed to be the girl by reading the box speaking of the synopsiswhoever they employed for that job made the film sound funny quirky romantic and quite enjoyable whoever that person was he or she should have been employed to rewrite this script by the halfway point i didnt care about any of the characters anymore moores lisa is an aspiring actress whos bubbly and a little conniving for no apparent reason at all but her ludicrous period play which is supposed to be funny in presentation is on a par with the rest of the script there is supposedly a happy romantic comedy ending to this turkeygiven the character material they had to work with i just cant envision it save your money warn your friends dont watch this movie
