having loved stephen kings novels and short stories for many years i like most reviewers have been consistently disappointed in the adaptations to film from his printed works a few notable exceptions are stand by me from the body carrie from the novel of the same name and the shawshank redemption from rita heyworth and shawshank redemption this movie is by far the worst thing that has ever been produced with stephen kings name attached to it in any way it is no surprise that mr king has pretty much disavowed any connection with it i feel the thing that most offended me about this poorly acted cheaply filmed hideously directed piece of garbage is that they had the audacity to completely change the ending dont waste your time or money on this amazing bowwow of a movie
