im sorry but for a movie that has been so stamped as a semi classic and a scary movie but seriously i think when the director has me laughing unintentionally thats not a good thing the characters in this film were just so over the top and unbelievable i just couldnt stop laughing at issacs voice it was just like a high pitched whiny girls british voice not to mention malicais over dramatic stick up his butt characterbr br children of the corn is about a town where all the children have killed off the adults and worship a god that commands them to sacrifice any 20 aged people when a couple has a bad car accident they come to the town for help but of course they get caught in the kids trap and are getting sacrificed but malicai has other intentions when he is sick of following issacs ordersbr br children of the corn couldve been something great but turned into a bad over the top movie that you could easily make fun of as much as i love stephen king im sure this is not what he intended and it was a pretty lame story or at least the actors destroyed it like i said for a good laugh watch it but im warning you its pretty patheticbr br 310
