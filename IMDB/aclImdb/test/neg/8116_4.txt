i must admit ashamed though i am that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horrorchiller was one of my favourite all time films nine years after first viewing stephen kings frightening story however i have now come to my senses and am able to assess fritz kierschs work more reasonablybr br indeed kings tale of a small nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper but it makes for a cheap average horror show on celluloid a lot of this outcome can be attributed to the fact that kiersch almost allows the beginning of the film to become a hackerslasher show and then turns the finale into a hocuspocus special effects nightmarebr br the cast are reasonable but they can only portray as much credibility as this rather incredible over the top movie will allow them and the soundtrack by jonathan elias is spookier than the picturesbr br a real shame that george goldsmiths screenplay turned stephen kings haunting short story into a shocking horror isaac malachai and all the other children of the corn arent really all that scarybr br sunday august 7 1994  video
