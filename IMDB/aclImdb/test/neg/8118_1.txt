unless theres some huge ironic conspiracy going on my jaw dropped when i read the positive reviews of this film i cannot believe that this film was even released its so badbr br i admit it is not my kind of movie but i tried to watch it objectively anyway you know so bad its funny and was still offended at its sheer awfulnessbr br the acting is atrocious they cant have watched the rushes and im guessing there was one take per scene it really is that terrible it is the worst film i have seen in many a year in fact i wouldnt even call it a film its a tragedy the gay black friend whom noone actually calls gay its just implied because hes so crazy homophobic this is not good in fact this is downright vomit inducing the jokes die on their pathetic arses the music is so bad it defies belief the person who compiled the soundtrack essentially chose the most earmutilatingly bad songs they had ever heard and put them in this waste of film stock oh my good christ i cant believe the 80s produced utter garbage like this i grew up through them and i cannot find one thing worth of note here it must have been a dark time to be a cinemagoerbr br if you even contemplate watching this film go see a psychiatrist he will then accordingly slap you you sick sick person
