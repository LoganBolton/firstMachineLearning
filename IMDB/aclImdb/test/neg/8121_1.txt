seriously im amazed at all the good feedback this show has here all we have in this show is two stupid kids who keep doing an annoying laugh and they do occasional funny things only in like 2 of the shows while most of the others sucked as then they comment on music videos which i cannot stand personally while they either love or likebr br in most episodes the only things you will hear are the repitive lets go score with some chicks or ill kick your ass beavis or the better yet and usually used quote that was cool and above all their annoying laughbr br if you want a good animated show try the simpsons ren and stimpy south park this show is just not worth the time or energy it takes to watch this awful mtv series truthfully
