i dont care if this show is suppose to be communicating profound messages about human existencebr br the show is craphow can anyone derive pleasure from watching it yet it was received so well this reflects a sad state of affairs for joe moron out therebr br i tried watching this program when it first came out as friends were talking about it the inane laughing between the two main characters and the pitiful dialog made me want to crybr br it is beyond belief that people can watch this show yet i guess the creators had the last laughmaking themselves wealthy by taking the pss out of the very people that would watch a show such as thisbr br i would wager they are laughing all the way to the bank
