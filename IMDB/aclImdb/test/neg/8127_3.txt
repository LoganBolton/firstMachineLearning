first of all let me just say that after watching this movie i felt like id been sold a bill of goods mind you its not the movies fault that imdb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second although i dont know how thats enteredmaybe some moron from the films crew put it in being a fan of the horrorcomedy genre i checked it out based on that and im so so sorry i did where to start first of all to touch back on my beginning theres no comedy in this movie it tries once or twice but never gets more than a chuckle at best my reaction was primarily rolling my eyes and wondering why someone thought such tired material would be funny also theres no horror here not a second of tension can be found you think im exaggeratingi am not no tension very little blood and not much violence on screen sorry but in a horror flick cutting away just as the good stuff starts is a major foul helltheres even zero nudity call me a purist or juvenilei prefer some in a horror flick if it cant come up with an original plotpremise and that tired as all hell reality tv show gone wrong thing its been done before and a lot better like wrong turn 2 orummmwhatever that movie was called with edward furlong thats how bad this movie is i dont even remember the name of that movie but it was better than this i also enjoyed the one comment claiming the timing for this was good because reality tv is taking over did someone from the past post that with a time machine are you freaking kidding me this thing is trashand not in a fun way
