sebastian cabot is a rich jerk who wants to buy up all the land because there is oilthough none of the locals are aware of the oil with the help of an evil gunfighter in black they kill and terrorize everyone when the son of a murdered man arrives he refuses to back down and stands up to these forces of darknessbr br wow as i watched terror in a texas town i felt as if id seen this film many times before and would probably see something like it again thats because aside from a few novelties such as sterling hayden using a harpoon on the bad guy it has a plot that is too familiar once again weve got a rich guy who is trying to drive out all the farmers in order to gain control of all the land and to do so hes brought in hired guns to force people to sell or kill them been there done that in just too many filmsbr br i love sterling hayden in films but just couldnt recommend this as anything other than a poor time passer
