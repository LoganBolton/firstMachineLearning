julien hernandez is certainly an attractive and likable on screen persona in fact his character pretty much carries this whole film or whats worthwhile about it the problem is with the exception of his gal pal played by marisa petroro and paul lekakis as a trickdate boyfriend for some of the characters no one else even comes close hernandez plays a 30 something director of cuban heritage and unknown sexuality who comes to la and gets a job making a gay documentary in the process of meeting a group of gay people while finding subjects he comes outbut very s l o w l y even at 88 minutes the film has obviously been stretched out and padded with various filmschool devices most of which only end up pointlessly interrupting the narrative which aint much to begin with or pointing out the overall amateurishness of the filmmaking br br which is a shame because theres a love story in here somewhere and the final three minutes when hernandezs sebastien finally clicks with a wealthy west hollywood party thrower nicely underplayed by lonnie henderson and they share some sexy soulful kisses it works despite all that came before but we dont really care about any of the other characters or their situations why would handsome dante have a eurotrash priss for a boyfriend he wouldnt and dont even get me started on sebastiens friend paulies rules for dating  no gay man i know hell no sane person period would put such constrictions on himself or others and please tell me how sebastien gets a peeled banana which is normally fairly shmushy right stuck up his butt and has to go to a doctor to get it removed br br i noticed hernandez won an award for this film as a short  it probably should have stayed that way all this said  id look forward to seeing hernandez on screen again in a better scripted comedy with more assured direction
