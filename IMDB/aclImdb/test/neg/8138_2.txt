this movie was cheesy and it was more than that it was about this guy who gets a curse on him and he turns into a gorilla i had to see how bad it was because of the title before this guy turns into a gorilla he gets married i was a little upset because she wasnt a bride of a gorilla she is now the wife of the gorilla she should have married him when he was a gorilla then the title would have made more sense there are all these people in the middle of the jungle too and they all want to leave this isnt just a b movie its more like a z movie i didnt even see any bananas for a wedding gift oh right he wasnt cursed yet
