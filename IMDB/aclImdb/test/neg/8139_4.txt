the cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself we have barbara payton raymond burr lon chaney jr tom conway paul cavanaugh and woody strode in front of the camera and writerdirector curt siodmak cinematographer charles van enger editorial supervisor francis d lyon and production assistant herman cohen behind it the illfated payton turns the head of virtually every male she comes in contact with deep in the african jungle where she lives on husband cavanaughs plantation doctor conway secretly desires her while hotheaded foreman burrs approach is quite literally more handson on the other hand chaney is surprisingly enough the laidback but knowing authoritarian figure and strode is a native police official the plot is very simple but frankly does not make a whole lot of sense after a particularly agitated dinner complete with thunderstorm burr and cavanaugh art imitating life  more on that later come to blows in the garden over their affection for payton and conveniently for burr a large snake just happens to be crawling near where cavanaugh hits the ground witnessing the event from behind the bushes paytons enigmatic maid a native witch no less for some inexplicable reason puts a curse on burr who has in the meantime married payton that periodically turns him into a gorillastarting from his very wedding day when his hand briefly turns hirsute consequently burr takes to losing himself in the jungle for days on end  even if the ape creature itself is barely glimpsed throughout the film it must be said however that the version that i watched ran for just 56 minutes when the official length is elsewhere given as either 66 70 or 76 therefore the film feels understandably rushed and disjointed if never less than campily enjoyable as it culminates in the gorillas subjectivelyshot chasing of payton in the jungle with the former being itself pursued by the guntoting chaney and conway to get back to the films tragic blonde leading lady for a minute after a promising start in movies next to such hollywood legends as james cagney and gary cooper  in respectively kiss tomorrow goodbye and dallas both 1950  her career soon nosedived into b and lesser grade territory thanks to her own colorful offscreen antics her most notorious misdemeanor was being the cause of a muchpublicized barroom brawl between suave husband franchot tone and brutish former lover tom neal which ended with the former in a coma and payton actually deserting him for the latter shortly thereafter but that was not all nymphomaniac payton also boasted that woody strode was among her conquests a controversial issue at the time shortlived husband tone having caught paytons infidelities on camera spread the damning photographic evidence around hollywood and this virtually served to end her days as a starlet  her last film appearance being edgar g ulmers murder is my beat 1955 which i happen to have in my unwatched movies pile the last 12 years of her tumultuous life were spent on skid row in the throes of booze drugs prostitution beatings arrests and even a stabbing  before eventually dying in 1967 in her parents home at the young age of 39
