gave it two stars because the dvd cover was good enough to make me buy this piece of horse manure i paid a dollar for it at the local dvd exchange and i want my money back i have a couple of good moviesat least i think theyre good that have never seen the inside of a video store after seeing this im really insulted by that light years worse than anything ive ever seen i cant even recommend this as a campy joke movie it is so bad instead of making you laugh it makes you angry how did this awful film find any kind of distro i can only believe it was self distributed as the amateurish dvd authoring would suggest to the producers of this movie get out of the business its obvious you have no talent for it
