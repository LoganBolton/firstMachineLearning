being somewhat an independent filmmaker myself i really understand what these guys were trying to do and it sounds like a good idea on paper on 16mm film however its awful i didnt realize the thing was made in the mid 90s because the film was so grainy and bad i would have sworn this was one of those 30 year old flicks where a porn producer tried to go mainstream and the sound ugh i dont know what kind of mic they were using to record but it sounds like someone is walking over dead leaves throughout the entire thing i guess i shouldnt judge too harshly after all how many feature films has my company put out none but id like to think that wed at least have good picture and sound quality to go with our poor acting writing and directing a for idea f for execution
