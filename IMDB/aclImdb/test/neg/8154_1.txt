the only thing i expected that this film didnt have was an intelligent talking motorcyclebr br this film is just plain awful i gave it 1 star which of course means i enjoyed it tremendously bad acting bad writing bad directing bad fight choreography the only real actor in this movie is martin landau who of course does a good job playing the villain although the character is your standard cardboard cutout evil ceovillain even the socalled plot twist at the end was no shockbr br there was so much to make fun of in this movie i enjoyed it a lot and it did have a few impressive car wreck stuntsbr br like bad movies check this one out ouch want a good movie not here
