rarely does one find a movie so bad that it achieves the oftensought paradigm of having so little redeeming value that that alone makes it worth watching cyclone i am happy to report is such a filmbr br i knew i was in for something good as soon as i found the videotape i am at least its fourth owner it has a used movie sale 995 sticker on the front and a yardsale sticker for one dollar i picked it up at a thrift store for fifty centsbr br the used movie sale sticker covers much of the front cover artwork meaning that what i see is a truly odd blended still of the front of the cyclone super bike a car flipping over on fire and heather thomas wearing flouncy eighties hair with her mouth open in an expression that says i ave a ooth ache i saw that and thought all right the case honestly was enough with nowhere to turn and no one to trust teri is plunged headlong into a maze of danger and deceit but i surprised myself by actually getting around to watching it i always make time for the really bad films that fight club tape can waitbr br meet teri teri is a stunningly wellcrafted character as we can tell from her introduction in which she and her friend do exercises that highlight her breasts and later her legwarmers then teri goes off to hook up with her boyfriend for the evening that goes horribly wrong before she knows it teri is driven straight into a web of deadly doublecrosses in cyclone the vhs box tells it like it isbr br left out of the box summary  perhaps out of some faint hope that actual copies of this film would be sold  is how awful the acting is it might have been just me but i kept thinking i could read the characters thoughts through their eyes this is dumb thinks heather thomas i know thinks bad guy with toowide mouthbr br a driving force no pun intended for the second half of this epic picture are the car chases those were actually pretty good although im inclined that gasoline doesnt need coaching on how to explode what really impressed me is that in all the chases the streets were pretty much empty its like there are only twenty people in this huge citybr br i know what youre thinking youre thinking gee wilikers i have to see this movie the sad thing though is that you cant find it oh no cyclone is a film that finds you just wait some day  perhaps during lunch perhaps late in the evening perhaps when military scientist jeffery combs reanimatoris murdered by hired assassins  you will hear the rustle of legwarmers and know that it is time
