i was expecting to view a more exploitation style of film but unfortunately this turned out to be just a badly made low budget action flick that just doesnt have the talent for that story is about a very beautiful woman named teri marshall heather thomas whos boyfriend rick jeffrey combs works for a secret agency and he has invented a motorcycle that is bullet proof and can shoot lasers and rockets and has a helmet that can shoot lasers as well the head of the agency bosarian martin landau has made a 5 million dollar deal to sell it and sends two hired thugs to kill rick and teri and collect the bike a tall blond thug named rolf dar robinson and his partner hanna dawn wildsmith manage to kill rick but teri survives while at home she discovers a video tape that rick left describing his invention that helps teri on what to do nextbr br spoiler alertbr br teri is being chased by several agents and she gets caught and tortured but doesnt talk about where a piece of the motorcycle that is needed but she gets help from a federal agent named waters martine beswick where they end up using the motorcycle for a bloody shootoutbr br this film is directed by fred olen ray who has made his career out of making ultralow budget exploitation films but he made a dire mistake here by leaving out the exploitation aspect and trying to make an action film aside from a quick shower scene at the beginning there is no nudity and the usual titillation that viewers are accustomed to seeing in a ray film is no where to be found i dont think anyone was expecting thomas to get naked but she doesnt wear one sexy outfit not that it stopped me from ogling her in those tight jeans and admiring her near perfect form but ray really blew it in this case like all of his films the cast is fun to watch and many familiar faces have roles like robert quarry huntz hall troy donahue tim conway jr michael reagan and russ tamblyn stuntman dar robinson died shortly after this was made and its his last acting effort and the film is dedicated to him you have to wonder why landau would waste him time with such junk like this but i was interested in the casting of combs in a very rare romantic role is thomas any good in this film who cares i think she showed that she could have become a popular b movie starlet if she wanted but it never did happen ray wastes everyones time with this effort although the cast is fun to watch but he left out the elements that make him an enjoyable filmmaker
