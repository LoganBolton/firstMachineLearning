hard to imagine what they were thinking of when they made this movie ie the writers directors producers actors editors etc christopher plummer veteran of 129 movies frolics along among scores of other actors with apparently no more motivation than to collect a paycheck i guess there is nothing wrong with that but once they are paid that doesnt mean anyone has to watch itbr br it bugs me that there are actually good reviews for this movie here at imdb art if you want to see art go to an art gallery dont watch this movie comedy watch a rerun of the flintstones about the same plot with less time wastedbr br dabney coleman gives his usual performance for better or worse and some of the young actors may have gotten some good experience from doing this movie but plummer it was embarrassing to watch his performance in fact i was positively transfixed on him throughout the movie knowing this was plummer of sound of music fame i see from his bio that he called sound of music sound of mucus so guess he didnt like it as much as the 100s of millions who liked him in itbr br i wonder if today he was asked how do you rate sound of music compared to where the heart is what would he saybr br probably something like where the money is
