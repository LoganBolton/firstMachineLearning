san francisco oh you marvelously desolated town thank you god for destroying it and making bricks fall on our collective heads and for pummeling into oblivion tens of thousands of your innocent obedient sheep oh lord who art so merciful in thy heavenly ways these should have been the lyrics to the title song of this ohso inspiring and utterly mindless filmbr br the movie starts well enough with gable discovering a cinderella with a highly annoying but muchappreciated operatic voice and she soon shoots to stardom one of the many problems with our cinderella is that she is played by jeanette macdonald who if one takes the time to look through all that makeup and 30s glitz facade realizes that she is kind of ugly too ugly to be playing this role anyway yet gable and everyone else fawn all over here as if she were some damn beauty or something another problem with cinderella is that her character is so utterly humble wholesome innocent godloving kind and generous  enough to make you vomit for a full hour macdonald plays her admittedly onedimensional role with the sort of ahhh oh and ooh that serves to annoy rather than make her sympatheticbr br tracy has been better and had better roles than playing this clichéd heartofgold godloving nonchildmolesting priest who boxes in his free time  as if priests have anything to do  how cute even the everreliable gable is not up to his usual standard he is far too animated and his character is far too selfless for someone who is supposed to be an ambitious western scoundrel though this obviously is the scripts faultbr br the plot is basically this gable and his rival holt play pingpong with cinderella  using her as the ball how well first she is working singing for gable then she works for the square holt then she goes back to gable only to return very soon to holt and of course both want to have her as girlfriendwife and if the earthquake hadnt interrupted this tabletennis plot its a safe bet that she would have been bouncing backandforth another ten times the wishywashy little princess that she isbr br there are many far too many in fact musical numbers its almost as though they tried to make the first disastermovie musical ever how silly the stuff she sings in gables joint is okay but when she starts belting out those highpitched annoying whines during the opera segments that is when i felt that my ears were unprovokingly and unjustly attacked by enemy soundfire in fact there is an opera number that lasts 6 damn minutes 6 may seem like little for those who havent had firsthand vietoperanam experience with such horrors of audio torture but its like with dog years a dogs year is equivalent to seven human ones a minute of opera is equivalent to 100 minutes of chinese torture or a dog urinating acid on your legbr br i thought this was a disaster movie but its more like a neardisaster movie i read that some of the dialog in this film was written by a silentera film director jesus the melodramatic and only occasionally amusing proceedings get interrupted by the real star of this movie namely the earthquake only after well over oneandahalf hours when joe the earthquake finally does shake up the city and our clichéd characters in it i almost felt like saying thank god death and destruction are finally here unfortunately joe comes too late into the movie to save it from its increasing mediocrity the scenes of devastation are very good but even the earthquake part of the movie gets ruined pun by a highly annoying religious ending you see gable who professes to be an atheist all along without actually using the word itself finally finds macdonald alive  after having searched for days  and suddenly he is converted into a believer because cinderella is alive how stupid all that tells me is that gables character is a weakminded moronbr br the movie ends on a very dumb note indeed gable having said thank you to god for saving his girl and he does his on his knees finds god sees the light and the movies little old devil gable converts himself into a believer how very godfearingly american an endingbr br of course no one thought of asking this god why the hell there was an earthquake in the first place the sad and unintentional irony is that gable in the end becomes a sucker all along he had made fun of suckers who fall for the holiest scam of them all  namely religion  and in the end he himself becomes one now thats what i call a triumph of the human spirit another irony is that the ending was supposed to have improved gable as a person but i see it quite differently on the contrary it took only one big joe to turn gable into a godfearing meek little obedient believer  who joins the worlds sheep family and as if this intellectual downfall of gables wasnt pathetic and disappointing enough this firstever earthquake musical ends with a truly hairraising take this word as you will noble and hopeinspiringly beautiful masschoir scene dozens or hundreds of earthquake survivors and proud proud citizens of frisco spontaneously or did god perhaps arrange it sing all together the title song in hope for a better brighter joeless future hallelujah if you are a sucker for hollywood sentimentality do not skip this movie
