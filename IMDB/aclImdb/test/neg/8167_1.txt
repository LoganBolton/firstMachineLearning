its hard to make a bad movie with the underdog finally succeeds sport theme but this movie succeeds admirably my mind boggles at how pointless and boring this film isbr br i guess the director couldnt decide whether this was about the runner or the coach it ends up being about neither ultimately who cares neither character has a likable personality there is nothing in the movie to make you care about anyone even the bad guy isnt really bad i think hes in two scenes and seemingly is on some kind of barbituate  i think he asks her once and politely to leave the coach and train with him then later he kinda sorta asks her to move in with him thats it conflict tension what will she do br br and whats with the depiction of running has the director ever seen an actual marathon christines form is so incorrect its absurd as is the form of the supposed champion she competes with a character with no lines maybe they could have hired you know an actual runnerbr br and the speed the run at is beyond comprehension were they running or speed walking its actually laughable i can literally walk backwards faster then they were running in the big race maybe it was too hard to move the cameras at real speedbr br another absurdity spoiler i guess at one point in the big race the two women in the lead inexplicably fall at the same time what they fell on is a mystery maybe they both just got exhausted and fell down and then they get up but dont start running again for maybe 30 seconds oh yeah very realistic this ridiculous event doesnt even add any tension since the other runners are not close and besides at this point you have been numbed into a state of catatoniabr br i especially enjoyed how all four of her male teammates highly trained athletes all drop out of the big race due to charliehorses or pulled tendons or something just as improbable br br but who cares this movie has almost no tension no resolution nothing some woman runner with absolutely no personality is discovered by an old boring coach with some past failure that is barely hinted at they train a lot she is not happy they train some more she wins da big race woopie br br my description is actually more interesting than the actual movie i just saved you 90 minutes avoid this one like the plague
