im a boorman fan but this is arguably his least successful film comedy has never been his strong suit and here his attempts at screwball farce are clumsily done still its almost worth seeing for boormans eye for talent this is one of uma thurmans first starring roles and as always she is ravishing to watch on a sad side note boorman wrote the script with his daughter telsche who died a couple years ago
