this movie truly shows the farce and hypocrisy of indian society what it tries to show you is only one side of the story the other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of indian children which this movie does not showbr br indian parents are culpable for the following a destroying the individuality of the children by making them completely dependent on the parents at a very early age such children grow up to be adults only in physical looks but remain children in minds since everything has been provided to them by their great indian parents they children automatically do not feel the need to work hard at something or learn the basics of human communication with other human beings apart from their parentsbr br b i can show you so many indian parents who try to prevent their kids making friends going out or prevent them to do anything which starts making them to grow into adultsbr br the reason why they do is the same selfishness indian parents expect their children to take care of them when they grow old they do no savings for themselves and once they reach the age of 50they cry out loudwe have grown old now and so we are dependent on you children since we have done the great service of bringing you to this world and taking care of you and making you intellectually weakbr br most of the indian parents at the age of 50 have dilapidated bodies and health and are financially completely insecure most feel that they absolutely have no need to take care of themselves since they expect their kids to take care of thembr br in the west the opposite of that happens people start planning at the age of 20 about their retirement and once they retire they are financially securebr br indian parents do nothing of that sort since like i said they have brought the kids in the world and what better investment at thatbr br i am a victim of my indian parents i am sure there are countless other indian kids like me who have grown up physically but are still struggling with their lives on their own and they continue to have pestering 50 year olds who cry out loud for help all the timebr br this movie shows only one side of the storyutter piece of junk
