ravi chopra wrote this film 40 years back wanted to cast dilip kumar in the leadbr br the film finally was rewritten and made in 2003 and hence the subject looks dated and too superficial at timesbr br like the reason amitabhhema separate is too superficial even the way the youth are shown is too bad like gulshan in avtaarbr br the message though comes well but things are presented in a clich√©d manner salmans character is the worst looks straight out of a storybook while the climax speech of bachchan is good and also the final of not forgiving the sons is goodbr br ravi chopra does a good job music is decent the songs sung by bachchan stand outbr br amitabh excels like always he has played an elder stern father earlier but here he plays a victim and portrays it well his last speech is great hema is good in her part aman verma stands out samir soni is okay naseer and the rest sons and wives are decent though divya dutta stands out salman khan is fake mahima is okay paresh and lillete are lovable
