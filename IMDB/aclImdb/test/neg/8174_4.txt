ok heres the short of it this movie is full of corny dialogue over the top acting and a threadbare scriptbr br there are moments that intended to be very dramatic but simply come off humorous because of the over the top acting and poorly written lines i couldnt help laughing at moments that were meant to be very serious the bright spot in this movie is the circus seeing the circus in its heyday was certainly a treatbr br there are moments that come through as good but then it nosedives right back into bmovie territory i was tempted to stop watching it several timesbr br i certainly dont know how it won best picture however it must have been a slow year
