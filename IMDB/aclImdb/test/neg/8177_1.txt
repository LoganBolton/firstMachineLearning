i dont mind some adult humor but this feature was just downright dirty the first 10 minutes consisted of pryor swearing at some guy taking pictures followed my even more profanities i dont know what happened between that time the the last 5 minutes because i walked out after seeing this i never looked at richard pryor the same way again and to think that he actually went on to host a childrens showbr br if profanity and tasteless unfunny dirty jokes make you laugh then youll probably enjoy this but if youre an oldfashioned type then dont bother
