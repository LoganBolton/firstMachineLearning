this film is strange even for a silent movie essentially it follows the adventures about a engineer in postrevolutionary russia who daydreams about going to mars in this movie it seems like the producers know the communists have truly screwed up the country but also seems to want to make it look like theyve accomplished something goodbr br then we get to the martian scenes where everyone on mars wears goofy hats they have a revolution after being inspired by the earth men but are quickly betrayed by the queen who sides with them except its all a dream or is it and given that the russian revolution eventually lead to the stalin dictatorship it makes you wonder if it was all allegory br br now ive seen good russian cinema for instance eisensteins battleship potemkin is a good movie this is just well silly
