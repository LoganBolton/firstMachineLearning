okay so it was never going to change the world and it bombed at the box office but honky tonk freeway is one of those films i fell in love with as a child the bbc showed it a few times during the 1980s and i happened to have a high quality vhs tape in the machine  lucky that and watched endlessly i watched the dvd last night and sadly time has not been kind to this wouldbe blockbuster either that or ive just grown out of this kind of broad dopey humour come on when schlesinger is so desperate for laughs he gives us closeups of novelty underpants with amusing slogans what can you say about the cast or screenplaybr br certainly its ambitious interesting unusual and sprawling but its never once laughoutloud funny id describe it as a childrens film with some adult overtones  you can safely let your youngsters watch this despite the 15 certificate they wont get the drug references so dont worry about it i had a pleasant surprise when i realized id forgotten just how catchy both the title song and the songwriting truck drivers everybodys going faster faster song were not to mention the town of ticlaws patriotic anthem the whole cast give commendable performances the photography is crisp and captures the mood of the various locations perfectly and theres a real time capsule feeling about the fashions the cars the gadgets especially the dashboardmounted drum machine the interiors and the popculture references  i was more than a little surprised to hear the nutty bum in the bank loudly telling everyone im oj simpson particularly now simpsons legal tangles have overshadowed his sporting achievements the snag is theres almost no plot to speak of its way too obvious to be witty and not funny enough to elicit many genuine laughs i wish id left this one as a pleasant memory
