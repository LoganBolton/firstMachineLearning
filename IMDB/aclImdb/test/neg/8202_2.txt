a 1957 roger corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley sic just as stock footage thermo nuclear heck is unleashed its the end of the world four men with guns two women one an unmarried virgin the other a las vegas show gird who drinks and smokes  guess which one makes it to the end of the movie time passes tensions develop or are supposed to something is in the woods eating radioactive rabbits a mutant monster seven weeks of radioactive dust has performed a million years of evolution on an already living human the result is a laughably bad zip up the back rubber monster who is strangely scared of their only source of fresh water it rains the monster dissolves the remaining two characters the hunk and the virgin set out to repopulate the world as the caption the beginning fills the screen after it transpires that the brief shower of rain had washed all the radioactivity away and dissolved all the monsters running around out therebr br the only thing of real note about this is the incredible amount of curtain acting that goes on in it one of the staple elements of bad and lo budget movie making of the period was the superabundant use of curtains in the set design it was cheap finished with one setup pull a curtain across drop a different piece of furniture in front of it and you have a different location in minutes without having to move the camera or change the lightingbr br curtain acting is a skill in which the actor will get to comment on whats going on outside any building he happens to be in it looks like rain or here they come now and it looks like theyve got the sheriff with them that sort of stuff hell do this by standing to one side of the window  reaching across his body and lifting the curtain away from the window but along the axis of the shot  ie towards the camera  thus enabling him to pretend to look out and tell us whats happening off screen without letting the audience see hes staring at the studio wall three inches away from his nose behind some cheap velvet curtains there was a lot of that in this movie
