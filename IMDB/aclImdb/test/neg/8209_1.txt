a couple of men are shipwrecked on a remote island they are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants while in the castle dungeon lives the counts unfortunate leper wifebr br the dungeon of harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie the amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background the various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way in fact the film in general is completely lethargic it just seems to drag on and on and even though the ending isnt too bad you will be hardpressed to care by that point as an example of 60s gothic horror this is strictly a bargain basement example i sadly cant recommend this one really
