i had already heard of ali g in madonnas music video music i always think hes funny in fact he really is just last year i always thought of buying a vcd of ali g indahouse thats why some months later i bought it cheap and i started watching itbr br but the movie surprised me my older brother and i were expecting it to be a great laughout comedy it turns out that indahouse is just a stupid piece of garbage it was really really bad it also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor it also didnt made me laugh even just a big smile we definitely hate that movie oh by the way i have plans to sell itbr br ali g was really different in his movie compared to his tv shows in such a negative way maybe he wasnt really wellfocused and enough serious to make this flick just because theres some sex scenes in it doesnt mean its freaking hilarious because sometimes too much isnt that laughable anymore for the first time ever i was disappointed at him that really made me sad rather and happybr br i gave this movie 1 over 10 actually i really want to give it a 0 rating its one of the worst movies ive seen in my entire life i wouldnt recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that arent too explicit or horrible
