garden state is another of these indietype pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real truetolife human drama oddly enough the production is very good so are the performances by some fairly bigname actors as well where the picture is lacking is in zach braffs script which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other moviesbr br when youre as young as braff is you havent really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder braffs experience looks to be from watching movies then repeating the same trite clichés in his own movie in garden state he plays andrew largeman a semisuccessful hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in new jersey to bury his mother who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years he appears to have no feeling about any of this he has no relationship with his father who blames him for causing his mothers paralysis in a freak accident as a sixyearold and has no particular despondency over losing his mother in fact he attends a party right after the burial to which he was invited by a friend of his who works as a cemetery gravedigger it all smacks heavily of beautiful girls also about a guy who returns to his hometown to find himself and hang with his old friends with a little ordinary people thrown in on the side br br its really a miracle braff could accomplish anything at all in his life given his father and his useless friends im surprised he didnt kill himself who are still living their lives as though theyre still in high school partying with dumb bimbos drinking and drugging etc none of them even recognize him from his tv role as the retarded quarterback natalie portmans character the most aware person in the movie does and say things like hey i remember you from junior year these guys are such losers for them watching television would be a cultural leap forward even one friend who made millions inventing a silent velcro has no real reason to live because his whole frame of reference is high school and partying and you dont need big money to party like a high school sophomorebr br braff it is revealed is heavily medicated which keeps from feeling and dealing with anything really like an adult would then he meets sam natalie portman a sortof lost girl who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother like a 10yearold in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown up to life size anyway they fall in love and braff learns to feel again the clichés come fast and furious braff has a long delayed hearttoheart talk with his cold distancing father and tells him what it is and the name of the game in one scene braff and portman are in the millionaire kids house playing touchyfeely is front of a giant fireplace and the bit is so routine so standard movieschtick i swear i halfexpected somebody to walk up and throw a sled into the fire in another braff visits a doctor ron liebman to get his junk refilled and liebman tells him in easily the worst line in the movie the body can play tricks on you i once found my exbestfriends cufflinks in my wifes purse and i didnt have an erection for a year and a half obviously no licensed physician would ever say that but its dirtbag poetry a nod from braff to i guess his loser friends to let them know hes still thinking of them just as the 37 joke in clerks was kevin smiths nod to his dirtbag buddies br br anyway braff finds true happiness and gets off the dope the story plays itself out predictably but if youre going to have a movie thats walltowall clichés at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it and braff does he has the right sort of vacancy of casual acceptance to make his role as the zonkedout andrew both real and poignant and natalie portman also of beautiful girls gives the movie a big lift with her tiny features and flickering expressions of mood she just about steals the picture as his traveling companion jean smart is surprisingly good as portmans mother and peter saarsgard though much better in shattered glass is notable as the gravedigger friend i would recommend garden state if you cant get enough storybook romance out of movies but when people start hailing it as a masterpiece theyre just clueless braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot write in a few fks and awesomes and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and that contemporizes the material it doesnt
