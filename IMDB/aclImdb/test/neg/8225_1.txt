garden state must rate amongst the most contrived and pretentious films of all time the plot is a simple one involving a young man returning home after his mothers death and discovering love but really the plot isnt important what is important to zach braff  writer director and star  is that he is able to hang from the plot all the necessary accoutrements of an indie or arty film we therefore are presented with endless cute and quirky characters and scenes that dont exist for reasons of plot or character development but simply to give some artistic credibility to the film à la wes anderson  or so braff hopes unfortunately and somewhat astonishingly braff has not only fooled many on imdb but also some critics who really ought to have known betterbr br of course braffs gratuitous use of the quirky alone does not make garden state a bad film what really makes garden state a stinker is braffs script he simply does not have the writing skills to carry this film off and the dialogue and characterisation are abysmal braff often has to resort to blunt devises and symbolism to achieve what he cant achieve through the writing for example the numbness of the braff character is shown to us by his indifference to an impending plane crash this cant be worked into the plot and so has to take place in a dream later he is shown fighting back against his circumstances by screaming into a bottomless abyss life  a bottomless abyss very clever mr braff those two scenes must rank amongst the most ludicrous and contrived ever seen on a cinema screenbr br on the plus side the acting is passable despite the lack of material for the cast to work with by which i mean a script and i do admire natalie portman for her efforts as the love interest  a character so badly written and implausible that she is little more than a mindless doll that braff moulds into his fantasy womanbr br it apparently took braff 3 years to write the script for garden state 3 years to write a script this bad  he really is inept hopefully therefore it will be some time before he makes another film
