this isnt a very good movie but it is easily the best troma studios film i have ever viewed lloyd kaufman  the brains behind troma  isnt concerned with a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining film his chief concern is making something bizarre and his definition of bizarre oftentimes mirrors my definition of terrible cinemabr br in this film we have the titled character luther  whose favorite pastime isnt baseball but biting the heads off of chickens  receiving his release from lockup the board has deemed him rehabilitated despite the fact that he doesnt speak  he merely clucks like a chicken  and has a set of razorblade dentures at his disposal of course once luther is set free he goes about causing mayhem first at a grocery store and later at a farm housebr br violence  lots of violence in this oftentimes tasteless flick luther sinks his razorblade chompers into a poor elderly lady waiting at a bus stop and then spends the rest of the film terrorizing the mother and daughter at the farmhousebr br nudity  stacy haiduk delivers some noteworthy skin in his picture as the former lois lane i cant recall which superman edition she was from gives us a shower scene followed by a romp in bed with her boyfriend  a guy who just doesnt have any chemistry with ms haiduk the extended shower scene footage in the dvd extras gives the viewer quite a bit more of stacy she is quite somethingbr br story  forgettaboutit whitey styles screenplay may just be the worst ever written the way in which luther is released from the asylum completely throws all credibility out the window his dialogue is something that a preschooler might write and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurd its as if styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people react in certain situationsbr br acting  the film belongs to edward terry who actually does a decent job as the geek he is quite menacing in a stupid barnyard fashion joan roth as the mother does a super job in support but haiduk and her boyfriends lack of chemistry made their roles awkward at best
