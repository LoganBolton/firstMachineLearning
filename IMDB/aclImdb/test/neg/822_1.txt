dont tell me this film was funny or a little funny it was a complete disaster and one of the worst movies ive ever seen ali g is only funny on channel 4s ali g show after watching his performance all i can say is he is not made for movies with a daft script or more like no storyline theres nothing to keep you entertained full of annoying unrealistic characters this movie is a complete garbage all the way at the end of the film ali g gives a speech he mentions if you hated this film tell people it was good not even the speech could save the movie he probably knew its gonna be a stinker i would of given this a 010 but the minimum start is 1 overall dont even waste your time on this rubbish
