this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot revolves around a man named luther who wears metal dentures bites people on the neck and walks around clucking like a chicken without the flapping of the arms he also thinks hes a chickenbr br sounds bizarre right well to me the more bizarre and weird the person is the better the more gore the better and so onbr br the movie starts out with the board deciding if they want to release this maniac from their institution they mention that he has created some dentures in prison that he used to bite people on the neck he also clucks like a chicken and thinks hes a chickenbr br if i had a patient like this there is no way i would release himbr br first luther heads to the supermarket and attacks an old woman on a bench and walks away then he sneaks in the back seat of a womans car and she drives all the way to her homebr br while at the house luther ties up the woman to the bed when the womans daughter and her daughters boyfriend come home luther hidesbr br later through the film a cop comes to the front door and asks about the mother you can clearly see the daughter is scared out of her mind and crying but the officer keeps asking if everything is okay she replies that everything is fine the officer finally gets in his car and leaves if i saw a woman constantly crying and looking scared i would want to at least get inside the house to investigate a littlebr br the ending is stupid as well while the woman in in the barn she starts clucking and gets luther excited so he starts walking around flapping his arms and clucking like a maniac she finally shoots him and just sits there for a minute before finally clucking some morebr br then the credits rollbr br this is one of the stupidest movies i have ever seen nothing happens at the womans house nothingbr br i sometimes like campy films but this one really bored mebr br i give this movie 1 star out of 10 good idea bad direction
