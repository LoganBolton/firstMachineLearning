i consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies the more bizarre and imaginative the film the more blood and guts the better and i really fall in love with cheaply done flicks if they are done right luther starts out well enough his origin at the circus a creepy run at a supermarket an attack of an old lady and his disturbing occupation of a womans farmhouse all set the mood nicely a hot sex shower scene ensues when the womans daughter and daughters boyfriend arrives at the house when luther steals the boyfriends motorbike the movie takes a turn for the worse br br the characters are presented with numerous opportunities to a save their loved ones b get the police to help c escape or most importantly d kill luther i cant feel empathy or fear for characters that are too stupid to help themselves chareters snub chances to arm themselves with guns and knives while luther is away a policeman eventually arrives and is equally ineffective in stopping luther even though at one point he has a rifle squarely aimed at luther while luther clucks and does his rendition of the polish chicken dance i found myself futilely coaching my television make sure hes dead hes gone get out of there or just kill him already br br luther is a bloodthirsty savage but he is hardly hannibal lecter if you cant outsmart this egghead you deserve whats coming to you by halfway through the movie youll be so lethargic to the fates of the halfwits that only morbid curiosity will sustain you to last to the mildly amusing ending this movie was noted as one of fangorias 101 greatest movies youve never seen well fangoria is halfright in the case of luther the geek
