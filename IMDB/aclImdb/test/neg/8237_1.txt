this movie reeks no money no acting no nothing i caught this on on the 3am late show movie tonight and felt compelled to comment on it this movie has nothing to recommend it i cant believe it ever got released to us television nobody in this movie can act their way out of a paperbag the lame attempts at comedy fall flat on their face the special effects consist of a wormlike handpuppet monster i cant even begin to tell you how rockbottom this production is it looks like it cost maybe 50000 to shoot but only because it is on 16mm and that is probably a generous estimate anyway i lost interest rapidly and had to settle for watching matlock reruns instead of finishing it thats how bad this movie is
