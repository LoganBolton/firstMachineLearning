as i sat watching this episode i kept glancing at the clock waiting for something to happen as the hour wound down i thought they were really going to give us a big pop at the end and then  nothing the whole family is huddled around the christmas tree like something from the hallmark channel then fade to blackbr br perhaps one of the poorest season finales ive ever seen nothing at all to drum up any excitement for next season the only thing thrown out as any sort of incentive to watch the next season was the ambiguous nugget offered up by agent harris while pawing a sub sandwich that the guys in new york were looking to get one of the guys in new jersey wow really i would never expect something like that from mobsters im on the edge of my seatbr br it almost seems like theyre trying to get everyone to lose interest they start more plot lines that end up just disappearing than any show ive ever seen they tease and hint but rarely deliver any morebr br whats with the arabs that hang out at the bing they keep throwing them in front of us and magically nothing happensbr br paulie knee caps some kid after tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to her son and poof gone in the windbr br and how many more meandering drug montages with christopher are we going to have to endure please have him get arrested or overdose or something interestingbr br this was one of the few shows that i used to looked forward to watching but now forgettabout it
