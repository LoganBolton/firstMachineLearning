this season lacked real oomf but as far as setting up stories to get us in the mood again season 6 is without highlights and spontaneitybr br this season lacked its usual sopranos style and if you cut out all the garbage that was filled in each and every episode this season you probably would have had 6 episodes worth of real storiesbr br side stories like paulys mom is she or isnt she was boring and had no purpose other than further exploration of his character i would have like to have seen bobby express his anger more at pauly in that carnival episode but to no availbr br and thats just it these side stories had no real purpose and lack finishing if they are going to finish off these stories in the next 6 episodes id rather not watch it because its not really worth seeingbr br disappointing is to nice a word to say about this season and its finale
