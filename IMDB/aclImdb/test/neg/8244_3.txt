oh what the heck ill reveal the secret this movie stinksbr br yeah there are some nifty dinosaur effects that for their time were probably really exciting to watch now they dont cut it but theyre not terrible theyre just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it so they just sit there and i sit watching this not laughing not excited just well bored it stinksbr br if i can exercise my jay sherman for a moment the film really does the box promises cowboys versus dinosaurs and in very generic sense it delivers guys dressed like cowboys fight a couple of big dinosaurs but really these guys are a bunch of sissies and the hero is a loser more on this later and the dinosaurs are hardly intimidating the plot is a yawner and there isnt much technically wrong with it thats there to laugh at its all just gray and blandbr br after some dreadful night cinematography filmed in one and a half colors i called it we get the plot which involves some people doing stuff that was what i caught oh and they are at the turn of the century in mexico so they at least dress like cowboys even if they dont act like itbr br so a bunch of these people who i think were human they go in the desert and they stumble on these dinosaurs after they find a miniature horsei dont know lets just move on then the movie degrades into a really pathetic king kong ripoff in the final act at that point i had lost the will to even keep my eyes at television level and i drifted in and out of consciousnessbr br the hero is played by the guy from beneath the planet of the apes who essentially played charlton hestons part when heston decided he didnt want to be in the sequel he was picked cause shock o shocks he looks exactly like heston thats about all he has going for him i was really upset when he was the hero of the film cause all he does is glower snear bag the chick in the film whos named tjunfortunately shes not a prostitute or finally the origin of the name would have been revealed meanwhile his friend kills all the dinosaurs saves the day numerous times and what does he get for it not recognition no nothing and he dies sacrificing himself for his friends they dont even wait up for him while they escapebr br boring long slowly paced with little to enjoy until the film decides to carbon copy king kongs script onto its own its best to avoid this film unless you enjoy pain on the scale of dropping an anvil on your eyeball
