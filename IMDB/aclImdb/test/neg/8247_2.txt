i sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom i look here on imdb even though it is not high on the list it is in the top 250 i was a little surpised even though yes i am very impressed with robin and matts acting abilities they still didnt save the movie im not sure what i really didnt like about the movie maybe its because i dispise math maybe im not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours even though i loved american beauty but that was it i just want my 2 hours back it was a big waste of my time if im missing something in this movie please email me i am curious why this is on the top 250 and dont say because it was a good moviebr br 210
