if i compare two films with sacha cohen borat and ali g then ali g is immeasurably better its no master piece but its a film at least borat is complete garbage and i do not understand how it rated better then ali gbr br i cannot put my finger on it there something wrong with the ali g script half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old not by an adult scriptwriter and a number of jokes including mr cohens lower body are quite tasteless br br but the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny such as how ali g becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public sadly true in todays western society people get careers for doing stupid things in public also alis advice about immigrant policy and some others br br ali g overall remains a sympathetic character even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age but its ok to watchits quite funnybr br but never ever watch borat its awful and makes every intelligent movielover sick
