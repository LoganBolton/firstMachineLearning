so many fans so little to show for it i know i know these words are gonna find me in a great minority a lot of people really liked good will hunting but seriously please great film making not even close and lets put the blame where it belongs in the writingbr br now i know they won an oscar for it and boy did they look good emoting on the screen but good will hunting is an abc after school special with lots of cursing in it and a slightly bigger budgetbr br what this movie does show is the brilliance of harvey weinstein and miramax pictures mr weinstein could take manure feed it to you and make you believe your eating bon bons and thats exactly what the studio did with the film they created such high faluttin buzz around it that people believed and wanted to believe it so much  that they saw brilliance where there was nonebr br now i know some people think its a great movie i dont think its a horribly bad movie i like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies and also to some great made for tv movies although not hbo films hbo films are unusually better than good will hunting would ever be its just a nice little film with some good performances robin williams was not good in it they just gave him the oscar cause thed been itching to do it for a while and of course the miramax public relations machine secured ben and matt their screenwriting oscar but come one people theres better movies out there thatn gwh
