im not surprised that so many people fell for this one when i was watching this movie a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever youre supposed to sob  or at least feel touched like when hunting said he didnt love the girl like when robin williams character sorry i forgot his roles name was telling hunting repeatedly its not your fault oh lord just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps i couldnt have cared less for what would happen to the characters many people sob for hollywood manufactured characters they cant even relate to think titanic yuck but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre i guess i simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all thisbr br folks its not me whos being condescending  those characters are and for no good reason because theyre unreal worse yet nothing is new or surprising even robin williams character is all clichedbr br i gave it 1 out of 10 its probably not that bad its just quite mediocre but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10 so i figured a single balancing vote wont hurt
