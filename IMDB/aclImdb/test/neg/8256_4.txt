i bought this film as i thought the cast was decent and i like jennifer rubin  patsy kensitbr br first off let me say the acting is not of a high standard stephen baldwin makes his character look almost retarded at times and at other times morose patsy kensit is soso but not too convincing in some scenes and the supposed poetry she spouts in a particular scene in her hotel room is utterly meaningless rubbish ms kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here but ultimately i think jennifer rubin is by far the best in this film ms rubins character is at first innocent then sexy as she plays stephen baldwins character travisfor a fool the supporting cast includes adam baldwinno relation to his more famous namesakes  memmet walsh who has appeared in many films also i noticed art evans who was one of john mclanes allies in die hard 2 the movie is decent and there are a few nude scenes with rubin  kensit a bit of action but this is certainly not a fast moving or intelligent thriller there is a particular scene when they are in the car about to commit a crime and stephen balwins character is wearing sunglasses and when you see him again the area around his eyes etc is painted black instead then the sunglasses reappear later when they are leaving the crime scene and police are in pursuit a very obvious error in editing br br if you are fans of either of the ladies or either baldwin then you may find something to like here but others should steer clear this is a reasonable but unremarkable thriller and not really worth more than a couple of dollars if you want it
