what a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film the script is full of holes from beginning to end incoherent not cohesiveutterly ridiculous one of the most talentedbeautiful actresses in the world and im talking about nastassja kinski is without a single memorable line here worse she supposedly dyes her hair halfway thru the movie but its obvious shes just wearing a cheap black wig bought from a drag queen costume shop the best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building that lead actor peter coyote lives in fairuza balk is photographed poorly to boot she looks like an overweight freshman whos pigged out at too many allyoucaneatstudentcafeteriabuffets i was so looking forward to this film i wanted to like it but i think id rather watch nastassja read the phone book with her own hair
