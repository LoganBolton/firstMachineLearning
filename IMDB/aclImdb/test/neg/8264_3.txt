masters horror sounds like is set in seattle where larry pearce works as the manager of a computer software call center having lost his 6 year old son michael nicholas elia to a rare heart condition he finds that he has ultra sensitive hearing larry hears everything in ten fold from people typing on computer keyboards people whispering across the room people tapping their foot on the floor dripping taps  eventually even people breathing become unbearable for larry as he is constantly bombarded with mind piercing noise eventually larry decides hes had enough  if he cant stop the noises themselves then maybe he can stop himself hearing them with the help of a large meat cleverbr br this canadian american coproduction was episode 4 from season 2 of the generally hitandmiss masters of horror tv series written  directed by brad anderson i thought sounds like was a definite miss the script was based on a short story by mike odriscoll  i am genuinely surprised by the amount of very positive comments it has here on the imdb at the present time for a start i would be very hard pressed to even describe this as a horror film  it feels more like some bizarre sentimental drama until the last 5 minutes when howard berger gregory nicotero  the boys at knb effects actually get to do some work larry has this strange unexplained ability to amplify sound  noises from the start so this episode ends up like 55 minutes of exactly the same sort of repetitive build up which leads up to a gory ending although it comes to late to save the episode this is pretty slow going  while its well written isnt this meant to be horror themed  im slightly confused as to who this is meant to appeal tobr br director anderson does ok but he just keeps repeating the same things over  over again until the last 5 minutes there isnt a single drop of blood in the entire thing theres no horror theres no scares or tension  absolutely no atmospherebr br technically this is very well made has good production values  doesnt look like a cheap madefortv program the acting is very good actually  its shame the story is somewhat limitedbr br sounds like is one of the very worst masters of horror episodes a lot of people seem to like it  thats fine but its definitely not for me another masters of horror another disappointment
