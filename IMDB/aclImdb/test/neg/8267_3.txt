i found this an awfully disappointing experience but i have appended a better option of similar style at the foot of this entrybr br this felicias journey is intriguing it has drama but it is full of stereotypes br br so it only serves judgemental temperaments without concern for truer justice  fairness  truth beyond black n white judgements that fit 30second ads of news that dot our multimedia experiences everyday especially news bulletins true or misleading in such depictions br br it is so exaggerated it reminds me of the fairytale of little red ridinghood consider the innocent young girl with no identification crossing borders questioned by a guard but freed without any evidence to venture on in search of her romeo who didnt give her an address versus the pathetically inept lack of substance in the raspy voice of the helping hand befriending her with his unlikely story fabricated by the layer br br it seems to suit the directors  management team that noone has faith or prays to god even in their times of desperation br br so in these early settings it orchestrates  tells much of what is to come a nightmare journey that betrays the essence of substance without fairytale resolution without truth or integrity or credibility then one twist  its all over what a disappointment if you want to see a much superior movie that investigates similar themes with much more credibility with much more powerful insight watch the 1983 paul coxnorman kaye man of flowers movie br br unlike here you will not be disappointed
