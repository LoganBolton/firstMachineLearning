ohhhh man this movie is awfulbr br this kind of tripe is what gives canadian cinema a bad name or no name well to be fair i guess most canadian movies give canadian cinema a bad namebr br next to the characters theres a couple that are the most grating in movie history the most annoying thing is the editing and pace of the movie its like a drunken snail making its way to diebr br thank goodness melanie doane is nice to look at shes the only thing that kept me watching unfortunately the rest of the movie kept interruptingbr br good for a laugh though if youre having a bad canadian movie night thoughbr br did i mention melanie doane the only good point too bad they didnt have the sense to keep the camera on her for more than a blink at a timebr br another addition in the canadian hall of stinking movies
