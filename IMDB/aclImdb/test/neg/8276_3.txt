the title for this review about sums up how i feel about this movie i cant imagine what audience there would be for this thing if not for the diehard fan of 1980s slasher films who simply has to see everything from that era otherwise dont even waste your time on thisbr br the story is similar to most films of its type something awful happens to one of the characters in the opening scene which inspires a bloodthirsty killer to go on a murderous rampage been there done that truth be told none of these 80s slashers were known for their originality so i cant see the point in harping on the film simply for thisbr br but where the film fails is in its suspense and murder sequences ive seen some pretty scary slasher movies from the 1980s that had far lower budgets than this this one just fails to create any real suspense the director throws in some nice camera angles and some semiprofessional directorial touches here and there but they mean nothing if youre not frightened the gore is pretty tame as well so anyone who watches these things with the intention of seeing some cool 1980s makeup effects will be sadly disappointedbr br the movie manages to clunk along rather dully honestly the key ingredient to almost any slasher is the tight pacingyou have to keep things moving along swiftly and keep the murder set pieces staged at regular intervals because lets face it we dont watch these things for the great characterization and stellar plots but the pacing whether due to the script or the editor is all off the murders are spaced out at odd intervals leaving us with some longwinded scenes no doubt meant to build character that serve only to bore you and leave you praying for the next kill which as ive said usually isnt executed all that well anywaybr br as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening he or she wears a jogging suit a fencing mask and his or her primary weapon is a sword i bet the writer just wet himself over thinking he came up with an original cool murder weapon but the idea just comes off as impractical and silly theres also not much emphasis placed on the whodunnit nature of the film as if they either forgot or dont care to place any red herrings in the mix to throw us offbr br i have the sense that the people behind this were trying to make something decent and respectable and at times it shows their intentions were probably a bit more genuine in regards to making a quality film as opposed to countless other knockoff slashers from the era but alas the attempt fails for the most part there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film there is attempt at characterization but none of it ends up meaning anything in the end sowhat a waste here all it manages to do is bog down the plot and make the murder sequences feel like they cant come soon enoughbr br in the end if youre really into these old 80s slashers by all means check it out if only to say youve seen it theres a completest in all of us but dont expect to be blown away or anything what we have here is a very mildly entertaining slasher movie that leaves no real impression at all
