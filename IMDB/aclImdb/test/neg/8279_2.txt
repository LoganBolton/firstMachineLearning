graduation day  br br i bought this movie this past week and waited for some time where i could kick back and relax and watch some good 80s slasher gems i got this and xtro to watch never seen any of them i just watched it and realized my outdoor speakers were on also i only imagine what my neighbors thought when felony came on to sing their one 10 minute hit im sure it was loud and im sure they think im weird with that and the chainsaw sound and screaming from other moviesbr br this was a pretty sub par slasher movie no suspense no story some cool deaths almost seemed on the amateur side i usually like movies like that but it just didnt click with me now i will watch xtro for the 1st time and have a margaritabr br dj eric austin tx
