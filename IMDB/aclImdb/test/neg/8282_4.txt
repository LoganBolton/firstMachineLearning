first and foremost i wish to aim a big  mean middlefinger towards the troma dvddistribution crew who were actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movies pivot killer on the back of the cover the synopsis just randomly mentions whos the person responsible for the massacre on graduation day for christs sake i dont care how terrible or how predictable an 80s slasher can be just mentioning who did it ruins the whole point so a word of advise in case you also purchase the troma doublefeature containing graduation day and nymphoid barbarian in dinosaur hell do not  repeat do not  turn the box around and read the back watching the film is already a painful experience but reading the back would really spoil everythingbr br now as for the actual the actual movie oh boy personally im a fan of the cinematic work of herb freed well actually i dont really know whether i should admire himor pity him all herbs films are pretty bad  amateurish but at the same time you can tell his direction is spirited and full of good intentions unlike with haunts and beyond evil he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to cash in on the typical highschool slasher films just to offer a minimum of originality all the victims in graduation day are promising athletes and members of the same track of coach george michaels awesome name i guess herb freed is a fan of wham during the opening credits we witness how a young girl dramatically dies on the field moments after winning a 30 seconds running race the debate of whether or not her coach and fellow track teammembers werent pushing her physical limits too much is raised but one particular individual goes one step further and begins to sadistically kill everyone heshe considers responsible for lauras death what a demented little movie the script must be one of the most incoherent ones i ever beheld with loads of red herrings and sub plots that go absolutely nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words theres a bloke impaled by a football attached to a javelin others are decapitated with an absurdly big sword and the unluckiest bastard of them all even falls to his death on a disguised bed of spikes herb concentrates on the ingeniousness  the fast pacing of the killings so much that he totally forgets about the sub plots he introduced earlier in the film for example lauras sister returns home from her military training and seemly starts an investigation regarding the circumstances of her death halfway through the movie however her character hardly appears in the movie anymore also the girls stepfather is referred to as a violent drunkard but this interesting given immediately gets ignored as well instead of carefully mounted suspense and misleading red herrings were served discodancing  rollerskating sequences and  of course  numerous images of unattractive 80s chicks stripping their tops off despite being really bad graduation day could count on a respectable cast christopher george grizzly city of the living dead greatly stars as the demanding coach carmen argenziano when a stranger calls the accused briefly appears as a police detective investigating the rising number of missing teenagers and michael pataki dead  buried draculas dog has a very amusing part as the schools stressed out principal the teenage beauties on duty include linnea quigley and vanna white heck for some horror fans the presence of these two ladies is enough reason already to count graduation day among the most quintessential slashers of the early 80s its a dumb film but entertainment and chuckles are guaranteed
