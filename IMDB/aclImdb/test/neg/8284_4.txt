after their star crosscountry runner dies after a race the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a mysterious masked murderer seeking vengeance for the girls deathbr br from the beginning of this film it was quite obvious it was not going to be very good at least as far as true quality goes the dramatic track race at the end of the introduction scene was one of the least believable sporting events ive ever seen in a film it would seem that the winner of the race had never actually run before in her entire life not just run track   but run at all ever from there we get a horribly unrealistic female navy member who was breaking numerous appearance rules with her jewelry and makeup not to mention the fact that her hair was hanging loose onto her collar while in uniform ridiculously awkward camera angles pathetically done gore effects and acting that ranged from frighteningly overthetop to boringly under done all in one actor mind you all help to make this film one of the most unintentionally hilarious horror films ever made on the other hand the writing wasnt all that terrible and the story was actually okay but the direction was horrible made worse by offensively bad cinematography the acting ranged from acceptable to just plain abysmal regardless of all the embarrassingly bad elements however theres something here whether it be cheese or something else that i cant figure out that makes the film extremely enjoyable and very worthy of a watch maybe it was just vanna whitebr br obligatory slasher elementsbr br  violencegore death scenes were fun enough but the gore was just awful blood squirts from impossible angles no actual gashes or wounds from knives etc but this film has the first death by football scene ive ever seenbr br  sexnudity there was a bit of nudity i mean linnea quigley is in it after all and some overly horny high schoolers but nothing to excessbr br  cool killers if you think leather gloves stop watches track suits and fencing masks are cool this one is for youbr br  scaressuspense not really any at all there is one moment that takes place in the girls locker room that i was preparing myself to be scared at   but it just led to some typical stupidity and was ruined for mebr br  mystery a little but if you cant figure out the killers identity about 20 minutes into the film then im not too sure about your powers of deductionbr br  awkward dance scene theres a great impromptu jam session graduation day blues with a guitar  harmonica that leads to some awesome 80s bopping this is followed shortly by some kind of weird blend of 70s disco and 80s break dancing that was probably the scariest part of the filmbr br final verdict 410 dont take it too seriously and you might enjoy it just like most everything else troma touchesbr br ap3
