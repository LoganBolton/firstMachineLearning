six months after highschool sprinter laura dies during a race a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons thats the daft plot of early 80s slasher graduation day a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style originality or decent gorebr br what it does deliver however are some stunningly awful musical interludes a few familiar faces including an early appearance from screamqueen linnea quigley and a smattering of nudity a prerequisite of any slasher moviebr br so forget the death scenestheyre lame and rather bloodlessand instead enjoy the movies more memorably crap elements the rapid editing that can induce migraines and epileptic seizures the roller disco which is accompanied by a prolonged heavy rock song  gangster rock as performed by the unforgettably awful felony an impromptu jamming session by the schools students christopher george hamming it up as chief redherring coach michaels and the cheesy music teacher who letches after his female students who for some reason find him quite irresistiblebr br towards the end of the film the action picks up a little with the discovery of the slaughtered kids bodies under the bleachers and a quite twisted scene featuring lauras corpse in her cap and gown but it all comes way to late in the day to save this film from mediocrity
