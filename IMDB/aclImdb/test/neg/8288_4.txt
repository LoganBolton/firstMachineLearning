ive got to say that im not a massive fan of troma films granted ive only seen three of them or four including this one but two blood sucking freaks and mothers day are widely reputed to be the best which leads me to believe that all the others arent worth seeing that would certainly seem to be the case with graduation day which is a troma take on the overpopular eighties slasher while the film is never particularly bad given the type of film its never particularly good either and by the end all i could think about was why did i bother watching this anyway the plot sees some girl die on a race track and shortly thereafter more people start dying naturally there are a few possible suspects but its hard to really care about anything that happens of course in slasher terms its the gore that is most important and given tromas track record where the red stuff is concerned i was expecting buckets of it there are some decent kill scenes and some of them are gory but its never very shocking which really just makes this another dreary slasher based on a celebratory event on the american calendar its worth noting that theres a small role in this film for sleaze queen linnea quigley but the rest of the cast arent worth mentioning the direction plot and its execution are all very mundane and i will say that unless youre a big troma fan or someone that wants to track down every slasher ever made dont bother with this film
