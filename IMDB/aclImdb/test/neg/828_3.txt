may contain spoilers for about the last four years ive been a keen fan of ali g sacha baron cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and in my view his best creation is borat whos as funny as hell and quite shameless in what he does and says to peoplebr br anyway to the movie i didnt bother paying money to see this in the cinema i suppose because i didnt expect a lot but when i hired the dvd recently i found the whole thing pretty sad the best part of alis taking the mickey out of others was largely missing and the script an plot was pretty damned awful hooking all the car batteries together to blow a safe  really br br this movie goes to show i think that some things can run for too long and definitely dont translate to the big screen the movie also had that syrupy sweet ending that ive come to expect from british films where have all the good british movie making ideals gone to that said there were the odd very funny moments such as the dog in alis bed and alis audience with hm the q with the shaven haven  respect remarkbr br so in summary i am an ali g and borat fan and i have enjoyed many of his interviews notably the one with anita roddick of the body shop but this movie fell really flat with me if theres to be another movie i hope its a whole lot better than this lot of old tripebr br weasel100 br br canberra australia
