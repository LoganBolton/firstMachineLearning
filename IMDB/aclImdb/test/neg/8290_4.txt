graduation day is a result of the success of friday the 13th both of those films are about creative bloody murders rather than suspense if you enjoy that type of film id recommend graduation day if not i wouldnt theres nothing new here just the same old killingsbr br even though ive given the film a 4 out of 10 i will say that its not a repulsive film it is watchable if your curious about it just not creative
