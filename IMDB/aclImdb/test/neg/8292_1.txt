while i am a longtime shatner fan since we used to watch trek reruns over the dinner hour in the early 70s i cannot think of any possible reason why he wanted to do this film whether for personal development or business reasons did he lose a betbr br as a movie fan i like to appreciate the bad films along with the great ones but shoot or be shot doesnt have any flair or funny bits unintentional or notbr br while unrated there were no objectionable scenes blink or youll miss it nudity cartoonish gunfire violence with the endless bullet gunfights so one is led to believe that the producers merely wanted to save the fee required to get the mpaa to rate it this will make its way to cable with barely 10 seconds edited outbr br of the eight people that were in the theatre with us four of them left midway muttering statements like this is stupidbr br shatner plays an escaped mental patient who has been denied release because he views himself as a screenwriter the examination board stamps his request insane he runs into a group of zgrade moviemakers who shoot on video because its 80 cheaper than film and decides to force them to shoot his script at gunpoint there are a few minor subplots that develop some of the secondary characters but for the most part that is the whole moviebr br if you want to spend 90 minutes on a shatner art film see free enterprise instead it is a much better film
