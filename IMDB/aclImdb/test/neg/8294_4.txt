ok a film about a film that takes a crack at video movie making could be entertaining could be should be funny edgy even controversial or at least interesting and yet this film is the bizzaro negative version of that hamlin was entertaining as a b film producer shatner played crazy yet likable and had all the best lines the rest of the characters were boring predictable boring underdeveloped boring and boring the production value was lame youll actually see the boom come down in one scene the sound was awful in some of the scenes hey im a big fan of shatners and of hamlin now but their talents are wasted here at least the story had a clich√©d ending
