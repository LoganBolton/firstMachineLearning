some of the secondary actors try really hard and camera shots in the desert are quite lovely otherwise this film is horriblebr br william shatners character harvey is an amateur screenwriter hes also a psychopath a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie even if that means taking a film crew hostage do amateur screenwriters  grovel maybe they dobr br the films setup is way too long we dont get to the point of the story until well into the second half the first half darts and flits among assorted charactersbr br shoot or be shot is touted as a comedy but i found it totally not funny dialogue contains no subtext none of the characters are believable as real people theyre all stick figures that perform action in a way that resembles cartoon characters indeed the film is basically a cartoon for adults silly inane birdbrainedbr br i can understand why some actors are in this film they need the money or the exposure but what are insiders shatner and harry hamlin doing here maybe shatner wants more comedy roles is this the best he can do is hamlin that desperate for money he used to be a respected actor what happenedbr br even though the story is supposed to be a satire it comes across more as a putdown of amateur screenwriters maybe that wasnt the intent but thats certainly how the film can be interpreted as such the script was very very poorly written
