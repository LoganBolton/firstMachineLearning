this movie clearly has an agenda which could be summed up like this never never cross the border either physical or metaphorical lets shun everything thats on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else lets pretend all gringos are evil satanic or drug dealers all that is outside ones countrys border and specially us borders is dangerous malevolent and people there will hate you or envy you or try to steal you or something else the based on true events is only a perverse tag that can be pinned on anything to give it some aura of credibility or in this case just to help pushing the films ideology down some na√Øve throats out there the perversity of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries people and all else into very black and white stereotyped categories mexicans into disgusting people mexican police into a bunch of corrupt cops republicans into the rightwing morons democrats into almost hippie humanists and so forth is there anything good about the film i hardly think so but may be you think differently
