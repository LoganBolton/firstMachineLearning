although i had previously watched this one some time ago on italian tv i found it to be a surprisingly tolerable potboiler this time round buoyed by an international cast of familiar faces including a bemused joseph cotten as the baron and contrary to many another film of the eurocult subgenre an incidentpacked plot in place of lethargic pacingbr br the creature itself looks a bit dodgy and cotten is a bit too old to be taken seriously as an eager scientist still dabbling in creating lifeforms out of corpses one would have thought that he would have made himself an army of them by now and not struggling at perfecting his technique still but ms neri does look good in and out of costume and reliable herbert fux probably comes off best as a lecherous graverobberblackmailer
