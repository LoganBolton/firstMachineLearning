okay anyone looking to see a great work of art should not watch this film a sophisticated film connoisseur will no doubt be nauseated by the horrid production values and the sight of watching an excellent actor joseph cotten whoring himself out for a buck mr cotten must have either really needed the money or he was too senile to realize that the film was crap the same phenomenon occurred with dana andrews who late in his career appeared in the campy and awful frozen dead i know mr andrews was in the throes of alcoholism but why did cotten do this messbr br as for the plot its a reworking of the frankenstein plot the first half of the movie really looked as if they were doing a serious but seriously flawed version of the original frankenstein story then inexplicably they introduced a daughter this wasnt a bad thinguntil then out of the blue they decided to stop making a horror film but make a softcore pornographic flick the change was dramatic and bizarre it was almost as if they said okay mr cotten is done with his scenes and has gone homenow ladiesstripbr br the problem is that on every level the film is just awful except for the monsters makeup while not great it is still pretty cool to see but bad writing acting and a budget of 1746 conspired to make this a drab and awful flickone so bad that tossing in some nudity for the pervs out there shouldnt be enough to entice anyone to see it
