i watched death machines as part of bci eclipse drivein cult classics featuring crown international pictures releases on dvd as i work my way through the multiple dvd sets i am growing to love many of crown internationals movies  especially the creepy erotic psychological thrillers br br death machines is not one of thembr br after seeing movies like malibu beach the creeping terror and the pink angels it is hard to say that this is the worst film ever made but it doesnt have much going for itbr br no plot really no story to speak ofbr br the acting isnt evident Â– only the actor responsible for the terriblyplayed tony with the thick fake italian accent made any attempt to get into character br br the score is annoying and pedanticbr br the only thing about this movie is why what compelled the filmmakers to make this film br br did they think the story of 1 three ninjas 2 two competing crime bosses 3 an ancillary bartender  karate school student character and 4 his pitiful loveinterest nurse was so compelling that the world would not be complete without this movie being made br br this is a complete waste of time and money for you me the producers writers actors and the director
