what a gargantuan pile of malodorous ordure ye gods where to even begin with this onebr br well mix crap acting including one bloody infuriating woman who speaks as though shes either a chewing painfully on some ice cubes or b has just woken up after having undergone some extensive root canal surgery editing that would appear to donate that the celluloid was cut and spliced via the utilisation of an angle grinder some truly hopelessly choreographed martial arts action a script that has ostensibly been written by a two year old and some of the most hideous and intrusively loud background music ever committed to any film and hey presto you have death machines aka the ninja murders although note that surprise surprise  there are in fact no actual ninja anywhere to be found in this sodding travesty br br in a nutshell if ever there was a cinematic equivalent of a particularly vehement bout of dysentery then this must surely be it avoid at all costs
