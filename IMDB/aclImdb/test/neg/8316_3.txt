a lot of good things could have been done with this movie using essentially the same sets plot devices and storyline for example why not plant a seed of ericas capability before the murder of her lover why not develop erica and the cops relationship slowly and convincingly maybe contrast erics metamorphis by including some other postevent facet relationship etc in her life that she now rejects why not have her injure an innocent bystander to underscore the wrongness in ericas actionsbr br instead tbo exploits the revenge fantasy to its maximum level giving insincere lip service to the dont do this at home messages thrown in only to allow the film to qualify as legitimatebr br im not a jodie foster fan after displaying some range in films like silence of the lambs nell and one where she plays the ordinary mother of a child prodigy foster has slipped into a succession of roles where she plays the same hardbitten badgered heroine singlehandedly overcoming evil such is fine once or twice but im getting too used to her fight versus flight closeup tbo could have used a younger actress or one that more convincingly embraced being a woman in her forties instead of 40something foster playing a younger womanbr br tbo is a movie with substantial actors financing and resources that manages to descend to junk
