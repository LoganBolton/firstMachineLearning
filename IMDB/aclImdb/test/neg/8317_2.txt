i dont know what neighborhoods the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in but im glad im not there if they dont comment on the cartoonishness of this thing okay we learn to suspend our disbelief in films like the die hard series but seeing little jodie knock off a whole street gang with a glock as a novice yetcmon all she needed was a bald head and a ripped tshirt and she would be bruce willis br br apparently jodie being the executive producer blinded her to what a joke and waste of her money this would be or she was living out some kind of fantasy where she is the only blonde and everyone else is a brunette black or hispanic even the dog is black little blondie is the only good one and except for a black police officer everyone else in town is some nasty minority out to get her has your fear of your acting talent declined so far that you think the only way you can get noticed is to be the only bright spot literally on camera in a dark morose and somber neighborhoodfilmcast apparently she thought she was in the wrong moviethe dark knightbr br ridiculous plot holes furniture chewing acting gratuitous violence look girls now you can do it toospend the time with your family instead of watching this drek
