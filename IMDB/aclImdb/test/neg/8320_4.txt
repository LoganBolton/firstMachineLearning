the brave one seems to indicate that the main character of course is brave id disagree the more brave thing to do in a situation like the one that happens to her getting brutally beaten along with her fianc√©e who doesnt live another day from it is to go after the criminals without resorting to a total distorted view of society jodie fosters character erica is a radio personality whos niche is walking the streets and recording what goes on were given no real depth aside from she had someone she loved he died the police dont pursue it she gets a gun yadayadayada she gets somewhat but not really involved with the lead detective into the character and so were left with something leftover from past movies the vigilante code of justice where taking the power in ones own hands is all there is but were never too sure if erica is sane or not if the filmmakers take a position one way or another that is until the end which is such a stupid message to take anyway dog included as overbearing metaphor while making the new york city of today which has become significantly safer than say twenty years ago look like youll get knifed or beaten if you go down just the right alley or just sit alone on a subway carbr br there could even be a somewhat better movie in the midst of all of this perhaps just in the undercooked subplot with terence howards detective who is involved in some custody battle of a child that isnt his and a woman who hes not linked to and a stepfather who i dont know what aside from owning parking lots and being a bad dude but were left to a script thats both hamfisted and disjointed with logic it becomes laughable for example to see that at first the logical side of erica unable to really shoot properly as seen in her first shooting in a convenience store at the convenient moment of a robbery of a wife by the husband and then giving way to the illogical of her crackshot at shooting at a pimp driving a car head on at her and killing him and ducking just in time to not get run over it doesnt help that jordons style with the camera becomes a little more than insufferable its called a stedicam for a reason not because it can weave in and outbr br ironically the script and direction become very good or rather work the best they can under the desired circumstances when looking at the actual beating scene under the bridge caught between a videotaped point of view by one of the criminals by the regular film cam in a pace that is perfectly disorienting and when erica first comes back on the air to her radio show and she freezes up trying to do her old shtick and speaks out a fromtheheart about how afraid she is this scene from fosters performance to the clear direction and script is the best scene in the film but aside from that theres just a lot of posturing into a psychology thats flimsy is she a de niro in taxi driver or a bronson in death wish we have her narration over scenes some of it doesnt have to do at all with her radio show observing how disgusted she is with walking around at night nothing to do but her selfimposed task of cleaning up the streets but unlike death wish a movie that held more ambiguity and never held an answer at the end in a revenge scenario the path of endless violence just heeds to a message one that wont be news to anyone whos seen a second of lifetime movieoftheweek melodramabr br the actors make do with whats given and in the end it becomes much more frustrating trying to stay with the anticipated the hackneyed plot turns and the plain old inexplicable plus the unintentionally hilarious like a few expletives shouted by howard after getting shot in one scene and the temptation to walk out grows stronger and stronger its a very problematic picture with only a few moments of genuine interest and clearheaded conventionbending
