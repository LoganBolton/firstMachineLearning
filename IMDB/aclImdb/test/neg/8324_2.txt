this review is based on the english language versionbr br orson welles legendary unfinished epic was just that  unfinished it should have been left as such not thrown together in this clumsy boring compilation of whatever material was availablebr br while im sure it was done with the best of intentions the filmmakers have not only failed to do justice to welles vision theyve also managed to discredit it by inflicting this version upon audiencesbr br the first thing that strikes the viewer is the amateurish quality of the audio not only are the newly dubbed voices rather poor performances theyre also inconsistent  welles original recordings using his own voice as he often did have been retained in a handful of scenes  they dont match at all there hasnt been the slightest attempt at consistency add to that an extremely empty sound mix which has only a bare minimum of sound effects  atmos  a long sequence during a huge festival including the running of the bulls sounds like it was recorded in a deserted suburban street with about three people making the sound of a crowd thats meant to be in the thousandsbr br however the real problem is the unavoidable fact that don quixote was incomplete  its glaringly obvious from watching this the film consists of a handful of scenes strung together  dragged out to ridiculous lengths just to make up the running time case in point  the sequence where sancho searches for don quixote in the city goes on forever its just sancho approaching people in the crowd asking them the same questions over  over again  there is no way that welles could ever have intended using every single take in its entirety but thats what appears here it lasts over twelve minutes when in fact it would most likely have lasted about two minutes absolute maximum in a proper finished version of the film br br while the start of the film is relatively complete  rather well done the rest has massive holes which simply cant be filled with endless overlay of spanish countryside  still more shots of don quixote  sancho going back  forth theres also no ending no resolution no conclusion no punchline no pointbr br although there is material in private collections that was unavailable to the filmmakers that couldnt possibly account for what would be required to make this into a complete coherent work welles simply didnt complete shooting largely due to the fact that his lead actor died before they could finishbr br however putting aside the fact that it wasnt complete  never could be one would think that just seeing a collection of footage from this masterpiece that might have been would be enough unfortunately by putting it all together in such a slipshod manner one is left with a very negative impression of the film overall in particular what was clearly a terrific performance from akim tamiroff as sancho is utterly ruined with the new voice  with long drawn out scenes that eventually cause him to be simply irritatingbr br orson welles vision for this film was something far more ambitious  complex than a simple retelling of the story of don quixote but thats what has been attempted here  as such the point is lost the only person who could have assembled all the material into anything worthwhile would have been welles himself  he didntbr br the footage could have been put to far better use in a documentary chronicling the whole saga of welles trying to make the film welles himself even came up with the perfect title for such a doco when are you going to finish don quixote
