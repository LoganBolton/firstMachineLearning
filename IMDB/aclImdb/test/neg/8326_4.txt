black vengeance is an alternate title for ying hung ho hon aka tragic hero 1987 i have just seen this on vhs together with the first part of the story gong woo ching rich and famous also 1987 the poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4dvd set of movies starring rod perry the black gestapo fred williamson black cobra 2 richard lawson black fist the fourth movie is called the black six strangely while the characters retain their original names in rich and famous in black vengeance chow yunfats character is named eddie shaw alex man man tze leung is harry and andy lau is called johnny also confusing is the fact that 1994 is given as the copyright dates on both films perhaps that was the year they were americandubbed according to the release dates given on imdb tragic hero was released before rich and famous was there any reason for releasing the sequel first despite some users comments i enjoyed these films although they arent among cyfs best such as the killer and hardboiled which are truly astonishing howeverif one day i come across a 2dvd set of rich and famous and tragic hero i wont hesitate to buy it hopefully these comments about black vengeance clear up which was also for me a mystery as to where it belonged in chow yunfats filmography
