ok yes i know im a philistine and i have no knowledge of nor love for opera i readily admit that i might feel differently about this film if i did but i dont so for those of you like me skip this one unless you want to look at the pretty sometimes unclothed girls for what its worth i thought the first segment with theresa russell who i didnt recognize was the best of the lot
