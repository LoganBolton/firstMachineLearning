the director is sweet as is his codirecting wife shira geffen but their movie sucks it has its moments and some pretty girls but there is too much of everything am√©lie meets breaking the waves meets pauline at the beach you walk away wanting to know more about the wedding photographer and about the girl who likes it best when nothing happens be it in movies or in real life instead you get a suicidal writer a neurotic actress and an illegalimmigrantcomesocialworker with a heart of gold it feels like theres more than one truly touching story hidden in the script but at face value its a truckload of wasted story lines and sentimental bullshit hard to sit out as it is
