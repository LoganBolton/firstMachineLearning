i went to see this because id never seen telaviv where the story is set i was disappointed since it doesnt offer many views of israels largest metropolis its also pretentiousone of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a shrug of the shouldersbr br the main protagonist is batya a woman in her twenties who works as a waitress at catered weddings her parents evidently dont care about her very much and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her batya feels compelled to take care of her the little girl doesnt speak and batya cant give her to social services because its the weekend and the agency is closed so she takes her back to her apartment with the leaky roof and when it comes time to work in the evening she has to take the little girl with her the boss is very unhappy about this and other shortcomings in batyas work performancebr br another main character is keren who is getting married at her wedding party where batya is of course working she breaks her leg climbing out of a ladies room cubicle whose door wont open and so she and her new husband cannot take the caribbean vacation theyve planned they end up in a dingy hotel on the seafront without a view it smells bad there is noise from the traffic and keren is complaining all the time her husband meets a strangely attractive older woman  a writer  who is also staying in the hotel and keren worries that he has slept with this strangerbr br the third main character is a filipino woman named joy who looks after old people the old woman she is hired to care for is very crabby and speaks no english only german and hebrew joy speaks english but no hebrew or german joy is mostly concerned with how her son is doing back in the philippines and wants to buy him a toy boat as he has asked she finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it the daughter of the old woman who hired joy is an actress appearing in some sort of postmodern physical theater adaptation of hamlet and does not get along with her motherbr br the way in which these three storieswhich intersect momentarilyresolve themselves is presumably supposed to mean something profound i didnt get it there is a fantasy element to batyas relationship with the little girl and maybe batyas nonexistent relationship with her parents is somehow inverted in this relationship when joy sees the toy boat in the shop window there is a strange effect used where the little sails billow as if blown by the wind and they do this as if they are on the scale of a reallife ship keren draws the outline of a bottle around a ship that is on a brochure cover in the hotel room and a narration of the strange womans poetry mentions a ship in a bottle but what does all this mean i thought about it for a while and realized i wasnt going to lose any sleep in the process if anyone out there has a clear idea of what its all about maybe they can fill me in
