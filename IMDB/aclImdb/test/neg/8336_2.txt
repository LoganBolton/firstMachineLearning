a horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toebendingly poor delivered pc clich√©s ad nauseam races working together the heroine being smart as well pretty a guy sacrificing himself to save another life a fatherdaughter relationship etc etc etc the movie looks like something created for network television and should have probably stayed there even the gifted tommy lee jones does not manage to salvage this bomb i urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin from the time when disastermovies roamed hollywoodbr br the two stars are given solely to the cgipeople and the prpeoples ability to get even one moviegoer to sit through it
