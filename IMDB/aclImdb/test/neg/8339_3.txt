when i saw this movie all i could think was what a disaster no im not talking about the volcano but about the movie itself i have seen a lot of movies but this is certainly one of the worst ever i dont care about the fact if a volcano erupting underneath downtown la is possible or not perhaps it isnt but even than this could have been a good movie but it sure isnt and ill explain you whybr br i dont know how much lava flows out of an average volcano but what i do know is that the volcano in this movie makes the vesuvius etna and mount pinatubo together look like a little barbecue i dont think there has ever been so much lava flowing out of a volcano as what we see in this film im sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his movie but i really wonder why he all spent it on the special effects and not on the script and the actors im not saying that he should have hired a top cast but this really is the opposite of what i would call good acting their performances are so unbelievably poor that it makes the entire movie even worsebr br and whats wrong about the script you probably ask yourself well can you tell me who comes up with the idea of people standing a few yards or even a few feet from the lava without getting burned or having to hide for the heath or people sinking in the earth when the flow of lava isnt even two foot high br br im sure i wouldnt be proud if i wrote such a script but apparently there are script writers in hollywood who dont mind about believability as long as it pays good money very good moneybr br when you see the movie youll probably agree with me that this is one of hollywoods worst disaster movies not worth more than a 310
