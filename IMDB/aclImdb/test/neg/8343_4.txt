this film is all right fairly silly and to be taken lightly but what i cant stand are the numerous heroes and that boys illegaly sentimental comment near the end look they all look the same isnt that by far passing the good taste standards i thought it was revolting as were the heroic unselfish acts by some of the people in this film im not saying it wont happen like that but zooming in on all the bravery like that makes my stomach churn
