volcano is set in los angeles where a minor earthquake has just hit vacationing boss of the oem the offcie of emergency management mike roark tommy lee jones decides to cut his holiday short  go in once there he sees that everything is alright but then drives off to the epicentre of the quake where seven underground workers have been killed by a fire or intense heat of some kind mike isnt sure what to think so he brings geologist dr amy barnes anne heche in to try  explain things unfortunately a huge underground river of molten lava has been released after the quake  erupts at the la brea tar pits sending the lava pouring out into the city streets engulfing anything  everything it touches in flames mike his men  the emergency services have their work cut out trying to stop the river of lava  save as many lives as possiblebr br directed by mick jackson this was the second big budget disaster flick revolving around the idea of an erupting volcano during 1997 with dantes peak 1997 being released a mere two months or so before volcano was  while dantes peak is hardly any sort of masterpiece at least its slightly better  more plausible than volcano is the script here is total nonsense  is not based in reality at all underground rivers of lava that seem to appear  then disappear just as quick various characters standing inches from a river of lava yet not being affected by the heat when that guy is on the train the metal seats around him start melting but he remains perfectly fine as far as i am aware human skin is not as heat resistant as metal is it  it constantly happens helicopters flying is clouds of ash in reality it would be impossible one simple blockade at the end of a street will stop the flowing lava what about down the other streets  other directions being able to blow a perfect trench in a street  then blowing a huge building up to make a massive dam  when kelly sees the lava heading towards her car she gets out just like anyone would but then for some reason just stands there  watches two firemen get burned to death  waits for her dad to save her even though by this stage her leg has caught fire despite all those concrete blocks being placed together to make a barrier in less than twenty minutes the guys do such a great job not one bit of molten lava manages to seep through  loads more besides like that massive building falling on tommy lee  his daughter yet then both being fine afterwards the characters are awful too although they were not as clich√©d as usual with no romance blossoming between tommy lee  anne heche  minimal city officials who try to shut tommy lee  anne heche up before the event labelling them scaremongers theres a few badly written  at times embarrassing moral moments as los angeles pulls together the black guy  that semi racist cop who warm to each other  by the end are wishing each other well  that little kid at the end when he says everyone looks the same is cringe worthy  is surely a hamfisted attempt  trying to say whatever colour we are we are still human beings  we can all get along in time of a crisis as it brings people together having said that i think volcano is one of those so bad its good films it entertains  it moves along at a decent pace but just dont expect anything grounded in reality or any human drama eitherbr br i suppose a film like volcano could be seen as an updating of a 70s disaster film such as the poseidon adventure 1972 or earthquake 1974 but on a huge budget with modern effects work speaking of the effects they are alright but none stand out that much  the setpieces are also surprisingly forgettable sure there are a few impressive explosions  a few ok river of lava flowing through los angeles effects but little else generally volcano just isnt very exciting  while occasionally unintentionally funny  completely ridiculous it doesnt really work in the way the makers intendedbr br with a supposed budget of about 90000000 it opened to a little under 15000000 at the boxoffice it looks alright  theres lots of fire but nothing stands out  volcano is a pretty forgettable film overall filmed in los angeles i think most of the places featured here were shot at their real life locations the cast go through the motions with some terrible dialogue  ridiculous setpieces to contend with tommy lee jones deserves better than thisbr br volcano is a bit of a disaster in both senses it is a disaster themed film that ended up a bit of disaster itself worth it for a few unintentional laughs  the ridiculousness of it all but its nothing great  i doubt i would ever want to see it again
