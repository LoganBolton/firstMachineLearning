although this movie and i use the term loosely was made in 1997 we just watched it tonight for the first time my husband commented that a tommy lee jones movie that wed never heard of made him a little apprehensive i blithely watched anyway certain that if jones was in the movie it must at least be worth two hours of my time after all he has been one of our goto actors for years although heche isnt one of my favorite actresses i was additionally reassured by seeing another wellknown face the list of accomplished actorsactresses continued to grow so i endured more and more of this film certain that if i pushed through enough clich√©s and trite social statements i would arrive victorious on the other side of the plot alas there was no plot it appeared to be burned by the everoozing lava of doombr br the characters were paperthin the plot was so chock full of holes that it literally distracted me from most of the special effects and acting in the movie was the fee for a brief consultation with an elementary science teacher too much for this films budget no acid rainno toxic gasses like sulfur or hydrochlorideno deadly ashno skinsearing heat just a few feet from the lava wowits the worlds friendliest lava ever br br the events were no better than the characters each incident was so contrived and farfetchedits like the writers said okay we need to get rid of the little girl nowand poof shes splashed by a lava bomb which burns her enough that she has to be carried to safety not from the lava but from her own helpless stuporbut just moments later in the car she is in no apparent pain and soon after is running effortlessly through the groan building that oh no is about to be blown up after enduring all of this your reward is the line from the little boy at the end about all the people looking the samewhich has got to be one of the worst movie lines i have ever heard even if it wasnt so painfully scripted it was ridiculous timing for all the characters involved kid and cop aside as if the mother would still be in the area and just needs to be pointed out because she just isnt speaking upwhatshes hoping to slink off into the shadows and get away from the little brat once and for all i dont think so obviously the childs mother would be missing or dead  or yelling her head off to find her toddlerbr br the token black gangsta tough hoodlum with a secret soft spot versus the chip on his shoulder narrow minded cracker cop with a secret soft spot scene made my eyes bleed even if such pat characters existed they wouldnt behave as the movie portrays them given the circumstances something about imminent fiery death and massive destruction tends to catch people offguard ya know br br there are too many canned movie moments like these to mentionreally its just an embarrassing movie to watch those poor writerswhere are they now
