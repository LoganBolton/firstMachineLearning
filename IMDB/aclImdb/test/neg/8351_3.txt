volcano is a bmovie at best and at worst is more of a disaster that what its supposed to be depicting to be fair you have to be prepared in any movie to suspend disbelief for one major concept volcano asks you to suspend disbelief in science human interaction and common sensebr br tommy lee jones gets to be the studlyyet1990ssensitive head honcho of the office of emergency management and hes fine when hes not stuck with the stupid dialogue the script provides however anne heche gives a howlingly bad performance as a smartass geologist who becomes roarks love interest while the city is burning down natch gaby hoffman goes from field of dreams and american president to a turn as a whimpering needy and victimforlife daughter of jones don cheadle gets to sit in a really coooool office and take joness phone calls doing the job that in reality roark would and should be doingbr br anyway the movie really starts going downhill when heches geology partner gets sucked into a lava vent while theyre breaking into the subway lines it picks up speed when jones starts suggesting that they use buses to dam the flow of the lava flowing down the street heches geologist who loves to lecture everyone about the science of geology being apparently oblivious to the fact that lava is hot and it melts metal and rock and a dead bus is unlikely to have much effect it really starts to suck when the film introduces rodney kinglike racial tension between two bad actors dressed as cops and an angry black man who cant understand why the fire department is busy with this large river of flowing lava but hey in the end the three of them will be working together to build a krail dam to stop the lava from eating up his neighborhood even though the dam is built in the wrong direction and the material used wouldnt stop lava anyway besides krails are hardly watertight but i guess lava wouldnt think to poke its head through the gaps not when tommy lee jones is glaring at it dont even get me started on the strandedsubwaycar subplot where a tunnelful of hot lava is coming down but oddly enough its not too hot to attempt a rescue its not too smoky to see and there arent any poisonous gases so everyone can breathe this must be la lava or lava lite you know it eats cars but is ecofriendlybr br there are moments of sheer camp here that almost make you wonder if this was meant to be a comedy for instance the two security guards packing up hieronymus bosch paintings have a completely meaningless and farcical conversation about weight and at the end no sooner does the little boy roarkjones rescued note that everyone looks the same while covered in ash than a rainstorm breaks out and cleans everyone up  and then the sun comes out and heche says something along the lines of aw shucks roarkbr br volcano almost achieves battlefield earth status but except for heche no one approaches travoltalike badness and the technical aspects are handled pretty well if you are from the la area as i am its kind of funny to think of a lava flow wiping out wilshire boulevard i gave it a three for the effects and the little amount of tension you get from this
