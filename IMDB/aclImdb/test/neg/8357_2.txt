i am writing this review simply because i am a huge fan of the book prozac nation and was appalled by the filmbr br i think that if you hadnt read the book you would have been lost watching the film as it provided no real back story to wurtzels depression there was no real mention of her childhood her relationship with her father her experiences at summer camp her first therapists in fact the film gives the impression that she has never been in therapy until dr sterling that said if you had read the book you would have been confused by the amount of editing that had taken placebr br i found the book to be a vivid portrayal of depression highlighting wurtzels low points and the experiences she had along the way the film however began at harvard and literally threw the audience straight in with no real explanation of what was going onbr br events that in the book were important such as wurtzels miscarriage her summer working in dallas her suicide attempt whilst on prozac were omitted from the filmbr br also this is pedantic but wurtzel did not lose her virginity to noah the suicide attempt that was shown in sterlings office was completely different to the book for a start she actually overdosed on mellaril as opposed to the parasuicidal gesture shown in the filmbr br all in all i would say that if you have read the book and enjoyed itidentified with it then dont watch the film read more now again by the same author instead or watch girl interruptedbr br the only redeeming feature was the performance by anne heche who i believe portrayed dr sterling very well christina ricci was also good though her performance seemed a little stilted jessica lange made for enjoyable viewing but looked the opposite of how wurtzels mother is described in the bookbr br conclusion dont bother
