i found it almost impossible to empathize with riccis character in this film if she was supposed to be a depressive i think the screenwriter and director neglected to research depressives before making this film because riccis character was more a depiction of a selfcentered worthless shtbag than a victim and survivor of depressionbr br the forced attempt at introspective narration was as ludicrous as the pained interactions between her and the people around her br br sorry but i couldnt buy it this is straight to video schlock im glad i didnt pay to see this
