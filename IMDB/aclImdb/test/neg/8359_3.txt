there must have been a lot of background info that was left out of the movie in fact in the film the girl lizzy didnt even appear depressed she just seemed like a girl that went out of control when she finally got to college mainly from doing drugs and drinking alcohol that seemed to be her problem not mental illness sure she had emotional problems because her dad left and she barely saw him as a child and her mom seemed a little out there but the way she treated noah and ruby was just mean and i dont think caused by depression she was very needed which ran rafe off but she was like that because of her dadbr br but i think the main reason this movie never achieved a theater release is that not enough happens with the plot and the story is not written wellbr br final verdict truthfully id only recommend this if you are interested in seeing riccis first nude scene otherwise it isnt very interesting
