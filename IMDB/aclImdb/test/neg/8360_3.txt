in the real world of art elizabeth wurtzel is the sexy drama queen every guy wants to do but no guy wants to wake up next to her onscreen portrayer christina ricci is the ugly artsy wannabe girl that desperately wants every and any guy but no guy will touch her thats why in prozac nation the unreleased 2001 film of wurtzels 1990s bestseller book of the same name there are immediate problems ok the problems start before the miscast of ricci who has the emotional range of a thimble is it any wonder that by far her finest acting was in the two addams family films first off she is bizarre looking with big eyes and a bulging forehead making her look like the fetal starchild from 2001 a space odyssey secondly she always plays whiney brats but thirdly is the way films try to make it appear any guy would be attracted to her in one scene in the film her pal ruby michelle williams and liz walk through harvard and all the guys tongues are wagging at ricci not the supercute and sexy williams helloreality check time this material begged for the andy warhol treatment here is his version of the film a five minute shot of a hypodermic needle a five minute shot of wurtzels hairy pudenda a five minute shot of her sleeping naked and stoned on the bed she rises gives the middle finger to the audience cue credits see less than twenty minutes to distill wurtzels whole life and oh yeah warhols film would not have cast ricci even michelle williams would have been better and after seeing riccis pallid bosom id take anything williams or any other babe had to offer me cinematically ricci is almost the kiss of death for a film and how she stays working is a mystery think of her performances in mediocre to bad films like monster sleepy hollow and woody allens anything else also costarring jason biggs and now picture another actress in her role and immediately the films could seem better if not great she is the female counterpart to banal wooden milquetoast actors like tom cruise and leonardo dicaprio
