if youre coming to this film to learn something about depression forget it you wont learn anything except how not to write a screenplay on the subject i understand the intent was to show how severe depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck but the result is the most onedimensional character ive ever seen in a hollywood feature no small feat christina ricci as elizabeth spends the entirety of this film screaming at the top of her lungs viciously insulting someone bursting into tears or some combination of the three the only exceptions being some quiet sulking at the beginning and end there is not the slightest hint of what she might be like without depression not the faintest glimmer of any other aspects of her personality she just screams at one point her roommate tells her lizzie youre such a fun person to be around when youre not being depressed and my reaction was she is it seemed odd that the writers would include this comment without giving us any examples but this script is a lesson in incompetence it has no discernible structure or flow at all instead it consists of a series of awkwardly strungtogether scenes of lizzie screaming then ends character development no scenes of her everyday existence ie going to classes that might possibly be important details no screaming at maximum volume check its not quite enough im afraid 110
