i suppose that to say this is an allout terrible movie would be unfair but its pretty bad the subdisney storyline involves dogs playing soccer and falling in love aw how cute the acting isnt bad but definitely could be better especially that of young canadian actor kevin zegers who during the whole movie looks embarrassed like he doesnt even want to be there anyway kids will love it but parents beware
