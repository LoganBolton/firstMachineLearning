im a big fan of h p lovecrafts books and the mythos background spawned some rather good other stories and stuff like that and in the last years there came along some boys who did movies about h ps work  for the bigger part lowbudged flicks  and showed them to the public at places like the h p lovecraft film festival now like i said most of them dont have a big budged but they at least know the heart and soul of lovecrafts work and films like cool air or the call of cthulhu  are what i would think  gifts for the fan base and other loonies that like hps creation br br and then there are people like ivan zuccon who just rip off the name and create a movie which would have been fun to watch if i had directed it myself and filmed with some friends down at the beach that is what mr zuccon did as it seemsbut while blokes like aaron vaneks or bryan moores earlier movies might not have had more budged they somehow still had more to offer  like a story real characters and some connection to lovecraft just blabbering out names like nyarlathotep or necronomicon makes a movie not a lovecraftadaption br br anyway this flick will not only make fans of the mythos shudder and hide it will also not appeal to people who 1 like good movies 2 laugh about bad movies 3 like good cgrade splatter movies or 4 watch everything that has horror written on the dvdcover i will not go into the plott of this waste of time as it has already been discussed by others here on this page but like i said unknown beyond is like a movie i would have made up with some geeky friends aside from that it lacks ideas for any storytelling and goes into ridiculous moronicnonsensebutheitsartstuff selfmade flicks of this quality are fun to watch if you know all the blokes in it and haha see how xy is coughing out the fake blood we made from old tomato sauce and stuff  but hey you dont put this in a dvdcasing declare it an actual movie and want money for itbr br i give it 210 because of the i dunno  effort or something like that
