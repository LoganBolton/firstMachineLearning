undoubtedly the least among the spaghetti westerns ive been watching lately basically a lowbrow ripoff of leones the good the bad and the ugly 1966 with three disparate characters outwitting one another and occasionally forming shaky alliances in their search for hidden gold leonard maltin rated it a bomb while its harmless enough its also totally routine and fatally the three main roles are stereotypes that is to say uninteresting eddie byrnes is a bank employee with ideas regarding his consignment being transported by train gilbert roland is the legendary but ageing mexican bandit his frequent lapses into spanish when excited are quite corny who apparently is still irresistible to women george hilton as an enigmatic bounty hunter tries too hard to emulate clint eastwoods man with no name figure director castellari  whom i saw at the italian bmovie retrospective held during the 2004 venice film festival where he came off as the most pompous of the cult movie directors present  shows little genuine feeling for the western on the strength of two aboveaverage franco nero efforts in the genre i ordered his collaboration with castellari keoma 1976im keeping my fingers crossed now and the films tongueincheek approach is equally lamentable
