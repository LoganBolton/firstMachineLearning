this really is by far the worst movie ive ever seen in my whole life im approaching 47 the description on the back of the cover equaled the scrolling text right at the begin of the movie the further plot was nil and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their acting i viewed the full length of it and was really relieved when the final characters death signalled the end of my suffering the location was either some kind of vaults or a grimy beach i suppose that homevideo equipment served as camera and the lighting was substandard the dialogues were uninspired and devoid of meaning as were the actors faces which brings me to the topic makeup by the looks of it they got it as gimmicks in some teenagers magazines my first own makeup or similar what made me buy the dvd was the name lovecraft printed on the cover the only connection with this brilliant minds works was the use of the name necronomicon which was wrongly translated as book of light the 470 euro i paid for this dvd were a complete loss for the dvd went into the recycling box without any further ado
