let me start by saying i dont recall laughing once during this comedy from the opening scene our protagonist solo giovanni ribisi shows himself to be a selfabsorbed feeble and neurotic loser completely unable to cope with the smallest responsibilities such as balancing a checkbook keeping his word or forming a coherent thought i guess were supposed to be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and cheer him on through the process of clawing his way out of a deep depression i guess were supposed to sympathize as he stumbles through a series of misadventures seemingly triggered by his purchase of a dog but in reality brought on by his own contemptible nature i didnt get the slightest hint at any point that solo ever possessed any redeeming character which became disturbingly apparent when he failed to feed his dog for a few days no spark of humanity or glimmer of conscience gave me hope that he would ever realize his life is so utterly miserable because hes a self absorbed selfpitying lowlife i didnt develop any connection with this character he didnt seem to care and so neither did i i actually wanted him to get his kneecaps busted at one pointbr br the dog was not a character in the film it was simply a prop to be used neglected scorned abused coveted and disposed of on a whim so be warned even though dog is in the title this film is not a romantic comedy for dog loversbr br scott caans role is amusing and believable as the oversexed best friendcad don cheadle is sincere and magnetic  i always want to see more of him on screen mena suvari was delightfully repellent lynn collins role of a stripper with a heart was well acted but the character was simultaneously absurd and clich√©d not to mention there was zero chemistry between her and ribisibr br romantic hardly comedy if you say so
