the two most noteworthy things about i wont play are it won an academy award as the best tworeel short film of 1944 and it was directed by silentera leading man crane wilbur the plot of this runofthemill short is inconsequential the dialogue lacks spark while the acting is no better and no worse than that found in most warthemed hollywood movies of the 1940s in other words its awful admittedly there are moments when i wont play is funny  janis paiges totally artificial look and line delivery are precious  but one laughs at the picture not with it
