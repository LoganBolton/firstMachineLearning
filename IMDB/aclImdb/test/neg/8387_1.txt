i had the misfortune to see this film recently and have to sit through it a friend purchased it for Â£1 and insisted we watch it as it sounded good from the story on the back coverbr br 10 minutes into the film it was apparent that the actors were amateurs and this was an extremely low budget effortbr br the scenes were very poorly acted the script was stupid and the story contained many scenes which seemed unnecessarily long just so the movie would be of a reasonable lengthbr br for instance when the lead character rents a warehouse the film spends a ridiculous amount of time on this scene with meaningless dialogue which serves no real purpose or necessity to the plotbr br the lead actor is supposedly carrying out revenge on a woman who sleeps with guys to give them hiv he never once thinks to get tested instead he turns into a crazed killer deciding to torture her before killing her and sawing her into piecesbr br if this sounds good and you are thinking this will have lots of gore think again this film has no real gory sequences and is quite tame for this type of filmbr br it does not scare it does not make you think it does not offer fast paced fun it may however put you to sleep it is certain to bore you to tears so please save yourself the despair and follow my headingbr br avoid this film 12 out of 10 this does not deserve even 1br br the film was 78 minutes but seemed as if it was 2 12 hours
