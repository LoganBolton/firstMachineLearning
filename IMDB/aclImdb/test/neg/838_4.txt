lately ive been watching a lot of westerns from the 1930s to the present there are some great low budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s this movie had all the elements of a decent western a good story with talented actors and everything else although its a spoof of this genre and for me the way it was done just didnt work and made for a disappointing moviebr br this movie can easily be divided into two partsbr br the first part is great it has a great opening scene and an interesting story develops of a bounty hunter aka the stranger going after a bandit who is going after a large bank shipment guarded in part by a banker over the course of the movie these three characters form shifting alliances in an attempt to get the money there are subtle comic nods to the contrivances of earlier films from this genre but the comedy doesnt disrupt the overall storybr br the second half of the film is where the comedy goes overthetop and essentially ruins the movie the turning point is right at the part where the barmaid causally scolds the dwarf to stop shooting the customers as she goes about waiting on other patrons seemingly oblivious to the four dead bodies laying about the place from this point onward the movie shifts from a decent spaghetti western with comic undertones to a stupidsilly spoofbr br there are three horrible fistfight scenes one at the river one in the market and one at the baths that follow in rapid succession as if one wasnt bad enough the fighting is so fake its ridiculous and since the sound is outofsync with the picture it makes it even worse in the market fight scene the banker bounces about the place on hidden trampolines and twirls around on poles like he is in the circus its clownish although the worst part of these fight scenes is the music its this lighthearted sprightly mix more suited for a square dance or a cheesy episode of heehaw these scenes practically derail the main storybr br overall this movie was disappointing because it had a lot of potential as a decent western but the comic turns just mucked it up if you want to see a good western spoof then see blazing saddles if you want to see a good spaghetti western then avoid this movie
