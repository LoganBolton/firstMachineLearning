paranoid park is about alex a 16 year old skater who causes the death even if accidentally of a security guard as the movie goes on alex deals with little issues like his parents divorce and the sexual heat of his girlfriend jenniferplayed by taylor momsen who you can currently see in gossip girl while hes consumed by guilt i had seen just one movie by gus van sant so farelephant and i can assure you that he kept all his mannerisms while doing this oneonce again he crosses time linesonce again he uses weird filming techniques like the neverending shots of people walkingmaybe you like these filming techniques i know i dont the plot feels unsatisfactory to meits almost to simple to be explored for such a long time the feeling i get same with elephantis that gus van sant tries too hard to make an artistic movie which causes the movie itself to loose substance also gabe nevins was pretty bad as alex theres a difference between looking alienated or detached and looking like a robot if youre a fan of mrvan sant then watch this otherwise skip itbr br 310
