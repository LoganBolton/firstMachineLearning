its difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film jeanpierre limousin presumably had the chance to explore the problems of amnesia on a serious level and opted instead to use it as an excuse to make a softporn movie having seen loved admired and respected se souvenir des belles choses which explores memory loss  albeit as the result of alzheimers  in a profound and heartbreaking way not least in the luminous performance of isabelle carre i find that novo is an insult to se souvenirs i have no problem with soft porn per se  and even if i had id virtually have to give up going to movies so prevalent is it today  but i do have a problem with writersdirectors who attempt to respectablise it by cloaking it as here in the guise of medical research the sad thing is that fine actresses like julie gayet  so wonderful in clara et moi  and anna mouglalis  who seems to have hit into a double play after last weeks le deluge and now this  are wasting their time on dross like this
