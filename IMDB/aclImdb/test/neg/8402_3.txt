i have heard that novo was compared to memento for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering from shortterm memory loss well thats like comparing the silence of the lambs and friday the 13th as both involved a character that killed multiple people they couldnt be further apart in ideasbr br novo deals with a copier man at a company who does have short term memory loss he is consistently followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office in comes a temp who also gets involved with him and maymay not use him for sex needless to say he has a lot of onscreen sexbr br wait theres more theres a boy who runs into the troubled amnesia male and its obvious theres more to this boy just bumping into him and theres a notebook the man keeps to try and remember important cluesbr br i admit i am not one for foreignmade films i dont mind reading the subtitles but i do mind that sometimes that takes away from one of my favorite aspects of a film great dialogue since they have to translate or i wouldnt be able to understand for the most part i truly believe they simplify what the characters have to say this movie was no exception the dialogue was just well blahbr br as for the story it was interesting enough to keep me around for 98 minutes weird yes but then again i dont live in france so i am not as familiar with their likesdislike or lifestyles such as i guess its acceptable for a father to lie with and frolic in the buff with his son on the beach Â– that must be a cultural thing thankfully it wasnt two hours of time invested in watching this man regain his past and progressively move forward to his cure for when the secret is learned i was like really well okay thenbr br i can only recommend for somewhat decent acting good looking folks and softporn sexual situations like every 24 minutes however if youre not into that sort of scene i would wholeheartedly skip this slow moving and memoryregaining film
