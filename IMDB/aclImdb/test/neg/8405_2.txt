i think rosemarys baby is the most overrated horror film out there not scary interesting or much of anything its reasonably welldirected and ruth gordon was wonderful but thats about it but this sequel makes it look like gone with the windbr br i caught this on tv back when i was 14 unfortunately i still remember it from what i remember rosemarys baby andrew is now grown up and the coven wants him to start taking over the world that is but there are forces trying to stop itand andrew is having doubts himselfbr br im giving this a 2 for a few reasons gordon is in this and still very good stephen mchattie was actually pretty good as andrew and there is one spooky moment at the beginning with rosemary patty duke being kidnapped by a buswith no driverbr br other than that its dull silly and needless the original didnt need a sequel ira levins book followup in 1999 wasnt much betterbr br tune in for the beginning with dukethen tune out not worth the effort
