um okay this is very poor indeed if compared to the first film the verymuchso critically acclaimed rosemarys baby in fact its a pretty poor film in general yes there are a few redeeming qualities but ill get to that laterbr br well it has been quite a while since the last film took place in fact its been pretty much eight years i believe rosemary is still trying to escape with her child and influence him in a good way rather than let him succumb to the evil future that the coven or tribe as it is referred to as here has laid out for him when she runs off with him and an empty bus comes and picks her up leaving her child with a hooker the hooker raises him until he comes of age where satan tries to possess him since he seems to be rejecting his evil heritage in every waybr br obviously things dont go as planned and then there is the ending that i would have felt seriously ashamed at had i not seen it coming since hearing that there was a sequel to rosemarys baby okay when i was around 11 years old i witnessed the masterpiece rosemarys baby and then read the book sequel thinking that this film was an adaptation of that i tracked this film down and got it was i right in doing so well in some way yes i am a true fan of this franchise and can say that i have seen the sequel and i have some idea as to what happens after the events in the first film speaking of both this film and son of rosemary ira levins own book sequel not yet adapted to filmbr br ruth gordon who played minnie in the first film is shown a few times in this film but whyohwhy is the coven so different the knife rosemary had dropped in the first film is shown sticking out of the ground yet minnie pulled it out the coven is now called the tribe as i said earlier they now go around in hooded capes chanting hail satan hail adrian hail satan hail adrian and so on and so forth the gothic building is now like a twostory house on a lawn in the middle of nowhere it looks like a little nice suburb home or something and the child itself is pretty normallooking with his eyes only going all catty when he gets mad and kills someone or something in that vainbr br as far as the acting goes its pretty poor on all parts except for stephen mchattie whom plays a verygrown up adrian pattie duke astin replacing mia farrow as rosemary has to have one of the flatout worst performances ever to be caught on film it is so bad its almost not even funny when she screams oh my god and cries for like the fifteenth time in the movie youre just like okay its not funny anymore and then by the time she is gone and the movie has been on for twenty minutes only youre like thank the lord i dont have to hear her say oh my god any longer sheesh in the end this movie has very very very few redeeming qualities enough to get it at least four stars but if you look at it as a serious sequel to the first film its pretty much nonexistent
