sam osteen the film editor on the superlative suspense flick rosemarys baby from 1968 here directs a quickie tvmade sequel one in which rosemary woodhouse patty duke astin in for mia farrow is shunted off earlyand inexplicablypresumably to help flesh out the more ghoulish aspects of this flaccid story about satans son on earth most interesting is the return of ruth gordon to her oscarwinning role as minnie castevet with ray milland wellcast as her husband roman but she isnt given much to doand looks terribly uncomfortable at being involved anyway this script is strictly lowrent goods and must have shamed original author ira levin who went on to write his own sequel fairly dim and pallid with poor photography and no suspense or scares whatsoever
