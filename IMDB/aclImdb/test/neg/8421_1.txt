one of the worse gayrelated movies i have ever seen since these are not characters in this story its hard to comment on the actual film therefore since colton ford aka glen laid his life open for all to see i guess hes fair game to criticize and thats not hard to do here goes 50 something glen is a big time porn star who wants fame and fortune as a big time singer i guess 11 films makes him a star being gay and forty i have seen porno and i did not recognize him or his lover personally they all look the same to me with different hair styles face it guys hes no jeff stryker jim bently or casey donovon thats ok though the purpose of these films takes place in about 65 minutes so they all pretty much have the same requirements if you know what i meanbr br so glen wants to be a serious legit singer after he dumps the porno industry but he cant get anyone to take him seriously i wonder why was he so stupid to think that he could whitewash taking his clothes off and having sex on film and according to the film its not just porn flicks he indulges in its living in a house with other stars where people can hook into their bedroom the bathroom and where ever via webcams  its 500 dollars an hour to entertain at a private party strip gigs at clothing optional hotels doing something called meth which i presume is a drug and then you have the balls to get angry when someone at a club gig tries to touch you  because hes legit now oybr br the only interesting noncardboard character is the academy award winning gay screen writer who wouldnt give his name and considering this is a documentary well porn is as porn does you can tell hes most amused by the dumbbunny porn starbr br glen has one hypernellie manager kyle who wants to sell him as a pornoparticipant in hopes of getting him gayclub gigs he tries to do the svengalliroutine wear this dont smile say this in what amounts to controlling issues but our antihero will not be controlled or told what to do thats the first mistake im not saying kyle was right but if any budding singer starts questioning the manager theyre not going to get far kind of like he who is his own lawyer has a fool for a clientbr br all of this wouldnt have been bad if it werent for one small tiny bit of information drum roll please hes bad he sucks his singing talent ranks up there with ashlee simpson its hard to root for someone who  while trying make his dream come true  at 50  doesnt work like normal people no job can you say lazyass and the whining and the why dont they accept me song and dance and after a few months of scraping the surface of the music industry he spouts off why dont i have a record deal by now what actors are waiters writers work in lowlevel newspapers or mags  whatever this guy is above that its true he wants his success now merely because he decided he wanted it whine whine whine his lover leaves him to return to nursing but i tell ya i wouldnt want that moron dispensing medical care to me both of them were useless airheads the movie is useless unless you really like whine and cheeesy people stay away do not waste your money on the crappy lives of useless people there are far more interesting things stuck to the bottom of your shoe
