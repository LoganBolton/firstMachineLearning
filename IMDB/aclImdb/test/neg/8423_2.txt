so what is one to do if you are a porno star with fading looks i know become a pop star this documentary  and i use the term loosely  follows the trials and tribulations of colton as he tries to transform himself from a gay porn star into a singer of electronic read dance music i only wish mr fords voice was as muscular as his armssorry to say his vocals are painfully thin there isnt much interesting going on here but mr ford and friends are eye candybr br see him record a song that sounds exactly like every other mindless dance tune see him travel to new york to make connections see him go back to la with little success see yourself look in the mirror and ask  why am i wasting time watching this mess
