after reading so many glowing reports of to serve them all my days i went out and bought it for christmas a waste of money im afraid i was looking forward to something in the same league as brideshead revisited and some of the few other great productions from british television but this is decidedly not among them br br the characters are all too good to be true swathed in a very predictable plot and with the most trite and eyerolling script ive heard in years yes it has its moments but they are very thin on the ground the lead actor is interesting mostly because of his uncanny resemblance to anthony andrews sebastian in brideshead only dark but his undoubted talents are wasted on a character who is insufferably selfimportant and priggish his prickliness is attributed to the effects of his experiences in the somme during ww1 he does the early episodes centered around his nervous condition better than he does playing the the squeaky clean socialist dogooder later on br br the women are completely unbelievable as in unreal his first wife is annoyingly chipper and chirpy the girlfriend the perfect sophisticated slut and the last lady a hodgepodge of political bosh the most interesting characters are howarth alan macnaughton and one of the other masters named hobarth i forget the actors namebr br the highminded preachiness of the script is typical andrew davies screenwriter in his early years and becomes tiresome within the first two episodes this miniseries is 11 episodes long by episode 4 i just wanted to get through the blasted thing br br the music is equally tedious limited mostly to one mawkish piano tune and a chorale sung by boys during the credits no expense was spared on the location settings which gives some visual relief to an otherwise excruciating viewing experiencebr br i like stories of this sort as a rule and am very disappointed at the maudlin nature of this series if you want to watch something riveting about ww1 and its aftereffects there are many other far finer vehicles to rent or buy one that comes to mind is the unknown soldier from 1998 the characters in that masterpiece theater presentation are real and fascinating and move one unlike the 2 dimensional puppets in to serve them all my days as for films on boys schools stick to goodbye mr chips or tom browns schooldays br br i know this goes against the general favorable view of this miniseries but i strongly recommend thinking twice before shelling out 8000 to acorn media for their 4 dvd set 2 discs of which on my set had insurmountable problems with freezing and skipping
