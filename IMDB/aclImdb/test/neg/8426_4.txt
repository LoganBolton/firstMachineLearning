thats all i can really say about this film its dbzlike tree of might and the worlds strongest it reallydoesnt fit into the timeline for the show at all though it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the tv series the action is pretty nice in general the plot has a nice enough base with a good background establishing why these guys hate each other and all pretty good in general there the problem istheres a lot of really weird stuff i mean really weird stuff like the worlds strongest theres a really really odd song in this one that could only have been created in a drug induced hazedisturbing is the fact that gohan while singing is pretty much drugged out himself creepy the villains are odd and rather comicalmoreso than the usual dbz typethis seems more like it was made as a dragon ball movie rather than a dragon ball z movie in general its entertaining enough butjuststrange
