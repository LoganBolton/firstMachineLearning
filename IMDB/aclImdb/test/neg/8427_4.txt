i sat last night to see this film being played in greek television because of the upcoming olympic games hosted by my cityknowing that it is an american film i had already expected it to focus more on the american athletes storyand i was really ready for it but what i saw was too muchi mean when a movie has such a title first olympics athens 1896 even being of american origin you would not expect it to be so propagandizing and on the same time ignorant towards other countries athletes and effortsthe american athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature strength smartness generosity kindness politeness in contrast to their sinathletes in the games who seem being unable even to speak their thoughts or express feelingsthe number of times the american anthem is played during the film must be an all time record in filmographymegalomania at its bestit even uses fictionalized facts which ridicules the greek nation such as greek citizens serving the foreign marathon athletes with wine in order to help the domestic ones win the raceso much for the olympic spiritbr br think of itbeing a greek and putting a bad mark to a movie whose title is also greek is something that doesnt make me happy at allbut according to what i have seen i cannot give it more than 4 out of 10 being pretty generous actually
