an art teacher comes across an antique wooden bed made from gingko trees and puts it in his apartment but it has a terrible history and he becomes hunted by a ancient spirit who sustains his human form by ripping the hearts out of peoplebr br this beautifully crafted horrorÂ… well actually its more fantasyromance than anything else does raise some chills and provide some stunning visuals but the plot was hardly interesting enough and the formulaic script lacked any sort of life problem was that i spent most of the time trying to keep my finger away from the fast forward button it sure would have sped up the films slow pacing but then again i wouldnt know about too much that was going on which was reasonably hard to figure out or keep interest in the first place the performances ranged from too melodramatic or just plain dull and thats probably because these characters are unconvincing stale and coma inducing the actual backstory of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and messily put together with too much focus on a flimsy romance being laughable when it shouldnt be and overall its constructed in an ordinary manner that just lacks the oomph or conviction to carry the film what compensates for the storys shortcomings are really arty images which looked grand but the use of some images had me somewhat dumbfounded to what they actually mean towards the film what catches your eye is the faded colour scheme but sometimes the actual screen would look real grainy or snowy although from that it shows the raw intensity of the production valves but also add some nice polished effects that goes well with the soothing but sometimes edgy score the camera work was pretty diverse although it didnt add too much to the feature but during some of the more upbeat scenes there were too many close ups or dark lighting which made it hard to understand what you are seeing also on show are some nice moments of blood and gore but not overtly grand or distinguishable from most other filmsbr br lethargically odd film with luminous images that look like something out of a painting but still it isnt particularly enticing watch out it might put you in a deep trance
