one of the greatest lessons i ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way br br i was working in roger cormans offices like so many other wanabees before and since i was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable hah one afternoon julie corman roger cormans wife and a producer in her own right asked me to load up a tape im not sure why she wanted to watch it i got the impression it was a student film or a show reel something like that some sort of calling card whatever the reasons she had to see it the only free video machine in the offices at the time happened to be in the room i was working in and i was the nearest person to the machine i started the tapebr br fade in on screen a figure sat at a desk facing the camera behind him screen left was a door that opened into the room against the far wall was a coat rack a second character entered through the door and started talking the first character the guy at the desk turned round to reply this is all one take static camera there are no cuts pans or dolly shots just one locked off camera the second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and delivered his next line julie corman said ive seen enough and left the roombr br what she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an idiot opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines nope sorry next thats how long youve got ten seconds cock it up in the opening shot and you are deadbr br i was reminded of that moment while i watched the opening of this piece of crap after an interminably long travelogue of jungle we see several monkeys apparently throwing themselves into cages a man carrying a gun laughs a jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the terminal god this is boring cut to the interior of the airport two men meet aha something is happening they shake hands cut to a different angle of the two men br br  and the director crosses the linebr br the first two shots of the movie that have any kind of spatial relationship with each other and the guy has cocked up not crossing the line is one of those basic rules of movie grammar that keeps the characters from jumping about from side to side on the screen and confusing the audience audiences dont like to be confused mystified baffled puzzled and intrigued yes audiences love all of those confused no you loose them they walk out not crossing the line is one of those things they pound into you at film school or should its basic stuff its not an inviolable rule there are no inviolable rules directors break it all the time  but not on the first real cut of the moviebr br i thought ive seen enough and switched off
