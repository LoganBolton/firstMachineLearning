this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness not only was the name a complete misnomersince the film has next to nothing to do with piranhasbut the acting is as hollow and stale as the attempt to actually make some kind of plot when you watch this film you cannot help but spend every waking second questioning when youve had enough and its time to turn it off unfortunately i waited until the end in my case thats two hours of my life that i will never be able to reclaim
