piranha starts out as expected stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them i thought for a while it might be a cannibal film it starts off like so many others showing nothing but shots off untouched amazon rain forest for all i know it could be florida at this point you figure some animal mutilation or natives will pop up instead you get the acting talents of william smith who starred in la vice and angels die hard he plays caribe an acclaimed hunter who i would describe him as jack palance light he is bigger in stature but not quite the jack palance goodness as for natives you dont really get that many wheres the piranha should i even ask that question caribe now hunts humans i guess he doesnt really pursue anyone till the end of the movie though just stares at them caribe does race one of the tourists on a motorcycle in a overdramatic smokey and the bandit kind of way the motorcycle challenge happens for no real reason other than an action sequence i cant tell you how many times ive seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a motorcycle race in the jungle never actually do they live do they die will you care anybody wanna race on motorcycles caution this film contains extreme dry look my advice is to rent a jack palance classic like craze
