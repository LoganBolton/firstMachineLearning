lets see what are the advantages to watching piranha piranha well if youve never seen anything to do with venezuela theres a lot of travelogue footage of both caracas and the countryside and jungleside and of the various native peoples at work and play as well as plenty of indigenous wildlife if you like william smith he plays a bit of a git as he has always been wont to dobr br and thats about it if it wasnt for william smith this could probably pass as a fundraising film for save the children or some other organization that benefits the third world the only time you really see the fish of the title is during the opening credits no mutant killer fish like in roger cormans singlynamed piranha youd figure with twice the fish in the title there would be twice as many monster fish preying on the characters but alas this is not the casebr br the story starts with a photojournalist and her brother coming to venezuela to do a story on one of the last untouched places on the planet but their motivation quickly changes to one of wanting to find diamonds which are apparently fairly plentiful therebr br theres not a lot of real action or danger in this movie what couldve been an exciting motorcycle race is dulled by the mass of landscape and animal footage that is inserted in it to draw out the films running time theres not a whole lot more action until the last fifteen minutes or so of the movie which is probably about how long the movie would last without all the traveloguerybr br in my view the only ways that a movie can really be a bad movie is to be boring or incredibly stupid piranha piranha certainly qualifies for that former badge and is pretty damn close to the second the only reason i wont rate it a 1 is that the added footage is more interesting than the rest of the movie
