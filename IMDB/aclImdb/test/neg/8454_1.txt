i caught this during a brief run in a philadelphia theater despite its local provenance and its relation to a hometown tragedy namely the beating death of eddie polec in 1994 i really have to come down hard on this movie the director for reasons best known to himself decided to shoot the entire film guerillastyle with nonstop handheld cameras and rapidfire cuts such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material which makes up the majority of the film a stroll down the sidewalk a brothertobrother discussion on a sofa hell even a kiss on a firstdate are all shot cusinartstyle distracting this viewer from ever being able to enter into the drama martin also undercuts his narrative by packing in far too many topics besides the birth of mob violence we get anorexia alcoholism divorce racism parental abusedid i miss anything no doubt a better cast and a betterfocused direction would have knit these threads together as martin surely intended to demonstrate how one moral flaw leads into and sustains a host of othersbut good intentions do not necessarily a great film make just a sprawling mess martin i know youre from my town and im down with you man i really amjust do a better job next time like you did in two plus one
