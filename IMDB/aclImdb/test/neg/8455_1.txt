this movie just happened to be on hbo yesterday so i watched it this was a mistake i guess i got sucked in and kept watching although it was a lot like a train wreck terrible horrible but somehow you just cant look away shaudenfraud i guess  br br this is the story of a photoshoot for models on some island in the caribbean one by one they are all murdered one drinks cleaning fluid one gets blown up on a waverunner one goes over a cliffso these are not accidents but for some inane reason the police are never called and no one thinks that perhaps they should wrap the shoot and go home not just in respect for the dead but perhaps out of fear for their own lives no they just continue with their shoot because that is whats most important forget about the dead models we have a magazine to producebr br one of the subplots is the evil magazine owner played by lee majors rex is his name he is the most obvious suspect and every time a model gets killed he twirls his mustache and says well i cant say this wont be good for sales mooo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha ha so absurd another subplot is when its revealed that rex is one of the models baby dady only when he learned of the baby he tried to convince the girl to abort she didnt but always resented him for even suggesting thisbr br they try to give you false clues and point toward some guy named raule seemingly because hes the only one with an accent and looks creepybr br at the very end sorry to spoil but this movie came out years ago so if you havent seen it by now one of the women was found face down dead in the pool this was the last straw vanessa angel forget her characters name comes at rex with a gun they struggle the gun fires and now shes dead too while shes laying on the floor his business associate tells him that with all this bad press the magazine will be worthless and its all his fault he gets him to sign over the magazine to him once he does voila all the dead models come back to life and you find the entire thing was an elaborate ruse to get back at rexbr br oy what a ridiculous movie as someone else said if you want to see something like this april fools day is far better
