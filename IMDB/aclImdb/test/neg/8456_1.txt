so youve got a number of models on an island and one by one theyre picked off agatha christiestyle we get somebody lost at sea pushed off a cliff poisoned by a solvent driven off a cliff blown up etc nothing terribly graphicbr br before any of that starts one woman inexplicably has a dream of a killer in a weird human face maskbr br the owner of the magazine is a sleaze who had an affair and somebody had photos taken of her before she was of agebr br in the end its all about business or somethingbr br theres an 80s style montage of a photo shoot most of the bathing suits being onepieces surprisingly a couple are fairly translucent theres camera clicks during the montage where the frame of the camera appears as a white square or rectangle within the picture the photographer is rather bad at framing
