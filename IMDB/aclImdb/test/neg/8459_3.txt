pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror science fiction and suspense films there are unnecessary shots to an audience watching the clips and donald pleasance and nancy allen are among audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror films not a bad idea but all the explanations are obvious movie horror helps us deal with real horror you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theatre and pretty trite also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of jarring and shown out of context these bits arent very scary at all and its real shorti saw it in a theatre back in 1984 and was outraged that i paid 500 for an 84 minute moviebr br still it is reasonably welledited and allen and pleasance seem to be enjoying themselves for people who have an interest in knowing more about terror this might be fun and interesting but if youre a horror fan like me youll probably be bored silly good idea bad execution no pun intended i give it a 3
