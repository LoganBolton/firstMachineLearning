maybe the target audience of this disney channel tvmovie will be pleased with it but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters they will clearly see that cranked out is written all over this production obviously it was no ones dream to make this movie but rather this was concocted in a board room somewhere then produced with cold efficiency there is some talent among the cast but actors like dabney coleman and jay thomas dont get much of a chance to showcase their talent the impossibly cute elisabeth harnois is engaging as the first daughter but will friedle is stuck once again playing another dumb character though hes not nearly as moronic and annoying as in his boy meets world role the background for this movie is washington dc and the white house but there is no real presidential feel to the film and the secret service is made out to be little better than the keystone kops when it come to doing their duty the disney channel presents a lot of original tvmovies and most of them are better than this
