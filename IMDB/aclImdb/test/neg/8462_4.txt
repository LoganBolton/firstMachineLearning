this movie isnt that greatat all but its good when you want to just laugh because its pretty ridiculous  there are a lot of mistakes in it and its cheesy i got this movie for christmas like 5 years ago but for some reason ive never given it away i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year this is a very 90s movie so its really funny to see how everyone dresses and acts this movie is good for someone youngalthough come to think of it i didnt even like it much when i was like 12 but thats just my personal opinion the movie was really predictable i wish it had had some extra weird twists but i guess it was trying to be an appropriate movie for everyone to enjoy i think it was appropriate for the whole family but hallies dress was a bit unmodest but certainly appropriate enough for family material
