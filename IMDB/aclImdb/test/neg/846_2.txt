i give it a 2 because of the beautiful mediterranean greece otherwise it would be 1 when nicholas cage came into with his first lines i thought he was just kidding cage as an italian  im sorry but very wrong actor whos acting is also bad not to mention his italiano accent the story is very loose it might have been good but with other actors and obviously with other screenplay the camera is great photography also but why the hell did you cast nicholas cage and penelope cruz for the role please dont get me wrong i dont have anything against cage he has some really great movies but he obviously isnt for every role its really a pity that the cast wasnt better set because the story has potential
