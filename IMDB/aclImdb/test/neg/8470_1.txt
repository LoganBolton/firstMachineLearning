forget what i said about emeril rachael ray is the most irritating personality on the food network and all of television if youve never seen 30 minute meals then you cannot possibly begin to comprehend how unfathomably annoying she is i really truly meant that you cant even begin to be boggled by her until youve viewed the show once or twice and even then all words and intelligent thoughts will fail you the problem is mostly with her mannerisms as you might have guessed ray has a goofy mouth and often imitates the parrot if you love something or think its awesome a word she uses roughly 87 times per telecast just say it and shes constantly using horrible unfunny catchphrases like evoo extra virgin olive oil shut up whats worse is ray has two other shows on the network i think this is some elaborate conspiracy by the terrorists to drive us mad give me more tyler florence ray is lame
