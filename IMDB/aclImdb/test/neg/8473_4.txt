i remember waiting to be born br br vision quest that was the american west br br we went to a psychic br br im sure their first reaction is that shes cuckoo br br the place is haunted br br i think theres another dimension right here br br an artist marta becket and her husband many decades ago left the hustle and bustle and culture of new york and moved to a godforsaken town with a population of 10 in death valley there they renovated a theaterpainting it is a very homespunfolk art manner and once finished she bega putting on dancing performances for practically no one in many ways its highly reminiscent of the werner herzog film fitzcarraldo or field of dreamsthough amargosa is a documentary of a real personnot a mythical crazy man like klaus kinski or kevin costner her husband eventually leavesmuch of it apparently because of the lifestyle she chose so today she lives on with her ten cats and a sanctuary for burros eventually along with her new male companion tombr br what you think about this documentary depends on your perspectives if you are into new age ideas and open to these sensibilities then youll more likely appreciate the film her talking about how she remembers her birth ghosts vision quests and psychics frankly made the psychology teacher in me cringe and this would definitely be the case for many people in addition her burro sanctuary and trying to preserve horses in the desert will most likely appeal to peta and many other animal lovers though with my background in environmental concerns and biology i see the burros and horses as a blight that would destroy the native plants and animals so on two different accounts i tend to think quite the opposite of martawho is more of a feeler and sensing individual depending on how you feel about all this will definitely color your opinionsand i am pretty sure most people will either think shes a genius or a nut youll just have to guess what i thinkbr br now despite all this the film is interesting and martas life is definitely not dullparticularly since in recent years people have actually begun taking trips to the desert to see her perform there is a definite following for her and her unusual little world while i would not be nearly as positive as most reviews i also cant be as negative as the one review as there is definite merit to this odd documentary i like films about unusual people and marta certainly is unusual i also appreciate her love of her art and happy lifethat is a rare gift br br i teach psychology at an arts school and it sure would be interesting to show this to the staffwhere i am pretty sure wed get a strong positive and negative reaction to the filmprobably depending on whether the teachers taught the arts classes or core curriculum it sure would be interestingbr br by the way and i am not trying to be sarcastic but when martas husband was having affairs with whom did this occur after all they lived in the middle of no where and i was left wondering where hed find partnersbr br by the way if youd like to see her perform andor stay at her hotel it can be found at wwwamargosaoperahousecom  the site is in english french and german and hotel rates are pretty reasonable as are ticket prices
