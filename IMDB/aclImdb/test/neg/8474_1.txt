the satirical movie website dateline hollywood joked that son of the mask was all a practical joke star jamie kennedy played on new line cinema for his show the jamie kennedy experiment if only and if only the movie had been half as funny as that satire piecebr br the mask was the ideal vehicle for the facepulling jim carrey that so many viewers dote on it also delighted males over the age of 12 by introducing cameron diaz so having a followup minus both of them was not a good idea plus youd have thought new line would have learned their lesson after dumb and dumberer when harry met lloyd but no though to be fair having an all new cast is in keeping with the original comic in which the mask went from owner to owner as written by lance khazei and directed by lawrence guterman however theres nothing there in return except a steady stream of admittedly decent fx by the usual squadron of houses industrial light and magic improving on the ally mcbeal dancing baby and their own babys day out with the tippett studio giant killer robots digital dimension and so on in support and an even greater pandering to cartoon fans by having our hero work at an animation company responsible for such gems as siamese popes naming his character after tex avery and working in not just references to classic cartoons but actual clipsbr br the trouble is that last approach doesnt really work partly because most of the attempts to bring cartoon trappings to live action fall flat especially the cars getting in the party mood and mostly because the tributes to the flintstones woody woodpecker duck amuck and especially one froggy evening show up how weak this movie is in comparison plus the movie fits in shambolic slapstick alongside strained sentiment the underlying theme of the story is family our hero isnt ready to have a son and his nemesis  alan cumming as the norse god loki  is far from the apple of odins eye and what bob hoskins is doing here as odin even after super mario bros is beyond me and kennedy just isnt in the same league as carrey in the zany stakes  though its not like he gets any help from the script also note that unlike diaz the very cute traylor howard as the mother of the son of the mask doesnt get much to do giving her the mask might have helped the moviebr br further points are lost for throwing away cumming hoskins steven wright and magda szubanski for a suspiciously abbreviated running time which would account for some gaping plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inside joke when our hero fails to sell the concept of the green guy as an animated tv series  the mask did become an animated tv series in real life and was a far better follow up than this sequel the fact that this actually opened in britain before the us should tell you everything what with this and blade trinity new line seems intent on cornering the market on dreadful sequels with cast members from two guys and a girl what next the butterfly effect 2 with nathan fillionbr br somebody stop this
