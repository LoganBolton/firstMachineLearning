this film and i use that term loosely reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote at eighteen months pu stinky poopies br br like that joke this movie can only appeal to the very young the very immature or the very stupid br br that said there are a few bright spots br br the effects where the majority of the reputed 100 million went are kinetic and convincing  i mean as convincing as those kind of kinetic cgi effects can be the cgi baby effects are not great but i imagine those are very hard to do well although for a hundredmillion bucks they could have been betterbr br moose the dog from frasier phoned in his usual exemplary performance steven wright did well with a small part alan cummings was well alan cummingsasvillain which weve seen before and bob hoskins as odin was unrecognizable but enjoyable br br the actress playing mrs avery was cuteasabutton as youd expect and jamie kennedy stunk as youd expect his best role so far was in the scream trilogy not to be confused with the lord of the rings trilogy and in three kings he should stick perhaps to more subtle forms of comedy jim carrey he aintbr br the writing and direction were if anything worse than kennedys performance i semiremember one clever though sevenyearold clever line that i wish someone would quote accurately for the memorable quotes section something about averys proposed costume being the crappiest crap in craptown it was a secondgrade joke but sort of funny in contextbr br over all since theres nothing lower than a one i give this film a one
