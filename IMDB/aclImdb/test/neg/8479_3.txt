this movie isnt worth going to the theaters to watch i did and i didnt like it the effects on the movie are really well done and you get a laugh here and there but the story is really bad it seemed like they had run out of ideas and what is that of loki and odin getting along that totally destroys norse mythology and i guess they forgot that lokis powers only worked during the night if you really must see this movie rent it when it comes out dont go to the movies for thisbr br they could have done a lot more with this than they did it felt like they just wanted to do a movie to show off cool animation and effects
