i actually was looking forward to this movie after reading a number of reviews before the release it sounded like a genuinely nice film one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting cast nicholas cage penelope cruz and john hurtbr br well it might have been all of those things but it is so boring that i defy almost anyone to sit through this in its entirety and keep attention also cages attempt at speaking with an italian accent is embarrassingly bad hes such a good actor that i cringed every time he spoke in this film br br disappointing seems to be the mostoften word used by reviewers here to describe this film and i totally agreebr br i guess it didnt take long for word to get out about how bad this movie was because like cages accent it did not do well
