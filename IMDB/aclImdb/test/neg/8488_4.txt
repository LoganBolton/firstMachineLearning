actually son of the mask did make me laugh a few timesmostly due to the cartoonish jokes that made bugs bunny and roadrunner so funny the cgi is very impressive and is used extensively in this movie garfield for example is no where on par for cgi but i would give it the same votebr br everyone knows the storywhich wasnt that bad for a kids movie yes it is a kids movieand therefore should be treated as such jamie kennedy is not very good in his role his attempts to act crazy are not very good and overall acting is poorbr br everyone else is not too badbr br basically my 2 and 5 year old watched the whole thing without complaining at least i was able to sit through thisbr br there is no way this movie is worst than shudder class of 1999br br 410 for the cgi and a few laughs
