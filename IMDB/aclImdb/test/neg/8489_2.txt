i sort of liked this movie not a good one but not the worst ever made though everyone else says it is one o the worst movies ever created i thought it was okay there are a lot of immature jokes it wants to be funny sometimes but failsbr br the story is okay it may be a little hard to follow for the younger audiences thoughbr br the acting is pretty bad jamie kennedy is a horrible actor at most times at some times it is even laughable alan cumming is probably the best actor in here he is funny when he is supposed to be but some of his lines are god awfulbr br oh and the main bad thing about this movie that i hated was tim averys voice when he is possessed by the mask the voice is horrible also the scenes that he is in are so unfunny that they are almost unbearable i am sure they could have cut him out and it wouldnt affect the movie at allbr br overall you can live without seeing this it is a nice movie to watch if you have nothing else to watch though they definitely could have gone without making the sequel but it is a decent effort 410
