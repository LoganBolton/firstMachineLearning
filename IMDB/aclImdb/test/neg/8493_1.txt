i can just picture how this movie came to bebr br so how else can we screw up our careers br br i know lets take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of itbr br perfect well get bgrade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10 of carreys original salary well save millions and rake in a massive profit never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place we as executives still honestly believe a movie was popular based on the name and story not the actors who made it so in the first place br br brilliant lets put a massive budget and get the cheapest actors we can find br br and really thats what son of the mask can be described as just a simple bgrade movie that attempts to suck the life out of its original classicbr br nevertheless if the movie didnt contain the words the mask or anything to do with the mask it would be a nice kids movie for all its massive flaws and horrible acting this really will appeal to kids its a good natured flick that really wants to scream out like me but only those 8 and younger will truly enjoy itbr br jamie kennedy is the only worthwhile mention in this movie he clearly is trying to make the material work playing the desperate dad but the script is so poor the only thing that spews out that is worthwhile was my drink after seeing this the character of loki also deserves a mention as he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this film its too bad the character is wasted on this film i would have really liked to have seen the character take on the true mask instead we are reduced to fart jokes and toilet humor near the endbr br the plot is so much by the books i wont bother to mention it here its all so clearly obvious that even a disney exec would be green with envybr br save your money this one is heading to dvd in three months from the looks of it shame on the studios for once again smearing a decent film with a horrible sequel didnt dumb and dumberer teach them anything
