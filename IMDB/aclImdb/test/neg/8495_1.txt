this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen i say this without hyperbole and believe me ive seen a lot of bad movies its embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars went into this film and that hundreds thousands of craftspeople spent so much time working on what the writers and producers must have known would be a colossal failurebr br when a 90 minute film feels this long drawn out boring and incomprehensible you know that something went wrong somewhere also jamie kennedy whose work ive enjoyed elsewhere is simply terrible in this role he was obviously never given a screen test because no producer in their right mind would consider him entertaining in any way especially in the guise of the mask simply awfulbr br personally i cant wait to see the reviews by the major film critics because i know theyre do a better job than me at tearing this train wreck to shredsbr br the producers of this film should be embarrassed and more importantly never be allowed to make theatrical films again
