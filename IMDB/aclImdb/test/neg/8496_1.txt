mr kennedy should stop experimenting with bad movie scripts what was he thinking this is a movie that should not have passed the hey ive got an idea lets make a sequel stage of inception if there was a zero rating id give it but i guess ill settle for a generous 1 it seems these days that if there is a buck to be made movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up hey i said hit and run kinda describes how i felt when this movie ended how this piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me it is filled with unpleasant humor strange animation and jokes that dont quite take you anywhere besides a state of confusion if you are being dragged to this movie and someone is paying for youfine but its still going to be more painful than a brick in the forehead however if youre planning on paying your own hardearned money search out a better alternative
