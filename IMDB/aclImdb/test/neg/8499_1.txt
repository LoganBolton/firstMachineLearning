i wouldnt have given this film such a low rating 2 if its average hadnt been ridiculously high but someone had to bring it down to something more reasonable i sat through most of this film watching scene after scene of tagging and shoplifting no dialog just tagging and shoplifting finally the two taggers kissed something happened but then back to tagging and shoplifting i left the screening i recommend this film only to those who are impressed by pretentious filmmaking i disliked the directors previous film a selfrighteous defense of manboy love but at least that film had a story interesting characters dialog the graffiti artist had only scene after scene of tagging and shoplifting i want more from a film than this
