i wasnt impressed with the graffiti artist despite its artsy aka low budget improvisation appeal there is little dialog and at least for me i was disappointed that it didnt give more credit or promote the work of guerrilla artists such as these instead it was a story that covers familiar territory two guys who basically do little more than tag buildings become friends tagging partners and eventually experiment with a relationship they seem like opposites rather uncomfortable together little is explained about their backgrounds and the things between the two young men happen at rapid speed although this i can understand because its only 70 minutes or so theres been countless numbers of similar plots and productions in recent years to the point that the sphere of independent film is starting to become just as saturated with this particular storytelling just as the mainstream has become saturated with this and morebr br much of the film may bore the viewer who needs immediate dialog and purpose the primary figure of this story at least extensively performs his routines with nearly no dialog no insight and nothing else to carry the viewer and for a short film i wished they couldve gotten to the point a lot faster that aside from the typical plot annoyed me yet there was something about a momentary glimpse into the daily habits of at least two graffiti artists even if most of it was rather unoccupied timebr br recommended if youre tired of the mainstream crap and dont mind an indie picture and have some interested into this underground urban art form but you really have to watch it for yourself because this seems to be one with a more acquired taste for more recent indie films centering on graffiti artists check out transit
