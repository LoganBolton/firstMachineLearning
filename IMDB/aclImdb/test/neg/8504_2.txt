i give this movie 2 stars purely because of its slightly liberal plot line without going into too much detailbr br the acting in this movie is terrible really terrible  wooden shallowbr br the graffiti on show is weak so bloody weak that i can only wonder why they bothered to use graffiti artists at all it was obvious in the spraying scenes that theyd gotten other people in to do the work they might as well have let the actors do the painting and saved themselves a few centsbr br i would avoid this film at all costsbr br the kid loco soundtrack used to be something i listened to on my ipod its going to be a while before i can go back there for fear of this movie coming back into my mindbr br avoid at all costs unless you are thinking to yourself wow its been a while since ive seen a really sht movie
