i enjoy gaythemed movies where the characters arent stereotypically gay and thats what attracted me to this movie that and the principal actor which is the only reason im giving this movie one more star than it deserves although not because of his acting in the film let me tell you a lot of people complain about the cinematography but the camcorder feel of the movie added a certain underground quality to it for me and there are a couple of scenes usually around sunset or sunrise and among trains that would make any movie screen blushbr br but the acting is cardboard the music is repetitive i got through the latter half of the movie listening to a soundtrack from another film you have to wait almost twenty minutes for any dialog and then it is awkward and amateur the subject of graffiti could have made this movie great had it been gracefully exploited and had the art itself been more intriguing but it isntbr br worst of all there is no climax there wasnt really a plot to begin with the movie just crawls back into its shell of silence and dies a forgettable movie
