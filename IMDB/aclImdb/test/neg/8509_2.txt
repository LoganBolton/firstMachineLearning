if you havent read tolkiens masterpiece prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever if you have however after having read the books several times over many years i have come to love the characters and story and feel i know it intimately i have my own personal vision of the shire hobbiton and the charactergallery thus for me the movie was a disappointment why it dictates the appearance of the characters unavoidably it changes events it removes important storyline it removes notsoimportant storyline great chunks of what makes the lord of the rings what it is is simply ignored even 2001 special effects cant do tolkiens and your own imagination justice peter jackson has made an honest attempt at the impossible and i dont think anyone else could have done it better but the fact remains i regret seeing the movie the next time i read the lord of the rings peter jacksons limited vision will leap forward not my own
