im a big fan of patricia hodge and mariam margolyes so i watched this show when it came on ae some years ago the show was strange to say the least but i gave it a chance because i liked these actresses this has got to be one of the worst shows ive ever seen i wouldnt watch it again and certainly wouldnt waste money on buying the video the storyline of this tv version is ludicrous and just plain stupid the kicker pun intended comes when ruth has surgery done on her leg bones that kind of nonsense belongs in james bond and scifi movies if this version is true to the book then i wont be checking the book out from my local library the american version came out some years after id seen this original to my surprise the americans got it right this time as their version with meryl streep and roseanne is played for laughs and is rather funny when played for laughs the storyline works
