my take yet another lame pg13 horror movie with predictable scare tactics and a derivative plotbr br the spirits move the walls creak theres something wrong in the basement these along with several other horror movie clich√©s haunt the walls of yet another house in the country in the sam raimiproduced the messengers a lame pastiche of the most predictable scare tactics thrown in on a plot savagely recycled from better and sometimes even worse horror movies of the pastbr br when the solomon family moves into an old south dakota farmhouse in yet another attempt by dad dylan mcdermott to reconnect with the family especially with their formerly drunkdriving daughter jessica the underrated kristen stewart in the more subtle countryside than their home in chicago the horror ensues when jessica begins to get little surprise visits from the houses poltergeists thinking shes some teenage girl who cried wolf her parents dont believe her how could they the real horror in the messengers is waiting for which horror movie it will savage next will it be an angry flock of crows wanting more than the familys crops a direct ripoff of alfred hitchcocks masterpiece the birds will it be the haunted house with a history dating back from the amityville horror or poltergeist or will it be the grotesque phantoms taken from your familiar recent horrors like the ring and the grudge heck the movie even manages to ripoff a scene or two from some truly bad horror movies like amityville 3d and the mediocre cold creek manor perhaps all the pang brothers really wanted to do was a blevel horror movie but did it have to be this bad couldnt they ripoff from the best avoid itbr br rating  out of 5
