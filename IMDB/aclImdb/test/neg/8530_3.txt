special sneak previews are always a good time no matter what movie it is you are seeing the theatre will always be packed by people who have been awaiting the film like free stuff thought itd be something to do or just got lost either way no matter how good or bad the film the audience alone will make it enjoyable now when said movie is a pg13 pseudo horror film can you really delve into horror when the mpaa is on your back censoring everything you know there will be chatter laughing and breath holding with the messengers the crowd did not disappoint giving numerous outbursts and warnings to the characters on screen as for the actual movie i feel sorry for those involved because it really could have been much better had it been paced right and allowed to stretch its legs beyond the scarefadetoblackshow aftermath progression these films have in the end we are shown a boring plodding story with no surprises and few moments of actual suspensebr br the story is a common one a family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try and rebuild their relationship with each other once settled in the spirits of the house come out to the reformed troublemaker child whose past makes it even easier for the parents to disbelieve everything told to them of course the child is not crying wolf and those around only find out when it is too late i will credit the pang brothers directors of the acclaimed the eye that i would like to watch more than before to see what they can do without hollywood interferencesupposedly reshoots on the messengers were done by someone else but the brothers retained credit its a shame what our studio system does to foreigners especially when it was creative independence which made the films that brings them in and not bottomline interference for really having a fitting style and for keeping the tired plot line somewhat fresh unfortunately though i also must give them credit for the almost unbearable slowness similar to why i disliked what lies beneath i couldnt stand the drawn out suspense which goes so far as to make it laughable when our heroine and her brother stand in a hallway with a ghost behind them the scene lasts about eight minutes with just static oddly composed closeups and depth of field focus changes to end up culminating to absolutely nothing for being only 84 minutes i almost think it would have worked better even shorterbr br besides a very effective opening sequence featuring the fantastic jodelle ferland strangely playing a boy and a great atmospheric credit sequence the only thing that saves the film from utter garbage is the acting except for penelope ann miller who first made me wonder what ever happened to her and then after a few scenes made me understand why i never asked that question in the years she was absent and dustin milligan completely lacking in credibility the acting is very strong dyan mcdermott does a nice job as the father trying to keep his family together through all the tough times he has many little moments of light comedy to counteract his serious dramatic role william b davis everyones favorite cancerman is used effectively as an almost foreboding character sadly not utilized more our true stars are kristen stewart and john corbett stewart plays the emotion very well and shows some promise as an actress with this and panic room on her resume as for corbett if he didnt pull off his role the entire movie would have unraveled completely i do wish he would be given more work as ive enjoyed him since the underappreciated series the visitori still need to check out his first role in northern exposure a show i havent yet been able to catch up on its a shame he will probably be most recognizable for the overrated my big fat greek weddingbr br if anything the messengers gave me a nice introduction to the pang brothers work and reinvigorated my desire to check out their chinese horror catalog the mood and performances were there it was just the simple and vacant story that needed way too much padding to make a feature film if they delved more into other characters rather than just stewarts it could have been more effective while also having something more to show then ten minute scenes of nothing if our protagonist is the only one being attacked there is no suspense as to how far the creatures will go to harm her the moments of danger had no gravity to them and until the ending really just stood in as filler i am excited however for the free comic book given away after the special screening as hopefully the medium will allow for a faster paced story that engrosses before it tries to surprise
