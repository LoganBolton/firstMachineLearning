despite a totally misleading advertising campaign this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clich√©d subpar haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending clue 1 for all considering seeing this turkey sam raimi didnt direct it although commercials for the movie play up his involvement in truth he is one of four producers its too bad that someone as talented as raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie i dont think he would ever have directed something like this that task was left to the pang brothersbr br the screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other horror films so youll find absolutely zero original content in the messengers what we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of pulse a couple that could have come from the birds one or two from the others etc nearly every scene almost every line of dialogue is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies the whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the surprise ending long before it comesbr br right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts has nothing to do with this movie in fact everyone can see the ghosts the teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them even quite early in the movie im sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal which otherwise is entirely absent now you know so dont be fooled perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors it simply isnt there all of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened anyhow didnt anyone think to maybe arrest him it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots loud noises visual flashes and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling boo all we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorlymade film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house if theres any message that the messengers delivers its dont waste your time on this movie
