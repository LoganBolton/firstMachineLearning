i dont expect a lot from ghost stories but i do expect a story to make a bit of sense is that asking too much from the screenwriters and filmmakers when the bad guy all of the sudden becomes a homicidal maniac solely because a bunch of crows start pecking him then i have a problem spending 900 for a ticket alfred hitchcock would be spinning in his grave didnt anyone learn anything in their college film 101 class a good movie has at its roots an interesting storybr br here are some of the ridiculous messages in this movie if you have desperate financial problems move from chicago to the middle of nowhere in north dakota to grow sunflowers i kid you not if your toddler has serious neurological problems from a car accident move away from some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to an isolated small town which at best has a community hospital hire a drifter to live  work with you out of the blue without checking any references when you have a teenage vixen daughter a wife and toddler  im glad theyre not my parents br br a town where everyone knows everything would have no problem missing a triple homicide just outside of town and of course blame the mans lunacy on a bad crop of sunflowers doesnt anything else grow in north dakota a couple of days after you buy your rundown house  with huge vines growing everywhere  that it reminds you of jack and the beanstalk a guy from the xfiles ala smoking man im glad to see the cigarettes didnt get him i guess he doesnt inhale will just suddenly sneak up on you while youre working to offer you the sale price of your home plus 15 more for absolutely no reasonbr br i think you get the picture i have seen so many godforsaken awful movies in the past month it just blows my mind is it that difficult to make a movie that doesnt treat the audience like an idiot im glad at least the crows in this sorry film turned out to have the some brains i wish i could say the same for whomever thinks they are going to make money off this celluloid piece of trash
