just saw this movie on opening night i read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it i must say i was not impressed im so unimpressed that i feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some moneybr br first of all the messengers is very predictable and just not much of a thriller it might be scary for someone under 13 but it really did nothing for me the climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movies resolutionbr br furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the subpar suspense scenesbr br if youve seen previews for this movie then youve seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot this movie is not worth seeing in the theaters
