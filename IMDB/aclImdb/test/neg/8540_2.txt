good old jess franco the alwaysreliable choice of director in case youre looking for undemanding sleaze shameless exploitation and 200 gratuitousness jess once again really surpassed himself with this utterly trashy piece of jungle adventure lets face it this film is basically just an excuse to have the ravishingly hot and underage actress katja bienert parade around topless its actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16yearold girl had to walk around a film set naked in front of a whole crew and particularly before the gazing eyes of pervert franco and it wasnt even the first time since the duo previously already made linda together anyways just in case you wondered yes diamonds of the kilimanjaro does have a plot albeit a very imbecilic one during the opening sequences a plane carrying aboard a wealthy scottish guy and a girl child crash amidst an african tribe of vegetarian cannibals i say vegetarian because they never at one point in the film so much even attempt to consume human flesh the obnoxious scot declares himself the great white leader and the girl grows up to become the beautiful and scarcely dressed white goddess several years later an expedition reaches the middle of the jungle to get the girl back to civilization and  even more importantly  to steal some of the tribes legendary diamonds this could have been a compelling and actionpacked adventure movie but jess franco obviously couldnt be bothered why shoot jungle chase sequences or bloody cannibalistic rites when you can just as easily aim your camera at a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree most of the jungle settings simply appear to be filmed in someones garden and theres a massive amount of clumsily edited national geographic wildlife footage in order to fill up the gaps in continuity the back of the dvd describes diamonds of the kilimanjaro as an ingenious feminist and adult orientated version of tarzan yeah right they just put that sentence there because katja bienerts character swings from one tree to another using a a couple of times
