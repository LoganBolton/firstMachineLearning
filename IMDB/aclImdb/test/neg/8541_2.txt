a group of adventurers travel to the dark continent to try and locate a lost heiress named diana who disappeared years before in a plane crash and who is now believed to be living with a savage tribe that consider her to be their goddessbr br once again my search for sleazy european cannibal movies has taken me deep into jess franco territorya seemingly endless cinematic wilderness swarming with subpar scriptwriting crawling with crap camerawork and abundant with awful acting franco regular lina romay taking the prize this time for her pitiful performance as an ailing elderly woman it is here in this hellish place that i finally stumbled upon diamonds of kilimanjaro an abysmal junglebased exploitationer so stupefyingly bad that it took me three successive evenings to finish watching itbr br tawdry and unrelentingly dull even by francos standards this wearisome piece of trash fails on almost every level the story is a dreadfully dull derivative of edgar rice burroughs tarzan albeit with a feminine twist the film appears to have been filmed in the local botanical gardens although grainy stock footage is poorly integrated into the film in a pointless effort to convince viewers that the action is really taking place in africa and the death scenes are virtually bloodless franco can usually be relied upon for some splatter but despite initial appearances this isnt a cannibal movie and it isnt that gorybr br where the director does succeed however is in his casting of sexy young katja bienert as jungle jailbait diana running and leaping through the undergrowth in nothing but a skimpy loincloth her curvaceous bod belying the fact that she was only sixteen at the time this nubile beauty makes quite an impression franco also throws in some further nudity courtesy of mari carmen nieto as treacherous traveller lita who gives us a glimpse of her untamed regions and aline mess as topless warrior woman noba thus narrowly avoiding getting yet another rating of 110 from me although im sure hell be receiving plenty more in the futurei have loads of his films yet to see
