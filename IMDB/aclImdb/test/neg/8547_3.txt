begrudgingly gave it a 3  one point each for fonda stanwyck and the supporting castbr br never saw this one before  am watching it right now and it has just gotten to the part where henry fonda is carrying babs over the threshold if i continue watching it will be just to see if fonda and stanwyck will be able to pull this one out of the dumperbr br but after reading the other viewer comments im not very optimisticbr br the opening ski scenes were enough to put me off my lunch the voiceovers were obviously done in a sound studio and the editing between the exterior shots and the closeups was horrendous i do not know that much about the technology of that era  but i cant believe there wasnt something they could do to make it more believablebr br my second gasp of disbelief was when fonda wiped out and i imagine due to the extreme velocity of travel he is burrowed head first into the snow up to his torso  stanwyck pulls him out with obvious staged difficulty  and i imagine because she is such an experienced doctor does not react at all to his apparently unconscious state and limp posturebr br look im completely capable of suspending my disbelief but i couldnt get over the fact that she had just jostled a man with a possible head injury and that he might be paralyzed for life not my idea of big yuksbr br so as i finish this comment we have just seen kirks first jealous outburst and dr hunt is off to perform an appendectomy im not sure which i hate more  the script the background music or the story argghhhh im done game over click
