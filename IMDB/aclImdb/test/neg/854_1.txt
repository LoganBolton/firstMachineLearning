technically this movie would have had it all decent actors a nice landscape no obvious sights of a lack of budget a celebrity like richard attenborough the plot summary also sounded promising suggesting a satire on silly bureaucracy and common people outwitting itbr br however it never delivers the plot is simply too illogical throughout the whole movie not one person does a single sensible thing mad politicians ridiculous soldiers braindead villagers  all just hustle from one incredible situation to the next what they all do never makes sense in a context beyond the current scenebr br of course this kind of movie has to be absurd and exaggerated however its also supposed to have at least one instance to point out the madness behind splitting a city in the middle actually there are at least two attempts which unfortunately fail the main character who doesnt seem to have a clue about whats happening to him and the writer who occasionally cracks jokes from the off that might be considered funny by an audience consisting solely of 12 year oldsbr br what i found most impressing is that the movie tries to be funny all the time but didnt made me laugh once ive seen several bad funny movies but until yet every single one of them featured at least 2 or 3 good laughs so in this sense puckoon is really remarkablebr br if you want to see a great movie with a comparable plot check out brazil dont waste your time on puckoon
