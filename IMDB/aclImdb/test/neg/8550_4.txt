you belong to me was the final teaming of henry fonda and barbara stanwyck as a screen team and it was a loan out film for fonda to columbia pictures fonda had signed a contract with 20th century fox in order to get the tom joad part in the grapes of wrath but after that it was usually his loan out films that were good while he was cast in mediocre things at foxbr br but the rule was broken here though the character he plays bears some superficial resemblance to charles pike from the lady eve this film isnt anywhere near as funny in fact feminists would probably be aghast at it br br in fact barbara stanwyck herself didnt like it at all she liked working with henry fonda right enough but thought this film was ridiculous as well she should havebr br fonda is another millionaire playboy who we would now call a trust fund baby who doesnt really do much with his life hes sort of lovable lunkhead who meets stanwyck on a ski slope and literally falls for her trying to show off turns out shes a doctor and they have a whirlwind courtship and get married br br but it turns out fonda has a jealous streak especially when it involves roger clark another millionaire patient of stanwycks and hes not understanding as to her professional obligationsbr br stanwyck like bette davis and katharine hepburn was and is a feminist icon when she tells fonda that he ought to go out in the working world and live on a salary and see if he can do it fonda goes out and gets a job as a salesman in a department store shes so proud of him that she actually is going to give up her medical practice and live with him on his salesmans salarybr br today now would be picketing the film stanwyck did not have too much conviction in her performance probably because she didnt believe any of it i certainly couldnt br br i dont think even back then audiences believed it either but the two stars and the rest of the cast tried their best but this one was a thanksgiving special
