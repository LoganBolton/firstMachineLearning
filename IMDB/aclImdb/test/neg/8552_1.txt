sad really sad this movie has nothing hmmm well maybe sybil danning to keep you watching it also hurt my eyes to see linda blair in this exploitation flick she certainly deserves betterbr br so whats the story about lets see warden john vernon tapes the inmates in rather inspiring positions while prisoner sybil actually runs the prison and little linda must fight to survive sounds like a bmovie huh it is
