not the best of the wips but not the worst either i honestly feel guilty laughing at this film considering it had to be career lows for all involved yet the acting dialogue preposterous scenarios and the ever present boom mic get to me everytime and certainly add to its bad movie charm as much of a linda blair fan i am top or topless honors go to sybil danning also special kudos to henry silva whos the only one in the cast who doesnt play his role too seriously viewing the film now though makes me look at stella stevens character more closely she plays the head officer and i have to wonder if this where hilary clinton decided to adopt her current look and demeanor after all im sure she had to look no further than her husbands video collection to find this film not that im judging ive seen it several times myself and it all makes me wonder what wouldve happened if mr clinton had been allowed to install a hot tub in the oval office hmmm
