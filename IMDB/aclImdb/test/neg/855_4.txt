spike milligan was one of the funniest men ive ever seen and a huge influence on my lifebr br this movie is limp and awful and does his memory no credit the script is cluttered and preserves too many lines from the book intact the leg jokes here are incomprehensible the actors performances are uniformly ineffective a great cast wasted and the lead sean hughes delivers milligans belligerent hostilities in a plaintive whine which misses the point completelybr br the gentle pacing is a killer as well farce should accelerate towards the end the goon shows often did the novel puckoon definitely did but this film if anything slows down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climaxbr br milligan narrated an abridged audio recording of puckoon in 1980 with tp mckenna dermot kelly norma ronald and jack hobbs now thats funny ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film i believe the lp was transferred to cd but dont know if its still in printbr br there is a movie of adolf hitler my part in his downfall with jim dale and arthur lowe it too is a godawful mess but its funnier than this thingbr br its possible that milligans spirit is too rambunctious for the screen the other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking this film fumbles virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint
