i can only say this ee03128 from portugal i couldnt say it better the worst movie ive ever seen and ive seen lots of crap when i read you comment i thought only about the thoughts i had while watching the movie when i saw who was one of the script writers i understood it balaguer√≥ uses the same tricks in all his movies and his scripts are not much better either and of course in barcelona we have tons of temples and churches around the city so we can keep cursed nuns to scare young americans coming on vacations please be serious and i do not want to talk about the quality of the actors there is something remarkable too it is fair to recognize it compared to the usual level all the spanish actors use a fairly good english
