the only good thing of this movie is its final twist in 97 minutes of film we can only save one single idea which was totally wasted in this movie i must say for more than 90 minutes this film is just a collection of clichés bad acting stupid ideas and disclosures complete lack of suspense stupid deaths terrible special effects all this in a pathetic and unoriginal plot until the last three minutes where finally a good idea appeared its nothing outstanding or an extremely original idea but at least was a decent good idea the only one the entire movie has i wont spoil it but i must say i think that idea with a better plot better fx and definitely a better acting would turn into a good film if you watch this movie and can stand it until the end you will know what it is
