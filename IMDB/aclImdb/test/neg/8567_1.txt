the movie is nothing extraordinary as a matter of fact it is an insult to the horror genre nothing about it borders on scary not even close to the threshold of scarybr br its just another case of another teenage horror movieseen one and youve seen em all first few minutes in the movie and youll know what will happen next the worst part is the script is blunter than the most recent installment of scary movie would have been better if its written in spanish and dont get me started with the inside jokes and punchlinesbr br though i will give a little credit for the special effects but trust me like any other hollywood made horror movie cgis and special effects has little or no effect to a horror movies ability to scare in fact it makes it worsebr br between the fresh faced anita briem and the spooky location theres not much to see in this movie
