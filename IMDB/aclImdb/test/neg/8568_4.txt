i am a huge horror fan particularly spanish horror this film had so many possibilities to be good its a marvelous idea a vigilante ghost nun as most of what has come out of jaume balanguerós mind both visual and sound effects were also pretty good but everything was shamefully spoiled by bad direction awful casting and a painfully bad exposition exposition script too bad maybe balangueró should write and direct himself a remakebr br moreover i dont really understand why this had to be spoken in english by actors who cant really speak english and when they do they do it so bad it just makes their performances even more fake if you look at contemporary spanish horror films like el orfanato or rec the performances are totally in tune with this type of stylish ghost story  and that is being realistic being believable as someone like ourselves like real people because that is the only way horror achieves its goal unfortunately everything failed in la monja
