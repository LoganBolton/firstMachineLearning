i didnt buy this i didnt rent this it was on ppv and someone burned a copy of it and loaned it to me so at least i wasted no money on it for someone that did darkness the nameless devils backbone this is a pretty lame film seems to have something to do with a bunch of girls that were at a convent back in the day and now theyre all grown up and theyre being pursued and killed one by one by a nun that comes out of the kitchen sink the toilet and even manages to negotiate the revolving doors in a hotel and what makes this nun so mean and nasty and wet i dunno this was so boring that at some point about halfway through i just stopped it put it away and watched something else wasnt even interested in finding out really oh sure theres some lovely young ladies to look at but hey are two of them lesbians i guess theres a picture on the bedside table of one young ladys bedroom and what selfrespecting horror movie wouldnt be complete these days without a lesbian couple yeah whatever 2 out of 10 if you want to see a worthwhile nun horror movie try desecration dead waters or the convent and thats the one with adrienne barbeau by the way not the one with john malkovich
