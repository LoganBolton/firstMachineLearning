okay now i am pretty sure that my summary got your attention and my commenting that zazu pitts is satan is not without some basis let me explain the film at first appears to be a dandy bmovie about an evil organization called the crooked circle and their vow of revenge in the form of murder on a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes while this is very odd especially the idea of a club of private citizens who solve crimes and could have been interesting this film falls apart despite a rather impressive list of familiar supporting actors why well because zazu pitts never one of my favorite actresses spends most of the movie whining just like olive oyl with a bad toothache while murders are being committed people are being kidnapped or whatever you can always count on zazu whining at full volumealmost like someones obnoxious 3 yearold who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her at the same time shes not an integral part of the film but received top billing why she is even there is beyond mei assume its just to whine and yell as a result i found the movie practically unwatchable and it was completely ruined now you probably know why i referred to this actress of dubious talent as satan im sure that when the actors in this film saw the final product they too felt pretty much the same way i did about her horrible overacting and amateurish performancebr br this film is in the public domain and can be found for free download on the internet i can see why
