six students at a convent do the unthinkable  kill a nun who was overbearing now eighteen years later the nuns spirit is back and getting revenge for her murderbr br yea basically thats the short of it theres more to it than that but i still have no clue what it is the only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun as i was pretty impressed for being a more lowbudget flick im also confused as to whether or not its in english most of the actors are italian and even the title here is in italian yet they spoke english in the film i think or it mightve been dubbed i still cant tellbr br anyway the real premise of the film is pretty idiotic and the ending not only doesnt make sense itwelldoesnt make sense
