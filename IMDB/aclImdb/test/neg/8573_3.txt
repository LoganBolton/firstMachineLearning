i thought this movied be totally different than just another teenslasher well i was totally wrong theres a liquid nun coming out of the toilet seat and something really odd i know that spanish culture is a bit different and their movies too but i didnt expect to see a fake hollywood film they certainly faked it pretty well though whyd they make a movie without any new aspects this is just plain boring and itd been done totally without any imaginationbr br i thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the movied be something really original it turned out to be a teen slasher if thisd been done ten years ago then itd have been something newbr br i cant recommend this movie for anyone but it certainly has some comedy value its like a horror parody in some points
