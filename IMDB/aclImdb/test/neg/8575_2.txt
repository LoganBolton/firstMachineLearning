i dont usually like to comment on the acting in a movie because it is the one thing that people who have agenda against a film will go after in this movie i will make an exception the acting in this film are below average all around i mean halfway into the film i wonder how the hell did the producer andor the director gets around casting such an ensemble of people who cant act eventhough the production value was good the ill written story just compounded on top of the bad performance of the actors and there is even a halfhearted attempts to a twist to the ending of the movie which ends up quite confusing is all the spanish horror films this disappointing
