this weeks surprise screening at gv turned out to be the horror movie the nun la monja seriously i think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles even though the storys about the character as described in the title who knows soon well have spinoffs like the monk the priest and others belonging to various religious sectsbr br the basic premise goes very simply that a ghoul dressed up in a nun garb so that it can lay claim to the title goes around killing exconvent girls there seemed to be some sort of conspiracy involved as the daughter of one of the victims eva played by an eye candy icelandic anita briem goes on to discover with the help of a few good friends like a rip off of i know what you did last summer mentioned also by the waybr br so as the body count increases its a race against time for our emotionally scarred arent they always heroine to uncover the truth and save the day delving into the sins of the mothers the movie did the unthinkable that with a dream sequence as the introduction i hate dream sequences as its a pretty cheap technique if not done correctly and there are a couple of them in the moviebr br in part the movie played at times like juon gone wrong with the plenty of dark water references and they could have retitled this unholy water for the circumstances and plot points in the movie however there are plot holes abound so dont be looking into the storyline too deeply youd come to expect the standard textbook twists towards the end about the sadistic nun and sets which look like they can rival recent thai horror movie dormbr br the actings pretty forgettable with the cast speaking in perfect heavily accented english and since most of them are pleasing to the eye the story must weave in a love scene in the middle of a witchhunt what gives hello got hantu still got mood ah then again the ghoul is a pretty cheap animatedsfx which has a built in ai of popping up every now and then in various fashion just to elicit screams from timid audiences the characters also break every unwritten rule in the donots in horror lore so you know and expect their just dessertsbr br can you possibly enjoy this movie sure you can just ensure that youre watching it in a full house should be easy since local folks are suckers for anything remotely horrific and laugh at those who are so jumpy they scream at every frightening scene its pretty fun and adds to the atmosphere besides whats going on the screen surround sound doesnt even come closebr br think of it as watching an episode of scooby doo without the wisecracks and its a pity that the gory moments in the movie had to be censored for a pg rating those could possibly have been the best bits now left rotting on the censors floor board
