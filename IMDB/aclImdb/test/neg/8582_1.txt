ive always found the dilettante man ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious and ive never understood why his work attracts so much attention apart from his rayographs which he invented by accident and which are merely directcontact photo prints his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn but surely this had to happen eventually and theres no real reason why ray deserves the credit the critical reaction to man ray reminds me of the story about the emperors new clothesbr br l√©toile de merde  whoops de mer  features a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish which is never explained starfishes have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs  and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies  but if that has anything to do with this movies theme ray neglects to say so i was much more impressed by this movies title cards which in french manage to include rhymes a pun si belle cybele and some portmanteauxbr br as so often in rays work there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie unfortunately the photography is largely so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her ill rate this mess one point out of 10
