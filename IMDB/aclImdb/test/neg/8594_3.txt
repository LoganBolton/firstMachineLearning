the basic plot is good and can be engaging the music is so great that it became the theme music for the tv show iron chef though it is way overused and too intrusive in the movie so how did this movie end up so poor well the plot was about 95 predictable and the characters were about as 1dimensional as possible and the dialog what person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the stupid macho bullcrap that purports to be dialog you get much greater realism from most cartoons the bottom line is that this movie has some good points but is so marred by hackneyed clich√©s and rotten dialog that it quickly becomes tiresome and this is a shame because firemen deserve a better tribute than this mess if you dont believe me look at the number of goofs listed on imdb for this movieway in excess of what youd expect to find they just didnt care enough to work out all the kinks and problems so as a result the movie seems rushed and in need of a rewrite and reediting
