if you can watch a film without worrying about the plot or corny acting then backdraft is definitely the onebr br however if like me you like watching films that you can believe then backdraft has some serious flaws it doesnt offer anything new and there are hundreds of 90s action films that follow identical formulas whilst not being quite as clunkybr br after two firefights im thinking this has got to go somewhere else i mean how many big fires are there in one city surely firemen do other things such as getting cats out of trees well i was wrong and the repetition continues again and again up until the endbr br a good aspect of the film is the fire itself well filmed and i must say i felt quite hot while watching it which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste
