i loved this movie when i was a teenager loved it it hasnt grown up with me though maybe thats because its a melodramatic load of old rubbish full of macho posturing cheesy dialogue overwrought slomo and characters saying goddammit a lot the lumpy narrative blobs gracelessly from one character to another one plot strand to another without ever bringing it all together and it doesnt help that william baldwins monoexpression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movies overlong runtime robert deniro and donald sutherland are worth watching but no ones really at the top of their game here and the women folk get particularly short thrift the only real impact comes from the impressive firefighting sequences and hans zimmers majestic score which remains one of my alltime favourites
