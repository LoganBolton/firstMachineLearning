i have no idea how anyone can give this movie high marks i didnt rent it thinking it was the next great horror flick the next great horror spoof or the next great lowbudget horror spoof obviously this isnt meant to scare but one fatal flaw with the production entirely sapped the joy out of the viewing experience the sound editing was horrible i had to work the volume control the entire movie you can imagine how difficult it is to get into something  even a lowbudget spoof  when youre either turning the volume up or down or trying to anticipate the next time you have to do so the regular dialogue is very low and all screams noises etc are very loud were not talking about toggling between 5 and 7 on the volume control finding a happy medium at 6 were talking toggling between 2 and 9 on the volume where it is virtually impossible to leave the volume alone again this movie might be a decent example of what it is meant to be but youre going to be spending so much time adjusting your volume control that youll never have the chance to enjoy it
