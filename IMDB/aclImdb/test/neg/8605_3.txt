i watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights there is no doubt that even if you enjoyed it its a bad movie but the important question is why it has a good cast its lively its prepared to tackle sex head on with some of the characters actually getting some of it here and there which is unusual for a british comedy it also has johnny vegas and mackenzie crook marmite performers agreed but theyve have had their moments in the pastbr br what its principally lacking is charm the characters are impossibly idiotic unbelievable and alienating so that instead of a film of men behaving badly the producers have made game on any mediocre writer wanting to make a film about the sexual attitudes of dozy sexist british men would have got hold of a few copies of loaded zoo or even viz to read sid the sexist and the thing would have written itself instead the producers clearly tried to make up some moronic difficult to care about characters character comedy  as opposed to slapstick etc  only works if the audience can recognise some human truth to the situation but watching this film is like being told an annoying joke that you know is not going to end up funny but you cant stop itbr br sadly the film is also poorly made the plot structure is weak theres little character delineation or development and many of the scenes arent funny time after time the same lame reggae chips in to divide scenes pointlessly and gratingly theres a lot of needless repetition  when youve done one joke about parking outside a sex party you dont need to do it again one wonders what the uk film council saw in the scriptbr br this is a world where most men are rakes and most women are continually up for it the apartment and alfie satirised much the same world view but the producers of this film accept it without criticism thus theyve ended up with a kind of inferior update of confessions of a window cleaner somebody british needs to have another go at this kind of thing and do it properly Â– a good next project for simon pegg and edgar wright i think
