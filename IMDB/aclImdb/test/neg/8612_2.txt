firstly ill admit i havent seen vampires los muertos but ive seen the original vampires film and love it i rented this film having heard nothing about it i didnt expect to be impressed i wasntbr br i love the idea of shifting the action to the far east which should have opened up a lot of new avenues for the action sequences as well as the story line but not enough was made of this the fight scenes and the motorbike chases were painfully boring br br there were some parts i liked like the way the slayer team werent shown as heroic good guys as they were in the first moviebr br id been hoping since i saw the old hammer movie legend of the 7 golden vampires a few years ago that someone would one day make another good asianbased vampire film this was not it
