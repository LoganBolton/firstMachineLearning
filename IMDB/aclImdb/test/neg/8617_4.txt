theres a good story well hidden and never really used br br the film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography somehow character and story development have been forgotten what is left is muddled and superficialbr br turn off your brain and watchÂ—you will probably find that the time goes quickly enough but unless you are the sort of person that finds soaps deep and meaningful you are going to get no real satisfaction from this filmbr br watch only if you have nothing better to do and then only if someone else pays for the video rental
