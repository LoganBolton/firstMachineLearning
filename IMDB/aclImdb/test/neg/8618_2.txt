this movie vampires the turning isnt even really worth the 2 out of 10 im giving it the movie is very predictable from beginning up to the very end when our hero kills the leader of the vampire slayers the use of music in this movie was even bad it kept playing as if you were to expect something significant to happen at any second though it never did the acting was brank at best and the movie was just dull the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story had potential though it ended up unable to deliver oh and did i mention the wardrobe the wardrobe for this movie was obviously cheap to nonexistent because our hero and his girlfriend whom hes trying to save throughout the entire movie wear the same outfits through the entire movie id suggest this film only if your really bored and dont have a good wall with fresh paint to watch dry dave the horror cowboy
