even though this was set up to be a showcase for some kickboxing and swordplay vampires the turning vtt could have aspired beyond that because it doesnt even aspire to be a good vampire movie vtt fails to deliver any punch that it may have been attempting tobr br using the idea of an 800yearold thai vampire was interesting but the story about progeny she mistakenly brought into existence and now must wipe out actually reminds me of gizmo and his plight in gremlins and that isnt a good thing when it come to a vampire flickbr br stephanie chao is attractive and serves as the good vampire very well but her lack of any accent grates when you realize that shes an 800yearold vampire added to that when she tells connor hes a young soul she doesnt deliver the line with much of the weight you would expect from an old soul attractive but not believablebr br meredith monroe was more believable in her role but for a dawsons creek alum you would think she would have more screen time the question of whether amanda succumbs and turns is the most compelling reason to continue watching this movie and you never get it you get a tease of it but you never actually get any type of development out of the characters for that plot device its a cheap way to play your audience folksbr br if you want something that is a good vampire movie go find lugosis dracula and if you want a sexy vampire movie you have dozens of flicks from hammer with a lot more strength than this one in the end if you want good or sexy this isnt the place this is just forgettable
