george sluizers remake of his own  superior  film is a complete waste of time why was it even attempted kiefer sutherland plays jeff harriman whose girlfriend sandra bullock who only has a small amount of screen timeis abducted at a service station by barney cousins jeff bridges now barney is portrayed as the kind of guy that no one would trust in a month of sundays  he lopes about like frankensteins monster but without the sympathy and bridges acting is totally awful sutherland comes across a little better when his character turns detective with the help of new love interest rita baker nancy travisbr br a major problem with this version of the vanishing is its obvious need to cater to hollywood audiences by avoiding the bleak ending of the original film here the ending is happy which seems forced and unbelievable and completely wrecks the story however by this time the damage has been done as jeff bridges turns the bad guy into a huge laugh
