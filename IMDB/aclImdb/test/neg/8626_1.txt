i cant believe this movie has 6 stars on imdb this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen that wasnt an episode of mystery science theater 3000 the plot is predictable i couldnt bring myself to care about any of the characters the dialog is cheesy several moments in the movie actually made me groan out loud including kiefer southerlands crazy neighbor and the incredibly lame joke that ends the movie jeff bridges accent is goofy  i cant tell what country hes supposed to be from it has to be one of the least thrilling thrillers ive ever seen as wellafter sandra bullocks character disappears absolutely nothing happens to advance the story for a good 45 minutes i would give this movie a negative amount of stars if i could
