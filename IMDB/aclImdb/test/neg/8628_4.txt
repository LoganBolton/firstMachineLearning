a couple are split apart during a vacation early scenes lead us to believe barney jeff bridges character has kidnapped the girl in an unexplained but premeditated abduction the film plays out some years later where despite a new love interest jeff kiefer sutherland is determined to solve her disappearancebr br the storyline is definitely intriguing but there have been some really bad decisions made during the making of this film culminating a pretty shoddy piece of workbr br ok here we go the abduction scene  aside from two major continuity errors there is a point where sandra bullock and kiefer sutherland are made to perform a little signedpetloveritual thats drowned in oversentimentality to the point of nausea we know theyre in love the i do solemnly swear never to leave you speech only moments prior was ample thank you jeff bridges robot accent is another example what is that for starman is back and it seems after a decade on the planet hes turned nasty the entire plot is then able to be resolved by the introduction of a needless character who by a rather fortunate twist of fate has quite miraculous powers of observation the climactic sequence itself has essentially been done before only much much better its riddled with further annoyances and another blinding continuity blunder i could go on but something positive needs to be said at a stretch kiefer sutherland is the only one to save face with a fairly decent performancebr br the 1988 original of the same name changed from the dutch title spoorloos for english speaking audiences was recommended to me only for an online rental company to send me this later hollywood version by mistake i was surprised to find both having been directed by george sluizer and would be interested to know his motivation for the remake i am reliably and thankfully informed it is of a much higher quality in all areas including plot horah for that but it really doesnt take much doing
