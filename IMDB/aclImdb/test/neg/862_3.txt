opening with some blatantly reused footage from kit for cat tweetys sos fails to live up to that classic cartoon instead we get an example of friz frelengs tweety and sylvester series at its most generic unlike chuck joness road runner series which strived to introduce new jokes to the same setting frelengs series seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place tweetys sos then basically amounts to this time lets put em on a boat its not an entirely weak cartoon there are a few good jokes mostly involving grannys glasses but they are outweighed by gags you can see coming a mile off the seasickness routine and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than tweety says i tawt i taw a putty tat a joke that worked well once but has diminishing returns tweetys sos will probably please children who enjoy virtually any cartoon but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags its definitely one to avoid
