if i had to pick the most depressing movie try to be suspenseful ive seen itd be this one i know about how good the original is supposed to be it had better be better then this one the movies so dark and depressing but it isnt interesting to watch eitherive seen depressing thriler type movies that were saved because of the suspense to counteratc and balence the dark quality vanishing didnt have that this was so disturbing to watch to begin with and there was nothing positive to make this a classic type movie i think another imdb poster got it right in saying this genre has just seen thrillers done in a far superior way i completely agreei would recommend skipping this onemaybe ill watch the original some day but i doubt it i give this a 2 out of 10
