george sluizers original version of the vanishing aka the man who wanted to know offers one of european cinemas most quietly disturbing sociopaths and one of the most memorable finales of all time shamelessly stolen by tarantino for kill bill volume two but it has plenty more to offer than that playing around with chronology and inverting the usual clichés of standard lady vanishes plots it also offers superb characterisation and strong underplayed but convincing performancesbr br unfortunately i can only assume that when it came to the remake sluizer was so determined that noone else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered from this disastrous misstepbr br chief culprit is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been over thought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing and this film is the proof of the pudding every movement is overly mechanical in its precision making him look like a rusty clockwork toy while his voice is a bizarre mixture of tootsie latka gravas from taxi and a dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from doktah eville no banality of evil here just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying please let me kill you thank you for your consideration but the blame really needs to be shared out here none of the performances are good often they dont even look good  keifer sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station nancy travis flounders badly and sandra bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession not that theyre given any help by either director or writer todd graff the script is particularly weak the chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film worse is the rush the film is in draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next rather than the highlow mood shifts in the couples relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that hes probably better off without her as for the new and improved happy ending  standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame lets end on a joke like a tv cop show moment  best not go there which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry goldsmith score cant do anything for this one
