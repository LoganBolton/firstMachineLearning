this film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the very protracted end br br the plot is confused and laboured the actors have a couldnt care less attitude maybe they were paid in advance  bad move or knew they werent going to get paid and the sets were featureless boring and cheapbr br i fell asleep twice and actually decided to not bother with the last 5 minutes as i assumed the actors would have fallen asleep themselves by then more unrecoverable life time wastedbr br if you must watch it then take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once but maybe youll need an antidepressant insteadbr br sometimes its good if celluloid degrades
