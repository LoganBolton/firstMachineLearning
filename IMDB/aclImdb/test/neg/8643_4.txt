i rented this movie because i noticed the cover in the video rental store i saw nolte connely madsen 40s time setting and thought hmm cant be too bad unfortunately after watching it my impression was not too goodbr br its kind of a chinatown ripoff but the worst part is that other than nolte the other members of the squad didnt get enough screen time but its a decent movie to see once i guess and melanies role was small enough that she wasnt given a chance to be a nuisance
