i went to see this film at the cinema on the strength of its potentially interesting subject matter good cast a director who had previously done the highlyrated once were warriors and my liking for noirish films set in la in the forties and fifties i would argue that i am reasonably easy to please in this film category i appreciate the classics of the genre but i will sit through and enjoy a halfdecent if derivative effort as well however i found this film completely unbearablebr br despite a good situation in which to place the story nobody seems to do or say anything remotely interesting or entertaining in the whole twohours plus of this sorry mess good actors are wasted in endless scenes of dialogue ranging from banal to embarrassing the narrative is slack and drags unbearably and none of the events it depicts is handled well enough to do anything other than bore the audience to death there is no drama no atmosphere no tension absolutely no entertainment value and by the end i simply didnt care what happened because i did not believe in anything in the filmbr br la confidential came out a year later and regardless of whether one version of the story is more truetolife the latter film deservedly gets all the plaudits for its excellence in every department mulholland falls by contrast fails in every department a fact made all the more tragic by the amount of talent involved if they ever show this on a plane i will still walk out
