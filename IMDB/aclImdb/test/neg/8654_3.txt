i agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love in fact it makes sex seem so boring and makes me wonder why bother i actually dont think at all this remotely speaks of how canadian indian second generations feel about sex at any rate did you know the first hoteldrunk idea was copied from a korean movie yopgijogin gunyo made in 2001 or thereabouts that korean film was actually brilliant as comedy but at the same time compels the audience to reflect on the complexity of manwoman relationships and manwoman difference in experience and thinking i mean most of the neal n nikki hoteldrunk segment was emulated take by take cant bollywood movie makers try to make originals only please seriously i never enjoyed a hindi flick that is a copycat the ones i enjoy have always spoken indian feelings through indian cultural means
