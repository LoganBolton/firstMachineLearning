what a crappy movie the main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in canada yet he had a thicker indian accent than his parents is it just me or does uday look gay in this movie also do all the chicks in canada dress like sluts at least thats how it is in this movie all the females are dressed like strippers dont waste your time with this one the only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful vancouver wonder why bollywood is going through a slump its because of movies like this i miss the good old days when hindi movies were actually entertainingi couldnt even finish this movie because it was so bad i think bollywood needs to stop trying to replicate the style of hollywood because its just not working out they need to stick to their roots because thats what makes indian movies entertaining
