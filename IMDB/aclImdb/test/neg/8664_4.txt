mansfield park in its second half is my favorite of austens novels and fanny price my favorite of her heroines so im saddened by the unhappy fate shes suffered in her big and smallscreen representations the only good reading of the character ive heard was done for radio by amanda root who gave it the same quality as she did the character anne in the film of persuasion a stern sure heartfelt moral centeredness if the actress had been younger she would have been good visual casting as well but the fannys that have reached our eyes to date have more resembled respectively mary crawford ruby the scullery girl and in this incarnation a jovial serving wench or possibly tart with her high moral principles pulled down a pegbr br well i had hoped for better but had feared worse the serial had a solid edmund in an actor who was best at likable saps and the perfect ie perfectly abominable mrs norris otherwise it was dullish the film which was apparently intended as a deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea came off as a mixedup burlesque after such disappointments and the more recent disappointments of this productions sister pieces the new persuasion and northanger abbey i couldnt help but have mixed expectations for this one and on the whole it left me feeling slightly better disposed to it than not it condensed the novel intelligently and in the end left me with much the same feeling as a comicbook version might on the other hand to do so it had to rework most of the characters except the crawfords and it incidentally diminished or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book including its most famous character and what should be if it isnt its most famous scenebr br the character is the officious aunt norris always ready to direct other people in what to do but always managing to avoid having to do any of it herself here one gets no sense of that at all and with her goes much else her remark that cuts through fanny considering who and what you are sir thomass discovery that she has forbidden fanny a fire in her room all these years and his roundabout apology for her fannys honesty in acknowledging during a visit home that aunt norris for all her faults could manage the household better than either of her sisters but then that entire trip is missing from the story and so is most of what goes on at the theatrical rehearsals and most of what discomfits sir thomas on his return and in fact sir thomas himself and his wife are different from what they were above all the scene in which crawford proposes to fanny one of austens most complex is simplified to a bare telling missing from it is fannys staunch upholding of what she knows to be right and what she knows to be very probably true against all the distractions crawford and anybody else can throw at her to a male reader now no less than when it was written it reveals with unmatched clarityunmatched at any rate as far as i knowwhat a woman goes through in trying to deal fairly but firmly with a man she has reason to distrust its a brilliant scene in the novel on tv its just a scenebr br and fanny oh fanny when will we see your like
