rozemas 1999 adaptation of mansfield park is far superior to this ostensibly slightly more faithful film the 1999 film is reviled by many austen purists but i admire the job rozema did in making mansfield park her own it may not be strictly jane austens mansfield park but at least it was wellwritten beautifully shot and wellacted by a superior cast i dont see how austen purists can be any happier with this 2007 version from itv and rebroadcast on masterpiece theatrepbs the screenplay is shoddily pasted together and dumbed down to boot the production values are lackluster and the cast apart from jemma redgrave and blake ritson are largely guilty of bad acting i cant think of a worst miscast than billie piper as fanny price her look was all wrong bleached hair and dark brows and her talent simply wasnt suited to the material sir thomas looked constipated the whole time michelle ryan as mariah was on autopilot as were the actors who portrayed the crawfords when i think how superior alessandro nivola and embeth davidtz were in the 99 version i just kinda shake my headbr br i havent seen the 1983 version so i cant comment on it but id advise anyone whos curious to give the 99 version a chance read the novel before or after and make up your own mind
