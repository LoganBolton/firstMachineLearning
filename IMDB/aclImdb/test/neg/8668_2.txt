ive read plenty of jane austen in my time and approve of several cinematv adaptations but this one we just dont needbr br rating is a 2 as i wouldnt say its awful just so boring you will feel like youve wasted 90 minutes of your life dull script matched by even duller acting ive heard billie piper is ok in dr who not a fan so cant confirm but in this she just sucks there is absolutely no chemistry between the leads this is austen its supposed to be a romancebr br please dont let this put you off austen or historical dramas there are plenty of better programmes to view
