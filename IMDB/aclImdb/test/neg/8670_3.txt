why bother itv admittedly mansfield park is the most difficult of the novels to get and fanny is certainly the hardest to like but if one is going to take it on then have the courage to risk being true to the book and its rather complicated spirit and for heavens sake have the guts to cast fanny as she was written a prissy goodhearted sweetish whiner mrs norris wasnt nearly as awful as she should have been and what the heck happened to portsmouth the contrast between fannys rather dubious family and family home and the splendors of mansfield is key to well so many aspects of fannys refusal of henry her uncles rejection henrys near transformation to a good person etc etc again given the complexity and challenges of the novel why did they bother its beyond me
