mom begins at night in the middle of nowhere at what looks like a wooden building in the desert a pickup truck pulls up  an angry father chucks his slutty daughter virginia monroe claudia christian out  leaves her there but she isnt alone as the shadowy figure of nestor duvalier brion james watches her from a short distance virginia tries to make conversation but as she grinds a cigarette out under her leopard print thigh high high heeled boots nestor grabs her by her throat  drags her off into the darkness nestor then rips her top open turns into a monster  starts to eat her innards virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that have lieutenant carlo hendrix art evans  the lapd baffled or at least thats the message a local tv news reporter named clay dwyer mark thomas miller is telling his viewers clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend alice mary beth mcdonough  therefore his mother emily jeanne bates has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the blind dark sunglass wearing nestor unfortunately for emily she accidentally knocks nestors sunglasses off which reveal he has strange coloured eyes nestor then turns into a monster again  bites emily turning her into a flesheating monster just like himself nestor takes emily out to train her they find a suitable homeless bum rory vansaint murder him  eat his guts but emilys son clay has witnessed the whole thing  he must choose between doing what is right  his love for his mother who now just happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking  flesheating monsterbr br edited written  directed by patrick rand i thought mom was a pretty awful film looking at some of the other comments on the imdb  the genre listing it has been given it appears many seem to think that mom is a comedy horror well i can tell you now that i didnt see any comedic elements in mom at all because there arent any unless they are very subtle the only thing that i can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation which mom presents that being an old lady turning into a flesheating monster  the predictable problems  emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out there are no jokes apart from naming a prostitute beverly hills stella stevens slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself  as far as i could see it is played totally straight throughout its 90 minute run time so with there being no comedy in mom that must mean theres lots of horror right wrong mom sucks  is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of nestor turning into a monster a couple of times biting emily showing her how to hunt for food  clay finding out until this point mom was moving at a fairly decent pace had some ok special makeup effects  had me interested unfortunately mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by emilys son the eventual breakdown of his marriage  him being torn between love for his mother  the fact that shes a flesheating monster this part of the film is incredibly slow boring  as dull as dishwater even having the nerve to resort to a clich√©d rolereversal scenario where clay tells his mom to go to her room  stay there locking the door behind her telling her off  putting bars over her window so she cant escape her room moms script totally ignores the monsters origins  asks us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should no matter how silly an explanation might have been i think some background to the monster would have helped technically mom is bland  cheap looking although i cant say its badly made its very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or anything with which i could make fun of to pass the time the special makeup effects on the monster are ok but their used in very quick flashes blink  youll miss them dont be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like i was the monster is only in it three times maximum  all of those are within the pacey first thirty minutes there isnt much gore either a severed arm some brief intestine eating a burnt body  a drill in someones arm is all we get the acting is ok but please mr brion james what is that dodgy accent all about at least james had the good sense to know he was in crap  sensibly opted to be killed off early on in the proceedings everyone else are nobodies expect the black lieutenant who was also a black police officer in fright night 1985 but you may recognise him from die hard 2 1990 he made mom  die hard 2 in the same year talk about opposite ends of the spectrum overall there is nothing by which i can really recommend mom as a horror film  it certainly isnt a comedy as far as im concerned very poor very disappointing  yet again ive been conned by fancy videobox artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters definitely one to avoid
