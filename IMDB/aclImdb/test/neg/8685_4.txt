minor plot spoilersbr br i must confess to having a soft spot for wayne crawford i know little about him but he appears to have masses of enthusiasm to compensate for his lack of talent in his films he usually performs multitasks  perm any 3 from lead male director producer and scriptwriter  tackling story lines from the subbasement despite this the end product is usually enjoyable fun for the nondiscerningbr br the evil below features crawford as a downonhisluck captain of a ramshackle charter boat a bit like bogart in to have  have not  the similarities between the films ends here thoughbr br the story begins with an underwater scene with two divers searching a wreck before being attacked by an unseen creature  bit like the start of jaws 2 the wreck turns out to be that of the el diablo which went down centuries earlier the ship was manned by heretic priests on the run from spain with a cargo of stolen church treasure this allows the introduction of various links to supernatural forces with lucifer and the armageddon both getting a look in the films title refers to this sunken devilship rather than any malevolent seacreaturebr br whatever faults the film has and there are many it is fun to watch and competently made you cant help but like a film which in the final 5 minutes copies the famous beach scene in from here to eternity and the final line from casablanca
