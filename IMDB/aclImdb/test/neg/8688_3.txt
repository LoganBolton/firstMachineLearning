the vhs cover for the evil below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick sadly its closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements it starts off with some divers who get attacked and we see a bit of blood but thats the only blood in the entire filmbr br the evil below isnt the worst around but for a horror film it is tediously boring the acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads theres a few nightmare sequences where it just seems like the director didnt know what to do i manged to sit through it all just about but i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone horror fans might want a copy for the cool vhs cover but its best left at that
