from the english accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence showing moses as a murderer people who actually believe in the old testament will just sit there and shake their heads i am not a religious person at all but even i felt as though the writers of this movie were trying to turn us all against god and the jewswhen moses picked up that rock and threw the first stone at the woman to kill her for committing adultery i wanted to stone the writers i cant believe in this day and age that hallmark and abc disney would attempt to show such garbage as this dont we have enough problems in this world already
