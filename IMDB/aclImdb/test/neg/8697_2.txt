this movie could have had a lot of potential certainly with todays technology one would expect real special effects but movies are not made with special effects alone of course acting is needed this film lacked bothbr br first let me say to those who are upset with this not following the bible why cant a movie take artistic license if you want to know about the story of moses read the bible i have seen very few movies that follow a true story fact by fact look at of movie from its artistic quailitiesbr br in viewing this movie you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version it fails miserably in that heston and brenner had presence they became their roles you dont see this herebr br even if you dont compare standing on its own this movie to too rushed parts where a scene should be developed it does not it becomes boringbr br my advice skip this and watch the other as campy as the other is its far and away the better movie
