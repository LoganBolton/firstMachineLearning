this movie was a waste of 3 hours of my precious timein the first 10 minutes i was already annoyed as i am familiar with the real version on the story according to the torah 5 books of mosesbut i decided to watch it to get my moneys worth and too see how bad it sucked well it suckedway more then i thought it would first and for most lets start with the script and characters the skeleton that makes up the body of a movie if you study torah at all youll see that the story is all wrong here are some of the distasful mistakes moses doesnt do slave work because he was in the tribe of levi moses doesnt kill anybody at mount sinai but yet the movie depicts moses being whipped and aaron and himself killing peoplereeeealllly not when moses speaks to the burning bush he knows who hes speaking too but the movie makes moses look like an idiot he states that he doesnt know who the gd in the bush is whateveraaron knews his brother well regardless of their distance growing up aaron was known for his calm composed peaceful nature but yet he is depicted as angry and arrogant in this movie moses looks like jesus in this movie how ridiculouspharoah the real one was actually and ugly dwarf who sat upon a pyramid of stairs so he could appear bigger then he was and moses was more then 10 feet and in the movie pharoah is taller then him and hes hot with light eyes the woman of am israel nation of israel covered themselves meaning their hair and bodies and they didnt dance or sing in front of men they did not participate in the golden calf so they would definitely not dance with a man in public as the movie depicts mosess wife tzipora was married to moses and she therefore covered herself and being as humble as they were did not cuddle or hold hands in public batia pharoahs daughter  the one who adopts him and saves him from the water actual converted to judaism and therefore would have been proud of moses when he said he was going to go free his peoplefast fwd to mount sinai moses comes down the 2nd time with two sets of tabletswith gibberish writing on itat least put the writing in the holy tongue hebrew or english and put it on one tablet not two sets bottom line is the movie is horribly written directed and the characters are all wrongbasically everything is wrong about the movie the old one is inaccurate as well but its more realistic and they actors are believable am israel chai
