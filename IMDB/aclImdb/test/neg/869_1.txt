this is probably the most uninvolving film ive ever seen i watched it because i have a soft spot for leon everything else besson has done has been just awful in my opinion with the exception of the script for wasabi and jean reno its a testament to just how bad this film is that reno one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable actors admittedly hes just starting out here cant make this film or the moments in which he is on screen watchablebr br its all very filmschooly black and white no dialogue people doing things for no apparent reason people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera and predictably none of it is entertainingbr br its not a french mad max as some people have claimed actually i think they mean mad max 2  that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a postapocalyptic setting and is just the kind of comment youd expect from someone who doesnt know what theyre talking about mad max 2 was pulsating mad max 2 was exciting mad max 2 was worth your time  le dernier combat is none of thesebr br i know its supposed to be cool to like arty blackandwhite french films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy which is why i wouldnt trust anyone who claims to like le dernier combat because i see nothing of worth in it whatsoever it asks for so much and gives nothing back i found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention anyone who can sit through it undistracted isnt human or at the very most is psychotic actually theyre probably just trying to seem cool
