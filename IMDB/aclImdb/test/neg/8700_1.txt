if youre a fan of the original ten commandments this movie will make you weep inside granted im only about 12 hour into it currently but its so painful i felt it was my duty to warn away real ten commandments fans before they are subjected to this bastardization i didnt think it was possible to actually make the special effects worse than they were in 1950s when the original was shot but this 2006 remake proves me wrong i can forgive some lame special effects but the craptastic dialogue melodramatic lifetime moviestyle schlockiness and the stilted wearewaxfigurescometolife acting makes me hope theyll rewrite the plot and drown moses in the red sea
