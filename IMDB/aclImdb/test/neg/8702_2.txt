i realise its very hard to live up to the first the 10 commandments movie which was grandiose and personally not a charleton heston fan but wowthis movieminiseries was disappointing even the animated the prince of egypt was betterbr br the one thing that threw me off was ramses compared to yul brynners version paul rhyss version just seemed so weak and unpharoh like the acting really wasnt that great for a modern adaptation i was expecting something better it just didnt look as stunning visually as the first one i guess they were running on a tight budget or something theres an occasional voiceover narrator which i found strange and unnecessary it also broke up the flow of the story and umgods voicelines were kinda weird
