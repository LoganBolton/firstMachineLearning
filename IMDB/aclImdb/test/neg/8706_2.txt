with a name like 10 commandments you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the bible specifically exodus not so here this is standard procedure with any biblical hallmarkmade film remember noah that was utter fiction and one of the worst films ever made at least this film had some truth to the original story however menerith who was a major character in this movie  halfbrother of moses is not in the original story other characters were absent not to mention important events were completely eliminated so what you may ask because this should be representative of the actual story otherwise some might and do believe that is the way it actually happened in todays age people get their religion from movies instead of church and reading the bible also it is a great error see revelation 221819 the script is already written why change it other than the account in exodus itself which should be the main focus you have the cecil b demille film to compare it to which is clearly a far better presentationbr br the night it first aired my wife was anxious to see it i told her not to get her hopes up because it was a hallmarkfilm she looked puzzled and said why hallmark makes good movies that might be so but they butcher the bible im sorry to say that i was correct not just the story but the acting as well with todays technology you should be able to make a wonderful biblical movie im still waiting
