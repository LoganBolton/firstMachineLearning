every great romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic leads to lend suspense anticipation and allure to the plot this story falls completely flat in this area there is no conflict  at least none that would inhibit the eventual joining of the two lead characters and so suspense is flat there is no anticipation and there really is no allure at allbr br the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane is representative of friendship at best and with the talent of these two particular actors i was quite surprised during the movie i expected them more to play a game of checkers and chat about the weather than see any moving passionbr br while im a fan of both actors i do believe that the casting in this movie was off  or perhaps the direction was offbase and it impacted their deliveries the writing was very weak which also might have impacted the performances most certainly the script could have used some help from some harlequin writers who have real experience putting the heat in romancebr br this movie may be worth watching on a rainy sunday afternoon but only after its on the cheap shelfbr br sorry diane ladd and richard gere
