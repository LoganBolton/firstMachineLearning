i watched this series out of curiositywanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technologyout do cecil b demilles classic epic of 1956 starring charleton hestonyul brenner and sir cedric hardwicke of course i was let down yes they had all the biblical characters correct but they didnt give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes that held your interest throughout the first movie if you going to have a miniseries you have to have some rivoting scenes the burning bush parting the red seadrowning pharohs armies building sethis pyramids could have been done with todays technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as lord of the rings or the matrix obviously they didnt want to leave a lasting impression of faith and sacrifice which is much needed in these trouble times
