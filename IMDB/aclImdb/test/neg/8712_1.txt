i nearly fell asleep during a screening of this of a boring story that seems to go on forever it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks after a heated affair the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they must go on their separate waysbr br the male prostitute then goes on a downward selfdestructive spiral trying to find his one true love repeatedly returning to the same places they frequented looking for more clues or signs as to where he may locate his lovebr br in the meanwhile he hooks up with one ugly guy who i thought was also a male prostitute a gay basher and some guy who ends up having a threesecond sexual intercourse session with him in a back alleybr br it never ceases to amaze me how films still portray random sex acts as scenes that can take place in a brief matter of seconds such as in this case where the trick barely has his pants unbuckled before thrusting three times and miraculously experiencing orgasm br br all of these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them to which he discards their telephone numbersbr br there is a brief sideplot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time for his lifestyle there is also another brief sideplot involving some random conversation with a young woman who has noticed him several times standing on the bridge from her window and there is also one more brief sideplot involving him showing the letter to a male acquaintance but the audience is not advised of his relation to this personbr br none of these things really connect with each other only to show us how lost and confused this young man really is he seems to be living life like a ghost there was one good scene in the entire movie that involved him rummaging through a yard sale looking for a particular record with the worlds saddest song on itbr br otherwise this movie just seems to go on forever filmed in black and white it may seem very dreamlike but sitting in the theater for nearly two hours watching this drivel will resemble something more like a nightmarebr br i found the ending to be confusing as i wasnt quite sure whether the young man had died and gone to heaven that would have been a nice pay off to end the misery that both audience and the main character had to endure in this meaningless tripe but seeing as this is an independent film movies with endings like these are supposed to encourage you to use your imagination br br for those of you who are seeking out nudity there are only brief scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive are artfully concealed within the shadows in other words dont waste your time with this onebr br my rating  2 out of 10
