a terrible deception controversial film winner of the teddy in berlin 2003 mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco the actors are all reciting well they are not exactly actors the film tried to be a high bet but ends up being a doubtful bet it stays in the superficiality of two guys kissing and a guy whose lover is gone it has no purpose nothing to do with the homosexuality presented in other films eg before night falls 2000 by julian schnabel technically the only thing that works is the photography otherwise the camera is put in strange angles to make it more artfilm and the whole film runs in a black and white atmosphere the film is so pretentious that bothers i mean its good to be pretentious when you have talent to support it or maybe it is that its so artcinema that its incomprehensible the story flows slowly slowly slowly to me more form than essence superb edition it was good superb direction dont think so the film is weak it was an interesting project its a shame its a flaw one star out of four
