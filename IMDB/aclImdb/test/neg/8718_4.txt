while the david lynch version of dune is choppy awkward and unfaithful to the novel it is visually well designed and well acted the best one can say about the sci fi channels attempt to make dune into a miniseries is that its ambitious actually that is virtually the only positive praise one can offer the actors with few exceptions seem happy to recite their lines with the least emotion possible and the least appropriate accents the costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a a large surplus of mylar fabric on hand and an unhealthy love of unflattering headwearbr br in part this miniseries suffers from living in the shadow of lynchs already well known effort however it takes elements from lynchs film which were not present in the novel and copies them nearly wholesale ie the guild steersmans navigation sequence and this only encourages encourages negative comparison to lynchs film a for effort d for virtually everything else
