the dune miniseries opens with a flashforward montage of action sequences the realisation quickly dawns that these are the best scenes out of the 265 minute running time and theyre not good not good at all oh dear br br but let us not judge a book by its cover even though thats exactly what were being invited to do lets give dune a chance to redeem itselfbr br well heres the expected watery opening on caladan but whos this petulant strangely ugly man paul atreides this is paul atreides this generic plastic puppet and why does he look so old whats that the actors only 25 well he doesnt look it and thats way too old anywaybr br but at least he has charisma right wrong alec newman is a stumbling mumbling buffoon im picturing him being discovered sitting in the dark in a remedial acting class because nobody liked him enough to tell him the class was over and hes just too dumb to realise it when your paul atreides has all the screen prescence of soggy toast and an acting range from petulant to blank your production of dune is doomed from the startbr br the other actors take pity on poor alec though and give uniformly insipid and incomprehensible performances so that he doesnt look too bad by comparison at least i assume that is what they are doing because im charitable you seebr br to be fair they are clearly being given no direction at all random gestures blank or inconsistent deliveries missing their marks its all here this is like a master class in how not to do itbr br and sure there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than there are in the 1984 movie but there arent twice as many because of all the pauses to fill timebr br but we can forgive all this because of the small budget of 20 million or only 5 million per hour nobody could be expected make quality science fiction on that sort of budgetbr br except perhaps stargate sg1 which makes do with 14 million per 50 minute episode or farscape at 2 million and frankly id rather watch four episodes of either of those while being punched in the kidneys than have to sit though the travesty that is dune the miniseries again
