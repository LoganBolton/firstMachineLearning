what can i say after having read herberts books and loving lynchs movie version i was extremely disappointed i felt i was watching a reject version of buck rogers the sets looked like left overs from a star wars tv special i felt the acting was a bit amateurish by most the costumes were garish and over done which gave it a 60s flash gordon pulp feel the worms theyre supposed to be sand worms and yet they appeared to big stalagtites with a mouth at the blunt end the effects in general were pretty second rate i wont even start about the disgraceful navigator effectbr br this socalled frank herberts dune wasnt even faithfull to his books it should have been called frank herberts dune  for dummies key plot elements were left out names were changed and the entire feel of the story was sanitised i didnt even recognise the harkonnens in fact most of the characters appeared nothing like herberts descriptions had depicted them im starting to get upset just remembering what a tragedy it was im glad i couldnt stomach the second installment
