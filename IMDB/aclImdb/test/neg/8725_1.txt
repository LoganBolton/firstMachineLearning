thats a weird weird movie and doesnt deserve a better mark than david lynchs one the special effects are badly made the actors are majorly bad actors and in this movie its not about a race which is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the dominators but it seems to be a crazy movie which pays homage to sect kind of organisations thats surely not the will of frank herbert the author of the six part epic check out david lynchs one thats the perfect tribute to the novels
