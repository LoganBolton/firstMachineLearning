after his career as a romantic leading man ended in the late 1960s rock hudson starred in lots of different projects including tv shows and lesser films however i believe that embryo is his only turn as a mad scientist and thats probably a good thing i guess he needed the workbr br driving along one dark and stormy night brilliant dr paul holliston hudson hits and injures a doberman which he brings back to his lab that looks somewhat like a dank midwestern basement he then manages to raise the dogs unborn puppy outside the womb so naturally he decides to do the same thing with a human being he raises victoria the beautiful barbara carrera from a fetus the same way victoria grows at an astonishing pace and soon blossoms into a gorgeous young womanbr br predictably things go very wrong after a halcyon beginning hollistons sisterinlaw martha diane ladd begins to wonder where the young woman came from and victoria herself begins to show signs of instability and violence the final sequence is one long car chase straight out of smokey and the bandit after which victoria혰who has shockingly aged in just a few minutes혰is assaulted by a frantic holliston who tries in vain to destroy his malformed creation along with its unborn child all of this is accompanied by screeching tires roaring engines a car fire and lots of sirens the limp ending혰a bunch of paramedics frantically working on victoria while holliston writhes in regret혰is more labored than creepybr br although just made in 1976 this movie is very dated the only difference between this and the many 1940s mad scientist movies is that hudson plays the lead role rather than boris karloff the sets are pretty cheap and very antiquated to todays audiences to the extent that hudsons reeltoreel tape recorder is about the size of a refrigerator much of the action takes place in a poorly lighted laboratory hudson sleepwalks through his sordid role giving the impression that hes truly a washedup movie star while ladd and carrera are much more believable surprisingly roddy mcdowall pops up briefly as a chess playerbr br the passport video transfer is very substandard looking as though it had been made from a poor vhs copy using home equipment if youre nostalgic for 1976 watch this once just to say you did otherwise watch a football game or soap opera instead
