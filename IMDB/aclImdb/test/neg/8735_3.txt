first and foremost id like to state  for the record  that its incredibly dumb to call your movie embryo when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses animal as well as human aged 1216 weeks the embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase okay in all honestly i didnt know all this but i took the effort of looking it up and thats the also the least thing the creators of embryo could have done dont worry im not just stumbling over details or being exaggeratedly bitter as there are several more reasons to state why embryo is a huge failure actual science can be considered as boring and inaccessible and thus science fiction is a cinematic genre created especially to make the otherwise tedious yet educational science topics more interesting and comprehensible to larger audiences by depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of lightyears of void filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and at the same time teach them useful little trivia about science in order to make a good or at least halfwaydecent science fiction movie writers and directors only have to comply with one basic rule dont be boring if they cant fulfill this one condition the viewer might as well read a theoretically accurate book something must have gone wrong during the production of ralph nelsons embryo the basic premise is potentially fascinating and even involving as were all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn babies there also were some very prominent names involved in the production like main stars rock hudson giant seconds diane ladd chinatown alice doesnt live here anymore and director nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics soldier blue and charly then what went wrong simple the script is irredeemably boring clich√©d and the whole thing looks incredibly foolish because the lab scenery  scientific equipment is clearly too primitive to achieve any medical breakthroughs with br br rock hudson in a very poor performance plays a doctor who hasnt put any passion in his research work ever since his wife passed away when his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the dying animals fetuses he manages to keep one fetus alive impressively accelerates its growth process and trains it to become an extremely intelligent dog because his procedure is so successful dr paul holliston convinces his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide the female subject unexpectedly keeps growing at a fast rate however and after only a couple of weeks shes a fullgrown ravishing and superintelligent woman the good doctor naturally falls in love with her but the groundbreaking new growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film apart from a lot of implausible and overly melodramatic mumbojumbo and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog that second half of the film does contain a little bit of grotesque action and suspense but by then the stupidity of the dialogs and the implausible plottwists already ruined the potentially fabulous scifi idea there are some really cool scenes most notably the chessshowdown between victoria and roddy mcdowall in a highly memorable and ultraobnoxious supportive role the grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous and it almost feels like ralph nelson put in that final disastrous shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller  scifi cinema the last sequence including the horrible freezeframe shot at the end certainly doesnt fit the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film but anyway my sincere admiration and respect to the dog and his trainers an animal with such intellect and talent surely deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better film
