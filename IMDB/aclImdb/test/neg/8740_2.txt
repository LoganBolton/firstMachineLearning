having sat and watched this film i can only wonder at the reasons for creating the film this was without a doubt one of the worst films ive ever seen and had no redeeming featuresbr br if it was supposed to be funny then it might have managed to be a very weak comedy but as an action thriller it was direbr br slow no plot no real action nothing approaching good dialogue and ive no idea about the characters what else can i say avoid
