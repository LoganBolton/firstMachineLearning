this joins the endless line of corny predictable 50s scifi shlock out there as usual its pretty bad there isnt much of a plot that i could detect and the overexaggeration of the leads only adds to the unintentional laughs the title is misleading also catching this on mst3k is probably the only way for it to be viewed and its better left that way
