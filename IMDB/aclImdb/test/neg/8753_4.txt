yesthe movie is not a piece of art but the first time i watched it i was 10 years oldmy parents were out and i stayed home with my two brothersit was may 1970i know that because i found a note about the cycle of horror movies that one network hadits one of the most vivid memories i have with the guyswe ended all in one bed and covered up to the head our very first horror movie we kept talking about it for years and laughing about the momentthose were horror moviesnowadays horror movies are always the sameor was it better when we were kids enjoying without analyzing the plot and the cast and the dialogs most sure it was thatbut for me this is a great movie
