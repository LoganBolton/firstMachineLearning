oh the horror ive seen a lot of gore movies in my day but this one just makes me gag with with laughter rather than repulsiveness this is definitely a crazy movie and is very lowbudget i might add but if youre able to look past the cheap audio horrible dialogue ugly girls the obviously fake gore scenes and overall cheeziness of the film then you might find some of this film to be somewhat entertaining the story is about a copy cat killer who goes on a killing spree every 5th day of the 5th month of the 5th year wow how original and its up to two detectives one of whom gave a valiant effort at trying to make the crapy dialogue good to stop the killers bloody rampage the killing scenes which are done with a plastic toy knife are pretty brutal which is a good thing but very annoying due to the constant repetition of an obviously recorded scream which is very ear piercing as for the gore theres plenty of it but it looks very fake especially the blood  dude cmon purple blood but if youre a fan of gore videos like myself then youll find something in this video to cherish like i did the craptalking detectivehes the best thing going for this film other than that all youre going to find is a bunch of senseless nudity which is also a good thing but too bad the girls are ooogly and a very idiotic hippy necrophiliac serial killer sorry but this one sucks
