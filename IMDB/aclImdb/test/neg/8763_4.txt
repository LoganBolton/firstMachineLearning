one of low budget horror schlockmeister actor john carradines more animated roles as a implied nazi scientist who is turning humans into zombies to serve the reich mindless scuffling brain dead only able to obey the most simple of ordersbit like staff in mcdonaldsbr br hitler isnt mentioned by name since america wasnt at war at the time they was filmed but its pretty obvious who the bad guys are working forbr br there seems to be two types of zombies in film the traditional voodoo type popular in the old black  white films of the 1930s and 40s blank eyed and just following the commands of someone else as they stumble along and then there is the type we know from later films like the night of the living dead and the evil dead still roaming about but with only the intention to kill and eat the flesh and brains of their victims both have their moments in various movies over the years br br revenge features the former zombie type although these are particularly goofy looking and would look more at home in an old time freak shows as geeks as they bite the heads off chickens one black zombie named lazarus with his wild hair looks like a young don kingbr br as to the plot the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie along with the others and thats where he makes his mistake even though he lets her keep her strappy heels as a nice womanly touch as he turns her into one of the living dead shes not happy about itbr br it all goes horribly wrong and ends in tears and the moral of the tale must be never ever turn your wife into a zombie its just asking for troublebr br the film is interesting enough and it quickly rolls along to a finish but never rises above its poverty row origins not a patch on any true zombie classics but fun just the same
