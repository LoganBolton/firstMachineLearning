as an avid fan of christian film and a person trying to maintain a keen eye for improvements in the realm of christian filmmaking i was excited to get a chance to see this film i was ready to see something that would make a new mark in quality movies i was left disappointedbr br the beginning scene is excellent though a slight ripoff of leon  the professional on the angle it showcases some great cinematography in the early goings everything after that was pretty much downhillbr br i was barely able to sit through this one i was tempted multiple times just to shut it offbr br the acting while quite possibly sincere was incredibly awful but then again the heart of the problem was the screenplay itself the dialog was worse than anything i have ever seen and even my amateurish screenplay the awakening soon to be an independent film looked like a hitchcockthriller next to this which isnt saying much the bright side of this film is that it was filmed on sonys brand new highdefinition 900 cameras shooting in 24p this film and star wars attack of the clones were the first movies ever to use these new technology cameras that year unfortunately the cameras performance seemed to be wasted with bad lighting poor angles and awkward handlingbr br the only good feeling i got coming out of watching this movie was how good my rookie indie film is going to look next to it   410
