not to waste your time watching this vanity project ive had my comment deleted twice now for reasons that i have yet to understand other than the suspicion that someone involved with gone isnt happy with what i had to say so ive pared things down to the nittygritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone nor unfair commentary br br gone is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words horrible stilted dialogue a script that just plain flails about like a fish out of water acting that would embarrass the most selfcentered of community theater divas cinematography inspired by the survivor school of swooping crane shots followed by static nostrilexploring closeups terrible adr work special visual effects that arent pedestrian music that totally fails to sustain any mood or emotion terrible editing with utterly pointless freezes and fades no art direction to speak ofthe litany of badness just goes on and oni felt genuinely cheated out of the time it took me to fast forward through most of ittime that could have been better spent staring at a wallunder no circumstances should anyone unfortunate enough to be reading this subject themselves to this movie because long before its over they will be wishing they had been raptured before they made that mistake br br case closed amen
