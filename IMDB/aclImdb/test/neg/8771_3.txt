im a christian and i have watched pretty of christian movies but this one is too bad they try to make this good but its too hard for them i thinkbr br  you can see the film is badly dubbed in many places  you can almost think that the mainpersons in this film was the only ones left behind i think there will be a lot more of thembr br  the quality is poor and the acting could have been better too the story is not so very bad but couldve been better the only plus i give is to the story in this film but totally i cant rate it more than 310 watch left behind instead
