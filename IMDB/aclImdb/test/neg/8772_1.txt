one of the reviewers here wrote good acting good special effects greatbr br location even better ending  all i can say is ugh this movie was painful to watch let me start by saying this i am a christian considered extremely conservative by many people i know so what i am about to say is not biased by thebr br christian content of the film im not gonna bash it because its christian i am gonna give it a 210 because its a horrible movie the writing is bad over the top way too preachy and much of the preachy stuff is just plain irrelevant to the story it just makes for bad scriptwriting whether i agree with thebr br screenwriters beliefs is irrelevant make a good script that flows well stays on track and is believable the acting was amateurish at best but hey when you cast amateurs you getbr br amateur performances dirk been may have been on survivor but that showbr br requires zero acting ability playing on his name and reputation to sell units is in bad taste cast unknowns who can act and youll have a much better film the effects were horrible the scene with the hail and the subsequent falling of the stars was embarrassing to watch and what was so great about the ending it made no senseyeah i know whatbr br tim chey was going for but it missed the mark bigtime i bought this film and expected so much more based on reviews and thebr br misinformation on their website and although i was hoping for more i got what i always get when i watch christian films an under budget poorly written pathetically acted badly produced piece of kaka maybe someday someone will finally step up to the plate with an endtimes film as wellwritten and as wellmade as gibsons passion was 210 stars
