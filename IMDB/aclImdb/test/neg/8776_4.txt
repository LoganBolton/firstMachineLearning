i loved this movie when it first came outbut i was just 12 years old then  and i had forgotten this film existed until one day i found a used copy for sale at a gas station i bought it and i couldnt wait to watch this film that had i loved as a kid and then as i saw this film again many years laterit hit me why in the world did i like this film as a kid watching it again as an adult i realized that this film is terrible the saddest part about this film is that they had everything in place to make the greatest western ever and they blew it the costumes are perfectgood actors there are 2 music scores the orchestrail score is wonderful and keeps with the classic spirit of the old timey lone ranger alive the second score is a series of songs by country music artest like merle haggerd and the statler brothers and those songs like the man in the mask are so bad that they are funny this movies strongest point is that it had a briliant storyline and one of the best western plots ever and for a while its fun to watch as john reid is nursed back to healthafter he and his fellow rangers are ambushedits fun to see him grow into his new life and identity as the lone rangeras he concels his identity and goes on a revenge run to get the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers to whom he rode with but unfortunatlyas good as the storyline is its all ruined by merle haggard narrating everything as you are watching it happenfor the love of god why did they do that between merle haggards narration and the statler brothers singing cornystupid songs like ride little cowboy being playing in the backgound make this movie impossible to take serious i would love to see a really good producer take this same script and story and redo this film rightbecause at the heart of this silly film is a great westerni would descibe this film as a beautiful woman dress in the ugliest clothing i give it 4 stars out of 10 if your 12 years old and dont know better then you might love it
