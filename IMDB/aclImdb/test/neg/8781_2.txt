this movie contains the worst acting performance of all time spilsbury lacks energy to say the least energy is what clayton moore gave us in spades i never felt once in this movie that spilsbury was anxious for anything revenge love justice not in this guys portrayalbr br there is also no chemistry between tonto and lr if the plot did not force them to be friends you dont get the impression they want to hang out with each other plus the sidekick has the more interesting personality ewwwbr br the dialogue is predictable and boringbr br the narration is stunningly bad and if you are familiar with the dukes of hazzard you can picture what this is like i cannot believe the director would agree to this it insulted me as a viewer by explaining every plot line i just witnessedbr br hey at least the horses and locations looked good maybe that is what happens when you hire a cinematographer to be your directorbr br rating2 you may be able to watch this one for laughs or to demonstrate to an alien what a bad movie is
