i rented this when it came out on video cassette in 1995 after rewatching it againmy idea about it hasnt changed muchbr br i was an adult then and im still an adult nowlolbr br the illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers didnt bother me this isnt a documentaryits a fantasy story where animals can talkbr br while i didnt care for much of the songsi liked the one at the end of the picture where its sang by barry manilow and another personbr br some people seem to make an excuse for its primitive animation by saying that cgi wasnt used often in animated features but lets not forget that the lion king was released about a year earlier and that packed possibly more excellence than any animated feature that came before itbr br but i think its pretty fair to say that the pebble and the pingoin was made on the cheap while the lion king wasntbr br the high points for me in 1995 as well as today is the suspense generated by the few dangerousmostly underwater chase scenesbr br i also liked the opening scene which takes place on a music notes page and a little bit of the love story but most of the timethe story dragged on and was boringbr br worth a look if you like animation but if youre an adult and not a risk takergo get another walt disney production instead of this
