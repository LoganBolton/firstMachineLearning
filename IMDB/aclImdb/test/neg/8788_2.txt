hubie  like stanely the troll from bluths a troll in central park  lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie were supposed to like him because hes nice but thats about all he isbr br his character design is unappealing the top of his head is a sort of dome that is narrower than the pudgy bottom half of his headbr br and penguins should not have teeth i know that iago the parrot in aladdin had teeth but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor gilbert gottfried hubie with his weenie little voice provided by martin short looks funny with that big set of chompers in his beakbr br tim curry who is usually delightful at being evil does some sort of dippy surfer dude accent as the villain might have been a good voice for a comic relief accomplice not the supposedly menacing main villainbr br the entire plot revolves around the hero and villains love for female penguin marina who is just as dull as both of her suitorsbr br worst of all is the pacing we keep cutting back to the villain to watch him threaten marina some more  this time in dialogue this time in songbr br barry manilow may be a great songwriter but in animated films like this and thumbelina his songs feel limp and listless  especially the ballads the only song i liked was the 1930sish good ship misery songbr br i read that the distributor made some cuts in this film against the filmmakers wishes and that could have caused some of the problems  though i suspect the real problem is that they didnt cut the rest of it
