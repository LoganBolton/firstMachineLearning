by the mid 1990s the career of animatordirector don bluth had seemed to drop to its alltime low before bluth had made a series of popular animated films many which remain beloved today such as the land before time 1988 the secret of nimh 1982 and an american tail 1986 but beginning with thumbelina in 1994 his films seemed to decrease more and more in quality and popularity and one of the many unfortunate entries is 1995s box office bomb the pebble and the penguin a film that didnt attract audience members beyond parents and children under the age of seven frankly the latter are the only audience members i can comprehend taking enjoyment out of this rather bland animated featurebr br the story is absurd the film stars a poorlydrawn stammering and chubby penguin named hubie voiced by martin short who falls in love with a female penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on her head voice by annie golden sort of like in real life penguins present their bridetobes with a pebble as a substitute for a ring but when hubie is swept away by the current he teams up with a lone rockhopper james belushi with a dream of flying and they race against time to return to antarctica before its too late the reasons why they could be too late is one of many underdeveloped elements of this weak story that would still be weak even if they were therebr br it becomes very clear very early on why this animated childrens musical does not and will not work for anybody older than say six or seven years of age it just does not have any of the qualities that are required for a good animated feature number one the film looks bad on account of a very poor drawing style the animation in this film is very cartoony even as far as animated films go its dark gloomy there is no vibrancy in the colors and on top of that the design of the film and the elements in it are universally droll and laughable take for instance the penguins who star in the film with only a few background exceptions every single penguin looks absolutely nothing at all like a bird hubie for example looks absurdly ridiculous with wide cheeks a stubby beak big eyes and that preposterous hat that he wears wherever he goes combined with his handlike flippers he looks like chris farley in a penguin suit result hes an ugly poorlydrawn cartoon character but the most absurdlooking and absurdlydesigned character is the evil penguin drake who frankly looks nothing at all like a penguin hes a muscleman wearing a penguin mask hes got a chest broader than that of arnold schwarzenegger and teeth larger than the teeth of the leopard seals and killer whales that serve as the films predators basically hes a twodimensional recycled villain he lives in a cave shaped like a skull he wears a cape laughs a lot and gets mad when people laugh with him result who cares and whats also bad and maybe worse is that this is an animated musical and theres not a single noteworthy or memorable song to found anywhere within its running time the opening hymn was harmlessnot memorable but harmless but after that the songs became duller and duller and there was one in particular that had me grimacing all the way through its the moment that viewers press the fastforward button for whenever it comes upbr br i felt the pebble and the penguin was lame all around save for the very few moments when hubie and the rockhopper penguin rocko are placed in peril at the jaws of leopard seals and killer whales who were thankfully given no dialogue and treated as animals instead of cartoon characters but in a way for this reason i cannot wholeheartedly recommend this movie to children this is the reason the film displays killer whales are the natural predator of the penguins my concern is that children familiar with free willy 1993 may be offended or downhearted by seeing their favorite denizen of the sea portrayed as a bloodthirsty carnivore the leopard seal was a better antagonist and was more funny seeing as how his jaws opened wider than a rattlesnakes and how he appeared to smile while growling but the point really is these moments with the predatorsand there are only a feware the only interesting moments and theyre not enormously interesting mind youbr br bottom line i cannot recommend this to anybody below the age of seven my advice if you have children around that page rent it for them they might enjoy it
