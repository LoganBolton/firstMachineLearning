its painfully clear that all effort in this film was directed toward cinematography and very little attention to everything else most obvious mistake is the miscast of the entire female cast many of them are very experienced and capable but they all seemed out of place and having an amateur director certainly didnt help the story is a very common geisha story and characters behaved very inconsistently thus making it extremely difficult for me to connect with the heroine br br this movies theme is modern prostitution but still it was annoying how tsuchiya annas lead character kept talking like a female motorcycle gang member while everyone else spoke in old japanese fitting for this setting this movie has very beautiful vibrant colors similar to zhang yimous hero but viewers can easily tell its filmed in a cheap elaborate setbr br the two sequences with shiina ringos insert songs were really nice though in midsection of the movie i actually really disliked her music before but they fit perfectly in this movie although ninagawa mika is a complete failure as a film director she has a major potential in pv music video productionbr br i believe the story felt very plain because the director failed to focus on character development and because tsuchiya annas unconvincing acting as an oiran had this film been directed by a known jidaigeki director with any other known actress in japan it wouldve had the potential to become a masterpiece
