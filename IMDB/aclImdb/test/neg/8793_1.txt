i just realized why the colors and sets in sakuran were so flashy and gaudy and just painful to look at the story is about a highclass prostitute known as an oiran in japanese their kimono were always flashier and gaudier than other kimono so that the oiran would stand out but the director mika ninagawa had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character or even the story br br what anna tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me the creeps you couldnt call it acting it was nothing more than catering to her flippedout highschoolgirl fan base hey anna good luck on that one as you get older yeah right an oiran as a crude and vulgar prone toviolence biker chick didnt we already see you portray this character in a more appropriate moviebr br the story was painfully boring and predictable what is the story of sakuran an obnoxious little bitch ever remains true to her self which is just that an obnoxious bitch she finds that inexplicably men are attracted to her and that she has an unexplained ability to manipulate men and becomes a successful highclass prostitute even though she talks and behaves like shes a member of a female biker gang this socalled seductive ability of hers is talked about but we never see it in action probably due to the ineptitude of the main pretendphonybiker chick i mean actress br br the main character of the movie makes a wealthy and powerful man angry at her because she keeps him waiting while she services a much more lowly customer not very oiranlike is it how could such a woman ever become an oiran oh because the previous oiran got herself killed and the house needed a whore that could demand a high price who would pay a high price for a slut so cheap rumors get around how could there be no repercussions for what she did to the powerful guy because the screenwriters are dolts they just made up a bunch of crapbr br then an even more wealthy and powerful guy falls for her why and she throws him over for a penniless guy who is generally cold and distant toward her but respects who she really is which doesnt make sense how can anyone respect someone so worthlessbr br speaking of crap its like the director squatted down and took a huge psychedeliccolored dump on the aesthetics culture and society of the edo period what of such things as sabi mono no aware wabi subtlety elegance a rigidly hierarchical society all shat upon by a director who comes off as a senseless nouveauriche parvenu the amazing thing is that so many other japanese in watching this movie squatted down around the director and took steaming spoonfuls of this blazingcolored stinking crap and exclaimed how tasty it wasbr br argentinean tango music with violin and bandoneon as backdrop for the edo period when japan was totally isolated from the international world except for the 37 acres of dejima why not just have anna the badassbiker oiran answer her cell phone and the rich and powerful daimyo character drive off in a hissy fit in his red ferrari the music we had to listen to was jarring and anachronistic the same as the art design br br near the ending i liked that there were only two or three tiny flowers on the shrine cherry tree but earlier the second she said she would leave the quarters when it bloomed we all knew exactly what would happen how boring to telegraph the ending so clearly but whats the point of the old tree blooming that rich and powerful guy already made the pleasure quarters bloom in cherry blossoms like the mountains of yoshino in spring that didnt impress her at all no of course not i already know that about whores the guys that treat them nicely get kicked in the balls maybe it bugs the whores to have people idealize them when they themselves know the truth of who they are just cheap and worthlessbr br considering the directors obsession with goldfish the second to last scene should have been of a goldfish bowl on a verandah accidentally knocked over two fish tumble into a stream which carries them off to escape beyond the walls of the pleasure quarters belying how goldfish are stuck in their bowl and cant survive outside just like the denizens relationship with the pleasure quarters otherwise the talk of the fate of goldfish has no meaningbr br in the final scene the cherry trees were full in bloom but the brevity of the blooms is one thing special about cherry blossoms i couldnt help thinking that soon enough dusk would wipe away all the soft pink color and warmth from the scene the sky would go quickly from hints of shadow into an ever deepening gloom and night would fall it would become cold very cold and dark that really wasnt a happy ending was it romantic love in the edo period could survive in the face of terrible poverty and being ostracized for about as long as those cherry trees bloomed maybe a few days unless it rained sooner but the unconsummated romantic love we see here its existence in this period is incomprehensiblebr br anna tsuchiya walking in the shoes of an oiran she couldnt do it literally check out the scene of her promenade where she seems to have the correct footwear on but she has to hold on to some guys shoulder to keep from tumbling on her assbr br i was going to give this movie two stars for the art direction but then i realized what that was all about sick dominance on the part of the director those colors and sets are just the way the director has of screaming im the most important one here me its all about me
