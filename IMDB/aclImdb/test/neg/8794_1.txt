in his feature film debut yellow chris chan lee attempts to enlighten hollywoods portrayal of asianamericans by departing from the stereotypes typically depicted in mainstream film however in so doing lee commits a far more heinous crime he exaggerates asianamericans own stereotypes of themselves to the point of incredulity the result dreadfully onedimensional characters and an outrageously shallow script triggers the cast into a frenzy of overacting ultimately resulting in a film that is physically painful to watchbr br dont be deceived by any of the positive reviews garnered by yellow each falls into one of two camps in one corner eg right here on imdbcom you find asianamericans who are so elated that an asian character can be depicted onscreen without thick glasses and a math book that they somehow neglect the idiocy of lees final product on the other hand you find movie critics who have simply presumed that itd be uncool to give yellow the thorough bashing that it deserves after all its an edgy asianamerican film made by an independent asianamerican filmmaker protected territory for nowbr br case example main character sin lee michael chung writerdirector lee accomplishes a monumental feat with sin by editing yellow in such a way that sin never appears onscreen unless he is either scowling or yelling see sin resenting his friends support scowl see sin walk along the beach and brood scowl yelling ensues see sin closing up his fathers shop scowl see sin urinating scowl see sin breathing scowlbr br gee i wonder if sin is full of asianamerican angst do you think im not sure scowl scowlbr br just to be thorough lee introduces us to sins father woon lee soontek oh throughout the movie whereas sin simply scowls or yells mr lee scowls and yells in fact this is woons principal role in yellow simultaneous scowling and yellingbr br gee i wonder if woon is an asian father with an authority complex do you think im not sure scowl yellbr br if lees onedimensional characters dont annoy you his story line will meet mina mary chen and joey john cho two characters that exist in this film solely for the purpose of spinning a tangential and entirely irrelevant love story into the film you see lee learned in film school that every good movie must include some sort of loverelated subtext and these two characters allow him to fulfill the obligation mina and joeys excruciatingly inane flirting dialogue consists of oneliner insults culminating in a kiss nerd stupidhead eyes meet understanding smile kissing ensuesbr br but rest assured somewhere out there sin is scowling while this all takes placebr br that neither mina nor joey contributes in any way whatsoever to the films plot does not perplex me so much as lees insistence on the most hackneyed movie cliches to accomplish his nonsequiturs and trust me the flirting sequence is just the tip of the icebergbr br towards the end of the film we find woon lee attempting to explain his constant scowling and yelling to sins girlfriend teri mia suh in what i am sure lee meant to be a poignant moment what a surprise as woon invokes a metaphorical story about the homeland to illustrate his point ripped straight out of readers digest his voice quivers in that extraspecial paternal way the camera pans into an obligatory shot of teris trembling hands we feel compelled to roll our eyes except we realize that woons explanation makes no sense whatsoever but lack of substance didnt stop lee from making the movie so why would he cut this particularly ineffective scene after all the world can always use another clich√©br br well you say the movie may be painful but at least it must be a technical masterpiece  say like what dreams may come sorry on a technical basis yellow disappoints as well lees edits are awkward and disrupt what little rhythm exists in the film at all but im sure lee thought they would seem hip to make matters worse every frame is either underexposed or overexposed although the light meter was invented in 1932 somehow the newfangled technology didnt make it onto the yellow setbr br in light of the films utter deficiency supporting actor burt bolos who plays sins best friend alex performs relatively well although bolos overacts slightly you cant really blame him when lees script consists solely of scowling and yelling bolos castmates on the other hand show no restraint in their overacting whatsoeverbr br i have not seen a film as bad as yellow in a very long time and i truly pray that i will not see a film as bad as yellow for quite some time as well please do not waste see it life is already way too short thank you
