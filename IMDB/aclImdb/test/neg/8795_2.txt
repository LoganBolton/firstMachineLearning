br br to make this short and sweet i hope this movie will not be considered the seminal work for the generasian of american film making the acting was subpar relying on stereotypes raised voices and exaggerated eyebuggery to convey its message chris chan park does not delve very deep into the any of his characters allowing them to remain caricatures of angryfrustrateddistantuncommunicative asians these depictions do not make characters mysteriously appealing it makes them confusing and unsympathetic i like to think that us asians are more complex than thatbr br i came out of the movie unconvinced unconvinced that these characters had a life long bloodbrother like connection with each other to go to the lengths they did to help their buddy out unconvinced that the main character had anything beyond a superficial attraction to his girlfriend unconvinced that hard working immigrant parents wouldnt pay for their sons college education unconvinced that all of the characters were even necessary ie janet who is put to bed in the back of the car and quickly forgottenbr br the story line which i actually think had potential was not allowed to come into its own for two reasons 1 flat characters for whom i had no sympathyaffinity 2 the plot is overshadowed by meaningless nonsequitur scenes such as the seancedonut shop sequence with amy hill which was simply ridiculous and unnecessarybr br i commend park for his efforts as im sure it took a lot of hard work to even produce the film and ill even give him the benefit of the doubt this time around as a rookie directorscreenwriter but i sincerely hope that next time around hell go a little deeper just because the film is one of the first of its kind about the korean american experience doesnt mean its automatically good
