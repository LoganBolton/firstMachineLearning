ok before i get into this lets go ahead and get the warning out of the way this movie is the quintessential cinematic definition of sleaze there are movies out there that can definitely outshock or outdisgust this movie that have way more artistic validity than can be said for this turd of a film so what makes it so sleazy lets take a closer look at wet wilderness for a momentbr br made in 1974 for practically nothing this roughie has no real genuine plot to speak of other than portraying what would happen if a family went into the wilderness to relax and spend a day while being accosted by a fat dude in a ski mask wielding a machete looking for kicksthe kind that end up with everyone being forced to have sex with each other while being systematically murdered by the masked creep so those sensitive to themes dealing with incest are encouraged to look elsewhere then to really either add a level of surrealism or just demonstrate a complete ineptness for the art of filmmaking the daughter of the group runs away after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a random black dude  tied to a tree branch that fat sumbitch left me here for 3 days with virtually no explanation whatsoever he is savedor is he of course not they are caught before they can escape where our killer forces them to have sex as well while forcing the mother to join in ending up with a dead black dude courtesy of a hatchet through the chest when all is said and done then our killer forces the daughter and mother to give him oral sex when one of the women grabs the macheteand the movie abruptly ends just like that no warning no tiedup loose endsits simply over now there might be a proper ending to this film i honestly do not know but i have only seen the extremely crude alpha blue archives version their version appears to have the ending either cut out completely or this is how it ends if this was intentional then in filmmaking 101 im sure there is some sort of rule of thumb on how to end a film but it shouldnt be done like this fans of the film psycho should rejoice upon hearing the soundtrack music as its all through the film id be willing to bet no rights were licensed or anything also even though this is a violent film theres not a hell of a lot of it so gorehounds will find nothing of real use here none of the violence is graphically shownonly the results one of the victims gets stabbed with a machete right above the vagina area also the sex is some of the ugliest sex ive ever seen the interesting thing about this film is its too ugly a film to work as an effectively erotic porno or turn on anyone but those with a tendency to like things sleazy nasty and ugly but not violent enough to garner any real notoriety with those looking for something really brutal like cannibal holocaust or other flicks like that the only notorious thing about this steaming pile is that violence was added to an adult film a fairly new concept at that time especially when you consider than porn chic was all the rage and the grindhouses that filled 42nd street played stuff like this to a most jaded group of porn mavens this wasnt and isnt mainstream porn at allbr br if you were in filmmaking school and there was a list of moviemaking donts this film would be a shining example of that lesson this cinematic swill demonstrates what happens when cerebrally challenged filmmakers are given a budget in this case probably about 142cuz it looks it and ignore all the donts and turn them into dosyes this film is that bad one more thing those who get offended by racial epithets are also encouraged to watch something else the black man in the film is constantly being verbally abused about his color and the killer is obviously racist but there was no political correctness in the early 70s im not sure a film like this could be made todaybr br to be honest this wont shock anyone or titillate anyone but those who get off on ugliness actually i got bored the sex is so ugly and mundane its hard to watch with any sense of eroticism so if you chance this you will thank god for the fast forward button the acting if you want to call it that is amateurish at best i mean its even bad for porno with not one reason to care about anyone or anything in this if you just gotta see this anyway then download it as youll really feel like a heel if you buy this some things are simply that worthlessand wet wildernes is the only thing more unpleasant than watching this film would be watching this film sitting in a theater and looking around at the others in attendance watching it too and suddenly feeling unsafe probably not societys greatest collection of thinkers and intellectuals but if youre up for some stupid yet sleazy porn garbage give it a crack its 54 minutes and yet it feels much longer crackheads would love this then again maybe theres something wrong with me for seeking this out in the first placelol caveat emptor sleazelovers
