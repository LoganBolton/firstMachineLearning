i cant believe the high marks people have given this film on this site the writing is incredibly bad with people coming in at just the right time and revealing exactly what the heroine is doing to try to escape dont you just hate it when that happens and the acting is so very very bad that you may get a splinter in your eye from all the scenery being chewedbr br a nut is holding her hostage children are outside the open screen so she whimpers for help instead of screaming when only a moment ago she was brave enough to be smashing windows to yell to these same childrenbr br shes finally free and alone in the house her chance to go for help so what does she do wanders around the house and lies down shes in the basement locked away so what does she do takes a little nap come on most of the movie is the nut wandering away and finding her sitting there snoozing when he wakes her up four times what if the writer is too bored to actually write a real plot why should we be paying attention i think the key here is that it was originally a play for the radio so they filled in with the heroine just sitting around rather than pretending to be screen writers and actually writing any actionbr br and the ending is horrendousbr br the whole movie is completely implausible horribly written and almost comically acted beware this movie at all costs
