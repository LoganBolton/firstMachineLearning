i dont understand how some people can stand playing halflife counterstrike when there are so many better firstperson shooting games availablebr br counterstrike is a game that doesnt use any imaginative ideas in its weaponry all the weapons in the game are reallife weapons but there could have been at least a cheat that allowed players to have access to a supernatural weapon like the allpowerful bfg in the quake  doom gamesbr br another problem is that the player actually has to reload the weapon manually this can become extremely annoying especially while in the middle of a firefight when you are so close to killing the enemy the reloading delay also gives the feeling that the gun is slow at performing its taskbr br there are not many choices of characters to choose from if i remember correctly there are 4 types of characters each for the terrorist and counterterrorist forces this means that many of the characters look the same as each other which really brings down the games realismbr br the game is pretty sexist when it comes to character selections in the early version of counterstrike there was a woman available to choose in the terrorist force selection which was good for the female gamers in the latest versions however the female character was deleted and replaced with another male character i wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed at the newer versionsbr br finally the maps in the game are very small the biggest map seems to be the desert map but it has standard detail in fact all the maps in the game have standard graphics in other words nothing newbr br to sum up i think halflife counterstrike is the most unimaginative firstperson shooting game of all time there are plenty of better  more imaginative shooting games to play so why waste your time on this boring game youre better off playing the unreal tournament quake and doom games avoid this overrated  overhyped gamebr br i give the game a 110
