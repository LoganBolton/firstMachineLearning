this movie wasnt the best but it did have some good actors in it isiaiah washington was pretty good as a homeless guy guy torrey was good as his handicapped brother icet was humorous as the landlord and surprisinglythe actress tami roman was good as the judge in the movie i didnt even know it was her and i am a die hard real world fan she was totally believable hopefully this movie wont hinder these actors development i know that isiaiah has left this movie far behind with the success of greys anatomy icet with his regular role on nypd special unit and tami roman has landed a recurring role on sex love and secrets upns new soap opera i wish the same for the other actors because one bad movie doesnt a bad actor make
