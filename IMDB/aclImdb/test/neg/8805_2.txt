i normally am a glutton for poor movies but this thing stunkbr br do not watch this moviebr br terrible effects and very little humour what the hell was the point of making this movie no gore to speak of and no acting to speak ofbr br i could only manage 45 minutes of this rat dropping of a movie and that is rare for mebr br something positive to say about this drivel cover art was ok i am pretty sure the movie has a ending too even tho i did not make it to itbr br the rats were unorganized and blew their lines constantlythey lacked intensity and seemed just to be going through the paces for their paycheque the actors were worse
