i cant believe that isaiah washington and icet were in this mess the plot and i use that term very loosely centers around an army of rats that terrorize an urban apartment complexat least i think thats what it was about the script made no sense at all i couldnt have cared less about the characters and the camerawork consisted of repeatedly showing shadow images of rats standing on their hind legs or running running is what i should have done as an african american male i often read pleas from my brothers and sisters to support african american films i try to help out but enough is enough no one should watch garbage like this for any reason whatsoever please brothers and sisters dont produce any more direct to video rat turds like this please
