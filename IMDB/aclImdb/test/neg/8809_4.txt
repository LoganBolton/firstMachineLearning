eh this is a popcorn movie nothing more i watched this with a bunch of friends and though that might not be the best way to view a horror movie and most of the dialogue and action was laughablebr br it left me yearning for a real film br br the main problem is the lack of tension in the film it keeps flashing back to explanation scenes which dissipates any discernible tensionbr br and the character relationship twists yeah they suck i wont say what they are but they just dont add anything to the filmstorylinebr br by relationship i mean the two main charactersbr br eek my recommendation is this watch this movie if you cant think of anything better mediocre at bestmaybe not even that
