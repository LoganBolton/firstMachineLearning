this was the most unrealistic movie i ever seenbr br i cant believe that the writer and director didnt see that almost all the movie looks like a sf onebr br for example br br 1 it is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after 10 hours to get up so quicklybr br 2 you cant get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the moviebelieve me its my domainbr br 3 with a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hour very easy lets say that the chain was made from steel but the water pipe was rusty and it was made from ironbr br 4 if you try to cut your foot with a saw you faint in the best case its more likely to die because your hart fails before to get to the boneshinbr br and there are more other examples
