im a big horror film buff particularly of the 1980s subgenres name one  ive probably seen it last year a new little horror movie that seemed to slip under mainstream radar called saw was about to hit theaters i was moderately excited having not heard anything about it i thought it looked quite promising judging by the previews and posters well except the back and white ones with the severed hands and feetthose just looked terrible i saw the film on opening night it was one of the worst experiences of my life this movie was literally mentally and psychically painful to watch because it was scaryno because it was one of the most awful movies i had ever had the displeasure of seeing first off the construction of the screenplay and editing was utterly atrocious even by horror movie standards starting off a sequence in an interrogation room with a victim shawnee smith who recently survived a serial killers attack then showing a flashback of what she survived not scary it was impossible to feel any type of tension whatsoever knowing that the aforementioned victim was perfectly alright sure that reversebeartrap thing was creepybut why should i feel in the least bit frightened when clearly you just showed me she survived the ordeal unfortunately the entire film was constructed this way it starts with two guys in a cellar then they show flashbacks of how they were abductednot scary why because we already know whats gonna happen to them seeing as how we just saw the result of the attack theyre fine move on with the story even more unfortunately the actual story was meager at best i couldnt have cared less for these annoying pitiful excuses for characters and the acting didnt help cary elwes was solid for the most part and then suddenly towards the end he started crying like a lost infant while straining to keep his american accent in tact it didnt work  the audience i saw this with was in stitches this drove him to a rash and idiotic decision even the most simpleminded wouldnt attempt he had other options better ones smarter ones even given his intense emotional state horribly communicated through horrible acting it was still irrational i didnt buy it bad writing alert furthermore even when certain sequences were played straightthrough and flashbackfree they were painfully predictable i constantly found my foot tapping impatiently waiting for the dumb sequence to end this happened for the entire film i saw every single twist coming twenty minutes into the film i had already called the killers identity not to mention his connection to his accomplices as soon as they appeared on screen better acting mightve been able to overshadow the awful script instead the actors might as well have had redherring or accomplice tattooed across their foreheadsbr br by the end of the movie i was utterly outraged i had wasted even a fragment of my life on this film and the entire theatre was laughing hysterically at the downright horrendous finale seriously youd think they were watching a monty python movie i wouldve been laughing too had i not been so angered at the films total and utter failure to accomplish anything it set out to do when we left there was no joke a line to speak to the manager of the theatre to get their money back didnt happen i was absolutely positive the movie was going to be a boxoffice bomb the following week you couldnt have imagined my shock to find out saw had hit number one at the box office and everyone was talking about it mostly individuals who found napoleon dynamite to be a thoughtprovoking epic tale and thought satire was some type of rubber i am so utterly sickened to hear people praise this film that i often feel as though im going to vomit its entertainment for the most feeble and simpleminded of the human race those who find some weird jigsaw clownpuppet riding on a tricycle threatening its a doll  knock it over and leave  whats so frightening about thatbr br dont get me wrong i own every friday the 13th love my splatter movies thought napoleon dynamite was hilarious cant get enough of freddy michael pinhead or leatherface have a font appreciation for unknown horror gems and rank sleepaway camp ii unhappy campers amongst my top 10 favorite slashers however i realize these films arent the most sophisticated american cinema has to offer  i appreciate them for what they are  quick easy fun saw is cinematic garbage the film attempts to be a smart and semisophisticated nasty little thrill ride and bogs down to an irritating annoying waste of time money energy and celluloid atrocious on all accounts every single copy should be incinerated along with its feebleminded fans shame on all of youbr br will i see saw ii maybe after i take a doubleshot of liquid drano before i gouge out my own eyes and impale whitehot shishkabob brochettes into my ears and colon my rating 010 avoid at all costs
