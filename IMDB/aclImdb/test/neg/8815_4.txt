i really tried to like saw the story was good and i admire the breakneck pace of the way the film was shot however there were too many clich√©s and elements that while they may have looked cool they really made no sensebr br first what i liked about the film was the overall tone of the story and i thought the premise was fantastic the character of the jigsaw killer was intriguing and reminded me of vintage dario argento danny glover was excellent in his role as an obsessed detective and monica potter was good in a thankless role as a doctors abducted wife shawnee smiths scene was incredible and both wan and whannell should be commended for using that scene as a demo to get the backing for the film the whole notion that the jigsaw killer finds a way for his victims to kill themselves is an excellent notion but once the film got going logic began to get awaybr br once they showed that zap was the one holding dr gordons wife and daughter hostage it was apparent that he was not the jigsaw killer and part of it the scene where he puts a stethoscope over the heart of the terrified diana while allison screams at him through her gag was one of the most gratuitous scenes ive ever seen it was supposed to be chilling but establishing nothing also since the jigsaw killer finds a way for victims to kill themselves he has no problem slicing the throat of a police officer i guess its a way to show that he doesnt want to get caught and will go to any means necessary to ensure that doesnt happen but to me it just didnt make any logic especially when he shows no remorse over the death of another detective which i did like that setup just wouldve been better if given to someone who actually deserved itbr br i felt leigh whannell was fine as adam it wasnt really a showy role and he has a lot of potential as a character actor however i wasnt too fond of james wans direction the story may have been original but the direction sure wasnt i guess im tired of quick mtv style cuts in favor of the old approach to directing but a lot of scenes involving the jigsaw killer reminded me too much of se7en way too much of it as the film progressed to me it was starting to become a series of demo reels like hey look what i can do instead of being intriguing it became very distracting but hey it worked hes now directing final destination 3 so hes on a path to a successful career and i think he will become a top notch horror director in years to comebr br what really did it in for me was the ending like i said i knew that jigsaw wasnt zap and i liked how adam discovered the mini tape player after killing him it wouldve had a terrific ending except for one fatal flaw i felt they shouldve left it where you didnt know who the killer was the way it was done was only done for one reason boy are we clever uh no to me it just didnt make sensebr br some of the better horror films are made for a reason where there is a reason for the violence we see in the story while saw started out very well it started to become undone by the filmmakers insatiable need to be cool and detract from the winning story they had perhaps if they werent too insistent on making the films themselves and relied on a more experienced horror director to helm it i think it wouldve been the horror classic that it undeservedly has been given over the past four months if this and cabin fever are the future of horror im very scared
