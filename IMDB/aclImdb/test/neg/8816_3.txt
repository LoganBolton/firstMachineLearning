the main problems of saw are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a uncritical spectator will just obviate the main question is whats is the purpose of the killer in his lying in the middle of the floor the film tries to show that the killers aim is to cause evil and destruction in his victims he loves to play with the lives of other people and to feel control over their the fears and debilities so why does he just pretend to be dead between the two main characters a tremendous unlikelihood can a man pretend to be dead for more than one or two hours without moving a single muscle or even without breathing in order not to be discovered by two men who are in the same room it has not sense at all except to be the final deffect of the movie the killer seems to have always the control along the plot and if its lying like a dead body this cant be possible finally it doesnt work the right place for the killer should have been a darker and untouchable shadow behind the false shadow the male nurse but not the floor of the white room the director shouldnt have showed the killers face and maybe the site where he is hidden then the film would be a quite good thriller however saw is just a fiasco hitchcock please come back
