i have to give this movie a 4 because of a couple of thingsbr br 1 what ill call the stupid victim syndrome if you have the killer on the floor and you have his gun  shoot him please if you are a cop and you have your shotgun pointed at the killers back  shoot him pleasebr br 2 when you are in a high stress situation and you have your finger on the trigger of a gun  your first instinct is to squeeze this is one of the first things they teach you in handgun training and the reason that you dont put your finger on the trigger until you are ready to fire  ask any hunter or infantryman if you are electrocuted your muscles should also contract  making you squeeze your fingerbr br 3 its really hard to lay on the floor completely still for 8 hours without 2 other people  one of them a doctor  not noticing that you arent dead even more so if you are supposedly dying of a brain tumor and were in the hospital just a few months earlierbr br 4 technically the killer did kill one of his victims  the guy he injected with poison that had to get the antidote if you poison someone that is murderbr br 5 what was adams lesson that he was supposed to learn yes the doctor needed to be there but what was adams crime maybe i just missed somethingbr br other than those things i would have given this movie a higher grade the plot was pretty good and the ways the killer chose to kill his victims were very inventive i can even forgive the terrible acting on the doctors part  the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick the cinematography and soundtrack were very good but the ending seemed contrived and just didnt work for me thank goodness i didnt have to pay to see this or i would have demanded a refund
