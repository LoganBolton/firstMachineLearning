id heard a lot of bad things about this film before seeing it but thought all the negative comments were probably down to the films low budget and poor acting  both of which i can deal with when it comes to zombie films however what i didnt count on is this film being really really boring if theres one thing you can count on from low budget zombies its gore and entertainment  but unfortunately this film has neither im quite surprised because the previous two horror films ive seen from director bob clark  deathdream and black christmas  were both highly inventive and entertaining films but children shouldnt play with dead things just doesnt cut it the plot line follows a group of young adults that travel to a burial island in order to mess about with rituals to bring the dead back to life however they soon learn that playing with things they dont understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals actually bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island return to feast on their bloodbr br the plots sounds like it could lead to a decent flick but what i didnt mention is that the interesting parts dont start until the final twenty minutes and as this is a ninety minute movie im sure you can guess that this isnt a good thing the opening hour and ten minutes are padded out with poor acting and even worse characters i can understand setting up a situation so that the horror is more potent once it comes along but please if youre going to spend so long on it youve really got to make it interesting all of the characters in the film are over the top and annoying and personally i just wanted the zombies to hurry up and eat them the film is not without its merits however as the atmosphere is a standout lucio fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and flesh eating zombies can blend well but bob clark already did it with this film the direction isnt bad either but its brought down by poor makeup effects and a distinct lack of blood which isnt likely to please fans of zombie movies overall i really cant recommend this film but if youre a hardcore zombie fanatic you may get a kick out of it
