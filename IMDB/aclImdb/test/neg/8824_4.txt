it seems like an exciting prospect a moderndress othello with christopher eccleston who was so frighteningly good in shallow grave and especially jude and eamonn walker who brought such intensity and introspection to his pivotal role on oz one would think them both natural shakespeareans but both performers misfire walkers othello is a fairly cookiecutter take on the part with a whispery delivery that doesnt make much of an impact and eccleston hams it up appallingly as iago winking at the camera in almost an outrageous parody of the role its likely he was egged on by his director whose florid approach might have worked better with elizabethan language but who seems a jarring pretentious choice for this modernized screenplay and the screenplay itself is less disappointing in being modern than it is in being obvious Â– its as if andrew davies sketched out the famous plot and then just wrote whatever dialogue first popped into his head all in all a failure 4 out of 10
