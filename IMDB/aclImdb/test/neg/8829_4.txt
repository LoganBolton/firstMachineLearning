i love japanese movieshaving seen at least 100200 so its obvious i am not afraid of japanese films however sometimes there are japanese concepts for film that just dont translate well to westerners they might be hits at home but abroad they just dont seem wellnormal its like the live fish my wife ate on a business meeting or odd ps2 games such as dating simulators or katamari damacythings that are accepted there that confuse nonjapanese this is probably the way others view things americans take for granted such as american football fried snicker bars and paris hilton well the king of strange japanese films that just dont seem right to americans might just be atamayama now the style of animation isnt the issueits different but nice enough no its the story concept itself and the rather bizarre ending thats what make this a truly unusual film and it goes like this there was a stingy man who for no apparent reason had a tree growing out of his head it was little at first and he simply cut it away but again and again it grew backso he just decided to let it go and after a while people began living on his head under the shade of the tree oddly while they were under the tree they were tiny but when they left they were full sized again then after finally getting sick of it all and yanking out the tree the man drown himself in the hole in the top of the head where the tree was the endbr br see i told you this was very very oddbut not in a good way like tampopo or happiness of the katakurisjust odd oddodd and unless you have a very high tolerance for this sort of thing i doubt if youll feel bad to know that this oscarnominated film did not win frankly that makes me happy as i really dont want this film to spur on such similar films the only reason it earns a 4 is due to nice but not spectacular animationbr br this film made my brain hurti hope that isnt a sign that i have a tree
