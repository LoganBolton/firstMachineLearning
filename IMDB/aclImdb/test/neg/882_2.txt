my husband brought this home from the video store so i could watch something while stuck home sick the sort of sick where you could never concentrate on a book but a sorta silly light romantic flick sounds just right that and a bowl of chicken soup well he meant wellbr br my first thought as some others post here also was that the house must be fakeits not only isolated alone on the beach but set on moorings into the loose sand and so close to the ocean that the surf waves go directly under the house this looks so obviously dangerous in hurricane country in the fall so potentially disastrous that i was sure filmmakers had simply cgid the whole thing or used movie magic to plunk a cute bb into the surfbr br but i have to tell you guys thanks to teh interwebs i can say that the house serendipity is very real is indeed near rodanthe and except for some window dressing and shrubs appears mostly as it does in the film you can rent it yourself off season for 1710 a week or about 3850 in summer go for it butinterestingly the house has severe problems the second thing that struck me after would be washed away was what about the plumbingelectrical in that surf and sure enough serendipity was condemned for a break in the sanitation caused by overwash from the ocean they are rebuildingbr br and the house isnt from the civil war not to mention that viola davis playing cliché black best friend thankless role for a fine actress last seen in doubt is not remotely old enough that her grandmother could have built anything in the civil war hello that was 150 years ago try greatgreatgreat in reality serendipity was built in 1988 laughably recently br br the basic film is built on a typical nicholas sparks weeper which means a lot of coincidence and trite predictable happenstance it is also aimed in a very pandering way towards women  you know us women who love bbs fusty antiques and knickknackswho dream of romance and guys who look like richard gere and dancing in the moonlight dont give us plot or thoughtful character development just set up some mechanisms and bring on the love scenesbr br gere plays a plastic surgeon who lost a female patient during a routine surgery for a benign cyst on her cheek of course she died of an overdose of anesthesia so you wonder right away why the surgeon is guilted up and not the anesthesiologist hello where is that guy why is the wrong doctor feeling guiltybr br gere has come to pout and confront the womans husband and is staying at the remote bbwho should be there why the only other person in the inndiane lane shes a lonely divorcée with rotten kids and an exhubby who wants her back while shes trying to decide about that the cliché best black friend has her subbing as hostess at the bbbr br now in the real world if this set up ever even happened the doctor would look like ernest borgnineand the lonely divorcée like rosie odonnell hed spend his vacation horndogging 22 year old girls on the beach while she sulked and thought about going on a diet but this isnt the real world i digressbr br the couple confess all fall in love a hurricane hitsthey make love fall in love he has to go away he dies and she cries a lot about that the endbr br there ive saved you from it now you dont have to torture yourself or any male acquaintances husbands sons boyfriends from sitting through this tripe very wearyingbr br someone else asked why diane lane a perfect tiny woman whom filmmakers seem to love to cast because shes just pretty and thin enough that most women would like to look like her but shes 45ish and not overthetop so she isnt threatening is constantly covered in big tarplike shawls this would make sense if she was chubby but she isntbr br anyways someone throw a pretty paisley shawl over this film so we dont have to watch it conclusion read a book unless you are too sick if too sick go to sleep
