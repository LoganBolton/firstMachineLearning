i would like to make it very clear that i am not at all religious i am an atheist but i could see that richard dorkins was contradicting himself over and over again i would also like to make it known that i am not the sort of person that argues against something with philosophy all the time but i feel that when comparing science and religion we must be philosophical and be willing to question the belief in main stream science as well as questioning religious beliefsbr br i wonder if richard dorkins ever spends any time to think philosophically about belief anyone who thinks long and hard enough about science and religion will realise that science is indeed a religion in itself yes there is a fundamental difference between the way that scientific beliefs are held when compared with other religions but at its roots its faith in a particular human instinctbr br throughout this series richard insists that science methods are the only right way of thinking and that it makes sense to believe in something only if the evidence for it is strong enough if you dig deep enough into how science functions youll realise that it is just as irrational as religion and that it comes down to faith in the end faith in the evidence faith in our sanity faith in our senses but more than anything else faith in our instinct to follow patterns of recurrencebr br this is not easy to explain but think about how the laws of physics were decided it was because they were and still are the most common patterns of recurrence that we are aware of i think that human beings have an instinct that makes them believe that the longer something remains in a certain state or place of existence the more we just assume out of blind faith that it is more likely to stay like it for example we dont expect that gravity will suddenly work in reverse tomorrow by this i mean pushing matter away as supposed to attracting it but the only reason why we dont expect this sudden change is because we have known for so long that it has always attracted as far as we are aware however that doesnt mean that it couldnt do exactly the reverse tomorrow or even right now it doesnt matter how long something may stay in a certain state or change there is no rational reason to make assumptions about it but we do out of instinct i would ask you to consider what is a long and short amount of time there is no such thing i dont know exactly how long it took for these supposed wise men to decide that everything must be made out of matter sound light etc but lets give them what they would consider to be an edge way lets say far longer than it really was 1200000000000 years is that a long period of time 99999999999999999 years makes 1200000000000 years seem like an incredibly short period of time for all we know there could be an extreme amount of change in the so called laws of science within the next trillion years its all about comparison only when we compare things can we say that is long or that is short its the same with big and small wide and thin heavy and light strong and weak and othersbr br i doubt that any scientist could tell me why they think that trusting this instinct makes sense i certainly dont see why it should but that doesnt mean that we as humanity should necessarily stop using it with this in mind the most hypocritical comment that richard dorkins made was when he said that faith is irrational a process of non thinking he said if what we have in this instinct that ive been describing and this instinct that we all possess on some level isnt faith then i dont know what the hell it is other times when he is being hypocritical is when he talks about the religions being bronze age bronze age myths he says i would like to point out that no matter how much scientific methods have been changed over the years due to experience experiments and evaluating the pure rules of science are getting older and older all the time they could even be described as the holy bible of science he was going on about how he is sick of the different religions being stubborn  i am right he is wrong but looking back on how rude he was to the various interviewees he seems to be just as stubborn him self to be fair to him at least he doesnt try to bomb religious communities i appreciate his hatred for certain religious beliefs that generate war but i dont respect his arrogance in his own beliefsbr br as far as im concerned richard has the right to believe in science if that is his way i am scientifically minded as well but i dont think he has the right to go up to religious leaders having unfriendly arguments trying to force his opinion on to them and virtually describing them as stupid despite all his education experience and discoveries he seems to fail to have the wisdom to properly question his very own system of belief i have read what he says in defence of this argument that open minded atheists such as my self put forward what he states suggests to me that he is totally missing the pointbr br finally the title of the documentary root of all evil this states that religion is the root of all evil it isnt true there are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religionbr br all round the documentary series was frustrating narrow minded hypocritical and flatout rubbish
