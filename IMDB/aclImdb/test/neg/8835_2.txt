i havent any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent b western or how one commentator said the plot was more cohesive than most nothing could be farther from the truth this movie is one huge nonsequitur it is an affront to the noble b western films of the 30s i have seen many of waynes early lone star and republic westerns and this one is easily the worstbr br the bad guy is known as the shadow  for crying out loud initially the shadows scheme is holding up opensided stage coaches simultaneously his gang rustles all of the cattle in the territory then they decide to move on to bank robbery to do this they need to shoot up the town with a machine gun  no explanation of why thats necessary or how he got that neato little toybr br no single scheme is revealed in enough detail to suggest a plot here the shadow is obviously just a generally bad guy with all kinds of generally evil schemes br br he imparts his instructions to his gang through a fake wallsafe knockknock whos there he is apparently clairvoyant because whenever his henchmen need to talk to him they knock on the wall the safe opens and  presto  hes there i can just imagine that he has met them facetoface and saysi have some secret nefarious instructions to give you about our next evil deed  meet me at the wallsafe and ill give em to you just why the shadow requires the safe to communicate with his army of outlaws is like most of the elements of this mess never explainedbr br he has a nifty tunnel to the ol hollow stump across the street from which vantage point various of his baddies perform assassinations he also has a hidden panel not in his secret lair behind the fake safe but out in the main roombr br when not behind the safe he hangs out on his cowless ranch masquerading as rancher matlock we learn that he has murdered the true owners of the ranch  two brothers  and assumed the identity of one the daughter of the dead brother has recently arrived from 1930s nyc judging by her wardrobe and she apparently never met her real uncle because he dupes her toobr br if you thought that bad guys always wore black hats and good guys white hats you need to see this movie here the good guys all ditch their hats in favor of white headbands that make them look like they have all suffered head wounds before any shots have been fired its like a game of pickup basketball  only wayne has them tying bandanas round their heads instead of just taking off their shirtsbr br perhaps the weirdest of all is the ending immediately after subduing the shadow and his gang we jump far enough into the future to see wayne and his wife the erstwhile niece on the front porch of their home never mind that there has been scant romance there yak is playing with waynes 34 year old son dressed up in injun garb hiyoo skookum funbr br no thanks to this nonsense wayne went on to become a screen legend only a superstar packer or not could surmount this entry in a film resume long live the duke
