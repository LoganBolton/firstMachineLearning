sad to say this is one of the sillier of john waynes series of poverty row westerns for lone star productions here he is a united states marshal on the trail of a bandit known only i kid you not as the shadowbr br no its not lamont cranston its some dude who gives his orders through an open wall safe so his men dont see who he is but the voice is unmistakable youll know within 10 minutes of the film br br and another reviewer here is quite wrong no squeals or groans from the audience would have occurred because gabby hayes was still playing a variety of roles and hes clean shaven here he had not yet found his niche as the lovable oldtimer sidekick of various movie cowboy heroes like the dukebr br later on he does lead his men quite openly in the climax so im not sure what the point of the original gimmick with the wall safe was i dont think those that wrote this one knew eitherbr br wayne gets yakima canutt as an indian sidekick here and the relationship is just about the same as an unmasked lone ranger and tontobr br its all pretty silly if you ask me
