i watched the beginning twice could not make sense of it and it bothered me for the whole moviebr br so work this out with me wayne the good guy jumps on the stagecoach disarms the drivers  steals the money  and takes offbr br disarmed one driver is then killed and the other wounded by the bad guys thanks to wayne who disarmed them and then watched it happenbr br then wayne drops the money in the dirt rescues the girl rides into town chuckles it up with yak too bad about the dead guy i guessand then later says he found the money back at the scene and everyones okay with thatbr br and hes the good guy and im pretty sure there werent small handheld flashlights at the time and bell did his first phone demo in 1876 were they in houses then am i thinking too hard about this one normally im happy to suspend judgment to enjoy a movie but this one bothered me and thats a sign the move didnt really work for me
