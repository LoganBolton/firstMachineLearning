i never fell asleep during a movie never this movie did the impossiblebr br while many people claim the superiority of japanese horror films over their american counterparts this movie was a lesson in over abundance as in the movie was 30 minutes too long it would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work but instead all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement the acting was absolutely terrible bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to adlib something called a script did these people even get any direction were they coaxed to be boring and dull either therory wouldnt surprise mebr br what was even worse was the rather unscary makeup involved with the creatures from the other side either way they all stunk dont watch this film thats all i can say unless youre an insomniac
