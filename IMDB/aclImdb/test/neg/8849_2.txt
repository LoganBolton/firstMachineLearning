i can appreciate movies with subtitles from foreign countries and specially the ones in which the subtitles are weak and dont really seems to follow the story or really make sense but this movie had too many parts that didnt really make sensebr br all in all i can admit to a few scary and freaky parts but they are repetitive i felt like i was watching a loop trailer seems like it was a short film shot with different actorsbr br in the veins of ringu and grudge but not even close the the hypethe excessive length killed the thrillbr br unless you are a die hard fan of these types of movies wich i thought i was dont waste your time on this one
