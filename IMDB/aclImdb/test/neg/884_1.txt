let me get this straightbr br hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing a cyst from her face and ends up falling in love with recently separated bed and breakfast hostess within about 24 hours of meeting her due to her solid advice on bedside mannerbr br wow move over the notebook theres a new kid in townbr br where to begin well how about the depth of this relationship i think we can safely sum up the foundation of this undying love in the following stepsbr br 1 exchange polite pleasantries over a bite of salad 2 drink copious amounts of jack daniels play basketball with old food 3 provide glib unsolicited advice to each other on your crappy lives 4 make love during a hurricane 5 devote your lives to each other via airmailbr br i noticed george c wolfe has the hairball and united kanye west project in his dossier would stick to your genre be too harsh enough said i think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry or laugh or even hope but the reason they are able to do that is that somewhere during the storyline we really start to care about the characters were watching on screen to make us care there must be time spent developing these characterstheir lives their history why were watching them now wolfe didnt seem to want to waste our time with such trivialities and instead provided us with all of about 8 minutes of background information on each character before hurling us into an intense oneonone interaction between two actors weve all come to adore but two characters we could care less aboutbr br for one brief tender moment when richard gere exclaims that he doesnt expect her to listen to his problems and she invites him for dinner the viewer sees a glimmer  a beginning  of something special between these two characters but instead of being allowed to enjoy the anticipation and playfulness of what happens next in the wonderful unpredictable joy that is courtship we are instead pushed headlong into a love affair between two people we hardly knowbr br lets face it we have all heard cheesy one liners in romantic films but the reason we cut some slack to bogart in casablanca or nicholson in somethings gotta give is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to the heavens and dragged through the mud and back again with these characters and by the time they deliver the line were so deeply involved with their plight we dont even notice the cheese factor since wolfe doesnt allow us to love or even like our protagonists all were left with a fromage sandwich and a few snickers in the audiencebr br wolfe takes the old hollywood directors phrase cut to the chase much too literally here as each stilted one liner is delivered by our cast the viewer is left wondering if director wolfe is subliminally saying to the audience cmon its a richard gere romance just buy inbr br it is as a result of this stunning lack of character  or relationship  development that the films climax fails miserably to tug at our hearts when geres character dies i felt like i was watching the news about someone i didnt know passing away or watching a ladies eights rowing race during the beijing olympics just didnt carebr br epic fail
