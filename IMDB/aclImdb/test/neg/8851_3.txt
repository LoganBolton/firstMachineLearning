i saw this movie because every review i read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium i really dont understand what all of the hype was about for one thing the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad what if something strange is going onwhat the acting didnt blow my socks off either it could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work withthe characters are purely 2dimensional to me and i didnt give a hoot about them at all another thing is that the movie extremely boring extremely sure there are a couple of jolts here and there but for the movies 112 minute length it sure didnt use its time up wisely most of the movie contains characters talking about stuff that had barely anything to do with the plot what was the point of thatbr br to top it off the movie makes no sense yes i believe i understood the intentions of the ghosts but how that fits into the events that actually occur in the movie is beyond me also much of the movie is played out in little vignettes which makes the story hard to follow at times and dont even get me started with the ending what exactly happened therebr br i can give kurosawa credit for placing some truly frightening images throughout the film there are very creepy shots of ghosts and other unsettling images if they reflected more on those images and elaborated on them it would have made the movie much stronger but they didnt and instead elaborated more on social commentary which was interesting but again portrayed in an extremely dull way yes its a message movie okay fun ill just get the message of my review right out here in the open find a better way to spend your spare time than watching this
