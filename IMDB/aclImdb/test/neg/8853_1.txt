kairo or pulse as its known amongst english speaking audiences is set in tokyo  starts as sunny plant sales employee michi kudo kumiko aso decides to visit her friend taguchi kenji mizuhashi to enquire about a computer disk hes been working on when she gets to his place he gives her the disk but then rather inconsiderately commits suicide in front of her meanwhile a student named ryosuke kawashima haruhiko kato has recently hooked up to the internet  keeps getting spooky messages  images on his monitor so he asks computer whizz harue karasawa koyuki whats happening she doesnt really know but it seems that the place where peoples spirits go when they die is full  they need somewhere else to go  earth is as good a place as any right these spirits dont like sharing either so they sort of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that i dont really know because the films a bit of a messbr br this japanese production was written  directed by kiyoshi kurosawa  right off the bat i have to say i hated kairo i hated everything about it  it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that asian cinema can produce something as crap as any american filmmaker the script is an overlong mess the thing simply doesnt make any sense with scenes which seem like they are from a different film sequences which make no logical sense or are not explained in any way  kairo is also the most downright boring film ive sat through this year at two hours long this is a real chore to sit through i really wanted to fastforward it but im fair if nothing else so i stuck it out to the bitter end  frankly wished i hadnt there are so many things wrong with kairo i suppose the filmmakers were going for a surreal ambiguous  deliberately incoherent feel but those are traits which i despise in a film unless they are done properly then theres the whole internet thing which i just couldnt relate to at all i use the internet all day  its not in the least bit scary to me in any way then theres the fact that kairo as a film provided zero entertainment value for me maybe im a neanderthal but i kind of like the films i watch to entertain me make some sort of sense  not bore me to deathbr br director kurosawa has made the ultimate insomnia cure as far as im concerned if you have trouble getting to sleep stick this in the dvd  you be fast asleep within 10 minutes i guarantee you i didnt think kairo was scary in the slightest the whole internet thing was laughable  as for scary you should see some of the penis enlargement popup ads i get now thats scary i hate this film i hate this film im sorry i just need to make that basic point again twice forget about any action tension or gore as there isnt any if you have a very nervous disposition then there are maybe a couple of scenes which might creep you out otherwise this is kiddie friendly pg rated stuff all the way urghbr br the film looks so dull  boring its untrue the camera just sits there for very long shots  when it does move it moves very slowly this has all the style of a mexican soap opera since kairo is sub titled its difficult to judge the original performances so i wont bother its hard to care for someone when they dont even speak the same language  you dont know what they are sayingbr br kairo is crap i hated it  its as simple  straight forward as that just because its an asian flick doesnt automatically make it any good  the mess of a story the plot holes the fact it makes no sense  its an absolute bore means kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an american production the worst film ive seen this year by some distance kairo got a hollywood remake as pulse 2006
