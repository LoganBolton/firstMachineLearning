this film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead theres a lot of mumbojumbo about the internet ie if you install a program on the computer you see dead folksmuch like if you play a videotape youll die in ringu frankly most of this seemed rather silly and lost me what i did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existencebeing totally alone for eternity this was sobering and fascinatingbr br i love japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most americans however one genre that has become popular in recent years that i just cant relate to very well are these horror films i know they are super popularespecially since they seem to be remade so often in the states ive seen both ringu as well as the ring juon and the grudge and was rather ambivalent despite their popularity about the only recent horror film i really liked from japan was seancea reworking of the great british film seance on a wet afternoon and what do i think made seance different well unlike the other films as well as kairo gobs and gobs of money werent spent on special effects or trying to scare the audienceinstead the emphasis was on the story the bottom line is that these other films are a lot like american films like halloween or friday 13thwith scary things jumping out just to scare the audience and plot is purely secondary at best for me i want storynot cheap thrills or ghosts as the primary focus of the filmbr br with a relatively high rating i know i am in the minority but i just dont find this a very satisfying film all too often minor things occur that might startle someone slightlybut the characters begin screaming and crying and acting as if to say this is the scariest film ever made so youd better start shaking well i think it just tries too hard and i wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the film and plot progressionnot scare tactics
