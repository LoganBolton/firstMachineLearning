wellthis movie is really plumped haha get it thats kinda like the attitude of this movie the plot is just a copy of pulp fictionokay thats acceptablebut to make this piece if plump haha is really unbelievablethe storyline is so patheticand the whole thing only gathered a few laughs it did try making a few jokes from various other moviesand it failed most of the times i meani do have a sense of humorbut this isnt really the way to go to get a laugh most of the supposedly funny moments are completely ironic the film is quiet short running at around 75 minutes overall they could have done a much funnier jobseeming they made fun of a blockbuster filmthey were gamblingand hey i think they lostbr br in overall plump fictionis plumpable but you wont gather much at allbr br worth watching over and over again no once is enoughactually its more than enoughbr br so is it worth the rent ummmas i saidits plumpablebut you will only gather a few plumps from itbr br overall out of 10 a 4 out of 10
