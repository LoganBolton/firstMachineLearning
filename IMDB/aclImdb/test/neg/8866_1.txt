ive never understood this type of spoof movies you get some serioussemiserious movie that everyone knows about and takes the seriousness out of it through immature fartjokes and such weve seen it many many times and its never really been funny its just an easy way to laugh at something you dont understand in my opinion this seems to be one of the more obscure and less liked of the genre though i honestly dont see anything in this that is much worse than that of spy hard or hot shots this movie as is clearly understood simply from the title concentrates on making childish fun of pulp fiction thats the main reason i decided to watch it as i found that film to be overly indulgent of tarantinos sick mind and powerfully overrated i had hoped for one or two good jokes making fun of the overly violent and pointless type of movie that pulp fiction was in every aspect in my anything but humble opinion i was sorely disappointed the plot is pretty much a ripoff of tarantinos film with a few scenes spoofing other often better films in the same childish and humorless fashion the pacing is poor and often youll sit there being able to guess the outcome of every scene predicting every joke often thinking of a better one at the spot bored out of your mind the acting is bad the characters are clich√©s and stereotypes and are intentionally paperthin in order to make fun of the characters theyre based on problem is it doesnt work it just makes the movie that much harder to sit through the humor is juvenile and lame the only positive thing i can say about this film is that they managed to find some actors that looked like the people they were supposed to look like the film is an awful waste of the actual real actors involved possibly slightly entertaining to fans of the typical spoof movies of the same kind i recommend this only to people who truly loathed pulp fiction or fans of the zucker parody films everyone else avoid 110
