of the thousands of movies ive seen so far this is the first one which made me think of the wasted talents expression i had never ever seen so many fine actors giving so dreadful performances frédéric pierrot elsa zylbersteinand so on the aging makeup is quite awful and to make it worse lit broadly the use of music eg love at first sight for the young aide de camp is at times so caricatural that i could feel most spectators around me smile awkwardly so far antoine de caunes has been quite a good actor but seeing this one and les morsures de laube i think he should start considering quitting please antoine give up that master of balantree project  i doubt you deserve it
