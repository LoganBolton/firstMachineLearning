this movie may bear some historical importance and it sure seems astonishing how well the facts are together the setting the rocket the space suits the surface of the moon all scream a classic  but in the end the result makes a pretty dull movie for todays eyes and the 50ies tech scenes you might hope for in a movie like this are by far not enough to reward sitting through all the tacky dialog and predictable plot developments the characters and plot may reward a scientific sociological analysis but bear too little entertainment value many timesbr br much of this movie seems like a good movie for nineyearolds the mature themes the human drama and the violence are kept to a level suitale for children as wellbr br the images of the earth and the moon seen from space may actually be more accurate than the ones in 2001 but so what if their use is dramatically inefficient especially 2001 may seem like a stretched out meditation over themes of this movie and has star wars not somehow modelled its spacescrolling opening titles on the opening titles of this film but then again  the inheritance is marginalbr br if its a real groundbreaking and megainfluential mature 1950ies scifi classic you are looking for however check out forbidden planet
