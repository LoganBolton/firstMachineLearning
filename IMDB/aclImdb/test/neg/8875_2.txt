i didnt even watch this whole movie now i like 50s scifi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me for one thing one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and acts like he might have made it into the tenth grade he sounds like he ought to be on a bowling league not a space ship out the window of the spaceship the crew is marveling at earth and this boob says can you see brooklyn and another guy says sure and the boob says gee i wonder whos pitching pardon me a moment i think my sides are splittingbr br when they first get up into orbit the boob says the moon is just for looking at take me back down watching the crew making stretched mouths and screaming from the gforces of acceleration during takeoff is also not one of the better moments of the film perhaps the films best moment can be identified by a big the end on the screenbr br we also find out that they cant open the hatch because the boob greased it before they took off sure a space vehicle is going to be greased by a member of the crew who we later learn has never even had a space suit on before and doesnt know anything about zero gravity as baby huey the overgrown fat cartoon duck once said that sounds logical the nogravityinspace effects are so bad its painful to watch everyone knows in the absence of gravity everything tends to go upbr br how this movie gets 63 stars out of 10 when other vastly superior films dont rate any higher is a mystery to me i really do like old scifi movies but this one is not realistic and the lame attempts at character humor by throwing in that boob from a gas station grease pit does not work at all  it just ruins the movie i think in retrospect its not the whole movie i hate so much as the fact that the boob is so obviously not someone who would be on a space ship  not even to grease the hatch omg i wonder if he checked the fan belts too maybe if theyd left the boob off the trip it might not have been quite so excruciating even so its only average what everyone else is raving about i dont knowbr br you want to watch a neat 1950s space movie rocketship xm beats it all to heck maybe not so much realism but a more serious story and less goofy characters
