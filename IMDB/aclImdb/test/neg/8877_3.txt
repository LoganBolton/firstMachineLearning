im going to recommend putting this one in the skip it pile as well i was mildly excited by the concept when my fiancée rented it and a bit more excited when i saw that milos forman directed it ah wellbr br the costumes were nice sure but they were typical there was nothing about them that said they were from anywhere but the period costume department of any major hollywood studio there was no distinction between spanish british and french  everyone dressed like they were at court in versailles the sets somehow didnt evoke the qualities of the settings  the prison didnt feel like a prison the mansions didnt feel like mansions and the outside scenes looked like they were filmed on a back lot for all that they were probably practical locationsbr br the score was dramatically less than it could have been i have been a fan of film scores since my youth noticing appreciating and collecting them by which i mean more than john williams my fiancée is a professional film composer an award winner who has had her works performed at lincoln center and a rising star in the industry at the start of the film we had high hopes for it and it did indeed start off nicely it rapidly deteriorated and at several points  including the scene of the release of the prisoners  it actually reached a level of annoyance i actually reached for the remote to turn down the volume the score was never anything more than the most obvious choice for scoring a specific tone of scene and didnt integrate itself into the soul of the film think of the music in babel and youll have an idea of what i mean it never attained the grandeur it wanted to but then neither did the filmbr br javier bardem as talented as he is was awful for the first part of the film his mannerisms are so distracting that it takes over his performance during the second half everything that was his character in the first half is gone replaced by an entirely different set of annoying mannerisms and he looked like the lovechild of keith richards and stuart townshends lestat i never got the idea that he cared about the role which is to say that the character cared about his life and actions or that the character was ever drawn by the writers as anything more than an opportunist who for whatever reason changes his mind and decides to stick by his principles at the endbr br natalie portman was very good although her performance lacked the shades of increasing insanity between her release from the prison and taking lorenzos hand at the end that i would have needed to call it truly an effective performance the character of alicia was never defined enough to truly discern and if it werent for the superb makeup on her eyes and cheeks someone seeing the beginning of the film and the end wouldnt know they werent the same character the prosthetic teeth were horrible artificial and distracting but thats no knock on ms portmanbr br stellan skarsgård was fine as goya not oscarworthy but serviceable and generally believable i dont know much about the life of goya or his deafness but it seemed to be tacked on to the movie as a requirement of biographical information rather than anything that was utilized in the film i am sure it affected goyas life much more than just requiring the need of an interpreter but youd never know it from watching this for the record words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted roughly 30 of the time through lipreadingbr br dont get me started on randy quaid at least he was a minor characterbr br the script reads like one of the choose your own adventure books i used to read as a kid at several moments through the film several outcomes are possible and none of the actions preceding them lead with any certainty to the way the film actually plays out ironically the film is also predictable especially its meager attempts at leavening the mood through small bits of humor the joke about the hands maybe its because i paint not well as a hobby and know what a pita hands are to drawpaint but i saw the joke coming a mile away as well as the reprise in the second half was the baby ever there for any other reason other than to be taken by ines there might as well have been a line of bread crumbsbr br disappointingbr br note this review is a copy of a reply i made to a thread in the forum
