this isnt exactly a complicated story its not a mystery or a plot you have to spend time re watching because you missed an intrinsic part of the dialog claiming a movie has to be seen multiple times for you to get it may apply to a very few films however this isnt one of them those type of movies have substance and are so involving its easy to miss an important portion of dialog or a subtle nuance to plot details you may have overlooked with goyas ghosts this doesnt apply the main flaw in this movie is an absence of detail it jumps from one character to the next never giving enough substance to any one set of scenes to allow the involvement of those watching because of that you dont connect with any of the characters you dont get to the point where you care either the main actor is gone just as the movie seems its going to redeem itself or their actions are despicable and youre not inclined to anyway goyas refusal to go very far to help ines is a good example his refusal to commit himself further mirrors the overall tone of his part the only characters you may momentarily feel for are ines when shes being questioned and then tortured after her rape by lorenzo any focus on her character is pretty much gone following that the only other in depth involvement comes from the best scenes in the movie centered around lorenzos invitation to supper with ines family and her fathers all out attempt to force lorenzo into signing a bogus confession and getting his daughter back then just as things start to be developing again theyre gone from the movie ive read a lot of the comments here about how the movie didnt know what it wanted to be etc i found that basically it succeeded in not being much of anything from lorenzos return and the coincidental viewing of ines daughter by goya everything seemed nothing more than contrived without much of a storyline no effort to really examine the turbulent times they lived in took place the essence of who goya was didnt materialize other than his actions or lack thereof proving him to be more selfcentered than anything else as for his art the movie seemed intent on examining a few of the paintings he did but again frittered away another opportunity in examining the reactions to this work rather than the work itself to sum things up best the movie had no cohesion it grossly lacked the substance to delve into the historical environment it covered and upon ending left you feeling like what youd just seen was a series of aborted attempts to engage the viewer by switching from one thing to the next without adequately engaging the viewer in any of them you cant watch something like this several times expecting it to improve with added examination theres just not enough to it to waste the time its not a case of your missing out on something it would just be more proof that the ingredients needed to make this movie good just arent there as for best film ever made its not even the best film ive watched today
