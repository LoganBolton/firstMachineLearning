perhaps i missed something but i found goyas ghosts to be a tedious costume melodrama as to the story it was trying to tell i found that a confusing mishmash that went off in all directions and perhaps it should have been made by a spanish director with the appropriate languages subtitled rather than in unconvincingly accented english i cant judge the historical veracity of the story but it seemed to move along with a similar artists models tragic fate plot line as girl with a pearl earring was the movie a commentary on the religious injustices of the inquisition false piety torture then and now or what i never seemed to be able to figure that one out natalie portmans various characters also seemed ridiculously stereotypical and ultimately the movie was crowned with the concluding melodrama of a disheveled bardems head and body hanging on the edge of cart heading off into the sunsetwith ines and goya following along behindcant milos forman do better than that
