i vowed some time ago to never get another joe castro film perhaps after near death but i sort of ended up with this one by accident since it was a troma release  i didnt read the cover carefully oops well i watched it and its by no means good but its i guess sort of tongue in cheekif its not it sure seemed that way some intrepid folks from the university of the rio grande set out to find if the chupacabra exists because of surveillance camera footage from someones goat barn that shows this weird thing hopping across the field of vision and also because the person that this thing supposedly killed was the uncle of the leader of the expedition theres a couple of camera men one of whom whines the whole time and there some exmarine named army  who is some kind of munitions expert or something at any rate the do find the chupacabra on some guys ranch  set out to find it getting involved with two supposed witches along the way the creature itself is rather ridiculouslooking with spines on its back  a great big long tongue that gene simmons would die for eventually after a bunch of folks done get killed so does the chupacabra and they take it back to the university for an autopsy so is it from another planet is it a genetic creation from some lab in puerto rico uh they dont tell us really not exactly intriguing but not quite terrible either definitely not a wide audience for this one 4 out of 10
