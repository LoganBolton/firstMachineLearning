i wanted to see this movie because i liked kavkazskij plennik prisoner of the mountains and brat brother with sergey bodrov jr and vor the thief with vladimir mashkov well unlike the other movies the quickie was a total waste of time the story that makes little sense very uneven acting lesley ann warren was especially bad really awful dialogs poor cinematography what else could go wrong i find it amusing that in practically every americanmade movie when the samelanguagespeaking foreigners russians in this case are left alone they prefer to communicate with each other mostly in broken english and when they happen to speak russian for some reason translators feel obligated to add a lot of fks in the sentences which have no profanity literal or nonliteral at the same time nativeenglishspeaking actors choose to speak in broken russian why is that getting back to the story most of the subplots of the movie eg betting the house inviting latin american paramilitaries etc either make no sense or do nothing more than confusing the viewers it is too bad that bodrov mashkov and leigh all good actors in my humble opinion got themselves involved in this disaster
