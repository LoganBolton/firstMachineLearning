although i rarely agree with filmkrönikan i have to say that this film while not awful just didnt make me care at all and it all just seemed to be out of place it had its moments three or four ones that made me snicker but most of the time i was just sitting and wondering why why did the characters do this even hot shots characters felt more thought out and fleshed outbr br if you want to see a nice norrlandsfilm then watch pistvakt there it was more than random ethnicities that just walked around shooting each other on the swedish tundrabr br i am so disappointed
