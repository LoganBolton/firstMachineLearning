im not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movieswhich it is not even though marques houston did appear in hp3 he played a totally different character he was eight years older in this film okayso reid and martin werent the most talented and couldnt carry a film all by themselvesbut to trade on the hp franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference albeit minor to the earlier movies im sure everyone who wanted to see it was hoodwinkedinto thinking that they were seeing a sequelnot a totally different film with a familiar name and im sorrykym whitley is not funny and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris ketty lester or dc curry in the earlier films although meagen good and mari morrow are a substantial visual diversioni have to give this a thumbs down just naming the film down to the last minute would have been ok furthermore the hudlin brothers who produced the first three movies were not involved in the making of this film
