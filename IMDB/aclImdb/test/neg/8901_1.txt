if this film won the lumiere award for best frenchlanguage film then what kind of garbage is coming out of france these daysbr br the subject matter is an important one  how the african economies are kept as economic hostages by the international organizations that are supposed to be helping them namely the international monetary fund and the world bank about 40 of the governmental budgets of several african nations go to payment of western debt while their people suffer from disease dehydration and illiteracybr br  but the subject matter was treated in the most dry manner that could be conceived by man  dryer than the sahara that surrounds the country of mali in which this film takes place more monotone and actionlacking than any documentary ive ever seen and im a fan of the genre one witness after another comes forward in this trial that is captured on film that condemns the world bank  imf some critics may site the colorful visual asides within the film but they were out of place and had no complementary soundtrack when they were on the screen they belonged better in a coffee table book than in this filmbr br even the characters in the film say something like this trial is boring and when will it be over everyone in the theater laughed were those people on the screen reading our mindsbr br danny glover had a brief appearance in this film it is a televised movie within bamako and it was set within morocco or mali it was also more ridiculous than any spaghettiwestern ive ever tried to avoid the only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was where a caucasian bad guy accidentally shoots an african woman carrying a baby and shows no remorse whatsoever perhaps it was to symbolize the insensitivity of the world bank and how it is unintentionally killing africansbr br and one last technical parting shot the subtitles were difficult to read with so much light colors on the screen and not enough black outline to the subtitles themselvesbr br ive already summarized the movie for you dont be fooled by the hype no need to see this film youll never get these two hours back in your life
