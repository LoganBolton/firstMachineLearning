i got hold of this film on dvd with the title evil never sleeps it gives front cover billing to carrie ann moss but she plays such a minor character that i didnt really notice her in the filmbr br im afraid that i consider this one of the worst purchases i have ever made the dialogue was stilted and the delivery wooden i found the acting to be disconnected from the plot grahams performance to me was of someone whos wondering whether shes left the gas on at homebr br all in all both my wife and i found this film painful to watch and it is not a valuable addition to my collection watch it at your peril but spending 90 minutes having your fingernails pulled out would probably be a better way to spend your time
