i love watching steven seagal movies not because of the action of the great plot holes but just because it makes me laughbr br oh it makes me laugh so hard this movie totally got no point and is ridiculous compared to this movie pearl harbor rocks and ben affleck need no acting school at all just to give a impression how bad it isbr br first off all there so many goofs and bad acting its just getting worse like when steven is try to get out of jail a chopper lands at first the security notice and they led them land when they fly away all of the sudden a guard start shootingbr br or when he killed that guy in the car he and treach both walk away you cant see no oil on the ground behind him steven notice that there is oil without even watching treach trows a lighter and the car blows upbr br and there are plenty of more goofs steven uses his basic action when someone is pointing a gun at him he grabs it and shoot him totally bullshit like some gangster would let that ever happenbr br the acting is also very worse at the fight scene in the jail outdoor place you can see steven clearly wait to come in action just rewind it a couple of time and you notice the bad actingbr br its just makes me laugh i hope one day it comes to the cinemas here in holland then ill go there with as many friends as possible just to laugh my self to death
