i too am a house party fanhouse party i is my favorite movie of all times house party 4 is a disgrace to all of the hps and to kid n playthis was supposed to be part of a series reallythere was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veteransyea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a house party movie bc its kind of focused on teensbut kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance  you can tell how good it was bc it didnt even make it to the movie theaters immature was in house party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacybut they should have represented rightthey should have left it at house party 3 i am 27 years old and i have been watching house party i since i was 11 when it came out in 199016 years ago and i have been a fan ever since when i first seen house party 4 i was like what are they really thinking aboutthere was nothing familiar about this movie that would compare to the previous 3 movies i thought it was a black ferris bueller days off
