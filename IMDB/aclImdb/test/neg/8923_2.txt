i usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as i do watching the film but with today you die i feel that doing so would be a criminal waste of my timebr br so here is a five minute rant about how bad this film isbr br there was a time in the mid80s when a single look from steven seagal was enough to crack your ribs a full on scowl could knock you off your feet if he actually got a hold of you he would snap you like a twigbr br these days although he is still capable of doing considerable damage he no longer looks the part hes gone to seed and just doesnt know when to call it quits he walks like hes dumped in his pants yet somehow still manages to look constipated and he has put on weight his trademark long ponytail has gone but his hair still looks stupid how this man keeps on working in the movie industry is beyond mebr br today you die is the usual seagal mix of bone crunching fights car crashes gun battles and pyrotechnics seagal mumbles his way through the dull script delivering his lines with zero enthusiasm or believability in this thirdrate action flick he plays harlan banks a thief trying to go straight who is conned into partaking in a 20000000 robbery he gets caught goes to jail escapes and seeks revenge yawnbr br there are some pretty good car chases and gun fights which intersperse the boring stuff of which there is a lot but reading other comments on imdb has revealed that these were actually borrowed from other better movies seagal is also bodydoubled an awful lot in this onebr br seagal turns in one of the most dreadful performances of his careerand thats saying something considering the lousy acting in some of his recent efforts most hilarious is his totally embarrassing attempt at ebonics african american street slang i da man fo shono actually steven you sound like an arse with a ridiculous script and plot lines that go nowhere this film is a waste of time money and effort and the final moment where harlan banks saves a childrens home from closure is enough to make you blow chunksbr br damn i just looked at the clock i was enjoying trashing this steaming pile of dreck so much i went way over my five minutes its time to post this comment and get to watching something decent
