star rating  jodie marsh  michelle marsh  kym marsh  rodney marsh  hackney marsh br br harlan banks steven seagal not quite as bad an actor as kevin costner butaaaaahhhh you get it is a modern day robin hood listen close you can hear brian adams music playing in the backgroundno not really the kind of guy who steals illgotten blood money from drug dealers and uses it to keep rundown orphanages open but now hes been approached to drive a getaway van in a heist from las vegas in one of those last things before retirement type jobs but of course it all goes wrong and he winds up the patsy for the big guys at the top and in jail here he meets a guy named although you wouldnt know it from paying attention to the movie ice cool treach who he forms a friendship with and ends up breaking out of jail with once free hes out to prove his innocence locate the missing money and naturally get even with those who framed himbr br of all seagals recent straight to video films today you die has that look about it most of all that it belongs in a cinema even with a rap star as his costar like his previous cinema films half past dead and exit wounds yes it seems when hes not making films about looking after the environment hes pretending to be black and costarring with rappers but tyd is not a cinema film and thats a luxury the great one is never going to be enjoying again until under siege 3 materializes if ever br br the film opens with a slick polished look that commands attention but it all quickly goes down hill from there once seagal hits prison the plot quickly loses its coherence indeed treachs character just seems to pop up out of nowhere without any introduction as his sidekick and from there you quickly lose interest in itbr br thats it i know ive said it before but i think i mean it this time i dont think im going to be giving any more of these straight to video seagal films any time i honestly have no enthusiasm to watching shadow man at all in fact i can honestly say that ive not really enjoyed any of his stv films up to this point and today you die is certainly no exception an apathetic boring effort all round best avoided by all
