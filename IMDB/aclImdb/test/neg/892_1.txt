i saw house party 13 and i loved them but this one wasnt funny at allfirst it cant be a house party movie without kid nplay right this one sucks and it was more like a black version of ferris buellers day off than a house party moviesecond who the heck is johnjohnthese new characters cant even compare to the ones from the other three moviesnow i know why they put it straight to videoit has horrible music weak plot untalented actorsand no hilarious jokes at allmy advicewatch this movie at night only if you cant get to sleepthey should have ended the series after house party 3 since kidnplay separated after that onei hate this one am glad my local video store doesnt have this film and never want to buy it or want to see it on comedy central eitherjust because chris strokes has talent managing an upandcoming rb group doesnt mean he has talent directing and producing films am i right or what finally the female characters were all dressed up like cheap twodollar hookers throughout most of the flickimx separated a year after this flick got released probably due to the failure of this film and are all but forgotten nowadays in simplier terms this movie just plain old sucks
