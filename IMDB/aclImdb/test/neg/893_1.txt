ive never saw the first three but i know theyre all better than thistrash its about some kid who throws a party wow sounds amazingsarcasm is it nooo it starts off with a kid laying in bed and hes getting woke up by his mom so the kid pretends to be sick so he doesnt have to go to school he goes to his uncles house and rounds up some people and throws a party i didnt laugh at all while watching this trash i cant imagine someone sitting down and writing down this dialogue thinking man dis  is gunna be big yo makes me wonder if they even had a script for this movie i watched this knowing it would be bad but usually watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of this just disgusted me two thumbs down
