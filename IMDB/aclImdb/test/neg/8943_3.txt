ok so this is horror i get horror  but i dont get horrific black  white is artistic but too much black is overkillenough said about the lighting the story  a serial killer  lots of these around its been done in the past and yes it will continue to be donebut i hope not my question is  when will the audience tire of reliving this maddening dilemma i guess the director thought he would do something different  portray killing children well thats been done before too so i guess he had to go to shock valuehave them killed in the darkest of fashions okay  the audience was shockedsickeneddisgustednumbed and getting up out of my seat  i felt all of these things so was the director successful yes absolutely these are the things he wanted me to feel and i did now what do i do with the feelings and more importantly what is the message here with the amazing talent that francis xavier was gifted withcould he ever consider applying it to making films that speak of dare i say coming out of the darkness i was left in the dark after viewing this film my soul was assaultedis that what this craft is about there are many such films out there  they make the bucks im told so whats up with the people that want to see all these deploring visuals what is going on in this world that people will pay to be horrifically shocked would i see this againnot ever
