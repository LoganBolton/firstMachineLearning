some years back this film had been scheduled for broadcast on tcm uk as part of a tod browning retrospective  but what they actually showed was the 1937 remake my brother had watched it and in hindsight it followed the original pretty much sceneforscene even down to the set design  though no classic he said it was a far more satisfying viewing experience than the incredibly creaky earlier version br br this being the first collaboration between browning and bela lugosi i had high hopes for it  but these were quashed when it became evident after the first reel of tedious conversation that the films main concern was to appease the stillnovel sound technique and consequently the result is stagey and extremely static the thriller plot isnt exactly exciting either even less appetizing is the ostensible britishindian setting with the characters affected accents and upperclass demeanor  not to mention the overuse of corny idiosyncratic idioms such as i say rather and now look here  rendering the whole risible more than anything else br br apart from this there are a few unintended howlers margaret wycherly as a fake medium pleads with police inspector lugosi if anything his undeniable screen presence is already evident to give her some time to work out who the culprit of the doublemurder really is the evidence points to her own daughter played by leila hyams  she hears a tapping and is deluded into thinking that the spirit world has genuinely made contact with herbut then lugosi enters the room and in his unmistakable accent straightfacedly tells her i knocked twice  you didnt hear me at which my brother and i almost fell to the floor in convulsions of laughter the editing is really sloppy too during one highangle shot of the main set a mike is seen being rapidly pulled up out of camera range  and even worse are a couple of instances where a person walks offscreen ostensibly into the next shot to another part of the setbut each shot is held on the other actors for an absurdly long time so that it appears to take forever for this person to walk just a few paces br br the thirteenth chair marks the third nonhorror browning talkie that ive watched  even if both this and miracles for sale 1939 deal with murder and occultism and could therefore still be linked to the genre much has been said about the directors apparent slackening with the coming of sound however flawed though they may be the 4 straight horror films he did throughout the 30s are infinitely better than the rest  which ive always found stylish and bizarre enough to suggest that browning wasnt as much at sea during this period as has been suggested
