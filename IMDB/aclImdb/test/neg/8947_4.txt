great acting great production values good directionbr br but the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half were clear on character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves many questions unansweredbr br the conflicts raised are compelling but the followthrough is weak for instance were very clear that rudyard kipling is prowar but we dont know if that philosophical stance changes through the course of the filmbr br this is the sort of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books i dont feel i can rely on the film to get a clear ideabr br the depiction of the war itself is heartbreakingly accurate though the womens lack of enthusiasm doesnt reflect the war hysteria that swept britain at the time perhaps this is historically accurate like so much in this film i simply dont know
