walker texas ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years the script for james jimmy trivette walkers sidekick is about as pathetically written of a part as wesley crusher on star trek tng and is played with about as much convictionbr br on this show people dont respond the way people respond to things in real lifeeveryone is polarizedeveryone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy unless walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly thats not how life works thats not how people are this show doesnt take place in this realitybr br the plot lines are about as realistic as murder she wrote a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into peoples houses without them getting angry and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her with walker everyone on the show including the bad guys act like hes the sort of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of and time itself bends to his whim the lines that sometimes come out of peoples mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous its as if the scriptwriter for the part of wesley crusher for the serious parts and the scriptwriter for bob sagets funniest home videos for the humor parts got together and wrote all the scripts for this showbr br this show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil its for the elderly its for wishful thinkers its for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending its for people who want to drift away into oblivion its for people whose drug of choice is their televisionbr br i cringe every time i see even a commercial for this show my opinion is that it is the worst show to be on television in the last 10 yearsbr br i used to like chuck norris but this show has forever tainted him in my mind i cant even watch his older movies without thinking of this show
