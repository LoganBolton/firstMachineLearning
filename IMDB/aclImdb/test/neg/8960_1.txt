this movie is awful im sorry i bought this to get star worms and actually expected this to be better after how disappointed i was in star worms oh just kidding turns out this is the worst movie ive ever seen the acting is garbage not that there really is any and the main character is a big stupid box who gets attacked by like stuff or something i cant really tell the special effects are so bad that you cant even see the warring dinosaurs which by the way do not war but just stand and kind of move their mouths or whatever those things are the movie is a headache its very obvious the director is trying to establish a universe hahahahahahahaha really this movie is just abominable even by tromas standards the only good thing i can say about it is that its got a lloyd kaufman intro as he tricks us yet again into watching something that isnt fit for consumption
