 mild spoilers  but you probably know the plot br br woman gets raped and decides to take out her rage on all of mankind  oh did i mention the rape victim was mute  thats the problem with ms 45  thana the rape victim decides shes going to kill men but is there any logical explanation to any of this  surely the whole film would have better if we had thana give a voice over as to why shes bumping off any man she comes across  theres just not enough development to this plotbr br as youd expect from a film by ferrara its not a complete waste of time  its far better than i spit on your grave and pseudo intellectuals will have a field day pointing out the irony of the woman holding a knife like a penis as thana goes on a killing spree at the end  but the script is somewhat silly and underdeveloped and hinders any serious comment the film could have made
