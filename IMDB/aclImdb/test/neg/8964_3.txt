as someone has already mentioned on this board its very difficult to make a fake documentary it requires tremendous skill pacing patience directorial distance a plausible premise a narrative flow and really believable acting aka great acting br br such is not the case with love machine it starts to show its faux hand about the 20minute mark with 60 minutes left to watch and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in its downhill from therebr br director gordon eriksen simply peaked too soon but to be fair to eriksen his problems started early as he explains in the extras he began wanting to do a real doc couldnt get funding and settled for a cheaper way of making his filmbr br the premise  people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website  was perhaps more interesting in 199798 when the film was made eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff  a pushy host handheld cameras zooms grainy blacks and whites  all i guess to elicit a sense of authenticity but it just doesnt work the film is confusing and forced but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue
