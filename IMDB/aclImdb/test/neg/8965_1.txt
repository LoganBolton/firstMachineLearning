this movie is truly unbelievable in every sense of the word i couldnt believe what i was seeing and hearing and i didnt believe it anyhow hepburn is probably my favorite actress but this was ridiculous being a hillbilly myself i know what it should sound like and its not kates back bay accent the only thing i found funnier was the fact that the guy who played charlie chan so many times sydney toler was cast as another one of the hillbillies with accent to match maybe this was a practical joke come to think of it i can think of no other reason for such peculiar casting well maybe this i noticed that natalie schaefer lovey howell on gilligans island appeared in this play on broadway can you imagine what part she might have played
