any chance to see katharine hepburn in something i havent seen or from her early movie career is a treat and on that level the film is amusing but shes horrible miscast as a hill billy her famous new england enunciation slips through making lines like id better rustle up some vittles pretty ludicrous shes so pretty and so youngÂ… it almost overcomes this major flaw the story is an old fashioned melodrama and there fore a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff but this was the staple of american entertainment well into the 1940s it has its moments but you might need to be a diehard movie buff to appreciate it
