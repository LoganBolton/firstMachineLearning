a long time ago way back in the early 80s a latenight tv show fridays came to abc trying to steal the limelight away from nbcs badlylisting saturday night live it didnt but it did introduce some repugnant sketches and semitalented comedians to the world like mark blankenfield for examplebr br which in a roundabout way brings us to jekyll and hyde together again which is repugnant in ways all its ownbr br blankenfield is about as subtle as a pew full of whoopee cushions going off after communion and about as tasteful too this is just his druggedout druggist character he played on the illfated fridays show stretched out to feature length and if you didnt like him there why are you reading this reviewbr br any time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie thats a bad sign then when it goes for dunderheaded jokes that would get you thrown off every improv stage in the western hemisphere and replaces gags with grossout things can only get worsebr br a comic take on a robert louis stevenson story about as good an idea as making a sitcom out of poes fall of the house of usherbr br aside from a few very few gags that give a slight grin this whole film is an exercise in waste  wasted actors wasted film wasted opportunitiesbr br no wonder they showed original author stevenson turning in his grave what more observant a review could they give themselvesbr br no stars no not even for armstrong who should have known better br br hyde from this one
