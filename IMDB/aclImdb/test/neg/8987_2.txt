first let me state that i have no idea who nora roberts is so the book may have been great but the movie isntbr br i have spent my entire life living in the peidmont region of nc i have never heard southern accents as ridiculous as the ones in this movie i have lived in two small nc towns and charlotte and raleigh on occasion you will meet people with a strong southern accent but i have never encountered a town where everyone talks like a bad imitation of gone with the windbr br in response to gorewon from the atheist community your comments reveal more about your warped psyche than it does about the movie if we were to stretch our imaginations and pretend that there is anything realistic in this movie  which there isnt  then the truth is that bad people such as torys father will always find some justification for their actions the author chose religion as a counter to torys supernatural abilities your supposition that the true character of the gospels directs a man to beat his daughter is about the most perverse and misinformed interpretation i have ever heard before you start spouting off about the gospels maybe you should read them firstbr br back to the movie the dialog is flat unnatural and unbelievable most of the time in particular many of the things that kade said to tory are inappropriate and do not match the mood context or way they are saidbr br the exciting twist at the end of the movie is lame predictable and lacks any credibility some have also claimed that jacqueline bisset does a wonderful job in this movie but the truth is that the bitter mother character is also a stale predictable onedimensional character is that bissets fault i dont knowbr br if you have a choice between watching this movie and a twenty year old rerun of the muppet show i recommend the muppet show
