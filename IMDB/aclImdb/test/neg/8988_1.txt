i watched this movie for the hot guyand even he sucked he was the worst onewell okay i have to give props to that freaky police officer rapist guy too he was even worse the guy wasnt that cute in the end he had the most terrible accent and he was the most definite definition of hicksville idiot that cant stand up to his mom for the one he loves theres ever been overall and if this makes any sense to you when i go to pick up movies at the video store i think to myself as i read the back of a movie that looks soso well at least it cant be worse than carolina moon the most terrible movie and the most terrible writing acting ploteverything in it made my gag reflexes want to do back flips it was the most horrid movie i will ever see with gabriela way up there too i hated it and trust me if there was any number under 1 imdb had for rating id choose that in a heartbeat
