i read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of nora roberts story not having read the book i dont know if this adaptation was faithful but i do know it wasnt good actually the screenplay was the best part of the movie so kudos to nora robertsbr br i planned ahead and watched carolina moon because of claire forlani ive never been sure if shes a good actress shes been decent in some movies average in others and really bad in this one but forlani wasnt alone the performances were all over the place oliver hudson was wooden and boring josie davis was hammy then amidst all this brate acting theres jacqueline bisset she didnt have a lot to do other than portray bitterness but even sleepwalking through that she was miles ahead of the othersbr br still forlani remains one of the most breathtaking women in movies and i was not disappointed in that capacity here i believe forlani can be more than eyecandy but until she turns in a good performance in a good movie she continues to excel at that and ill continue to faithfully watch everything she participates in fandom is fun that waybr br this movie though carolina moon was pretty bad in addition to the bad acting fake southern accents are really distracting the direction was pedestrian it wasnt horrible it was just the boring madefortv caliber youre used to seeing on lifetimebr br if youre a fan of any of the stars you can probably enjoy carolina moon for that reason as i did if youre a fan of the book you might enjoy seeing the story on the screen albeit in a lackluster form otherwise this movie is unremarkable
