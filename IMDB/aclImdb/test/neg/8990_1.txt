this fantasy was utter garbage i thought michael moore cornered the market on ridiculous antigovernment movies but this one was far worse than anything he ever did no wonder critics of the british media complain its driven by tabloid journalism this movie is a leftwing loonys greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen anyone even slightly to the right of such rabid bushbashers should be appalled it ever got funding to be made im sure it will do well in syria iran pakistan and north korea though its hard to believe that in these days of insane muslims blowing up innocent commuters there is anyone in the uk who thinks britain should surrender in the war on terrorism i guess its no longer the country i admired for standing alone against the nazis nearly 70 years ago all hail neville chamberlain and the pathetic policy of appeasement
