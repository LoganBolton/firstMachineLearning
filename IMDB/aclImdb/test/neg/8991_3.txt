the film begins in latvia just after wwi being a history teacher i knew that multinational troops occupied much of russia during this time there was serious concern about the spread of bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their nations interests however some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the communist army as the nations involved really wanted to see the socalled whites win however the whites were deeply factionalizedsome wanting the return of a czar some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between because of these mixed goals and a lack of a real commitment by the foreign armies the whole expedition was doomed and left the ussr after only a year or two however what i did not know was that german troops were also involved this surprised me as they had just lost wwi and werent in the best shape to be mounting such an expeditionbr br this is the backdrop for the film but its also about a procommunist rich lady and her illfated love for a childhood friend who is among the german troops she throws herself at him repeatedly but in each case he rebuffs her so she then sublimates these desires by various affairs while none of this sex is all that graphic this and the underlying reason the man isnt interested make this a rather adult film and one i wouldnt show to younger audiencesbr br while the setting for this film is interesting the overall film is as gray and lifeless as any i have seen i dont recommend it unless you are an amazingly patient person or you are really into overrated german films i especially warn away anyone who suffers with depression as it will no doubt make it worse the simple fact is that there are so many better german films out there waiting to be seensuch as mostly martha das boot mother kusters goes to heaven wings of desire or ali fear eats the soul among others
