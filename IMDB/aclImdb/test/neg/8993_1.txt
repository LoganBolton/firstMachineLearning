naach would have won an razzie for the worst film in 2004 may be overall too if it were global when it comes acting badly aka showing attitudeyawningover not acting halle berry is no match for antra malli while the catwoman had storeline supposedly hot actress in microscopic costume and some action sequences naach had nothing at allbr br one of those movies which makes me wonder why imdb does allow one to rate a movie as 010 yet again i think that movie does not even deserve a 0 it has to be something negative or minus infinitybr br ok what about the plot outline it is a fundagiving arrogant full of attitude choreographer meet an useless skillless loafer who aspires to be an actor tale the story is so short that if just another sentence imdb might ban me for writing a spoiler about the storytelling its like a bunch sorry 2 people for the most part of people moving in super slow motion dont try this movie if you have bought new dvdplayer you would end up believing that either dvd is in bad shape or dvdplayer is struck not its fault at allbr br at the end of it all you end up giving some credits to the director at least he realized that both antra malli and abhishek bachan at least at that time cant speak dialogues convincingly so there are not too many dialogues in this movie so you can at least sleep your way through the movie with some annoying noises from those antramalli song sequencesbr br do watch this movie if you are new to bollywood cinema once you have tolerated this movie you would be able to see any bollywood movie and enjoy itbr br there cant be worse 3 hour torture than this
