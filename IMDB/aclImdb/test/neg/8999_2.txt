what a waste of time i got about five minutes into it and became very antsy and was soon fastforwarding a bit and pretty soon the desire to take my thumb off the fastforward button was nonexistent actors mark redfield and barry murphy did very capable jobs i thought but no one else i saw gave anything like a good performance again take this review with a large grain of salt because the movie was just so unbearable i couldnt make it to the end heck i couldnt make it to the middle br br i find myself unable to submit this review because it isnt long enough maybe this last sentence will put it over the top
