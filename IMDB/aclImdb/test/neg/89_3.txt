artificial melodrama with a screenplay adapted by mel dinelli from his play the man concerns a boardinghouse proprietress taking in a troubled handyman who may be homicidal despite solid work from ida lupino and robert ryan both trying their best this tedious yarn isnt very inventive within its one primary set which quickly becomes visually dull and underpopulated cast of characters there is however a smart pooch who senses the worst hokey and humorless with a stilted direction from harry horner perhaps lupino should have directed wheres all the suspense promised by the ads dinelli also served as a coproducer 12 from
