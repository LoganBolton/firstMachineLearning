im not a big fan of musicals although this technically might not qualify as a musical but i thought i would give it a chance as i love war movies it was mediocre at bestbr br hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role it just didnt work for me julie andrews probably played her part as best as she could but i just find it hard to buy her as a conniving deceptive spy sorry i know that is classic stereotyping on my part but i have to say i think this is julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking i always thought of her as more matronly but then surely thats a result of her roles in sound of music and mary poppins no doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role she was quite beguiling in appearance here but i still didnt buy her as a spybr br i couldnt keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out  and having conversations with those in my room which i usually never do  im always shushing everybody so that tells you how little it held my attention dont waste your time
