the thomas crown affair is a terrible remake of a notverygood movie redeemable only for the topless shots of former supermodel renee russobr br thats it the plot is negligible pierce brosnan phoned in his part and dennis leary as usual plays an annoying irish cop but i couldnt take my eyes off the beautiful ms russo theres an okay lovemaking scene on a stairway a terrifically sexy ballroom dance a topless beach scene and a roll in the sack oh and theres a painting stolen from a museum and a catamaran gets sunkbr br but lets hope other directors recognize ms russos perky attributes and cast her in more highlyvisible roles
