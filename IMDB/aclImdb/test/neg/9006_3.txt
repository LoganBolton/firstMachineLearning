i am sure im in the minority i know i am among my friends but i found this movie long boring and gratuitous the fact that the role played by denis leary is the most likable character the only other time i liked him at all was in a bugs life speaks volumes rene russos character was irritating beyond belief and thomas crowne himself was flat and stereotypical to say he was twodimensional may be a little generous no the scenes with his psychiatrist did not help make him realbr br with the exception of two wonderful scenes both involving the museum caper and not involving rene russo this movie made me wish i were at home watching televised golf
