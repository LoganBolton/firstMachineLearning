i had the funny chance of seeing this on mystery science theater 3000 four years ago i must admit it wasnt as badly done as some other science fictionhorror movies of the time the plot revolved around an astronaut that came back to earth with alien embryos inside of him now the plot is quite weird well if you can even call that a plot seeing a space program run out of one building and an old pickup truck is dropdead funny ill admit it was horrible by todays standards and 20 years agobut i can see myself 43 years ago watching and being charmed by this movie its not even close to the badness of invasion of the neptune men manos hands of fate or future warbr br
