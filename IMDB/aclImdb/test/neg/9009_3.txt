ive been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and cant seem to do it but with a movie as bad as night of the blood beast the plot hardly matters an astronaut crash lands and is believed dead his body later reanimates but is found to be carrying the embryos of some strange alien lifeform but how did they get there and wheres the alien that implanted the strange creatures in maj john corcorans body br br imdb lists the runtime for night of the blood beast at 62 minutes is that right 62 minutes it had to be longer than that it felt interminable to me even with the mst3k commentary which was very funny by the way the actual movie felt much much longer and its pretty much a snoozer from beginning to end i like a lot of these alien invasion type movies of the 50s but not this one it failed to grab my interest on any level the baby aliens were too silly looking to be taken seriously the titular blood beast was pathetic and none of the characters did anything for me add to that the usual lowbudget roger corman trappings and youve got a real loser of a movie
