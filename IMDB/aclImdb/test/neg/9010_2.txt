i accept that most 50s horror arent scary by todays standards but what the hell is this when you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood thirsty beast instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either wants to take over the world or live in peace on earthyeah which is what the people wantedbr br the overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beastbut the title really kills the movie night of the beast would have made the fans more happy because there really isnt any blood to speak ofbr br i like how the 50s movies had endings that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one this movie isnt the worst ive ever seen but its almost up therebr br 2 out of 10
