this movie has a fairly decent premise  one gruesomely featured again and again in science fiction films most spectacularly in alien  and some decent heman performances from the male cast the possessed astronauts wife to me is the weak link in the ensemble  she doesnt seem to know what to do with her face in a lot of her most prominent scenes for which i blame director corman br br given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent screen play blood beast might have been pretty decent but the inherent cheapness of the production design and the continuity errors and gaffes undermine the proceedings for instance every time i saw the comatose astronaut laid out on an examination table the width of an ironing board i broke into giggles probably not the the emotion the crew wanted to invoke and the monsters costume needed some serious work fern covered parrots just arent scary or convincingbr br still the premise was strong enough that i hung on to the end just to see how the plot would resolve itself and the aliens motives were sufficiently ambiguous at first that i could sort of think of it as an enigma and the scene with the shot of the murdered scientist had a bit of punch to it along with the plot development where the alien claimed to have assimilated some of the dead mans personality br br its corman its cheap fast and mildly watchable if you dont think too hard or expect too much what more needs to be said
