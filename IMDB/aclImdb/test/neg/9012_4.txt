what a travesty of movie ratings injustice  a 21 on the imdb scale as i write this folks this is a lot closer to a 30 ill even go out on a limb and say 40 where ive put it come on  how can you have a movie about a net of static electricity surrounding the earth and alien amorphic cell structures and not give it at least a 40 for creativity then youve got all that great dialog like  dave look at the composition of this mud you know i dont think they ever got back to that mud no matter this is the kind of flick that z movie diehards live for and i can now rest easy actually i saw this quite a few years ago without the proper appreciation for it along with corman titles like attack of the giant leeches  and the wasp woman i dont know what the fascination might be but to quote a character from the film  whatever it is it works fastbr br back to that alien amorphic cell structure  i liked the idea of a third element competing against your standard red and white blood cells when astronaut john corcoran michael emmet returned from the dead i had visions of a scene that might have been a precursor to 1979s alien but that was not to be instead budget restrictions limit the picture to a defeathered big bird knock off even though that concept was still almost a decade away who knows where one idea leaves off and picks up with another br br look this is not that bad not that good but not that bad anytime you can hook up crash landing astronauts with alien beings committed to taking over the earth youve got a winning combination throw in the cheesy monster factor and youre on your way just remember  a wounded animal that large isnt good
