another gray horrible bit of schlockiness from the family corman the first space capsule into outer space crash lands back on earthwith some of the worst special effects ever and the pilot appears to be dead but appearances can be deceiving hes actually more alive than the rest of the cast including a patronizing misogynist old doctorwhod also really really boring a greasy guy who looks like hes cornered the market on hair oil another guy so dull he doesnt even make much of an impression a female scientist who never seems to be hurt or angry over the old guys patronizing and a female photographer with a farah fawcett haircutprefarah of course and about as much liveliness as a dead duckbr br what are any of these peoples names i think it was steve apparently everyone in the cast including the women were called steve anyway the dead pilot steve turns out to not only be alive but to be incubating baby aliensor seahorses or shrimp or whatever inside his torso the momma beast that implanted these little critters looks like a giant bald parrot with claws once again i am impressed by the laughability factor of the monsters created by the house of corman the space carrot from venus in it conquered the world is still officially the worst most laughable monster ive ever seen grace the screen but the cormans always manage to deliver when it comes to bad cheesy looking monstersbr br they also managed to deliver on their other trademarks as well ie a boring confusing plot long gray shotsthank god corman did most of his films in black and white since his color stuff still manages to look somehow graytwo or three locations max stupid and lame props and special effects and lots and lots of dull dialog theres only two deaths in the filmif you dont counted the roasted parroterralien blood beast being offed at the end of the film cheers rang out through the land im sure when the alien rips the old doctors head off andapparently eats it now it can talk in english and has the doctors memories it can also move the pregnant astronaut around as though he were pinnochio br br the monsters apparent intent is to rebuild its race using human beings as food and giant wombs theres a confusing bit at the endwell more confusing than usual anyway in which the creature tries to explain why it is doing this but it makes no sense whatsoever something about how humanity is about to follow in its races footsteps and destroy themselves by something theyll soon create it never really said what that was it could have been anything from toaster ovens to digital watches who knows its baby minder stabs himself rather than let the alien shrimp crawl out of his body and the oily guyand the other guy burn the parrotalien to death with a molotov cocktail ahhthe smell of roasting chickenerr alien end of story in which the rest of the characters wander off and leave their dead comrade laying on the ground to rot oh hell why not save yourself the expense of a funeral im sure that was what corman was thinking when he was trying to cut corners and make his scenes as cheaply as possible
