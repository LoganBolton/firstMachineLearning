warning spoilers dear rogerbr br during your distinguished career youve made a wide range of entertainment some good some notsogood night of the blood beast falls in the latter category its not as unredeemingly awful as say the phantom from 10000 leagues or maybe the dunwich horror nonetheless one of my greatest criticisms of this movie is that i could have made it for you faster better and cheaperbr br lets start with the foreward and titles roger the rocket sequences look like something from disneys man into space not as good of course the futuristic rocketship looks like nothing in contemporary 1958 why didnt you just use a vanguard atlas or even a viking launch better still why not dispense entirely with the launch and start with a shot of space and the capsule floating in it thats what i would have done for you roger second why have the spaceship crash upon reentry even a middle school physics student could have told you your astronaut would have arrived on earth extra crispy and largely deboned i would have shown your astronaut becoming possessed by the monster maybe by using that great negativepositive stuff you used in war of the satellites losing contact with earth and landing in the wilderness that would also explain how you blood beast could impregnate your astronaut during the tremendous heat of reentry but still be destroyed by fire even with these stupidities the first half of your movie is pretty good had you spent some money on decent music it would have been as good as a mediocre episode of outer limits but once again your writer describes ed nelson as the designer of the landing system then gives him some stupid dialogue regarding magnetism the biggest problem with the second half of night of the blood beast is michael emmet hes terrible as the doomed astronaut you should have fired him on the spot and replaced him with ed nelson you could have combined nelsons responsibilities with those of john dunlap and saved yourself the cost of one actor i dont know if you actually paid any of these people but at least you would saved the cost of catering three meals a day id had also ditched the scorched parrot costume and spent the extra money using makeup to have the astronaut turn into the blood beast maybe that was a little too close to the creeping unknown for you but it would have helped the pace of the second half immensely if you are going to have a blood beast wouldnt it be a good idea to show a little blood yeah i know the title comes from the embryos in the astronauts blood but kowalski couldve done a lot better job for you if he poured a little chocolate syrup around after all it looks like blood in black and white whatve that cost you maybe two bucks id have also used some closeups for some reason insipid dialogue and bad acting dont seem quite so bad in closeups look at almost 70s tv series and youll see what i mean oh in closing roger a note to your writer you cant use a fluoroscope to show some poor schmuck full of alien embryos when you dont have any electricity remember you fried the generator in the first reel ohand i almost forgot roger couldnt you afford a fake knife you know the kind where the blade goes into the handle i had one of those when i was 9 which also happens to be the year night of the blood beast was madeit cost maybe another two bucks i think i knew enough then to make you a better movie i know i know enough now to do so so roger if you decide to remake night of the blood beast or if you are looking for a writerdirector to work with you on some other project im your man ill work cheap cause id really like to make a movie for you rogerbr br i give night of the blood beast a 3 special note if you like to watch kitschy movies like night of the blood beast the dvd i bought for 399 was very good quality you can also get night of the blood beast along with a lot of other terrible horrorscifi movies at places like bestbuy for about 6
