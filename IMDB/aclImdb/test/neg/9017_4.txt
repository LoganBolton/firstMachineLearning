after an astronaut dies in space he is brought back to a military base inside the man are discovered alien embryos  he is the host for what could be a terrible alien invasion this film comes to us from director bernard l kowalski who also directed attack of the giant leeches see separate review but may be better known for his work on columbo executive producer was roger corman known as the creator of much better films than this one particularly in the 1960sbr br this movie is cheesy and poorly constructed what comes across as interesting is the poor effects not the actual film itself one scene shows a closeup of the alien embryos and its an embarrassing cartoon representation even for 1958 and then when a fullgrown alien appears youll wonder why he is wearing shoes or if youre really perceptive youll wonder why youve seen the alien suit in other moviesbr br by no means is this the worst science fiction film youll ever see and you almost have to give it some credit  the alien host overtaking a military base idea predates both the thing and alien by a number of years i dont know if these films were inspired in any way i doubt it but at least it was ahead of its time beyond that though the film flops and is only great for heckling when drinking i havent seen the mystery science theater version but this sure is one film worthy of their insults
