this slightly ponderous late 50s scifihorror schlock isnt entirely a loser its about a manned space rocket that crash lands in a remote area a bunch of scientists go to investigate and discover that the astronaut is in some kind of coma hes being kept alive by alien embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in him anyway the title alien monster soon raises its head causing general havoc including partial head removalbr br the main problem with the film is its pacing it takes quite a while for the blood beast to appear and he really only comes into his own in the last 20 minutes or so he is undoubtedly a completely ridiculous creation but thats really not a problem as he provides a fair amount of comic relief at the end of the movie where we have the final standoff and this ludicrous creature starts talking with the voice of the doctor he killed earlier you will be doing well not to have a giggle so too in the brilliant xray scene where we see the alien embryos floating about in the astronauts body  its just too funny for wordsbr br but unfortunately the fun moments in night of the blood beast come too few and far between if youre a 50s scifi nut though then its well worth checking this one out just dont expect too much
