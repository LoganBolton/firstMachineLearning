this is probably waynes poorest movie at least the poorest in which he had a starring role its just incredibly bad the editing is especially awful it really appears that the editor if there was oneliterally picked up pieces of film off the floor and pasted them together the opening has to be seen to be believed john wayne must have cringed every time it was mentioned i know there are b films  but are there h films if so this ones an example and i say this as a devoted jw fan
