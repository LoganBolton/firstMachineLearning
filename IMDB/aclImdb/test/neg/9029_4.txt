allegedly the true story of juana de castilla the eldest daughter of the catholic queen isabella yes the same who funded columbuss expedition the film charts the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband the archduke philip of austria known as the handsome and played in a rather unispired manner by italian hunk daniele liotti at his most buttery and beefy here this is a groaninducingly familiar story of late 15th c early 16th c intrigue betrayal and bodiceripping it drips destructive lust from start to finish but while la reine margot succeeds in making cruel sensuality and ruthless cutthroat intrigue entertaining to watch juana la loca just doesnt pull off it just ends up feeling like a bigbudgeted soap opera with belowaverage lazy or overkeen acting liotti looks positively bored and pilar lópez de ayala in the title role  though to be fair she may mature into a proper talent  just seems to be trying too hard switching back and fourth from twodimensional hornylooking to spoilt teenage hysterics all the way through some of the supporting cast are ok with the exception of manuela arcuri another italian pinup voluptuous and beautiful but really no actress to speak of i couldnt in fact bring myself to feel any concern towards any character nor for that matter did i feel strongly in a negative way against any of the supposed villains what a waste of a substantial film budget this one sadly is just so rhetorical and dejavu nodding to other films in the genre rather than to its source material  history  for inspiration it seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historic era deserved a far superior filmmaker to evoke it
