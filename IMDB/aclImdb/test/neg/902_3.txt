some movies are offbeat but enjoyable but many movies are just mindnumbingly weird motorama fits notsonicely in the latter category many seem to like it because of endless guest appearances and a total lack of sense but those two things can only take a movie so far and motorama simply doesnt have any other merits to its creditbr br motorama delights itself on plot improbabilities its main character gus is a cussing 10year old on a roadtrip across an imaginary country trying to collect game pieces to win 500 million when interacting with adult figures none of them seem to notice or be concerned with the fact that hes 10 years old at first its incredibly funny but it quickly becomes just too unbelievable especially considering the people he runs into and the fact that he seems so unfazed by a lot of the disturbing to someone that age imagery going on around him gus has no depth and as an antihero who has no problem causing misery for others to get his game pieces its hard to feel sorry for him when he encounters troublebr br that trouble is provided by a slew of guest appearances each mistreating gus in more and more strange ways besides making the already wornout plot even more unbelievable and less enjoyable the characters share gus lack of depth and are equally unmemorable the characters actions can get a little interesting but the actors themselves dont add anything to them thus negating the whole point of getting big names they couldve been played by anyone and the character wouldve been the same these guest appearances seem to have been signed more for marquee value than anything elsebr br motorama should be interesting  its a unique idea but theres too little semblance of sense in the script for it to work incidents that should have a lasting effect on the antihero and the viewer dont as the movie quickly moves from incident to incident in the hope that something will eventually make the audience feel sorry or understanding for gus that never happens as by doing so nothing is allowed to connect it just jerks back and forth as if on a conveyor belt one incident after another with a story so nonsensical it ceases to be enjoyable and a main character who never evolves to care for himself or anyone else on a higher level motorama has little to offer except a brat sneaking around and trying to get rich why should we care about that
