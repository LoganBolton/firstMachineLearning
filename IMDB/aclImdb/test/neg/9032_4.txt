have you ever wondered why these guys  seagal stallone willis et al  manage to survive all those gunfights in which theyre outnumbered i think ive got it figured out the enemies always miss and the hero doesntbr br here seagal has a pistol and outshoots a half dozen heavies firing at him from a few feet away one of the heavies has a shotgun or maybe two of them have it doesnt really matter there could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him and seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intactbr br and when it comes to mano a mano combat  forget it the evildoers may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt object but seagal with his skill in aikido or tempura or sushido or playdo or whatever it is brushes them aside with a few dismissive blows not only is he a master of these outr√© skills but his physical strength is herculean more than once he snaps somebodys long bones as easily as we would break a toothpick one he breaks a guys spine over his kneebr br ill tell you something im getting into the spirit of the film here because seagal uses that line ill tell you something several times along with whats that supposed to mean these guys are fully deserving of extinction in any good xenophobes handbook they are all black speak with unintelligible jahmaycan accents wear dreadlocks that look in dire need of a shampoo they torture and murder with aplomb and  heres the worst part theyre unchristian thats right they practice voodoobr br actually the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting element of the film they got the constituents of the ritual pretty well  cigar smoke rum spitting the sacrificial chicken they only left out the possession dance in which the spirit rides the dancer they should have read metraux on voodoobr br otherwise the plot adheres to the usual conventions what was done to jaqueline bissett by the voodoopractitioners in the deep is done here to a friend of seagals what was done to john wayne when he was stuck between trucks in mcq is done here to seagal himself at the movies very opening when seagal makes a brief speech about having seen too much pointless violence in his dea career so hes now happily retired and when we are introduced to his friends and family i tried to keep track of his affiliates to see if i could pick out which ones would be horribly murdered or maimed to generate his quest for revengebr br the acting doesnt really require much comment but charles the jamaican cop played by tom wright is really pretty good wright has considerable range here hes an associate of dubious allegiance rather sinister but in the pentagon wars he has a comic part that he underplays perfectlybr br the jamaicans never flew as movie villains i dont know why exactly its a small movie market and if you go to jamaica stick to montego bay however if you want to see jamaican voodoo drug dealers as heavies and if youre in the mood for another typicalstandard action flick this should be a satisfying view
