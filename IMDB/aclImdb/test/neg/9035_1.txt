just finished watching this movie as it were playing on tv and i didnt have anything else to do went right here to imdb too look on the trivia page and happened to glance at the user comments and what do i find every dumb idiot raises this movie to the sky i wouldnt even have written anything but when no one else takes the time to spread the word about this suckass movie i thought that i couldbr br the acting sucked from pretty much everyone in the cast the worst one was the guy playing brian wilson think i got the name right as he were overacting especially when he was high the rest wasnt as bad as him but no one was good neither i aint no expert on the beach boys though so cant really complain on the story that much except it sucked though no motivation for any of the characters decisions most of the time but hey maybe they were idiots in real life to and what i found worst was that i thought it were going to be a movie about the beach boys but you really only got a grip about a few of the characters i hate when they do that in movies same thing in the doors even though i like that movie more dont have any energy left to write more it sucked dont buy or watch it
