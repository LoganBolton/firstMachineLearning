i love the beach boys and their music so being that i am a filmmaker i thought wow a beach boys movie sounds great well wrong i just actually turned off hdnet the channel the movie was playing on because it was so bad someone above mentioned about editing well they should have at least looked at the monitors while they were filming i dont know if anyone else caught the mustache falling off the face of one of the guys after he kissed his wife and then he smoothed it back on with his hands ever heard of retaking a scene acting was terrible direction was terrible makeup was terrible possibly the worst makeup job i have ever seen brian wilsons fat cheeks looked like plado br br this is honestly the first time i have ever commented on imdb and i know it really doesnt make a difference but come on what the hell were the producers thinking
