another movie that makes the story of the beach boys worse than it is i especially remember the scene when brian says hes to quit touring and the other boys calls him traitor i didnt happen like that and like the movie indicates in the beginning is that some scenes are overreacted a movie about the beach boys doesnt have to be that way because a lot of things happened anyway the sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about the boys to those who aint so familiar with the group hardcore fans like myself knew that this isnt the entire true story and thats why i gave it a low rating 3 however it is the best movie about the beach boys ive seen so far that says quite a bit about the other movies if you want the truth i recommend the documentary endless harmony
