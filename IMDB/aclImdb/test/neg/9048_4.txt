eaten alive goes down much easier than ruggero deodatos cannibal holocaust but its also a far more sillier film i mean at times it can be unintentionally hilarious but the plot is so mindnumbingly idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience by the end tough guy robert kerman cannibal holocaust teams up with janet agren the gates of hell here with an intolerable accent to search the jungles of new guinea for agrens sister whos been brainwashed by the leader of a religious cult ivan rassimov along the way they fall witness to sometimes real animal torture and some cheesily rendered cannibalism as directed by umberto lenzi the movie is so overthetop its hard to take seriously but if you enjoy trash cinema with more than a few unintentional laughs its not badbr br 410
