eaten alive follows a young woman janet agren who searches for her lost sister turns out her sister have joined a sect that has disappeared into the jungles of borneo with vietnam veteran mark at her side she sets off to find her sisterbr br as per usual the acting isnt of the highest quality but you do get cannibal flick poster girl me me lai spending most of the time on screen with her breast bare female lead janet agren covered in gold paint and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood among other things now thats gotta count for something br br but i must say that i find it bit hard to recommend this title if you are fan of the genre you will most likely recognize every gore scene in the movie bar a select few and i mean that literally a lot of the gore scenes are lifted straight out other cannibal movies like man from deep river and last cannibal world theres probably more movies stuck in therebr br ultimately this is one for diehard fans to check off their list if you havent seen any italian jungle movies youd be better off watching cannibal holocaust and if youre an avid fan you have seen most of the gore scenes in other movies
