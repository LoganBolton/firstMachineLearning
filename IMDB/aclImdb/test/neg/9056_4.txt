personally i didnt really gain a whole lot from the act of seeing with ones own eyes ive noticed a lot of really highly rated reviews on here for the film and im kinda surprised maybe i missed something that other reviewers felt moved by but i found the film pretty tedious and basically pointlessbr br the action of the film is a bunch of autopsy footage that is filmed in an arthouse style  lots of extreme closeups weird editing etcand with no sound or dialoguebr br i guess the act of seeing with ones own eyes could be considered a study of human anatomy or maybe if you really wanna dig a little some sort of comment on the fragility of humanity or whatever  but i personally found it to be a bunch of semiinteresting but ultimately dull autopsy footage if thats your thing then this will be a winner for you as for me  ive seen more interesting er footage not a bad film as it isnt really a film in any traditional sense  i just found nothing really notable about it  410
