i didnt hate this one i just couldnt adapt to the story it didnt really grab me michael mann is a very good director but i have to disagree with his methods in this im also a fan of daniel day lewis some projects hes been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant my favourite daniel day lewis films are there will be blood and gangs of new yorkbr br there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score it gave the film a lot of atmosphere thats about all i liked in it though this film has a high vote as well which is a bit random i can see that a fair few people will like this but not enough to make the overall rating 78br br i would give this film a miss if i was you but there is a lot of high votes for this so i guess you should watch it and make your own views on what you think i didnt really like it 410jd seaton
