i saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me and we both had the same feeling about it it wasnt terribly motivating and didnt even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like so that nonmarathoners could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one in fact there was almost zero technical information at all i didnt expect this to be a techheavy instructional video but when that info was near zero then the film just wasnt balanced and wasnt particularly useful to nonmarathoners contemplating their first runbr br there were other problems some of the very first images were people collapsing near death while trying to run a race yeah real inspiring the timing was also hard to follow because it was semi chronological but the filmmakers rarely gave you any good clues as to what point in time you were looking at and they withheld information you see that kantor has an injury and you just assume its from all her training but then several scenes later they finally clue you in that its because she tripped over a pine cone in her yardbr br some parts were very good though like the bit about a woman defying race officials who wanted the run to be menonly and the coverage of a chicago race where two of the runners portrayed earlier were vying for first placebr br off the top of my head im thinking of other chronological documentaries like supersize me and grass where you always know where you are and you feel like they told you everything you wanted to knowbr br in short it wouldnt have been hard to make a better marathon film and as it stands i cant recommend this to nonmarathoners to educate and motivate them to try one because i dont think it will have that effect
