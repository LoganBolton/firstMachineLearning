is there anything else on earth to be more enticing than to learn what expects our frail bodies after um death spanish director ignacio cerdà a soulmate of his german colleague jörg buttgereit provides blowbyblow answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables scalpels surgical saws human entrails and warped mindsbr br welcome to the autopsy roombr br i dont know which facets of the film apart of its notorious reputation may have helped it to acquire sufficiently high ratingbr br storywise its fairly simple and straightforward  a day in the life actually half an hour of a troubled coroner or perhaps assistant pathologist or whoever he is that is fed up with his routine morbid duty and discharges his psychological tension in a nontraditional fashion right at his workplace im perplexed of what particular message the authors tried to deliver with this onenote plot i suspect it may be somehow inspired by udo kiers characters quirky demeanor in andy warhols frankensteinbr br artistic values of the film are also questionable its hard to evaluate the performance of the actors that dont squeeze a single word their emotions are concealed behind the medical masks theres also not enough room for great camerawork  basically the entire action unfolds mostly within four wallsbr br authenticity  effects and makeup are impressive and the setup looks very plausible but only a handful of medicalforensic experts can judge how truthful and anatomically correct the dissection is carried out here if anyone cares honestly i used to think that the autopsy is done to examine the condition of particular organs and to ascertain the cause of death now i know that dead bodies are severed raped and humiliated intestines are ripped apart brains are retrieved from the head stuffed into abdomen and mixed with guts then the body is stitched back and washed  nothing personal and what are these poor lads expected to write in their deceitful autopsy reports afterwardbr br shock and disgust factor  its much unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would discover to his horror that the disc he was intended to watch with his wife and kids beside a christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video manual on vivisection this obscure item is barely available sought by people well familiar with the subject and not easily offended hence it would be pointless to warn anyone to sabotage this film they are well aware what exactly they are watching and what they want to seebr br cerdà is really gifted and stylish director which is clearly obvious from at least two other parts of his trilogy  preceding the awakening amazing black and white short and 30minute genesis visually stunning and moody piece with an offbeat and interesting concept and im pretty sure that one day he will conquer the hearts of moviegoers with his new more mainstream oriented material and sooner or later aftermath would become a rarity for the meticulous collectors of his early warmup worksbr br but in the meantime im afraid it may be recommended strictly for medical students or specialists that study mental disorders and sexual deviations
