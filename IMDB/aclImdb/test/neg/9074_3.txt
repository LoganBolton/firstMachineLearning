its been a long time since i have been in the arthouse theater and i went to see douches froides because it has gotten such great reviews in the papersbr br the thing is with this movie is that it has no head or tail but merely a section in time about the life of the three main charactersbr br when it started i already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down but sometimes things can get better in this case not there is no real character development or interconnection between the players you start in the middle of a situation all of the sudden theres a girlfriend and then theres a guy with whom he needs to be friends with in order to fulfill his sports ambitions but the way they are put together is quite odd since they are just put together so it seemsbr br and all of the sudden they have sex with each other at least one you can see of the feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly noticeable and really all i could think of during the movie was when are they gonna have sex again and when you think of it its quite insane really because it basically means there is nothing really worth looking at but three teens going at it and that for me at least makes it a very crappy movie stay clear from it and save your money my Â€750 is wasted there are better arthouse movies than this onebr br i give three stars for the acting performance one each
