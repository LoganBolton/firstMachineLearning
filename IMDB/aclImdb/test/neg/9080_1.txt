this is one of the few movies  maybe the only  that truly haunted me for years it was the first i had ever seen people tortured so much that blood was flowing of their mouths from gritting their teeth and screaming etc it was brutal the worst thing i had ever seen on filmbr br dr clement molloch played by joseph mayer is still one of the most evil characters ive ever seen on film and ive viewed thousands he was so sadistic that i would never watch this movie again nor would i recommend it he makes hannibal lecter look like mr rogers if seeing people tortured is not your idea of fun then stay away from this filmbr br i know there are a lot of sick people out there many of them professional film critics who probably enjoyed this sordid sick story its a b movie anyway with stupid dialog and some wooden acting by charles bronson this is not one of his better efforts even if it was there so many horrendous scenes in here you wouldnt want to watch trust me on this one
