does anyone remember the alternative comedy show the comic strip presents  one edition featured charles bronson  robbie coltrane  being interviewed about his new movie glc br br  its about a man  an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and i have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner  br br  and after glc what next for bronson   br br  were using a new angle  my family dont get wiped out but i go after creeps just the same  br br this accurately describes the evil that men do  its a bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isnt down to a blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained br br bronson is a retired hitman who isnt giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of  the doctor   not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture  its never really explained why the doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous english accents br br as you may guess its a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like the doctors sister being a lesbian so some ta can be included br br in many ways its like one of those nasty chuck norris vehicles that were being released at the same time  but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ice cold in alex and the guns of naverone two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on sunday afternoons  believe me this movie wont be shown until well after the watershed
