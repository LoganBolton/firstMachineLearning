yet again director j lee thompson unites with actor charles bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick in fact this is probably bronsons most brutal film quite a feat for a man who appeared in death wish ten to midnight and chatos land however brutality doesnt on its own make for a good film and the evil that men do is ultimately a disappointment if you were to take away its brutality the film would have precious little else of interestbr br  the story is about a retired hitman bronson who lives a cosy life on a caribbean island he is persuaded to come out of retirement to track down and eliminate a sadistic torture doctor who has been plying his vile trade around various south american hellholes throughout the film especially at the beginning we are treated to some graphic torture scenes to show us just what a nasty piece of work he isbr br  these themes are actually quite serious torture does go on in suppressive latin american dictatorships and everyday folk are made to suffer some despicably painful experiences simply for voicing an unpopular viewpoint but the evil that men do  for all its worthy posturing  isnt really bothered about the plight of these poor people it is bothered purely with giving charles bronson an excuse to blow away some unpleasant scumbags its just an exploitative actioner which hangs its coat on genuine issues the torture sequences make you the viewer feel like a dirty sickinthehead voyeur rather like someone who gains pleasure from viewing snuff movies the script is full of horrid dialogue including some excessive descriptions of acts of torture the evil that men do fails to explore its disturbing ideas its serves them up as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them sorry but thats just wrong
