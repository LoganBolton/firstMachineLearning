during an eightyear stretch of the 1980s when charles bronson made nine films only one was released by a company other than the cannon group the evil that men do a tristar films pickup from sir lew grades itc entertainment firm bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director j lee thompson which ran through numerous actioners until kinjite forbidden subjects in 1989br br expectations should run pretty high with bronson and thompson working for a betterfunded outfit like itc but the evil that man do is a great disappointment on many levels while still from the low budget bmovie mold of the 1980s evil has tantalizing potential for a great film everyone in the production department however took an easy way out and sold hack work undeserving of bronsons imprint the evil that men do had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of bronson and thompsons best films but instead will go down as one of their most averagebr br this 1984 political thrilleractioner opens in brutal fashion with clement molloch joseph maher a british doctor holding his special training class for political leaders in surinam the grayhaired passive molloch is an expert on torture methods who is employed by numerous political regimes in the opening seven minutes we witness molloch using electrical current to inflict unbearable pain on jorge hidalgo jorge humberto robles a dissident journalist as you may expect the scene is awful to watch and was cut from the original vhs releasebr br hidalgo was none other than a friend of holland bronson a retired assassin who is enjoying life in the cayman islands holland was approached by the journalist years before to rid humanity of molloch but turned the offer down a mexican professor named hector lomelin josé ferrer visits shortly after hidalgos death to talk holland into finishing the job bringing videotapes of testimony from the doctors victims while in denial at first holland eventually agrees to the dirty work targeting molloch and his doting sister claire antoinette bower in guatemalabr br holland enters guatemala city with help from an adviser max ortiz rené enríquez he poses as a tourist with hidalgos widow rhiana theresa saldana and young daughter sarah amanda nicole thomas in tow as with most of bronsons later output his character knocks off mollochs henchmen one by one crossing paths with a sleazy american diplomat john glover and his supporting hitman roger cudney along the way a brutal ending takes place in the crevices of an opal mine where the doctor gets just deserts from several of his victimsbr br the evil that men do is based on a forgotten novel by r lance hill and jumps at american political dealings in latin america during the 1980s indeed evil is hardboiled in every sense of the term as it uses sensationalism and doses of brutality to cover up huge weaknesses in plot and character development for every plus this film has there are three or four minuses resulting from shod craftsmanshipbr br while the evil that men do has a great concept the film is never truly more than an excuse for bronson to wipe out foreignbased scum in the style of bad pulp fiction evil is filled with cardboard characters that we never get to know or understand holland despite being played strongly by bronson never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him into becoming a killer for hire rhiana a terribly weak part for theresa saldana is disgusted by holland for much of the way but later feels an affection for him where does her love come from especially after watching holland kill several people and wanting to go home just a few scenes beforebr br the most interesting characters are actually molloch and his sister claire because so many questions can be asked of them naturally we never find out what has brought them so close together how and where their torture dealings started what claires exact role in their business isthese plot holes can go on forever especially with the paintbynumbers storyline that seems to make things up as it goes along why is hidalgos daughter brought into such a dangerous situation other than for her to be conveniently taken hostage by molloch if mollochs bodyguard randolph raymond st jacques clearly saw holland and rhiana in the cockfight arena why is he so friendly with them in a bar afterwords is his memory that short and what really was the purpose other than cheap theatrics of holland throwing mollochs chauffeur cillero jorge luke off a window ledge when the murder could have been handled more discreetly in claires apartmentbr br the overall acting is decent and somehow bronson gives one of his strongest performances j lee thompsons direction is lacking at points but may have been compromised by limited time on site besides evils filming in mexico the presence of itc is clear through better production values cinematography and music rural locations are wellused to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of latin america and cinematographer xavier cruz provides rich color and clarity the orchestral score by ken thorne murphys war is refreshing in an era of synthesized junk oddly enough these positives only add to the frustration of a good movie that is screaming to come out peter lee thompsons editing is better than usual although with more laughable continuity errorsbr br the evil than men do was perfect grindhouse material for the early 80s and i find it hard to recommend for 21st century action fans the dvd from columbia tristar entertainment is an okay presentation offering widescreen and standard format with fourlanguage subtitles while the video quality is well above average evil was originally recorded in plain mono audio the theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a grindhouse feel with eroded color and fuzzy sound qualitybr br  out of 4
