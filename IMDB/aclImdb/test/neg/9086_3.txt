originally the spiders was planned as a fourpart serial and it shows i dislike serials theyre typically ridiculous convoluted and banal this one is no exception in the first part of the spiders the golden lake a rich adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminalsthe spidersto steal gold from incas a silly love triangle ensues with some cowboys and indians action the sensationalism and exotica of it didnt entertain mebr br one can legitimately trace themes from this twopart series to langs later far superior work and the filmmaking is better than in other serials ive seen from this time including les vampires 1915 in the spiders the camera isnt as static and this film is fast paced thankfully the tinting and lighting are adequate too none of thats remarkable though its nearly unseemly however in how closely this series resembles louis feuillades serials the criminal gang dresses and behaves like those in les vampiresonly the names and to a lesser extent the situations have changedbr br for the further comments on the spiders series see the web pages for it
