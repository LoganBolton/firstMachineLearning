this is strictly for pryor fans just because he was a great funny guy doesnt mean this is more than a bmovie the script is awful it just meanders around constantly ridiculing crime and prisoners of war it balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face doing justice to neither br br first there are 30 minutes of rather unrealistic uninspired vietnam prisoner of war time  the guy is playing basketball at one point how more can you pander to your audience that prison time is boring unconvincing and already can easily put one to sleep br br back in the us the guy for no real reason at all is considered a war hero yet he is of course quickly forgotten by the public and seems to be stumbling into all kinds of wacky mishaps or are they really we will soon find out yawn there are annoying clichés his sick mother his little daughter he never meets a high end whore falling in love with the hero etc it is very odd how this movie constantly switches from tragedy to slapstick in one instant doesnt work at all br br overall this in fact is just a bad comedy and does a disservice to prisoners of war just because this guy was a great standup comedian played in a few good movies and died of ms is no reason not to be annoyed by this silly unconvincing unfunny comedy but if you like richard pryor you will probably be thrilled by him reading 3 hours of dadaist poetry
