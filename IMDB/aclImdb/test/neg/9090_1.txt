i was reading in a stuff magazine about some of the goriest bloodiest films that asia had to offer and i immediately jumped to netflix to quench my thirst boy what a mistake i made this movie is one of the worst films i have seen first and foremost no plot what i expected to be the plot see revenge turned into a series of events just happening in a effort to spend their special effects budget of 1489 and waste studio time they should have kept their money and not wasted their time nor yoursbr br when a major plot twist occurs tetsuo ii body hammer is given a new identity and i wasnt buying it a flashback is given that should answer our questions but seemed to me like i turned on showtime at 347 am and dropped acid the movie continues and spirals out of control with cheesy graphics and special olympic effectsbr br do i seem bitter about this film yes did i see iron man no was there a plot no was it so symbolic that i didnt understand no was there a body hammer beats the hell out of me so take my advice and stay away br br i must admit though i have had so much fun writing this and laughing to myself about this film that if you want to laugh watch it
