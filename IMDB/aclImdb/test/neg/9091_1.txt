i was rather disappointed the first tetsuo made me an instant tsukamoto fan from the first 5 mins of the film it was fresh innovative and justdifferent i rather enjoy having a movie be in your face and push all those make you squirm buttons tetsuo did just that where for me few movies canbr br for those of us who enjoy getting a breath of fresh air those that appreciate those offbeat styles used that make indie films so worthwhile testuo ii will likely be a disspointment if your looking for that visceral hyperkinetic feel of the first movie skip this one as thats all been stripped away tetsuo ii is for some odd reason just a typical hollywood style action flick i was rather confused however its still worthwhile in my opinion for any diehard tsukamoto fan
