this movie was a disappointment the story is essentially the shining with a castle or a very cheap set masquerading as a castle to be specific substituting as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts the budget is the same youd see from a cinemax softcore porn as is the photography sets lighting and video it was shot on the story is a failed attempt at sincerity theres no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic for your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma and the trauma in this movie is pretty trite want an example a blind girl listening to a language tape teaching the italian words for colors begins to cry at what she will never seebr br this movie had a few things going for it however the monster is actually pretty cool pretty scarylooking and there is a pretty decent amount of nudity from raffaella offidani herself a star of italian erotic films the gore however leaves much to be desired as does the acting even from the experienced jeffrey combsbr br other than this ive only seen two other stuart gordon films reanimator and from beyond both of which were outstanding but i wont let this little footnote in his career keep me from watching many more of his movies
