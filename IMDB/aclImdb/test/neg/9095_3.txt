this is a candidate for worst films ive ever seen it wanted to be as shocking as silence of the lambs but has neither the style nor the wit of the aforementioned the makeup is excellent the acting is pretty good but the story seems to drag on for years and the murders are so gruesome that theyre more disturbing than entertaining
