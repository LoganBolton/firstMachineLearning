this film has some pretty gorey parts like a boob getting bit off and a other big bites castle freak himself is a good monster i would be scared to pieces if he was coming after me however the movie had some dumb parts about itbr br a husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3 year old son and blinds his teenage daughter i suppose death is a greater damage than blindness but youd never know that the parents actually feel bad about their daughter being blind all they care about is that jjs dead while their teenage daughter walks around running into things and talking about how shell never be able to drive a car the parents are like  honey stop walking around without a guide you know better than that and then they cry and dont ever stop being depressed because jjs dead sounds like favortism to mebr br  the lines of dialogue are not very realistic or well done for example when a giant crash is heard in the castle everybody runs down into the basement to see what it was it was a huge mirror that crashed to the ground and shattered the husband runs to the broken mirror in horror and plainly says the mirror broke i dont know i would say a little more than that if a giant mirror mysteriously crashed to the ground in my castlebr br  the husband and wife have some major relationship problems and its funny to watch how dumb they are with each other no one ever believes the blind girl advice if a blind girl says she hears things believe her and dont tell her to shut up i think this is the moral of the story listen to people when they tell you things or else you might end up killing yourself to prove your pointbr br  lastly i thought the best character was the main police officer he was the best actor and character everyone else besides castle freak was pretty run of the mill 310
