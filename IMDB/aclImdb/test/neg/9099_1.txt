watching the first few moments you realize its going to be a parody  and certainly it is a parody but im not sure of what a fairy tale an opera a hollywoodian cmovie  if there was something like that and i can assure you its not worth watching its simply a pointless film cf a good parody is everything but pointless with pretentious shallow speeches of extremely sketchy characters its like a commedia dellarte or better its like a botched commedia dellarte and the score sung in an intentionally incompetent way something greenaway will use much more efficiently it is painful to listen to unless one wears some sateoftheart earplugs haha go for quality movies eg a mittas how czar peter the great married off his moor 1976 and steer clear of this mistake
