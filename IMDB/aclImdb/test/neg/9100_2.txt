alain resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world in one of them is a sort of operatic bordello story where a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of people into throes of happinessonly his attempt misses its only real target the woman that he pines after in the same unfinished ch√¢teau he built a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story as one woman believes ineffably in the role of romance and the cynical anthropoligist tries to teach her a lesson by setting her up with the biggest jerk in the group meanwhile a bunch of kids fantasize a george melieslike adventure of a prince that saves a girl in distress from swamp creatures and then kills the evil king bringing upon the kingdom of love the two primary themes life is a fairy tale and life isnt a fairy talebr br which sounds better than the movie actually is resnais is the type of director where oftentimes the concept is good or bad but the exposition is what matters here the concept is great but the movie is downright painful to watch horridly offtune songs bubbly characters without an ounce of dimension backdrops of sickening pastelinstead of giving your inner child an ice cream cone resnais drowns it in a bucket of cake frosting add some french philosophy and you get a weird witches brew one that doesnt bubble bubble toil and trouble but just kinda sits wrong in your stomach until you want to regurgitate itbr br resnais is a risktaking director and even in his worst you can see hes trying something that might not work with full clarity of action in i want to go home he manages to pull past annoying characters and ditzy setpieces by showing some real change and having a moment few moments of quiet to catch his breath here he submerges directly into a fantasy that doesnt really reflect fantasy only its babys room wallpaper reference the biggest problem is that he somehow managed to make a movie more flamboyant than an 80s pop video and more kitsch than golden era hollywood musicals the fantasies are beyond childish and naive but the movie with nudity and profanity is definitely aimed for adults a target he decidedly missedbr br however he sticks closely to his theme and never backpedals if anything this movie is impressive simply because its unapologeticbr br polarisdib
