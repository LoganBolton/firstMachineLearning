seriously this film is not steve guttenburg is constantly forcing his toughguy dialogue and then giving everyone the evileye all the time he just wasnt believable he seems like hes trying to be a badass and he sucks at it i just remember him as the millionaire dad with the olsen twins in it takes twoso this is a big change i rented this film for sean bean and he dies as usual only this time he didnt get impaled on a boat anchor patriot games smashed by a giant satellite dish goldeneye or get run over by cowsthe field he just got shot real quicklike and civil and that was all i got from this film that they didnt kill him off in an extremely grotesque and morbid way how sad is that i was only watching it for the 3 seconds that sean was in it and then the rest was rubbish i actually tried to watch and understand the plot but there really wasnt one seemed a little like mission impossible with the holeoooooo theres a mole its the leader of the group and no one expected it lets trap him lets frame the underdog goodguy so we can get away with it cliched and tired this movie was a waste of time
