the setup for nature of the beast is ingeniously simple and fraught with limitless potential for suspense harried salesman jack a very domesticated lance henriksen picks up trouble in the form of hitchhiker adrian eric roberts who seems to be in possession of incriminating information against jack oh and over a million dollars has been stolen from a casino and someone dubbed hatchet man is dismembering people in the desert sounds great right sort of like the hitcher meets psycho one or both of these men has a secret and nothing is as it seems well unfortunately writerdirector victor salva of jeepers creepers and powder fame doesnt have enough ideas to keep the movie going the scenario arouses no tension or suspense poison for what is supposedly a thriller and the inclusion of an underlying homoerotic tone seems outofplace henriksen evokes an unusual notquiteearthbound everyman even sporting an ample gut but roberts is about as threatening and scary as an extra in death wish 3 were never sucked in to the point where we actually care about whats happening and the conclusion slides into improbable territory i kept thinking it was going to be fight club all over again but i was mistaken too bad nature of the beast could have been something elseinstead of nothing else
