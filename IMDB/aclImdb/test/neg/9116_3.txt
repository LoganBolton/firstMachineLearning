personally ive watched it because of lea thompsons appearance and i didnt really expect to enjoy the movie as such but surprisingly i kept watching it until the endbr br lets face it  it just one of the sagalike stories and isnt particularly original or entertaining but strangely it just keeps you by the tv my opinion about will of their own would be much better if there wouldnt be one point that i just dont getbr br there is lovely and really touchy scene in which lea thompsons character is running on the street holding baby in her arms the snow is falling she is cold scared and has no place to stay she doesnt know what to do next and then about 1012 years later when things are better for her she just leaves the same kid without any warning to take up the career she was dreaming aboutbr br i just dont get it  i dont see how is it possible that she would do such thing it was the opposite action to all that she done so far in her life when all that she was doing was aimed on that child survival after this character flip i just couldnt enjoy rest of the movie
