were it not for the fact that this came as a 2dvd set paired with the original american graffiti were it not for the fact that ive been here in iraq for several months and at this point will watch pretty much anything i would have tossed this movie in the garbage after the first ten minutes this movie was appallingly bad on so many levels i just dont know where to start poorly acted shot directed written scored edited my 9year old daughters first forays into filmmaking are superior to this  and she was filming the dog sleeping come to think of it i give that piece of cinematography 9 stars but im biased if you have even the slightest appreciation for quality filmmaking then avoid this piece of garbage at all costs no character in this movie has a single redeeming quality save for the icelandic girl who doesnt even have a single line in english ill not waste more of my time describing what a bad movie this is
