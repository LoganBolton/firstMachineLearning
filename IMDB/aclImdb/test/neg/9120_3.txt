i suggest if you have already seen the original american graffiti do not see this movie if you havent seen the original i still dont recommend this but it will be a lot less painful to watch the characters from the first film are great and by the end you fell a connection to them this movie sets out to show how bad their lives have become its a chore to watchbr br set on new years eve in 1964 65 66 and 67 we have four stories about the characters from the first film in 64 we have john milner paul le mat who is now a professional drag racer he meets a foreign girl eva and though his plot really goes nowhere its the best of the four in 1965 we have toad charles martin smith who is stuck in vietnam and more than anything he wants out he tries to find ways to hurt himself or do stupid things to get out in 66 we have debbie candy clark the girl who toad picked up in the first movie now she is a pot smoking hippie and really im not sure what her plot was about it was her going to a concertnot much of anything happened finally in 1967 steve bolander ron howard and laurie bolander cindy williams are having marriage problems that end in a antiwar rally and police actionbr br none of these stories are very good the script in some parts features very very bad dialogue these poor characters who i enjoyed so much in the first film ended up where they are herewhy why was this sequel made i guess if a sequel was made it had to feature the vietnam war and hippies and police action but the real thing is that this movie shouldnt have been madebr br the direction was stylish but it just amounts in a huge headache each story has a different style milners is just a regular depending on how you watch it wide screen and is filmed how the rest of the movie should be toads plot was shot in 16mm and what it amounts to is a poor looking picture which is the size of a small box in the middle of the screen debbies plot is shot in multiscreen at one point there might have been one screen but for the good majority its anywhere from two to twenty screens up at once dont bother trying to follow the screens since theres nothing going on anyways steve and lauries plot has the weirdest filming style its style really doesnt mean anything and is dumb and pointless instead of just a full widescreen its a condensed widescreen that looks like a full screen version of widescreen though i dont like the others at least i understand what they were going for this one just doesnt make sensebr br the music is this movies saving grace not that it could save this bob dylan simon and grafunkel stevie wonder marvin gaye and dozens of others have nice songs featured here they dont save the feature they just make it a little better than it is its still bad br br overall this is a pointless sequel any fan of the original should avoid this lackluster sequel br br my rating  12 out of  110 mins pg for language drug use and violence
