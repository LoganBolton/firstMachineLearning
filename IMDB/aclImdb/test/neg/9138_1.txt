ive seen all 3 now i just cant believe how bad naqoyqatsi is not in comparison to the others but simply on its own merit or lack of br br i cant understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10 i gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10 they were thought provoking and beautifully done i gave this movie a rating of 1 if a 0 or negative number was available i would have given it that rating instead what a total waste of time it was watching this movie i thought after the first 30 minutes that i should turn it off but then i figured that it was just a very slow starting movie i thought the same thing after 45 minutes then 1 hour etc then i realized that it wasnt going to get any betterbr br its very tedious to watch and without any redeeming qualities dont take my word for it watch it yourself be sure to see the first two movies before this one if you see this one first i can just about guarantee that youll never want to see the first two but they are definitely much much better than this piece of workbr br the best part of the movie is when the credits role at the end thats when your penance on this earth is complete and you can foregoe 89 minutes in purgatory for the suffering that youve endured watching this film if god is truely merciful hell be more generous
