i am a gigantic fan of both koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi but this movie is just not good the reviewer below is entirely correct that the stunning imagery of the detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film i really really wish i had left after that instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film maybe my expectations were too high but i felt let downbr br the score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two  not necessarily a bad thing if youre a fan but theres only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh it was good enough though that ill still probably check out the soundtrackbr br but just keep this in mind if you see this film if you come to realize at any point that youre not enjoying it go ahead and split  you wont miss a thing because it wont get any betterbr br ill even give the executive summary here warning spoilers lots of shots of athletes that look almost good enough for a nike commercial shots of smiling people inexplicably dull frontal head shots of famous peoples wax dummies wtf were they thinking here some giggling babies cuuuuute some bitchin photoshop effects some imagery thats meant to suggest a comparison between the flows of water information money and people i think and then a bunch of quick unrelated scenes of mass violence and then a bunch of stock space footagebr br i could remake this movie in 10 seconds heres my pitchbr br 2 seconds of a happy daddy with a shaved head and lycra biking shorts playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with string 5 seconds of that scene in network where the guy talks about messing with the elemental forces of nature and how money flows in money flows out 1 second of reginald denny getting brained with a brick and then 3 seconds of alan bean bouncing around on the moon br br there you go  thats 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life i just saved of course id get a copy of after effects and apply a filter or two so it wouldnt look as blatantly stock as it is if steven soderberghs reading this hey i wont even need much money for this projectbr br if you insist upon watching a movie about life as war i suggest bowling for columbine instead it may not have the pseudointellectual veneer so fashionable among the black turtleneck crowd but at least its funny
