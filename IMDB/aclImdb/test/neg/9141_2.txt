this is a failure so complete as to make me angrybr br all of the subtlety and structure of reggios early films is gone leaving nothing but a hash of digitally smeared images whose sole purpose seems to be whining about bad things humans do just how do star treklike wormhole graphics slomo colorized seascapes mutiplicities of obviously fake computer icons and shots of athletic competition that incidentally show that no one has ever been able to top or even match leni riefenstahl for filming bodies in motion edited together with an overlay of video colorization that a 1980s dr who producer would have rejected as too cheesy add up to a polemic against civilized violence there is no intellectual emotional or visceral connection between these images as assembled and mutated by reggio and way too many digital effects artistes and the cautionary tale i assume he wanted to produce with all of the dramaturgical consultants involved no one seems to have pulled his head out the his own feeling of saying something important and considered that they might all be failing to say something newbr br only people who watch too much television could make such a film and believe that its meaningful this is kindergarten stan brakhage and ultimately gutless in its relentless obviousness the only irony and tension evident here unlike in koyaanisqatsi where the relentless beauty and strangeness of timealtered ordinary images forced you to consider their meaning was when the dvd i was watching jammed and skipped this is mtv for the noam chomsky crowd based on reflex rather than reflection and signifying nothing two stars for the music which is in glasss best pomocesar franck style and features some passionate cello from yoyo ma i hope for his sake that he didnt have to record his parts to a playback of the film there are some things you shouldnt have to do even for a paycheck
