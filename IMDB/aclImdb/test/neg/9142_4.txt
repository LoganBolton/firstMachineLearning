what a disappointment ive enjoyed the jon cleary books about scobie malone but theres little resemblance between him and the cinematic malone in the books hes a city detective who is devoted to his wife and doesnt get involved in fisticuffs for the film the character has been spiced up into an outback copper who uses his fists and isnt averse to jumping into bed with a gorgeous girl though quite what she and the films other sex interest see in him i dont know taylor was 39 at the time and his face was getting puffybr br but his characters stamina is remarkable he flies in from australia apparently goes straight to the commissioners house rather unwisely seeking to arrest him during a blacktie reception saves him from assassination getting into a fight in the process goes to a casino with one girl leaves with another and takes her to bed so much for jet lag on the way back to the commissioners house showing a good knowledge of london back streets he gets beaten up by the baddies but is still first down to breakfast its also remarkable that the commissioners limo has its windscreen and headlights miraculously repaired within minutes of the assassination attempt and that one character has a touching faith in the precise timekeeping of a clockactivated bombbr br the best thing is joseph the butlers disdain for the uncouth malone and at least the film avoids being a london travelogue though some scenes take place during the wimbledon tennis week
