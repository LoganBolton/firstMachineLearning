this version of the magic flute is not only the worst production of mozarts great opera that i have ever seen it is also the worst video production i have seen of any operabr br im a big opera fan and i have more opera on dvd than movies the sets are cheap and cheesy papageno doesnt even have a bird costume he is just dressed like some guy the sound is in mono the color is really bad it is saturated in orange most dvds from this period have the color digitally restored but they did not bother with this one also the language has been changed to swedish instead of the original germanbr br this is not a movie version of the magic flute it is a filmed performance and it is not a good performance and it was not filmed very well you can pick any other available dvd of this opera and i guarantee it will be better than this one my preference is for the version conducted by james levine with sets by david hockney
