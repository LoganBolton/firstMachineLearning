the positives its shot pretty well has some interesting peripheral characters likable main character albeit weakbr br the bad plotstory editing characters wasted jessica albabr br im a fan of sappy movies but this movie is cringeinducingly bad i dont understand how anyone can hand over 12m to this guy jenkin and before i go any further i just want to say that i dont dislike jessica albai really wanted to like her in this film however jessica alba in her fake accent and her model poses made me miserable she has absolutely no screen presence in this movie and she ruins every scene shes in needless to say the romance does not come off as believablenot even a tiny bitbr br all i saw throughout was the actors flapping their wings trying to get this thing off the ground with what little they were givenbut sadly all this movie does is sink there is no emotional connection no emotional conflict and nothing is gained its a pretty empty movie
