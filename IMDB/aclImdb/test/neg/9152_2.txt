based on a fairly bland best seller this film  like most other lifetime movies  played out more like a reenactment than an actual movie the only difference here was that meredith baxter wasnt in it the women in this dont age even over a span of like 20 years and the acting in general is pretty badbr br the characters in this were all clich√© and onedimensional the story was of the cheesy nature i wouldnt recommend it but its the kind of thing that people who loved the book and people who watch that network all the time will think is great i only watched it because my girlfriend wanted to see it so she wouldnt have to read the book her sister loaned to her it wasnt made for someone like me  my girlfriend cried a little at the end though so she didnt think it was as terrible as i did
