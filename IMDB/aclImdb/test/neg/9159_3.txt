i honestly thought this movie was going to be cheesy even though ive liked alvin and the chipmunks for a long time i was was very wrong it was great it has been the best movie i have seen since october in my opinion its the movie everyone should see this holiday season enchanted i thought anywaywas awful the golden compass was alright but the ending was pretty crappy to his dark materials fans and i am legend well i havent seen that yet or national treasures 2 but it looks alrightbr br im not about to give anything away but this movie is great for anyone especially kids
