it is difficult to rate a writerdirectors first effort after all it is one more movie than i have written or directed james hunter wrote a story that was interesting but suffered from an uneven flowbr br after all the idea that a man ja rule has to choose between the thug life and going straight is common and even falling in love with the daughter tatyana ali of the man you killed has been done doing it again demands something that is original and originality is lacking in this filmbr br i was drawn by the inclusion of so many favorites tia carrere trues lies waynes world pam grier jackie brown frank langella dracula good night and good luck and ving rhames rosewood dawn of the dead they did not disappoint in their performances but they had little to work withbr br direct to video is becoming more and more common but that doesnt mean it has to be a waste of time maybe the sophomore effort of hunter will be more enjoyable
