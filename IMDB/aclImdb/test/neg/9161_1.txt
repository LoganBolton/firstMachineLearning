im surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie even my 4 and 6 year old were bored the chipmunks are cutebut the storyline is overly obvious not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastesbr br we did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in attendance but i wondered whybr br i dont admit to ever being a chipmunks fan but i expected to be entertained its not even an escapist movie as far as i can tell simply a heavy handed view of success too young spoils weve seen more than enough of that with britney spears et al havent webr br dont bother
