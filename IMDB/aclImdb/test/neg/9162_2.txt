you know the old saw about a train wreck the one about how you cant look away this movie isnt that good the only reason youre still there is because you brought your kids and you cant leave them alone in the theater you might catch a napbr br tim hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk he manages to take a decent comic actor in jason lee and turn him into a robotic unsure actor in this productionbr br i didnt have much hope for this movie in the first place i admit if it werent basically the only family film i could take my son to around christmas my wife and i wouldnt have gone god i wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves i leaned over to my wife about 10 minutes in to tell her what a stinker i thought it was but she beat me to the punchbr br im not kidding its putrid only david crosss terrificasusual work saves this review from being only 1 starbr br the story is cloying insulting and stupid as might be expected for a movie in this genre although the recent curious george was blissfully intelligent and enjoyable the acting is mostly poor the decision to update the chipmunks songs for todays audience was inadvisable at best and boneheaded at worst it does not workbr br the chipmunks of old were clever mischievous and sly these chipmunks are dumb somewhat meanspirited obnoxious and in a surprise needy to the point of uselessnessbr br either as a retrospect a tribute or as a completely new production this film totally fails the final straw my son couldnt wait to leave spend your money renting curious george instead
