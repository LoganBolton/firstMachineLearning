when i finally got around to seeing this film recently it turned out to be exactly what it looked like to me at first glance yet another hollywood cgliveaction rehash of an established cartoon franchise nothing special or memorable whatsoever designed in every way possible to appeal to very young children and very immature adults making heavy use of comedic devices such as farts pooeating and the size of theodores buttbr br this film would bother me a lot less if it werent such an obvious step down for the chipmunks even their characters i found were changed for the worse for this movie while in the past each one of them had a very distinct personality here they all behaved like immature smartalecky children with add constantly bouncing erratically off the walls it especially bothered me to see simon portrayed in this way hes supposed to be the smart serious nerd who acts as the straight man to alvins crazy antics but here hes pretty much a carbon copy of alvin one joke in the film even implies that simon only thinks hes smart but really isnt and honestly if i had never heard of the chipmunks before seeing this film i would have agreedbr br in my opinion this film is just another obvious cashgrab and im more than a little sorry it was even made the fact that its a kids movie doesnt excuse its flaws to excuse a stupid movie that degrades a classic franchise just because its for children is insulting to children and any kid would deserve something more intelligent than this film
