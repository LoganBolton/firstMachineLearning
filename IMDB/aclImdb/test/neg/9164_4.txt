as cute and adorable as they are the story of three singing chipmunks just doesnt seem to have enough meat to it to sustain it for an hour and a half i thought that the first half hour or so of this movie was well worth watching it was fun it had a few laughs in it it was full of energy then it somehow just lost that i wouldnt even say it faded away because it seemed quite abrupt to me the fun was gone the laughter disappeared my daughter noticed it too shes 4  she laughed uproariously several times in that first part of the movie then her laughter stopped perhaps it took on too serious a tone  the evil movie producer working the chipmunks to death something happened anyway and it wasnt for the betterbr br of course the movie is trying to tell the story of how the chipmunks alvin simon and theodore began everyone knows the christmas song here we discover how they met dave and got their start the movie is updated to the present time although their real origin is noted by daves street address of 1958 which was the year when the animated singing rodents were first created jason lee did a pretty good job as dave and the chipmunk voices were also pretty good david cross as the evil ian irritated me to be blunt and i couldnt figure out the point of the character of claire played by cameron richardson she added little to the movie its a movie you can watch with the kids  its probably a movie youd only want to watch with the kids in fact it gets a 410 from me
