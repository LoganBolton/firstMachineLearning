i went into this movie with semihigh expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood and this nearly wrecked that love for me jason lee david seville in the film is horrifying i understand it cant be easy to act with cgi characters who arent actually there but i really found his performance atrocious along with all the other nonanimated characters the chipmunks were adorable yet sometimes blatantly obvious at moving the plot of the story along and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for longer than half an hour into the film if you feel you must see this film rent it at the most it is not worth eight bucks to see it in theaters unless youd like a good laugh at the horrible acting
