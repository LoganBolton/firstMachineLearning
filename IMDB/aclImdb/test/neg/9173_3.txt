what can i saynot much to this one at all pretty dull and uninterestingbr br the actors performances are just ok the only one that shines in any way is simmons but he only has maybe 3 scenes i understand that by keeping his screen time to a minimum he retains the mysterious psychic aura he has but i cant help but feel his talent was wasted no one else rose above mediocrebr br the story itself seems like it may be intriguing at the beginning but then just doesnt go anywhere there wasnt a single scene in the movie that impressed me or made me feel like i had just seen something special the cinematography was fairly blandi mean desert in a washed out sort of sepianot very inspiringbr br the story of his childhood pal back outta prison seemed only partially thought out and didnt really add anything to the story other than making an average twilight zone script into a full length featurebr br drab
