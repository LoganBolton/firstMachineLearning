the only reason i bought this dvd is because cynthia rothrock is in itnow everybody knows she is the queen of martial arts b moviesthe trouble is this is not a martial arts moviecynthia rothrock has about a minute or so of fight scenes in this stupid movienow if you were a film maker and you had cynthia rothrock in your movie wouldnt you want to have a lot of martial arts action all she does in this movie is walk around looking bored just like i was when i watched this pile of crapi own a lot of her movies and they are all b movies but at least they had some cool fight scenes in themif you are a martial arts fan avoid this no matter whatim still mad i wasted 4 dollars to buy this dvd
