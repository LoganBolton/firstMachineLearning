unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie im really not the much of a cynthia rothrock fan to say the least however when i saw that the movie had fred williamson and robert forster both great actors i just had to watch the film williamson is a dakota smith an alcoholic cop who is demoted to scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush and even worse having to team up with cynthia at the behest of the captain robert forster forster is always watchable its just a crying shame that the movie itself is so damn trite and clich√©d it also features one of the least terrifying villains ever to be committed to celluloid williamson would return to the dakota character in a few more films the next one being down n dirty br br eye candy nina richardson shows some ta mary kapper goes topless br br my grade d br br where i saw it showtime extreme
