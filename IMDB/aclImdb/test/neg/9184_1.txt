wagons east is widely known as john candys last movie as he died on the set thats just what makes it so sad not simply that candy suffered a fatal heart attack but that it was on the set of such a crummy movie seriously i dont know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap but the flick has no redeeming qualities its as if they took every unused script for stupid westerns and just mixed them together and filmed it no wonder john candy didnt want to make the movie maybe his contractual participation was what did him inbr br anyway the point is that candy did much better than this throughout his career to be certain he had already completed michael moores canadian bacon in which the united states declares war on canada just stick with that one and you can say that candy ended his career honorably as for richard lewis  who previous had costarred with candy in eugene levys absurd but hilarious once upon a crime  he made up for this piece of crap by frequently guest appearing on countdown with keith olbermann in later years
