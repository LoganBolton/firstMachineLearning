john candy was very much a hitormiss comic actor his death was a tragedy and we all miss him a lot but wagons east in which he plays a bumbling wagonmaster who agrees to take a group of pioneers out of the wild west is even sadder i dont understand why it was even released the story is pointless and weak and the jokes arent there it saddens me even further that candys last film would be his alltime worst movie so lets forget all about this one and remember him in his better films such as summer rental planes trains and automobiles and uncle buckbr br 0 out of 5
