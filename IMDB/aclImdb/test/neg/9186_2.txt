wagons east was a big disappointment for me but the saddest thing about this movie is that it turned out to be john candys last film role he died just before shooting was completed on this there are only a few laughs throughout this western spoof and for a comedy that doesnt cut it if you want to see a uproarious spoof of western movies the answer is obvious see mel brooks classic blazing saddles or if you want to see candy in much better material see summer rental spaceballs or uncle buck just to name a few these three movies as well as others shows us what a great comic actor he was unfortuneately wagons east does not what a shamebr br  out of four
