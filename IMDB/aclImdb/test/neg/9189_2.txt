first off im not a firefighter but im in some kind of parafirefighting unit the guys who get called if an earthquake hits and the real firefighters need more people for sar so i had some training and simulation but i have no reallife experiencebr br but still there are some points one notices as totally unbelievable i can understand that they removed the mouthnosepieces of the masks and that there is not enough smoke because the public would otherwise see nothing but some things defy logic br br  no second mask attached to the oxygen how the hell do you want to rescue people trough the smoke without one br br  rappelling people no its not done like that id be screaming too if somebody hitched a rope around me in that fashion and hung me from a building if i could scream that is and not pass out from want of air because the rope squeezes my lungs the second time when theyre abseiling jack its better but still weirdbr br  aim high no you bloody dont you always fight fire from as low as possible you dont fight want to sprinkle flames youll want to extinguish the fire and thats below the flamesbr br  no discipline theyre running around like chicken and they shout all the time instead of using radio and keeping disciplinebr br  no tactics why dont they work in teams of at least two you still can get separated but it takes much more than if everyone just scurries around alone in search for victimsbr br  do they really enter buildings without bringing water i europe firefighters would never enter a burning building withoutbr br  firefighters on the roof wtf do they think theyre doing there without security lines or water  exploding rooms wood and brick does not explode suddenlybr br the better points are actually camaraderie and the other nonfirefighting parts of the movie its a lot of kitsch but thats alright ill give it a point for this
