if you pack all the clichés about city firefighters into 105 minutes you have ladder 49br br it has a story but is highly clouded by all the clichés it turns it into movie that with every event becomes so predictable its not worth watching there is no depth to the story and even the acting seems superficialbr br it looked like it wanted to be a tribute to firefighters but ended up being boring and pretentious the parallel between jack morrison being fatally trapped beneath an inaccessible part of a building and firefighters being trapped beneath the rubble of the twin towers was all too obviousbr br it doesnt compare to movies like backdraft and certainly does not set an example for future movies about fire personnel
