i really enjoyed the film it was really cheesy at times they destroy the villain with hair driersbut where are they plugged in its a unique film though and i enjoyed the acting of courtney draper and tamara hope i also enjoyed fanuel however you write it liking megans charecter because she called him a dweeb besides the acting the rewinding and showing what happened on ariels and then megans point of view was quite interesting i saw it twice and id see it again
