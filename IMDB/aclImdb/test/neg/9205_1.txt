now i love bad old skifee movies as much as most people and i understand that a budget is a budget that said planet of the dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie can get the thing has no actors and only one attractive female whom they kill off two minutes after swimming ashore there are literally no redeeming qualities to be found in this pile of wasted celluloid the only thing not wasted was paperthe screenplay must have been no more than four pages long surely no one actually wrote dialogue this pointless im constantly amazed that such movies ever got made much less released im only glad i didnt pay to see this waste of time its 75 minutes of my life ill never get back
