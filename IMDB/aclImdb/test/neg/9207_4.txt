the first half of the movie is not that bad actually although theres not really too much depth in the characters the story is somehow funny and generally ok with potential to get better which it doesntbr br in the second half things start to turn for the worse not only for the characters in the movie but also for the viewer who will be basically waiting for the story to come to its obvious endbr br the previous user comment mentioned its a love story a road movie a thriller a comedy of errors an 80s movie and most of all its a jonathan demme moviebr br well please allow me to rephrase that its a boy gets girl story they happen to be driving around in cars the thrill is gone as it is all too clear how things will evolve there wasnt any scene in this film to which one might laugh out loud it does have some slight 80s feeling and yes jonathan demme really was the director
