something notsogreat silence of the lambs remains demmes only good film and im of course including all the overrated leftwing exercises in bigscreen indulgence some of which i havent seen  and never willbr br this is a light comedy that takes a thriller turn somewhere halfway the first half is a little hard to sit through its neither funny nor particularly interesting daniels plays an overthetop dumbasdirt naive moron who is so gullible and trusting that it defies belief his animated acting is often annoying and barely funny he actually lies to griffith at the outset and tells her that he is married with children when in fact he is divorced in all the history of mankind and movies any man who is married and meets a woman he likes will lie  if he lies  and say that he isnt married later on the notatall credible or believable rationale behind this was revealed he wanted to protect himself what a load of crap the fact that his character makes all the wrong decisions and does all the dumb things in the movie made me actually look forward to liotta pounding on him when he caught up with him in the formers apartmentbr br what then happens in danielss apartment is the classic endofmovie fighttothedeath which the good guy  albeit the very dumb good guy  predictably wins still at least the last halfhour has some action something going on and daniels isnt given any more the opportunity to be animated the film lacks credible characters whether main or marginal and the feel of it is too 80s which means the movie has a rather bland look visually ugly sayles yet again makes a cameo as a policeman the film is also perhaps a bit too heavy on the coincidences side griffith once again plays a softtalking dumbsounding bimbo but as usual she is convincing because she is a softtalking dumbsounding bimbo this was an earlier film before her lipenlargement and breastenlargement surgery compare the natural breasts she exposes in this film to the readytoexplode balloons she briefly flashes years later in nobodys foolbr br if youre interested in reading my biographies of griffith and other hollywood intellectuals contact me by email
