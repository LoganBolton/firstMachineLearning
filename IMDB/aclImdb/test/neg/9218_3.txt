one should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the second coming and the third testament that they had read the other two or at least knew a little more about them than miracles and judgement day this film contains absolutely nothing of relevance for viewers who are interested in jesus religion or philosophy  there is only the standard british social realism with guttural dialects and plump characters in pubsbr br actually good candidates for a real third testament have been published several times  like a course in miracles or conversations with god they all have thoughtprovoking new twists and angles for christian faith and theologybr br the most interesting information in imdbs rating is not the number of stars but how many people who have bothered to vote in four years only 387 people have bothered to vote for this film as usual the enthusiasts are the most eager for comparison have a look at jesus christ superstar  original version from 1973
