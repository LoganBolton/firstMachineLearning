as i dont have a tv and had never heard of this miniseries i didnt know what to expect from the second coming and hired it purely on the strength of its plot synopsis which sounded interestingbr br dear god every pun intended if someone told me that this had been written by a class of thirteen year olds who had been given the project of turning the second coming into a school play i wouldnt have been surprisedbr br why oh why did they decide to portray jesus mark ii as what amounted to an idiot savant is there anything in any of the gospels to suggest this okay an ordinary bloke but a great northern moron i dont think sobr br apparently all jesus did to impress people was his miracles because according to this take his preaching sure as hell never impressed anyone certainly without the night into day stunt mr jesus eccleston would have been floundering without a canoe a paddle or any kind of following at allbr br and the odd little gay polemics put in willynilly without rhyme or reason other than of course russell waving to his qaf fan base jesus turns up in the pub to recruit disciples more gormless northern losers and of course the gay writers standby  the harpy woman nag nag nagging away gay rights are rammed down his throat to no real purpose almost like russell thought he owed it to the lads to put jesus on the spot br br i cant really see the real jesus coming out with well ive nothing against it personally mate only someone truly middle class and woolly could imagine jesus to be quite this wetbr br and dont start me on the ending please come in and eat rat poison because the only way we can be truly free is if god diesbr br it was like an eddie izzard sketch of god as bill gates hello im bill gates and now youve pointed out to me that my global domination is cramping your style im going to give it all to you my customers and eat the rat poison of coursebr br im often mystified by the ratings on imdb but the high rating on this one takes the biscuitbr br never mind jesus for the new millennium  this is jesus for brainless mtv ladsbr br god help us all indeed
