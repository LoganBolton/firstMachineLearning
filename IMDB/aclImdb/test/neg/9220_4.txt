possible minor spoilerbr br its not a terribly objective review but i just found this movie horribly depressing like a lot of russell t daviesbr br work it asks more questions than it can answer his best work bob  rose doctor who revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat these uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here i suppose the fact that im still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes br br i would however disagree with the reviews ive read complaining that the end feels tacked on i think each conclusion follows logically from its premise and the ending represented a sound personal belief that neatly resolved the primary theme of the show while i never really questioned the progression of events i felt like there was much that could have been expanded upon ive also read that it was originally conceived as a four part series instead of two and its possible that the truncation has done some harm to the completed piece however these flaws appear throughout in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketched inbr br to his credit davies is totally unafraid to write big and you have to admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project the premise he tackles here is the stuff of movies or novels  it is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television strong points include christopher eccleston who is positively mesmeric in the lead for me he was and remains the best reason to watch the depiction of the messiahs humanity was brilliant thought provoking and engaging and a real credit to both davies writing and ecclestons acting i also thought the depiction of the modern worlds reaction to the second coming rang true br br so two stars simply because i personally want my entertainment to be entertaining i would rather be uplifted or at least distracted by my fiction i have a whole big real world around me  as filtered through cnn or the newspapers  if i choose to be horribly depressed there are definitely less subjective reasons by which to judge this piece but im afraid my judgment in this matter is clouded by my emotional response
