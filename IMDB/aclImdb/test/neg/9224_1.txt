this is indeed a spectacularly bad film but it is the rare kind of badness that is endlessly jawdroppingly entertaining i want to add to the other comments on this filmbr br the rock band on the plane look like three skinny drunks from casual labor wearing bad wigsbr br watch for the severe continuity problem with the kids stuffed tiger it turns into a lion a leopard and back again its filthy or clean depending on the shotbr br spoiler the stuffed tiger turns into a real animal to save the kid and the writersbr br the sight of little jimmy floating down the amazon in a coffin clutching his stuffed tiger and squalling away will stick permanently in your memory br br listen for one of the most inept sound effects ever late in the story when the priest is setting out to find jimmy the guide demands his monks robes as paymentthe priest drops on one knee in a moment of resigned contemplation and there is the sound of a bell not the deep bonnnng of a church bell but the ding of a bell from a boxing matchbr br this is an absolute hoot to watch
