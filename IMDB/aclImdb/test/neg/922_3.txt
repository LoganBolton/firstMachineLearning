great ensemble cast but unfortunately a bunch of undeveloped ideas make the film drag one feels not fulfilled at the end after waiting for some kind of conclusion closure or at least an ironic twistbr br it had that familiar curb feel without dare i say it larry as the annoying polar opposite the music was there the show about nothing scenes pop up but without any common thread or suspense  it falters as a solo project that ran out of budgetbr br spoilers the movie title speaks about cheese but she prefers the rice pudding is cheese a better selling title than rice pudding he prefers just any junk food regardless of the sell by date maybe i want someone to eat cheesedogs or ice cream in a pirate suit would have at least tied some scenes togetherbr br marty this is just not funny and overdone people just dont care about a show within a show a coffee book table about coffee books was funnierbr br unless you are big fans of the cast save your time and eat some cheese it doesnt even have to be with anyone
