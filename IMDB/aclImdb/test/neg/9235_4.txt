persuaded by the 70 points in imdb which is pretty good i decided to watch this movie however i found this movie quiet boring about 2 hours and full of clichés a little girl getting multiple personalities after a childhood trauma etc tamer karadagli is quiet funny in this movie dialogs motions etc you will have to see it he is kinda the tough cop you see on american movies perhaps copied too much i would describe this movie as ordinary american thriller with a little bit of turkish touch unfortunately yet again im convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres worth watching in turkish cinema anyways i gave this movie a 4 its too boring and full of clichés
