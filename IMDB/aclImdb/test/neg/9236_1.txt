altioklars populist approach manifests itself in all his titles from the worst to the best he doesnt care or has no clue about art all he cares is to make people think theyve got a kick in the groin by watching his movies the problem is the effort is way too evident and as events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration kneaded into them the effort fails badlybr br on this turkish movie who knows where the original or originals were made since it felt extremely hollywoodish to me altioklar is trying to be some sort of tarantino mr tarantino if youre reading this please watch the movie for the best comedy of your life he doesnt use subtle moves to do that all he does is to use extreme stuff and it gets unbearably absurd and laughablebr br levent üzümcü as the forensic guy with the cowlicked hair is just hilarious im hoping to meet him in person and ask how he felt about this movie himself because i really found the role insulting for him demet evgar groping her genitalia was also uncalled for and did nothing other than making everything look fake another specifically idiotic aspect of this movie was the 100 faulty pace setting when things need to be taken slowly scenes flow abruptly and at other times it makes you sleepy to watch the slow ridicule going onbr br if altioklar is so deeply in love with lame hollywood superficiality he should use michael sixarrows as his name instead even such a move wouldnt be half as ludicrous as what he has done on this movie he should first learn not to imitate directors whose levels hell never approach then realize hes not in hollywood and then take private lessons from zeki demirkubuz or reha erdem on how to lay the flow of ideas out in the plot this useless movie couldnt be saved even by those but perhaps he can make watchable movies in the future by taking these stepsbr br by the way ive seen some infamous failures such as propaganda and otostop and i still cant divert from saying this one was the worst turkish movie ever
