the beginning might be a spoilerbr br the eye 2 is the sequel to the eye its about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to herbr br the sound effects scared the hell out of me though momentarily but thats the only scary thing some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have chilled br br the eye has quite a frightening and indelible impression whereas the eye 2 is a forgettable horrorcumdrama film omit watching this watching the eye is good enough
