i watched this movie and all i can say is thisi am not a film student nor am i some artsy intellect who tries to look for a deeper meaning into everything that i dont understand however if i were to do that with this film my thoughts would bebr br yep hes on drugs and i can picture it nowhe was tripping one night and sat around with his buddies laughing and saying stuff like heywouldnt it be funny if nuns really could fly like what if one just fell out of a plane and free fell for a while bounced to the ground and got up and walked away cackles or if buckwheat gave the pope a bath oh my god im cracking up just thinking about it dude we gotta make a movie about it and then he says to his friend as hes laughingoh and wouldnt it be hilarious if people loved it and called me a genius for it so to me this is what happens when some guy does one too many drugs and writes a script and produces a movie should i have been doing lsd to understand what this guy was thinking so i could have had a laugh too because i have to tell you i wasnt laughing i was yawning and checking the timebr br i think everyone who is trying their hardest to find a deeper meaning is hysterical i had never heard of this director until i came to read the reviews which i did because i was mad that i lost that last 2 hrs or how ever long it was it felt like 12 hrs of my life and i cant ever get it back anywayi have read that this guy is a heroine addict and he wanted to die for art what the heck is that so my point is sort of proved this guy is not all there hes a drug addict and his movie is evidence of suchso please quit trying to find a deeper meaning to it if one really wants to understand everything in this movie go drop some lsd and sit back and relax then it might actually make sensebr br it reminded me of the time i watched gus van sants last days another movie i was mad about watching i cannot help but wonder what the ratings would be for that movie if the same people reviewed it who reviewed this one it seems like if the movies director is totally off his rocker or if its a french movie with sex and subtitles or if its a cartoon it is going to get great reviews hands down anything else is boring and has already been done blah bring on the boring please
