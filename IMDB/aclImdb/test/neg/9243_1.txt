harmony korine im not sure what he was trying to do with this film if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeededbr br i know that there were big questions raised in this movie like who are we really what are we here for is there really a god all great questions but i really dont think that is funny when you have the questions along side such tragedy im all for real life being portrayed but come on its never funny when a wife is being raped someone killing themselves and family and friends find the body and people die for unexplained and unnecessary reasonsbr br the only good thing about this movie was the location it was filmed there is a lot of beautiful placesbr br im not a film student or even know all that much on the subject i admit this but i do know that when i leave the theater with a feeling of disgust then it was not a film i would recommend to anyone
