korines established himself by now as a talented and impressive imagemaker the promotional posters for mister lonely all include the films most impressive compositions though theres one in particular ive yet to see in promo material that of a blueclad nun teasing a dog with a stick surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down the opening images of this film of michael jackson lookalike diego luna riding a small motorbike round a track is strangely compelling and beautiful roy orbisons mister lonely plays on the soundtrack and the images unfold in slowmotion theres also a funny and terrific sequence in which the same character mimes a dance without music though a radio sits like a silent dog next to him in the middle of a paris street korine splices in sound effects and jumpcuts that evoke both a feeling of futility and dogged liberation in the characters dance routinebr br the first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant father umbrillo werner herzog is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns over and drop food into impoverished areas nearby in a scene that is both lighthearted and affecting herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wishes to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in san francisco as the exchange develops herzog draws out of the man a confession he has sinned and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place this scene short and sweet gains particular weight after one learns its improvised origins the sinner is played by a nonactor who was on set when korine and co were filming  and his adulterous ways had given him in real life a lasting overwhelming guiltbr br henceforth the film is hitandmiss a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous muddled narrative whereas gummo and julien donkeyboy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight via coherent structural frameworks mister lonely feels like a victim of editing room ruthlessness a few scenes were cut from the film which would have otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters due to continuity errors in costume  a result no doubt due to the absence of a shooting script and korines tendency for improvisation one deleted scene in particular  in which charlie chaplin denis lavant and madonna melita morgan have sex  would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later on in the film i wont spoil it but its there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration and as it is only halfsucceedsbr br the two strands of the narrative unconnected literally are best approached as two entirely different stories with the same allegorical meaning one compliments the other and vice versa its something to do with the conflict between ones ambitions and the reality of the current situation but theres not enough of the herzog scenes to merit their place in the film and so any connection between these two allegoricallyconnected threads is inevitably strained  and the inclusion is in retrospect tediousbr br this is an ambitious step forward from julien donkeyboy that suffers mostly at least in the lookalike segments from having far too many characters for the films running length a flaw that would have been even worse had big star names played everyone as was originally plannedbr br with many of the imagerys selfcontained beauty and moments of real genuine connection with the soundtrack this feels like itd be much more suited to an art installation or photo exhibition as an exploration of mimesis and the nature of impersonation itd lose none of its power  indeed for me it would perhaps be more impressive the loneliness attached to iconic performativity such as that encountered by both the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them is wellcaptured in images such as that wherein marilyn monroe a gorgeous samantha morton seduces the camera with a seven year itch pose in the middle of a forest or when sammy davis jr jason pennycooke settles postdance rehearsal with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible tranquil lakebr br as it is moments like these and all those where the titles of randomlychosen michael jackson songs crawl across the scene are married to one another in a film narrative far less affecting than it should bebr br for those who see it i lost all faith during the eggsinging scene late on youll know which scene i mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb as some sort of gimmicky attempt at the new cinematic language for which korine has previously been hailed
