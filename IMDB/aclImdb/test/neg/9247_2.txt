i can name only a few movies that i have seen which were this bad this movie has terrible everything the dialog is corny and clich√© the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions the cinematography is nothing to cheer about and the plot is silly a fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didnt make the soccer team this is so bad its funny to watch if you can catch this on lifetime id recommend it highly as a comedy as for being a serious movie im afraid ill have to rate this a 2br br dont watch this film if you are a serious movie fan and looking for an interesting and challenging storyline or good acting there is none to be foundbr br edit hmmm i think a group of people who work for lifetime must have written some phony reviews and voted all the negative ones down dont believe them this is a really crappy movie
