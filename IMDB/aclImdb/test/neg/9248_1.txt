 or should i say unintentionally hilarious either way this is one of the best comedies ive seen in a long time i was laughing throughout at the antics of some of the dumbest fictional characters this side of homer simpson its just one foreheadslapping painfully stupid scene after another as the clownish dimwitted cardboard cutouts substituting for actual humanoid characters push pull and drag the plot to its inevitable and obvious conclusionbr br if i had to describe this movie to someone id call it a mutated hybrid of fatal attraction dumb and dumber and the three stooges with a climax uncannily similar to the episode of family guy in which the whole family gets into a knockdown fistfight in the living roombr br advice to benson family next time you get a new pet do the poor animal a favor and dont name it fred
