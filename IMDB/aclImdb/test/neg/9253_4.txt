lord david cecil wrote an interesting book in the 1930s early victorian novelists where he looked at the works of dickens thackeray eliot trollope mrs gaskell charlotte bronte and emily bronte he selected these writers as the popular favorites of the first half of the victorian period and he explained their strengths and weaknesses as he saw them to the reading public some of his comments are quite relevant to this day but like all criticism it gives an idea of the spirit of the times of the critics life as wellbr br cecil thought highly of george eliot mary ann cross who wrote about seven or eight books including sketches and poetry but for most modern readers they are usually acquainted with her shortest book silas marner which is still read in some high school curriculum the other books felix holt the radical daniel deronda middlemarch the mill on the floss adam bede romola scenes of clerical life are still in print penguin for example has most of them in print but are mostly unread the one of most interest today is her last novel deronda where she discusses the jews in english society and an incipient prehertzl type of zionism romola is her sole attempt at a historic novel about savanarolas experiment of a religiously pure republic in florence in the 1490s her meatiest novel is middlemarch which is concerned with english society in the provinces in 1832 the year of the great reform bill of lord grey i had to read middlemarch in college for a literature course it certainly is a thoughtful book virginia woolf called it the most grownup book in the english language but it suffers like all of eliots novels from one defect  she cannot write livable exciting prose while dickens is overly exuberant at times and thackeray can become pompous and prolix and trollope can become as lord cecil says very ordinary in his discussion and charlotte bronte can fail to explain certain relationships well and mrs gaskell seems best dealing with female characters all of them and emily bronte in her single novel hold the readers interest reading most of eliots novels is like trying to chisel sentences out of blocks of marble with a toothpickbr br to date i have read about fifty pages of mill of the floss i notice that one of the other reviewers never finished the novel too but i have read a synopsis of what it is about the tullivers maggie and her brother tom are the central figures  they own the mill in the title although close at the start of the story maggie falls in love with the son of a neighbor whose father is involved in legal difficulties with mr tulliver sr tom takes a dim view of this relationship and the tragedy of the story is regarding the split between the siblings culminating in their demise at the conclusion maggie runs back to the mill to rescue tom during a heavy flood and they die together it must have been a success with victorian readers but it is very gloomy and depressing to modern audiencesbr br the movie changed the ending a little  maggie geraldine fitzgerald does die at the end with her lover and tom james mason notes their deaths at the conclusion in his record book the story is totally rewritten except for a double death in the flood at the conclusion it doesnt really help matters although fitzgerald and mason do pretty well with their parts they cant really pull the film up by their work alone the end result is a fairly minor film that fortunately did not hurt the leads careers the only other thing to note is that the boyfriend was played by frank lawton who two years earlier played david copperfield as a grown up opposite wcfields lionel barrymore and maureen osullivan but then lawton never really had a major film career  he just happened to always be around in pictures some good some mediocre
