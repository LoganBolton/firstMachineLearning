well well at last a view of this underrated flick but you cant find a good copy of it terrible copy full with green drops the editing isnt syncronized the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording overall its too dark a waist of time you should say but it isnt its a bit slow the first half part of the movie its all talking and making love to each other it is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60s never wear any bras when they enter the sleeping room its full glory anyway banned in the uk since 84 and still on the video nasties list the reason is simple its gory for their time being it really has some nasty dismemberements and its creepy in some way due the fact that it is filmed handycam way so every shot the image is moving things they do these days with the steadycam the ghastly ones could have been better if the quality of the film was better but still better then other films of the time like schoolgirls in chains
