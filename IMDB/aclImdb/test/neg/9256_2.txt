out of all the films i could have chosen it had to be this when i was last in new york i went into a times square store and out of the hundreds of dvds they had i chose joel m reeds bloodsucking freaks 1976 and this on a double feature dvd that also included seeds of sin 1968 did i regret it read on to find out the film opens on an island near milligans staten island home where two lovers are walking along with a massive parasol seemingly made from paper at one point he gives her the top of a weed as a gift out of nowhere colin hal borske a retarded hunchback pops up and kills both of them for no reason at all after the opening credits which are joined by some of the worst headache inducing music i have ever heard at least it got me used to it as its used constantly throughout the film we are introduced to three couples the wives are all sisters vicky ann linden and ricard fib lablaque veronica eileen hayes and bill don williams plus elizabeth carol vogel and donald richard ramos they each receive a letter from a lawyer h dobbs neil flanagan that request a meeting so he can read their late fathers will dobbs informs them that they must spend three days in their childhood home crenshaw house and fill it with sexual harmony and marital love that it had never known because of the strained relationship between their father and mother he informs the couples that the will is highly irregular but legal after three days the inheritance will be settled the couples are also told about the servants martha veronica radburn hattie maggie rodgers and the retarded colin who welcomes the couples by killing and biting chunks out of a rabbit in front of them later on that night whats left of the dead rabbit is found in one of the couples beds with a note that says blessed are the meek for they shall inherit this starts a series of events which end in gruesome murder and reveals dark family secretsbr br cowritten photographed and directed by the talentless andy milligan this is an absolutely horrible film in every way possible lets go through just some of its faults the music its awful and headache inducing sound you can barely hear what characters are saying and certain scenes dont have any sound effects plus at certain points you can hear milligan shouting out orders to his actors oh and theres a constant hiss on the soundtrack throughout as well the acting probably among the worst i have ever witnessed the very unspecial effects colin pokes someones eye out in the opening sequence its the size of a tennis ball the part where someone is tied down and has his stomach opened up with a saw looks really awful as are the various hands and legs that are chopped off photography milligan has absolutely no idea how to stage or film a scene he regularly cuts the top bottom or sides of peoples heads and faces off the screen and his camera jerks and shakes around like its operated by someone who is constantly tripping over there is also at least one scene so badly thought out and filmed that a crew member is seen the film is often so dark you cant see whats happening too editing again some of the worst ive ever sat through he seems to cut scenes before theyve finished cutting away while characters are in the middle of a sentence the script if there was one credited to both milligan and hal sherwood it took two people to write this is all over the place and is incredibly stupid there is one unbelievably bad sequence where the killer follows a victim down into the basement the killer walks right behind him at one point the potential victim turns around what does the killer do to avoid being spotted they duck down right in from of him the killers close enough to give the guy oral sex yet he doesnt notice them right in front of him you have to see this sequence to believe it i still cant believe what i saw bizarre sub plots just happen and then totally disappear check the scene out when richard has to borrow money from his brother walter producer and cowriter hal sherwood who turns out to be a gay priest who has had an incestuous relationship with his brother before he was married a strange scene thats there for no reason at all martha the housekeepers reaction to the first murder shes more bothered by the fact that its thrown her dinner schedule out theres load of insane dialogue as well patty and martha discuss colin patty says if only i didnt beat him so hard martha sympathetically replies you have to patty you have to delivered totally straight faced and dont start me on how ugly the wallpaper looks throughout the house the only good thing i can think of saying is that the costumes look reasonable for the time period its meant to be set in i could probably go on all day about how amateurish this is but i think you get the idea one to avoid unless your a serious masochist i didnt regret buying or watching it for a second though
