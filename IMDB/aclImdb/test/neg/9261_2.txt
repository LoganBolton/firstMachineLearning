i bought this movie for 99 cents at kmart several years back along with hawkens breed figuring anything with gabriel byrne and amanda donahoe is surely worth that much it wasnt dark obsession the title i bought it under was a slight cut above hawkens breed imbd rated at 24 but not enough to allow me to even keep it in the house i threw both movies in the trashbr br this thing fails on so many levels its hard to narrow it down but lets just say its tawdry incredible boring hedonistic confusing and even at 100 minutes way too longbr br i love byrne as an actor but this schlock really looks bad on his resume
