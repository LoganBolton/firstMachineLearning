extremely slow moviethere are fine performances from all actors which is why above 5 scoresurya and jyo are supposed to be this ideal husband and wife and we are shown this till it gets to a point you start asking is there a storythen one day jyo discovers suryas diary to find his failed college love story the college love story is totally unconvincing as surya is an arrogant senior who is always picking on bhoomika beats up her friend yells at her in public and despite being terrified of him she falls in love for himeven after that he continues to dominate her using crude languagei certainly could not appreciate the meek character played by bhoomika i dont think any self respecting woman will fall for such jerks in real lifeso jyo decides to bring them together and what happens after that is the climax the story is extremely weak in its charactersa extremely arrogant surya to bhoomika is the exact opposite with jyo and there is no reason given for the sudden change in characteragain a extremely meek bhoomika becomes a big extrovert when she returnswonder if she had turned so super confident why didnt she try to find her love as she no longer feared anyone
