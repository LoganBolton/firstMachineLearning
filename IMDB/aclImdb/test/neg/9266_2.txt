my grandad gave me this dvd with friends like these the front cover looked quite scary thought id watch it what a bloody mistakebr br basically the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them involving friendsbr br the first one is about a guy who buys a car that talks to him the second is a about a guy who wakes up to find a cassarole clone in his fridge and the third is about a woman who does online dating but it turns out he has a robotic armbr br the dvd case rated this film 18 but even a 5 year old can watch this and not be scard or entertained the film should be rated 12 for slight scares and the swear word bloodybr br all in all this film is utter shite dont go near it
