its hard to decide where to begini bought this for a few quid and its the worst few quid iv ever wasted the back of the dvd had no pictures and a few lines plot summary this should have warned me but i usually like bad movies for a laugh so decided to give it a go the movie is made up of three short storieseach revolving around someone who was on a particular bus at one pointits never made clear what the significance of the bus is or what city its set inbr br possible spoilersas if there is anything to be spoiled the first story is about a man who is persuaded by a car to purcahse it against his wifes wishesthe car is sort of like a demonic brum and takes over his lifebr br the second is about a slob of a man who never cleans his fridge and a monster bacteria man grows out of itbr br the third about a woman who goes to a dating agency only to discover her date isnt all that normalbr br inbetween these we are treated to shots of the busor a bus anyway while a narrator whittles on a load of garbage about relationshipsreallyits like he is on commission for saying relationshipsbr br the movie actually has no redeeming features whatsoeverthe acting the costumes and the little spfx are all disgustingthere arent even any attractive female cast members to admiresimply put this movie is a debacle
