the final entry in the on the buses trilogy sees the usual wasters go about their business in wales i feel sure the franchise could have continued but harold pinter complained that the screenplays made him look bad in comparison and so no more were made br br its actually less than two minutes before we get our first dollop of sexism  a woman running for the bus finds her breasts fall out of her dress for no reason whatsoever still it does at least make stan reg varney laugh  but then what doesnt he and jack bob grant spend the entire movie laughing uproariously with little or no provocation you get the impression that theyd wet themselves watching paint dry br br as before the only funny element is the genuinely amusing stephen lewis hilarious as blakey hes on his own though with a cheesy dated script that even wastes firstrate talent like wilfrid brambell and henry mcgee yet it seems as if only lewis understands how to time the shaky material wringing laughs out of even the weakest lines describing how her daughter fell in a river stans mum laments i hope its not polluted well it will be now blakey quips br br the plot  if indeed there is one  sees stan lusting after a young girl but being continually thwarted by her domineering mother its a recipe for side splitting hilarity im sure youll agree and whether its on a stormlashed boat or the swimming baths stan and maviss exploits always produce the same result abject boredom later conquests include maria an italian stereotype and a staff coworker even stans mum gets a onenight stand with stan considerately reminding her to put your tin drawers onbr br when one of the comic highpoints is arthur mullard overhearing olive trying to locate a light switch in the dark i cant find it and thinking shes talking about sex then you can see why this work reaches the upper levels of literary sophistication in fact why it didnt get in the bfis top 100 movies is beyond me br br other ribtickling shenanigans involve olive anna karen breaking her glasses i dont know whats more surprising the lame predictability of the setup or the underdeveloped payoff the short sighted olive follows a man in a kilt into the gents thinking hes a woman in a skirt the next shot sees her marched out by blakey and redirected to the ladies and thats it next she ends up in another mans bed and is ordered out by his wife and no thats all there is to that scene toobr br when holiday on the buses was last screened on british television there was a breakdown in transmission it actually came as blessed relief
