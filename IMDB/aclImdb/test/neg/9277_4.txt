the problem this film has is the same problem the tv series had and thats the laddish stan and jack  theres nothing wrong with laddish characters but stan and jack are played by actors who seem to be in their late 40s early 50s  and theres something objectionable  not to mention crediblity defying  as they cop off with girls young enough to be their daughtersbr br as for the rest of holiday on the buses  i found it instantly forgettable  its basically a 30 minute episode spun out to 90 minutes with having all the action take place at a holiday camp instead of a bus stationbr br amazingly almost a third of voters on this site have given it a 10  come on guys  this film doesnt deserve more than a 5
