this was one of the shows that i wanted to followup on but id just couldnt bring myself on devoting my time to this show to have a show that centers on the topic of politics you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show something like the west wing or commanderinchief rob lowe was ok but actors like kyle chandler just couldnt act he was awful in early edition it was a pain to sit through this show with its lack of suspense urgency and characters who can actually act i just had to give up on this show and am glad it was canceled so i would have nothing more to missbr br grade d
