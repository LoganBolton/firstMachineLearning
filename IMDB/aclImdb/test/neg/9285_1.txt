i saw this late at night on a minor channel and i put it on expecting a laugh or two martin lawrence is a good comic actor and i reckoned he might be a good standup comedianactor in the style of richard pryorbr br i couldnt have been more wrong this concert was awful it was full of racist comments directed at white people muslims and people from india muslims and indians are the same thing in lawrences narrow mind and rambling clich√©d codphilosophy lawrence like many black comics and directors cant resist the urge to preach when given a platform do we really need a lecture on martin luther king and the civil rights struggle during a standup comedy show then there were his fawning comments designed to ingratiate him with women it made my skin crawl listening to himbr br worst of all the show simply wasnt funny and i found it boring i turned over halfway through and flipped back to find him either still preaching or going on and on and on about the birth of his child there was no humour in the story of the birth of his child and it was selfindulgent on his part to bore us with the details he clearly didnt have very much to say or he would have cut this section of the show outbr br this show was rubbish runteldat
