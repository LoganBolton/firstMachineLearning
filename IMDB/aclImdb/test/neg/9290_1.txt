to paraphrase the previous reviewers comments if youre a stooges fan avoid this one at all costs my basic question is being the experienced troopers of comedy that moe and larry were why did they insist on attempting to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home studio columbia was so clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and veteran comedy directors this movie plays like someone whos giving a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how very hard moe and larry are working to make every little bit of slapstick relevant joe de rita despite his background in vaudeville is just not up to the job as a replacement for curly shemp or even joe besser if thats who moe and larry had left to pick from they should have just closed up shop and enjoy their retirement years leaving us fans with better memories of far better films they had done earlier always leave them laughing is the motto for comedy and always quit while youre on top hence seinfelds leaving the sitcom while right up there instead of sticking around for the inevitable decline
