contains spoilersbr br as a fan of rachael leigh cook i watched for this show to finally come on so that i could see it i taped it so i could watch it several times and there is something about this show that really bothers mebr br i recognize that this was a madefortv movie not only that but it was made for lifetime which is a channel that i despise because it was made for tv i can ignore the huge plot holes i can ignore the massive lack of character development in ally sheedys character i can overlook the fact that george c scott and rachael leigh cook both of whom are very talented actors were definately not reaching the best of their abilities i can look past the fact that don diamonts character was so cliched that you knew when you saw him he was the villain i can even pass over the obvious mistake in the timeline shes raped during her winter break and then over a year later she has the baby from itbr br the major thing that i cant get over is this there are two trials for the custody of the child in the first trial custody is awarded to the childs father because he is better educated has a degree from a community college and has a full time job in the second trial the judgement is reversed because the judge feels that there is lack of evidence that emma rlcs characteris an unfit mother and custody shouldnt be taken from the primary caretaker and given to someone with no previous interaction with the childbr br the problem is this nowhere during the course of these trials is the fact that a thirtysomthing year old man raped a 15 year old girl and got her pregnant taken into consideration whether it was a rape or not he had sex with a minor wouldnt that be taken into consideration when the judge is choosing him for custody because hes a mature adult mature adults dont have sex with minors br br its not the worst cable movie that you would ever see but its not a great show either  out of
