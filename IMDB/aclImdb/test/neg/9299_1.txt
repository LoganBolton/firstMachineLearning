i went to this film full of hope with so many capable and humorous actors headed up by sir ben i thought this is going to be a little treatbr br oh how i felt like gouging my eyes out as the credits rolled that i had wasted 93mins of my life this film that was clearly doa there are some real problems with this film and it will probably be easier to list them 1 no jokes i am not particularly hard to please comedically  high or low brow  but there really is not one laugh in this filmbr br 2 sir ben mumbles through every single line whether he is supposed to be drunk or not 3 there is no effort to to begin let alone develop the relationship between the love interests in this 2 people bumping into each other randomly in the street would instantly have more rapportbr br 4 all the acting talent that is assembled is completely wasted dont be fooled into watching this because of the namesbr br 5 for a cold ass hitman he rubbed out more people in gandhi than this flaccid waste of time a by the way dyed beards look really creepy i was hoping that this was a slow burner but in the end the only thing that could inject any life  and justice  into this is frank pulling out his 9 and offing the whole cast starting with tea and ending with himself  sorry it was that bad
