i know everyone said this movie was utter crap and i agree with them i spent a few years after seeing it telling other people it was crap i recommended they not see it but when it came on tv we saw the ad i turned to family and said i know this is sad but im thinking of watching it my sister turned to me and said yeah me too and you know what it was funnybr br by no means is this a good movie its absolutely a waste of time but its a good waste of time you may still think its crap and fair enough but i thought it was a really funny slapstick comedy i didnt like a couple of bits like when the fish got hit by the car but apart from that i thought it was good i loved sitting there and picking out all the famous australian faces flacco elle mcfeast garry mcdonald etcbr br so if you like to waste your time watch this movie otherwise see a drama or something
