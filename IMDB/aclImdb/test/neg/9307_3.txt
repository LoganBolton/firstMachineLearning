mr accident is a deliberate series of nonstop disasters and near death experiences reminiscent of saturday mornings warner brothers cartoons like the coyote who falls off the cliff 5 times per episode the leading man more like an over grown klutzy child always manages to postpone his meeting with the grimm reaperbr br this australian surprise is offensively unfunny and at times even depressing the 2 out of ten are is for the visual stunts some never attempted by anyone since daffy duck and the use of vivid colors like in those high class national laundry detergent commercialsbr br there may be an age bracket where this comedy finds a following i have definitely passed that age long ago calling all preteens heres a haha for ya
