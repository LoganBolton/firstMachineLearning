this movie was a poor movie the plot was poor and the comedy they tried to deliver came out poorly the accidents seem contrived and predictable i thought the actors tried to some extent but with this movie it was so lame it can only go so farone of the worst films i have seen and dont recommend it to anyone the only accident to mr accident was its release
