i feel dumber after watching the first 20 minluckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highlynot because of the budget of the film or the special effects just simply good acting and getting simple things rightand most importantlynot being lame but i guess this was produced for those sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is a good moviedont be scared of rating films lowsave your underappreciated high scores for once in a life time movies keep in mind that many use imdb for trusted reviews and opinionsdont spoil the broth by sugarcoating turds peace  love
