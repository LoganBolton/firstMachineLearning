what can be said of this independent effort beyond the fact that it was shot with television cameras and whether that was by conceit or budget constraints doesnt make the watching of this variation on a theme by romero any easier i was constantly reminded that i was watching somebodys school project at best derivative at worst cheapbr br writerdirector georg koszulinski who also appears in the film does some interesting things with stock footage but that says more about his editing style than his directing style which consists of inyourface closeups with tv cameras which made me think i was watching publicaccess television instead of an actual honesttogoodness filmbr br the story copies and pastes bits and pieces from various sources including the aforementioned romeros dead trilogy the road warrior dig that stock footage of a future that looks like the past and the blair witch projectbr br what results is an hourandnothings worth of zombies tracking down and eating humans okay the humans in this case are clones but that doesnt change anything its the same menubr br the year is 2031 and the first strand of people who were cloned nineteen years before have started to malfunction particularly in the dietary area of course when clones go bad the first thing they have a taste for is human flesh or in this case cloned human flesh its not safe to be indoors its not safe to be outdoors its just a matter of time before the flesheating ghouls devour our heroes have you seen this before br br i dont mind people ripping off romero if its done well but no new territory is covered in this film its night of the living dead meets the blair witch project shot with television cameras what is particularly disappointing is that the dvd cover makes it look like it was shot at the very least with 8mm film this wouldnt have been a problem with me if the story had not been equally cheap the film offers a bleak vision of the future in which technology has evolved to the point where human cloning is possible must we continue to clone our favourite movies
