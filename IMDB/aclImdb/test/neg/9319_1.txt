well i remember when the studio sacked schrader and hired harlin to do reshoots to this film they were quite right to do sobr br dominion prequel to the exorcist is simply a bad movie its boring really it isbr br it would be nice to think that the studio put aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who in such big words condemned harlins version and praised schraders even if no one had ever seen it would have been rightbr br but they werentbr br to put it in a nutshell  schrader has no idea what a horror film should be and it shows in a big waybr br droll boring unintentionally funny in all the wrong places and bad supporting castbr br save your cash and your nerves dont see it
