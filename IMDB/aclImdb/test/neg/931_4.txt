first there was tsui harks zu warriors 2001 which is visually groundbreaking but much lacking in the acting and writing departments now this movie which is visually almost as good as zu though no longer groundbreaking but is even worse in the acting and writing departments its really sad that there seems to be an almost complete lack of acting and writing talents in the hk movie industry i guess you need to understand cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogs in the movie really are its like some delinquent kids talking in the street its that bad to make it worse the actors and actresses themselves look like delinquent kids and cant act even if their life depend on it i understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in hk but has hk youths really become so braindead that they cant appreciate anything but such juvenile and vulgar actingwriting if thats the case it makes me ashamed to be from hkbr br i wish hk movie makers will learn some lessons from directors like zhang yimou or ang lee and finally make a movie thats both visually stunning as well as competent and mature in the acting and writing departments and stop using young singersidolsheartthrobs as actors because they cant act however many fans they may have in hk
