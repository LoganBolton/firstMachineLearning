i have nothing at all against paul schrader in fact hardcore 1979 is one of my very favorite films but some horror movie fans were in a premature uproar when his original version of the exorcist prequel dominion this one youre reading about right now as it turns out was scrapped by warners and when renny harlin was substituted to spruce things up and make a new version that was more scary in my opinion some viewers were prejudiced and became automatically juiced up for hating renny harlins take on the subject exorcist the beginning before the first frame of film was ever even unspooled for them to judge and i ought to know because i myself went into the theatrical premiere of beginning with stubborn arms folded and prepared for the absolute worst which i was sure had to come imagine my surprise when i found harlins beginning to be much more serious than i ever could have conceived with a good performance from stellan skarsgard as a young version of father merrin who was struggling with his faith in god it wasnt a great film by any means but it was nowhere near the garbage i had prepared myself for well in advance sight unseenbr br well now i finally have seen the true garbage version  and its paul schraders dominion prequel to the exorcist it was relentlessly talky uninteresting and insipid stellan skarsgards troubled priest was nowhere near as interesting as he had been for me in harlins film and the actor himself not as good in the part for all those who pointed out the obvious cgi effects in beginning guess what theyre here in dominion as well remember the silly ending in harlins rendition which ill also agree tainted the rest of that movie well youre going to find that this ending from schrader isnt a hell of a lot less lamebr br let me also say that i resent the nonsense thats been presented by those who appreciate this film better than harlins by saying that were retards or cannot appreciate subtle filmmaking as a person who despises stephen sommers mtvfashioned mummy of 99 and being a true fan of the very suggestive and discreet old horror films of the 30s and 40s i can assure you this is not the case with me at least there was some degree of terror and exorcisttype goings on in harlins beginning this one here is just a real exercise in tedium and a great challenge even for the most certified of insomniacs its going to be quite interesting to hear horror fans try to convince themselves that dominion prequel to the exorcist was as good as theyd already made their minds up for it to be in advance just as they were already predisposed to lambasting harlins beginning the second they learned paul schraders name was getting soaked with the whiteout
