absolutely one of the worst movies ive ever seen the beginning was not the greatest either but better than this one this is not a good way to lead up to the original movie its just simply awful the cgi hyenas were so fake looking in both movies why not use real animals i enjoyed the old sinbad movies better than this i was royally disappointed the only good thing i can say about this waste of film is the cinematography and clothes which really captured that era well i understand why this movie was redone as the beginning its just that bad in my opinion where does the money come from to waste like this give me a multimillion dollar budget and ill show you how it should be done
