once again ive been duped by seemingly intelligent reviews making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously crappy movie i actually put my shoes on got in my car burned expensive gasoline and drove to the nearest rental place after reading said reviews and paid the requisite 4 dollars and change to rent this thing im telling you this ones not worth the minuscule kilocalories spent on lifting ones index finger to switch channels on a tv remote br br i even gave it a few more minutes after seeing all the telltale signs of a pedigree dogpile these presented as clinical symptoms of a director who is a going senile or b is only marginally interested in the film heshe is obligated to create i saw similar deterioration with john carpenters string of ridiculous caricatures over the past number of yearsbr br here are a couple of scenes as incriminating evidence the priest is having a disturbing dreamsupposedly a harbinger of nastiness to come since he seems hell bent on opening the archaeological feature which houses the demon the dream is a goofy collage of disjointed images right out of the twilight zones stock footage a ticking clock careens through the dream scapes blackness implying what the unfathomable mystery of timebig deal a disembodied head painted in demon features with convenience store quality halloween makeup flickers back and forth in a convulsive frenzy every time i see this effect a big fat ripoff from jacobs ladder it pisses me off this in itself almost instantly discredits a film br br the whole buildup of the archaeological dig itself is laughable everything is so obviousso tired and overwroughtthe only possible response is boredom at one point in the dig the priest comments on finding the statues of angels surrounding a sarcophagustheyre all pointing down toward the crypt with their weapons he queries look at these surrounding statuesits as if they are holdingsomethingdown this is supposed to build tensioncritical massbut it doesnt even come close how can there be suspense if you treat the audience like a bunch of morons having to explain the suspense as you go along the imagery is overdone in the first place but the added comments only add insult to injury in my opinion soon thereafter the tomb is decorated with the remains of the soldiers placed there to guard the main atrium another shameless ripoff of the keep btw who for crying out loud did the makeup effects for this film the blood actually had that pinkish quality one might see in 70s tromaville flicks at this point i became almost convinced that they simply forgot the makeup and had to go to walmart in the interest of time and moneybr br dont listen to glowing comments on this one ill be keeping a suspicious eye on schrader too looks like it might be time to hang up his gloves perhaps a close friend will offer a gentle admonition to quit while theres still dignity in memory of films gone by
