well after seeing beginning i thought why the hell they burned schraders version and did that poor one but now after seeing dominion i deeply understand this decision even they got it not much betterbr br sorry but this movie is really crap some good moments but a really boring storytelling and some major plotholes are killing this moviebr br i thing the exorciststory has a lot and in a prequel on this you can built on a lot and give references the audience will like to see but there is so much little of it in the movie the effects are really bad  not even tvstandard
