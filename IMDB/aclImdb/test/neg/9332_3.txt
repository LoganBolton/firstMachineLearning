mostly uninvolving biblical mumbojumbo that drags on for well over two hours the only thing that saves this film from gods wreath and there is only one god remember is the unintentionally funny dialog and a good battle scene which comes far too late in the movie for most of the two hours until the action scenes there is too much talking the dialog is so inept that the movie just begs to be spoofed by mst3kbr br george sanders is absolutely awful one of the most animated overlytheatrical performances ive ever seen brynner isnt much better his stiff wooden acting combined with the horrendous fortunecookie wisdom utterings make for a rather boring and silly solomon it seems that every time brynner opens his mouth something ohso wise and ridiculously highandmighty comes out to an extent its not sanderss and brynners fault because of the crappy comical dialog and the typically biblical onedimensional characterization but they made little effort otherwise brynners accent even reminds a bit of schwarzeneggers this is not a plus only lollobrigida manages to avoid embarrassing herself by playing the role with more conviction and in an appropriate way which befits a role in such a silly film to describe these biblical characters as onedimensional would be too give them undeserved credit the characterization is halfdimensional
