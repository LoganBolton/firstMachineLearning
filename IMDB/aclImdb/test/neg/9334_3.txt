this movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone such as the robe quo vadis and samson and delilah unfortunately depict all pagans or anybody who isnt a jew or christian as morally depraved and decadent the focus is only on biblicalrelated stories that ignore the world outside the bible as far as they are concerned nothing good came from pagan egypt greece or romebr br any movie that preaches about the one true god gives a short shift to freedom of religion the movies ignore the fact that ancient judeas lack of religious freedom made it a fertile ground for religious extremism most 1950s religious movies also overlook the loss of freedom the occurred after christians assumed political power in the 4th century
