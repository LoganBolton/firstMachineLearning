it wasnt until i looked at the trivia section that i found out that the original producerstar of this movie tyrone power died during its making  this no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things  a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic  you know when youve been painting a wall until youre completely bored  well thats the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when theyre swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner br br the plot centres on soloman the king of israel having an affair with the queen of sheeba and his people not being happy about it  you cant really blame them since theres few things more beautiful in the world than those israeli moteks  though the israeli women here all seem to look like cherie blair  modern day israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in european and american accents br br after much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed  and no thats not praise  we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered israelis have to defend themselves against a massed egyptian army who cant read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them  this is what i dont get  even though their blinded by the sun the egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the israelis never ever realising theyre charging towards a gaping ravine  isnt this somewhat illogical  its also something of a revealing error since the horses  chariots and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures br br anyway the film ends with soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising god for his victory  but who needs moshe dayan  arik sharon or god when youve got an idiotic enemy who cant see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall
