if only disney had stayed away from it see i think that this movie has some potential well the main characters situation does at least take out the whole jordan cahill thing and youve got the beginnings of a decent movie of course you also lose more than half of the film but oh well not that much of a lossbr br so here it goes you take a typical preppy suburban teenage girl danielle panabaker whos actually a decent actress whose best friends screech a lot mostly over a pop sensation im assuming its a direct quote from the movie movies like this almost always involve that particular phrase named jordan cahill except of course tpstg wants more out of life enter brenda songs character a sophisticated individual who is just what tpstg needs honestly i dont care what the characters real name is i like the acronym better the two new friends go to see jordan cahill one to drool one to make fun of the droolers and they come out of it with his cell phone hijinks ensue and everything turns out alright in the endbr br if only disney or any major film studio for that matter didnt have such a low opinion of 8 to 14 year olds or maybe if 8 to 14 year olds expected a little more out of the movies targeted at them its sugarcoated crap like this that make me more than a little unsure who to be more disgusted with a little film called high school musical comes to mind
