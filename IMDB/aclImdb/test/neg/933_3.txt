i was watching the beginning of this on a friday midday while working at computer at home relaxing a bit after a hectic week and cleaningup some files and answering some communications got interrupted a couple of times so had trouble getting all the details straight although its hardly a work of hitchcock proportions where missing a detail can through the whole story offkilter and besides it was not exactly an engrossing piece of workbr br so during a commercial read the only prior comment here by mgconlan1 and pretty much can agree with its detailsbr br not quite in the category of a film so awful it is fascinatingly good but id like to catch on tape when run again rather than seeing it as aired so i can fast forward as needed and see the parts which i missed this first timebr br give it a 3 because of the attractiveness of the four primary characters
