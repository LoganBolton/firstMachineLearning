i grew up in the 90s therefore you must understand that i witnessed firsthand the premiers of the greatest dcoms i was there when brink appeared zenon halloweentown johnny tsunami etc these movies constitute my childhood when these movies came on not only myself but whoever i was watching them with would stand completely in awe for 1h30 talk about it for the week to come and catch it again the next weekend i dont think words could express the amount of excitement zoog disney brought br br even when i watch them now the dialog doesnt seem that bad so effective in fact that i actually remember parts of conversations literally word per word from movies i saw over ten years ago the characters are believable funny granted a little stereotypical but thats what makes disneys charm br br i sat my little brother down in front of the disney channel to try and convey and make him understand my feelings for dcoms enter stuck in the suburbs my brother looked at me slightly puzzled asking me if i had always been gay i feel more disappointed and betrayed now than what could i compare this to when han solo found out lando sold him out to vader br br half the movie and im not exaggerating is flashbacks there is no talent in these young actors some of which are older than i am whatsoever the plot is ridiculous it feels like a bunch of old rotting corporate people over at disney sat around a table and asked themselves how can we seem hip to these youngsters ok maybe all the dcoms were like that but they at least made a little effort to not let us realize they think were complete idiots br br and apparently this type of movie works stuck in the suburbs is rated almost as much as zenon or airborne how is this possible dcoms got even cheesier and people prefer them now though apparently the lack of curse words is enough to give it 1010 for some people christ its a completely different generation
