ill not comment a lot whats to stereotype characters absolute ignorance about colombias reality awful mise en scene poor color choice not funny it supposed to be a comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some distend music its beside the nonsense scenes very poor actors direction if you see somewhere those people i mean the interpreters youll know they are at least good but seeing this so call film it is impossible to guess it you get tired of the music this comedy has no rhythm the only good rhythm in it its the rap sing in the final creditspathetic doesnt it etcetc it has been a long time i havent seen a movie so bad
