i dont understand the exaggerated good critics about this film except that a lot of people from venezuela are understandably very excited based on that the venezuelan cinema is really a bit behind of what other countries are in the regionbr br the movie first of all is too repetitive a lot of scenes are almost identical from each of the both leading roles so you get the impression that its a time filler a time filler is also a good point as this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes you will start to get tired after a while and watch on the clockbr br all actors are quite bad by exception of the venezuelan guy edgar ramirez who brings in a bit of slapstick and plays the role of the venezuelan recruit pedrobr br by the way this is not a representative movie about the people of the region caribean zone it tends to ridicules them
