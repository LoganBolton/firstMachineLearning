wow the storyline to this was just incredibly stupid i realize that this movie was supposed to be of a comedic genre but still even nonsense is supposed to make at least some vague sort of sensebr br water has become incredibly rare substancebr br well thats strange considering that hydrogenated oxygen or oxidized hydrogen is one of the most plentiful substances there is in the universe and pretty easy to make glomp together hydrogen and oxygen atoms and voil√† waterbr br instead of water the rarity of dilithium crystals or some such thingamajig should have been used as a plot device as something the pirates would go after water as a plot device was just dumb dumb dumbbr br the comedy seemed labored and contrived and forced the comedy in the tv series red dwarf was labored and contrived and forced but it was actually amusing here instead i felt like saying ha ha that was just so funny i forgot to laughbr br sigh all that money put into sets costumes actors what a wastebr br rather than just whimper and whine and complain at its lameness my recommendations to make it better 1 use a believable plot device 2 get rid of the comedy none of the actors were really any good at it the movie would work better as a serious action adventurebr br the obvious intention of the writers was to do a spoofy comedy but they didnt quite pull it off its not likely ill ever watch this again its too much a total hack job
