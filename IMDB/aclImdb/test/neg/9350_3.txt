i cant knock this film too terribly because its obvious midway through the the watching of it that they were trying to make it bad or campy if you prefer anyway many of the parts they tried to make funny actually are but often simply for the cheese factor watch the space invaders game actually played as reallife scratch your head at the bumbling robotsoh the wackyness and watch the whole thing go way over the top near the end with the time warp and the sexual innuendoes just keep on flyingim actually surprised this got away with a pg oh well a fun way to waste a couple hours but star warstrek this aint folks 3 out of 10
