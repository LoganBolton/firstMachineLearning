go up to any film fan and ask them the title of the film which was directed by robert wise with secondunit direction by yakima canutt and sergio leone was designed by ken adam and scored by max steiner starred sir stanley baker sir cedric hardwicke and brigitte bardot was filmed in colour scope and stereo at cinecitta in 1955 with a thousand extras  and theyll tell you to go away and stop being sillybr br theyll tell you that no such film exists that the names youve quoted never worked together  they werent even contemporaneous and that youve just picked the names out of a movie publication at random and are attempting to befuddle thembr br at which point you can direct them to imdb and show them the cast and crew of helen of troy theyll be amazed this lesserknown swordandsandal epic has all these names and more  niall macginnis janette scott and good old harry andrewsbr br and it is certainly an oddity after the war 1000 italian extras cost about 25 a day and toga dramas were a staple of italian cinema the orgy scenes were shot twice  one with tops the other without you can guess which version britain and america got i believe even la sophia is an extra in this onebr br either way the names stagger the mind but its really just a coincidence all of said names were either just reaching the ends of their careers canutt steiner or beginning them everybody elsebr br only robert wise and niall macginnis were in the middle of their careersbr br for the record leone was uncredited and learning his trade  adam still had to invent the descending circle in the ceiling of sets a trademark hed go on to put into all the early bonds  baker had yet to star in and help produce the likes of zulu and robbery  and go on to direct a welsh tv company called harlech  then die tragically youngbr br while harry andrews would go on to become one of britains favourite character actors  janette scott thora hirds daughter would never make the really big time but who can forget her in day of the triffids even though her bit was added later  for padding and a happy ending or crack in the worldbr br sir cedric was theatre but knew how to mug on film  and bardot was bardot for gawdsakebr br but what were these stellar people doing in this camp old nonsense dont ask me the two main stars were noname italians  helen had a moustache and paris was pretty  while the brits were only there for supportbr br to summarise i think you can just mark this one up as a major fluke in stereo to be honest if i hadnt seen it  i wouldnt believe it either
