this very finely crafted film commits the unforgivable which is ironic given the films theme no one coming into this film knows what they are in for worse than that 34 of the way into the film no one still has any clue of what theyre in for because everything up to that moment is a different moviebr br as a frontrow fan of dutchers first two films easily competing for the best 2 mormon films to date competing with saints and soldiers and now new york dollsaw that at a screening dutcher had me wanting to see his film for a very long time i was there i wanted to believe believe that id see the next great mormon movie one that would hold the numero uno spot for a very long time but no threefourths in the film took the sharpest of left turns and dragged me through something that i never wanted to go through he takes on the mt everest of all moral issues yea both of them with little time or emotional capacity left to adequately address them but instead waves them both off with a nod towards jesus as if that will make all things well instantly true it is that jesus saves dont accuse me of not believing that thats not dutchers problembr br is the film shot well indeed do the actors act they acted their pants off was the music appropriate all but whatever was over the closing credits everything about this film was superb except the story which was so dank and wrong that all else doesnt matter i learned dank from new york doll very decent show by the way the third act of the film was neither desirable nor pleasant nor faith affirming i know dutcher was bending over backwards to make it so but i was so far shoved out of the movie at that point that nothing no thing could have brought me back the preposterous unbelievability of dozens of details in the final minutes didnt help anyone whos been on a mission knows what im talking about especially anyone who혰spoiler alert혰is familiar with events surrounding someone being sent home from a mission early for moral andor psychological reasons its as if a parallel universe suddenly sprung up where normal rules or behaviors suddenly dont applybr br there are a million things good about this film but they were created and beautified only to be trampled upon and thrown away in a kneejerk fit of ooh this will really get them elitism hence unforgivable i can only hope that when dutcher puts the finishing touches on his next film falling apparently that he remembers that film critics can only buy so many tickets and that its the fans that pay the bills thats why the first gods army was such an unqualified successbr br dutchers shock and awe approach proves that when it comes to the big issues he is in way over his head having neither the spiritual nor creative maturity nor business sense necessary to take them on i pray혰pray혰he learns his lesson and that years from now he and we all look back with a chagrin and rejoice that he pulled his head out of where the light doesnt shine and really successfully takes on those and other issues and changes the world forever because of it
