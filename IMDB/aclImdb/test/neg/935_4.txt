i saw this movie considering this as a normal hollywood movie but then came to know that its a movie made for tv channelon my dvd cover out of 2 critics comments one of the critic stephen farber from moviline reveiwed it as a best movie of the yearbr br all the character were simple and decent performances except the brains character which never gets scope which director wanted to keeps mystery till end there was suspense till end but when you see the end that lady police officer and main culprit had a lesbian affair seems to be totally stupid ideagod knows what happens to dave the male lead characterbr br the other critic from mr browns movies said that shocking and effective but doesnt quite live up to all the hype which i saw after watching the movie for which i was partially aggreei should have read this first before taking the movie
