a woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable rash of suicides then again are these really suicides it seems as though theres a ghost on the loose guess what the ghost has long black hair that hides its face and it moves about with its head or arms twisted this way or that making for a very weird looking specter recurrent theme music plays from unexpected locations to announce the arrival of the ghost and bizarre sound effectswhich resemble the sound of small twigs being snappedalways accompany this hapless spirit does any of this sound familiar well if youve seen a few asian horror movies in the last 10 years it should borrowing heavily and unabashedly from the ring one last call and a few other recent horror hits this film tries to carry an uninteresting and wornout plot to a climax but weve seen it all before avoid it unless youre desperate or havent seen any other asian horror movies in the last 10 years
