this is a movie from toilet pictures if the name of the production company is any indication how stinky a movie is then this would be it i think im not really a fan of horror movies not that im chicken but rather this year alone i havent been genuinely spooked by whats on offer so far be it from the west or from asia 956 is no different great premise but poor execution relying on clich√©d techniques i think these are the only tools of the trade available to try and elicit some heart thumping momentsbr br sejin ko soyoung is a lonely career woman who one day notices that some apartments in the block of flats opposite hers undergo blackouts simultaneously at precisely 956pm everyday no shes no voyeur but a series of unexplained deaths in the neighbourhood including one which she encounters herself on a subway start to draw her deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding these deathsbr br with horror movies theres always a pseudological explanation within the movie about how the spooks come about thats just about the most interesting thing that happens in the film the unravelling of the truth although it wont take seasoned film lovers to guess the plot halfway through which of course makes it a very unsatisfying experience watching this moviebr br theres a myriad of characters like the wheelchair bound girl and the neighbours who take turns to care for her as well as a schoolgirl detective a mentally challenged boy and a spooky train commuter but following genre formula these folks are there usually as fodder for deaths or in this case pointless red herring characters whose sole aim by the filmmakers is to mislead the audience nevermind if they convolute or add little to forward the plotbr br and dont get me started on the techniques employed here quick cuts sudden appearances long hair ghouls ahhhhhhh so passe who cant move properly copious amount of blood like it flows down a mountain for free and the list goes on but credit to the sound engineers for creating some ear piercing bone crunching sounds used each time the spooks move though it seems like a one trick ponybr br dont waste time on this even if youre a horror fan its a complete waste of a promising premise and in the end you feel like youve just be taken on a ride a very long and painful one to endure its high time for some innovation in this genre otherwise one film will easily look like another with ugly long haired monsters moving funny but with the ability to make sudden appearances accompanied by loud sounds oh and can someone oil those doors while theyre at it as well
