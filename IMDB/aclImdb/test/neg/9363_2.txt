br br i understand that people have different expectations of lowbudget arthouse movies i also know that john sayles has a sort of glow about him that earthy intellectual antihollywood vibe a la tim robbins the coen brothers and atom egoyan that makes him a darling with the critics from the getgobr br but this is not a good movie im sorry it just isntbr br it meanders it has too many characters its tone is uneven its point of view is muddled the acting is all over the board from naturalistic to over the top it lingers for long moments with minor characters we dont care about and cuts away from tense scenes just when things are getting goodbr br it misses the markbr br the worst flaw in the movie is that the two closest things to a protagonist edie falcos marly and angela bassetts desiree are straightjacketed in characters that have no drive marly is an apathetic drunk steeped in her lifes own inertia desiree is a woman trapped in her own repressed pain when your two main characters worldviews can be summed up with the phrases i dont care and i want to leave here why should the audience give a rats patootiebr br ill be plain sayles writes funny dialogue hes very adept at crafting a scene the problem is these scenes dont go anywhere theres no spine to the movie no drive the movie doesnt create rooting interest in any of the characters in my opinion hes also too preachy about big bad corporate america gobbling up the little guy br br if you want to see a quality small movie see david lynchs straight story pass this one up
