i usually dont write reviews for shows unless ive seen them in full however there were so many positive views of this show on here i felt it was necessary to balance it out with a bit of realismbr br this show is hysterically bad i dont think it was meant to be but it is i see that theres lots of praise being showered upon the show and i honestly cant understand why this show is so poorly acted the dialogue is so awful and the plots are thin around their holesbr br i think that this show is interesting in that it is a definite litmus test of your standards some elements of the show work and perhaps those elements are just more important to some people than those that dont work which make the show nearly unwatchable to people like mebr br if you enjoy making fun of a show as you watch it anticipating clichéd lines and such this can be an enjoyable show to ridicule if you have that sort of time on your handsbr br the pilot is a pretty fair example of the whole show if the nonsense saccharin cliché ending doesnt leave you in a dumb shock then this may be a show for you
