all i can say is this movie is made for the lifetime channel on tv which means no solid characters no particular style weak acting all kinds of suggested sex but nobreasts and tushs because boy that would just catapult the film into the depths of sleaze wouldnt it but the heavily simulated sex well thats ok br br when watching these films i have to ask myself when will these types of tv channels and their advertisers ever grow up i think these companies are actually way behind the times they really have no clue what the younger generation is in tune with and if they knew they would demand we change the whole point of many american tv channels like these seems mostly to regurgitate the same sanitized diluded garbage over and over like a generic movie assembly line i guess it works for them or at least it has not sure about the future though br br dont bore yourself to death like i did seek out some real tv movies on hbo showtime ifc starz etc any channel that puts effort into their work and doesnt have to ask a priest what they can or cannot show
