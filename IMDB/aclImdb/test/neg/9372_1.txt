eliza dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress she manages to be the rocksteady centre of tru calling but thats not enough to rescue her tv series from mediocrity its a real shame that a woman as attractive and talented as dushku should go from a meaty supporting role in buffy the vampire slayer to this clunker br br unoriginal and desperately trying to be hip tru calling fails to excite on any level above hormonal the eponymous heroine spends a lot of her time running hither and yon across what must be a very small city in order to avert the deaths of goodlooking corpsestobe that shes already met in the mortuary where she works despite all the running she does she always arrives looking like shes just stepped out of a portable airconditioned dressing room br br in every episode eliza dushku and the rest of the cast struggle to breath life into the bland characterless screenplays but its a pointless exercise tru calling just lies on the slab gazing lifelessly at the ceiling
