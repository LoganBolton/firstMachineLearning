to begin with i have to admit ive never been a big fan of the dutch moviegenre unfortunately watching de dominee hasnt made me change my mind it shares some common flaws like having a plot thats too predictable and linear for my taste br br worse however is that the cast has their dialogues as if they were stageactors in a play unfortunately this is common too in many dutch movies and at least to me makes it impossible to feel any kind of involvement with the main charactersbr br the actor that plays adri im sorry i forgot his name at the moment is at least delivering a decent performance and is one of the reasons i dont rate this movie even worseanother reason is the fact that at least it seems to have had some budget and the production seems professional br br ironically the fact that the acting is often too articulated might not be so much of a problem if you dont speak dutchalthough i already warned you that the plot isnt spectacular either but at least it might make it an acceptable movie to watch
