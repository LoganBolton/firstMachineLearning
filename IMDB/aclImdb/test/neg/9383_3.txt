when jan svankmajer lets his imagination run wild get ready youre in for dark harrowing films like alice and little otik or short gems such as down to the cellar and jabberwocky all of those are excellent films that represent disturbing surrealistic filmmaking at its bestbr br on the other hand when svankmajer attempts to make a political statement of any kind youre advised to leave the room in a hurry svankmajers films in this vein tend to be both adolescent and preachy presenting strawman caricatures in repetitious fashion to express his pseudobrilliant insightsbr br lunacy unfortunately is very much this latter type of movie cartoonish ideas and characters are stretched paperthin for an appalling two hours there are a few moments that briefly hold interest but these few oases are separated by vast deserts of boredombr br if you found svankmajers dreadful monotonous short film et cetera brilliant and hilarious youll probably love lunacy if youve never seen a svankmajer film before please start elsewhere
