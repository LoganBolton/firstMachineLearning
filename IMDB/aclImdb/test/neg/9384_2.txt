talk about creepy if you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was in firefly later on gets kidnapped theres entertainment for you but only if you like this sort of thing i dont so i thought to be frank this episode was appalling thankfully its one of a few duff episodes in season 3 and the only charles grant craig episode so you dont get much of this sort of thing in season 3 so overall verdict just read the summary at the top this is a strong contender hell money says hi for worst episode of season 3 to be honest though i hadnt really expected much i wish i could oubliette this episode altogether thats one thing they got right the title
