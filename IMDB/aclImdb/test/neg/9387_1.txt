with nbcs thank god youre here the network may be trying to replicate the successes of abcs improv sitcom whos line is it anyway in which host drew carey would judge the performances of a handful of cast regulars asked to improvise scenes of some kind in the nbc show dave foley and cohost dave alan grier oversee a handful of notable comedians who must improvise their way through various scenes which all begin with thank god youre here it takes itself far too seriously why must viewers be repeatedly reminded that the actors have never seen the sets before both cohosts seem less then enthused after watching the continuously subpar unfunny attempts by the actors to solicit some laughs i am left wondering whether the live audience is genuinely laughing at what transpires or whether they too are improvising expect this time slot filler to be a very shortlived one
