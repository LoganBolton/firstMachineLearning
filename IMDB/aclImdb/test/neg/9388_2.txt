on the positive ill say its pretty enough to be watchable on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen long whiny and pointless and im not saying this to be mean i really wanted to like this film it seemed to have everything going for it had the so called buzz and was a hassle to track down besides had a little more effort gone into it on the story side i believe this wouldve been amazing and i expect the team behind it will produce wonderful work in the future they clearly have the ability but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go
