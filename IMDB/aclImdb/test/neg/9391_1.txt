got to confess right up front that i didnt watch this entire movie i missed the first hour during a sci fi channel broadcast or was i spared the first hour the other reviewers sum this one up nicely it was badly conceived badly scripted badly actedbr br but the worst thing for me was the adr the entire film which appeared to have been dubbed sounded like it was done in somebodys garage there was a voluminous echo to the words which just served to make the bad dialog hang and hang and hang even a made for tv movie should have recognized thisbr br and the idea that alternate dimensions are differentiated by color saturation went out in the 80s folks
