this movie was thoroughly unwholesome unsettling and unsatisfying apart from a few nice shots of italy theres nothing to recommend this movie as usual hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a fractured existencethe next guy you meet whom you sleep with after knowing for a few hours he must be mr right as for humor there is some in the movie but i cant see how anyone could possibly label this a romantic comedy since about threequarters of the movie is totally depressing my recommendation skip it in the theaters wait till it comes out on dvd then skip it there also i want someone to give me back the two hours i wasted watching this dreck drivel dross
