diane lane is beautiful and sexy and tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and thats being generous the story line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolvingbr br set in lets say a suburb of newark the plot would be deemed ridiculous all that saves the movie are the tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in florence and positano and a film of the whilethesunsinksslowlyinthewest variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest locales in all the world
