ridiculous nauseating doggerel with terrible acting ineptly superficially and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clich√©s about tuscany and italy divorce and midlife the main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug selfcongratulatory selfpity the worthless character and script call for im sure the book was bad but it cant have been this bad the camera is permanently fitted with a vomityellow tuscan lense filter perhaps the tuscan sun wasnt tuscan enough which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to rome and how imaginative the amalfi coast youve never seen the white marble of romes vittorio emmanuelle monument looking so yellow i mean tuscan one of the worst movies ever and therefore quite worth a look
