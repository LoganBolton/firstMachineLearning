i quite enjoyed the wrecking crew 1999 which was the last of the three films in this series the first being urban menace 1999 which ive yet to see i know it was baaaaad but the three leads did a pretty decent job all things consideredbr br this however was truly atrocious icet was dreadful and hes the producer cant say ive ever heard of silkk the shocker who apparently never learnt how to spell but his performance was one of the worst ive ever seen in a moviebr br miss jones did pretty well in her small role though she later went on to make some atrocious racist jokes on her radio show after the se asian tsunami plus other occasions sadly way to go girlbr br noone else comes out with any credit strangely tj storm and ernie hudson who are both pretty bad here are far better in the wrecking crew which was made along with urban menace at the same time as corrupt how that works i dont knowbr br im going to try the icet commentary now to see whether he apologises for the film or tries to make us think its a great piece of filmmaking
