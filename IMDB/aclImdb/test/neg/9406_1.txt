another entry in the pacinoasmentor subgenre you know the drill young hotshot with hubristic flaw in this case matthew mcconaughey trying to jumpstart a flagging career by latching onto pacinos coattails  hey it worked for keanu and colin didnt it is discovered by glamorous and delightfully corrupt father figure pacino natch young hotshot learns from father figure all the insandouts of a lucrative yet degrading career this time its football handicapping father figure plies young hotshot with money and hookers and power but we all know that this decadent state of affairs is on a collision course with dissolution and despair    that is until the young hotshot finds his moral center by rejecting the father figure and all or almost all that he stands for clearly stones wall street pretty much set the ground rules for the pacinoasmentor subgenrebr br we are also meant to take these latterday pacino films as a parallel to reality again you know the drill livinglegend actor demonstrates his unquestioned superiority as compared to an inferior young actor the latter may bear and grin through the process but he must recognize that he isnt going to get any of the good lines much less get a chance to chew major scenery before the denouement now it must be said that there are actually two good movies in the pacinoasmentor canon scent of a woman and donnie brasco in the former case it was a oneman show anyway in the latter case pacino had met his match as a scenestealer in the person of johnny depp however those two movies were seriousminded not merely an exercise in showboating for showboatings sake pacino has made damn certain that his younger costars in the films since brasco are nowhere near as charismatic as depp by the way none of this speaks very well about the livinglegend actor like his contemporary de niro pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels two for the money is the worst example yet worse even than devils advocate which at least had the virtues of featuring a naked connie nielsen and being chronologically prior to this movie well this is what happens when youre crowned king too damn early  just ask marlon brando frankly ive seen one too many al pacino films with the same plot  and the same overacting from the star  to be charitable any longer did i say none of this speaks well actually its humiliating for everyone involved including the paying audience no ones going to accuse matthew mcconaughey of being a shakespearean actor but even he doesnt deserve the role of secondfiddle to this intolerable old showoff with the added implication that he mcconaughey will never measure up to the greatness that is albr br ive not wasted space on the plot particulars if you want a synopsis imdb provides a nononsense summary though i think i laid out a fairly comprehensive summary in my opening paragraph basically youve seen this movie before many times the particular milieu in two for the money is the seedy world underworld really of sports handicapping pacino runs an office of bet advisers  that is middlemen between you and your bookie  and even has a cable tv handicapping show cohosted with several of his top guys one thing the movie got right was the sleaziness of these type of shows    but one detail they got dead wrong was the constant use of the words gamble and gambling if youve ever seen proline or other shows of similar ilk youll never never hear jim feist and his cohorts say the word gamble they ask you to call their 1900 number to get their picks    but if you were from say mars youd have no idea what you were supposed to do with those picks gamble is the fword on sportshandicapping tv shows  strictly verbotenbr br gambling is against the law you knowbr br 1 star out of 10
