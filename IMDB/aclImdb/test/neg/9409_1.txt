for all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie another payday in la for any audience hoping for a fair return for the price of admission a huge waste of time and money the saddest aspect of this ugly exercise to me is that we are watching an extremely talented actor pacino seemingly playing a parody of himself thats what remained with me as a total mystery i can fully understand the need for movie industry people to work and thus make a living what i fail to comprehend is an artist of al pacinos talent prostituting and embarrassing himself with this level of mindless junk hopefully hell choose projects of better value in the futureand for value save your time and hard earned money skip this lets send hollywood and al a message
