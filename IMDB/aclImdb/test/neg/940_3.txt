i wasnt so impressed with this film finding it quite tiresome and plain the plot line was interesting a kid creating his own college and enrolling hundreds of kids but the laughs were few and far between the jokes werent really funny and i didnt bust a gut at any of the scenes the characters werent intriguing and i didnt feel for any of them even the dawky fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group it was a good first watch but it didnt blow me away and its not one that i would recommend comparing it to other films in the same genre ie american pie is just cruel because there is a film which was laughaplenty this accepted failed to raise a smile
