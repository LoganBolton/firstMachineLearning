this movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible the plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end i wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest penbr br normally i dont write reviews but i was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got while i admit that the acting was okay at some parts the scripts deficiencies more than outweighed the decent acting the only reason i watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made judging by the trailer we were not disappointed in the least its only saving grace is that it contained my new favorite pickup linebr br brandon i just want to get to know youbr br girl you just want to get into my pantsbr br brandon i want to get into your mind your heart your soul i dont see you wearing any pants in this equationbr br overall i would rate this movie as the worst movie i ever saw that took itself seriously
