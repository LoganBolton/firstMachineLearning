i didnt have much high hopes for this one before seeing it the story yelled stereotype at mebr br i mean come on its so stupid the plot line about the innocent android that realizes that the people who created him are immoral then decides to change everythingbr br i had to see it three times the first two times i fell asleep because i was so incredibly bored by it its very rare that movies bore me so much i fall asleep during them the third time i forced myself to watch it simply to be able to warn people about itbr br i got the distinct impression that the people responsible for this mess had tried to take all the coolneat things from other scifiaction movies and put them together to make a kickass movie they took the androidrobot lots of action thin story stereotype characters and a big fight in the end and threw it together unfortunately the movie sucks the acting is so wooden you could build a house out of it the storylineplot is absolutely laughable the camerawork and editing is horrid the direction is nonexistent and to top it all off everything is so cliche and ridiculous that it just annoys the hell out of youbr br i was left with the feeling that i couldve spent the time watching this one doing something much more creative like trimming my fingernails or watching the grass grow
