mario van peebles tries to go the jeanclaude van damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes awol to preserve himself however the government isnt going to take this lying down so among the simplistic plot van peebles protects villagers from the rebel forces and defeats a improved version of himself in this disappointing film this blatant rip off of universal soldier which is far more fun then this simply goes nowhere the main problem is that the movie is so unbelievably inert van peebles just waits around and there just isnt enough asskicking to justify a viewing on the other hand the movie does sort of resemble a competent version of rotor although where as that abysmal bad movie was hilarious this one only yields occasional laughter in its laughably unconvincing action sequences also like rotor it makes no sense in its narrative and basically the movie is awesomely boring plus the villains are disappointingly weak and basically the movie needs an actual action scenario to work because the material is too dull in all regards solo is a very weak filmbr br 12 out of 4poor
