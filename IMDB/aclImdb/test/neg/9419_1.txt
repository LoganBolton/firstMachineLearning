i had the dubious opportunity to view this movie on tv its the perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst films ever made not only is the acting bad and the effects terrible the movie has more logical holes than ten pounds of imported swiss cheesebr br i would highly recommend this film as an example of how not to make a movie and what director not to use in one of yoursbr br i turned off the tv during the last ten hideous minutes of the show calling it pathetic is a gross understatement
