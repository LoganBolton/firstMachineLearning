solo starts as a team of us soldiers go into soth america to blow up a rebel airstrip joining them is a robot named solo mario van peebles who can use any weapon ever made is fifteen times stronger  ten times faster than any human being something goes wrong though  solo refuses to kill innocent civilians which colonel frank madden william sadler isnt happy about back at base  general haynes barry corbin orders solo to be shut down  reprogrammed one of solos main directives is self preservation so decides to escape back into the south american jungles where colonel madden  his men are sent in to recapture itbr br this mexican american coproduction was directed by norberto barba  one has to say solo is awful the script by david corley was based on the novel weapon by robert mason  is one clich√© after another robots were popular at the time solo was made in hollywood  at the boxoffice so solo ripoffs the likes of robocop 1987 universal soldier 1992  the two terminator flicks as well as having the same setting  basic story as predator 1987 this is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people at first he doesnt know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions  starts to befriend people sounds like terminator 2 judgment day 1991 to me the characters are poor  colonel madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating solo at all  why he would kill other us soldiers  disobey orders to destroy it you know i saw this on cable telly last night for free thank god i didnt spend any money on it  i looked it up in the tv guide  do you know what it said my tv guide described solo as a dire scifi action starring mario van peebels which when i think about it is a perfect description of solo in less than ten words my tv guide has hit the nail on the head i mean its a scifi action film it certainly stars mario van peebles  its definitely dire enough said reallybr br director barba doesnt do anything particularly special here  the action scenes lack any real excitement  the scifi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact solo is a robot so the military lose solo  colonel madden is sent in to recapture it right im not being funny but wouldnt the military have put a self destruct mechanism inside solo in case something like that happened surely at the very least solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time im not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self destruct device might be useful if anything went wrong the violence is mild there are a few ok fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff reallybr br technically the film looks alright  is competently made it was actually shot in mexico the makers of the dolph lundgren action flick agent red 2000 edited footage from solo into that film the acting is poor van peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot william sadler deserves better than this it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic die hard 2 die harder 1990br br solo is a really bad scifi action flick which is basically a huge ripoff of big budget hollywood scifi action films like robocop universal soldier  the terminator films not recommend  im going to start  pay more attention to my tv guide when it comes to choosing films to watch
