the novel weapon which serves as the basis for this atrocious piece of garbage is one of the best technothrillers to come down the pike in a long timethe character of solo who is not supposed to look like a human is a wonderful creation and it was simply awful to see him reduced to just another terminatorclone with mario van peebles horrendously trying to act like a robot there is nothing worthwhile about this filmbr br why does hollywood insist on snapping up the rights to excellent novels and then butchering them there are so many things wrong with solo that listing them seems as unfair as inviting a man with no legs to a brisk game of hopscotch avoid this awful film and seek out the 2 novels by robert mason that feature the awesome character of solo the books are weapon and an excellent sequel solobut dont pay any attention to this awful dreck of a film
