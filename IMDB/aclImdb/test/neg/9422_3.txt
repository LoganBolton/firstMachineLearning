solo is an action movie about a terminatorlike android that is constructed and trained for the military when a flaw is discovered he is issued to be deprogrammed rather than face death he chooses to flee into the jungles of central america where he takes refuge in a village the military chases him into there leading into a big action feastbr br mario van peebles does a decent performance the android his movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero and it works out the action scenes arent that spectacular but they arent all too bad either the acting from the other characters is pretty bad but i was not expecting anything too good the special effects were decent as wellbr br solo is decent as an action flick but very forgettable it lacks the substance that most movies possess but if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking this will get the job done
