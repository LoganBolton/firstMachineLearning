i was told about this film from a friend who saw it late night during the week he told me it was so bad that i had to see it so i went on an auction site and bought the film this is probably the worst film i have ever seen it makes you laugh when it really shouldnt terrible acting and terrible storyline plus he looks nothing like michael jacksonbr br i still recommend buying this film as its one of the funniest things you will ever see van peebles is a joke in this filmbr br robots cant bluff psychebr br i have to say though the special effects are actually amazing psyche dvds were probably even out when this film came out but if i had my way it would be a straight to vhs release yes people it is that bad
