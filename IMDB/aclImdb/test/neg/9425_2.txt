firstly let me make it clear that i love aircraft and usually any film with them in is worth watching  and ive sat through some shocking ones however the same is not true of this film james stewart is an excellent actor but he is wasted in this strategic air command promotional film the acting is mediocre and the direction is weak i had to stop watching this awful rubbish about half way through this was despite some really good maybe even the best aerial photography the trouble is even for an aviation nut like me making something out of the shocking aircraft featured b36 and b47 just grates on the nerves too much its a shame that the film wasnt made when the b52 appeared then the superlatives used for the aircraft in this film would have been valid then i might have been able to sit through it perhaps im missing the point of the film which may be the angst suffered by loved ones while their beloved are on active duties in any case it could have been done much better recommendation well worth missing
