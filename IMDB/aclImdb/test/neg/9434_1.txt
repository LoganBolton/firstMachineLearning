can there be a worst film even ed wood at his horrific worst couldnt come up with something this bad cheesy stupid longwinded preposterousand those are the good points i saw this trash back in the early 80s when i was incredibly bored to begin with and actually sat through the entire thing without blowing my brains out although that probably would have been a more pleasant experience i actually remembered it because it was so bad it makes me sad in a way because some of the best directors got their start by making tv movies ie spielberg and it was a wonderful way for them to get their initial material before the public but crap like this just totally killed the entire process
