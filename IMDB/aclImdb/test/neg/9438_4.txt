i know this film was shown on local tv when i was a kid but i cant remember whether i watched it or not seeing it now considering how utterly forgettable it is i still dont know  so i counted it as a first viewing there have been several films featuring the title character a creation of visionary french author jules verne these include 20000 leagues under the sea 1954 with james mason in the role master of the world 1961 vincent price mysterious island 1961 herbert lom captain nemo and the underwater city 1969 robert ryan and the mysterious island of captain nemo 1973 omar sharifbr br this version stars academy award winner jose ferrer however even if the premise itself isnt halfbad  awakened from suspended animation in his submarine the nautilus and finding himself in modern times nemo adopts all his ingenuity to aid the us navy in defeating megalomaniac scientist burgess meredith  it emerges as easily his most infantile adventure yet for instance five seconds into the film merediths assistant  donning a steel mask  rants that the world shall be ours equally hilarious are the zealous gesticulations of the similarly deckedout midget whose task it is to fire the professors allimportant delta beam  and how about those androidtype minions aboard merediths vessel who never seem to do much of anything br br ferrer manages to maintain his dignity throughout but meredith is an embarrassment in what is virtually a retread of his penguin characterization from the 1960s batman tv series and film where the budget was so tight  mostly invested in bland production design and shoddy special effects no doubt and both evidently influenced by star wars 1977  that apparently they couldnt even afford him a decent costume he looks positively idiotic wearing a tie in a sub the supporting cast includes mel ferrer playing a saboteur in the vein of joan fontaine from another irwin allen production voyage to the bottom of the sea 1961 and who engages in a swashbuckling routine with his namesake inside the engineroom of the nautilus lynda day george unsurprisingly shes the only female character around and horst buchholz as the king of atlantis  for whatever reason nemo is obsessed with locating the famed lost continentbr br by the way having been reduced from a threepart miniseries for theatrical exhibition the film obviously feels choppy  though one is still able to discern where one episode ended and another began
