let me start by saying that theres really no reason to watch this movie i only sat through it because i was trying to kill some time before going to workbr br basically its your typical sophomoric comedy aimed at the teenage set theres nothing remarkable about it other than the complete ridiculousness of the story not to mention that there are plot holes big enough to sail a carnival cruiseliner through obviously this isnt supposed to be a realistic movie its supposed to be funny sadly it mostly fails on that count as well i must admit that i laughed a few times but mainly in a holy sht i cant believe how stupid this is kind of waybr br if you never see this movie youre not missing a thing
