i watch a ton of movies and enjoy the occasional b movie but this movie was awful aside from the homemade quality of the film it was very slow and seemed to make no point im only commenting bc of another comment i saw here that said it was great wow maybe ok to watch on a rainy day when nothing else is availablebr br the characters were disjointed and didnt fit any discernible pattern of reality the dialog between characters was forced and at times very confusingbr br i guess if you were very into the whole area 51 and understood some of the nuances other comments reference it may be good  but for me  the average joe  i dont get it
