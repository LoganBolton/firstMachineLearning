i watched this because of the description and cover art and yet again was deceivedi am getting sick of all these new stupid straight to dvd horror moviesonce in a blue moon 1 will be ok it started out with a confusing scene and then jumped 30 years and showed a couple one night during a thunderstorm which was ok because i like storms and it set a nice moodthen it turned into a cool road trip where they ended up at a diner encountering bizarre peoplethe rest got weird and then got confusingi did watch it til the end but was even more confused when it ended so badlyi had higher hopes for this movie but it was more like a science fiction then horror and something that should have been made for tv
