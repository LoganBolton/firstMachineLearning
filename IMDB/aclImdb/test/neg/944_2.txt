seriously i dont understand how justin long is becoming increasingly popular he either has the best agent in hollywood or recently sold his soul to satan he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing the only film that he has attempted to anchor that ive remotely enjoyed was waiting and that is almost solely because ive worked in a restaurant but i digress aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim his one liners were funny on occasion but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable if you just want to completely turn your brain off or better yet dont have one then maybe youd enjoy this but i cant recommend it at all
