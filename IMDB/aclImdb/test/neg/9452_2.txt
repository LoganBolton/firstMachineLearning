a really terrible movie really lowbudget with terrible acting a convoluted and inane plot a modest reworking of the vampire tales mixed with modern sciencebr br the result is a total mess without meaning for most parts with very limited and cheap effects it is not even fun like several of the low budget independent movies of this kindbr br a waste of time
