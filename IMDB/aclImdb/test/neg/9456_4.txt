ouch what a mess we have here not so much of a mess as a painfully dull halfassed excuse for exploitation brought to you by the one and only j g pat patterson yeah the same one from moonshine mountain doctor gore formerly known as the body shop is i guess somewhat inspired by frankenstein and god knows what else the late mr patterson also stars in this joke as a heartbroken scientistplastic surgeon who has recently lost his wife in a car accident and is driven insane from grief to the point that it becomes clear that the next step is to slaughter countless females then maybe rob a few graves for body parts in order to put together the perfect mate it wont be easy but thank goodness his pal gregg the hunchback is available to lend a hand and to offer moral supportbr br if proof was ever needed that some peoples goals are not meant to be accomplished here it is gang this patterson hayseed obviously never had any business directing anything much less following in the footsteps of good ol h g as a master of gore ive never seen a gore movie that just flatout refuses to give the viewer a single reason to keep watching even the gore is boring almost remotely humorous at times but impossible to tell whether its intentional or not i pick notbr br shot in charolotte north carolina home of the california axe massacre on most likely a 3digit budget by a guy as untalented as he may have been who probably had an appreciation for drivein trash so maybe we should give good ol j g a break i mean he tried i assume which is more that can be said for most and this movie is better than any of the bigbudget superhero garbage the theaters put out these days although i realize that isnt saying much besides doctor gore is quite the improvement over pattersons previous failure the electic chair so its slightly possible he would have improved his craft in time had he not died so maybe its not all that terrible especially compared to the other movie on the dvd how to make a doll so what the hell check it out 410
