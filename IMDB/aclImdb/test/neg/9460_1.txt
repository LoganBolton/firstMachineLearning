before i saw this movie i believed there were two kinds of bad cinema 1 your average completely uninspired fare ie constantine and 2 the work that is charmingly bad or sobadits good a la manos the hands of fate now that ive seen dr gore i know there is a third kind of bad movie the utter crap sandwich that will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory a work that is mindbendingly execrable anathemabr br i have hated certain films before but ive never hated a film so much that my loathing reached its threshhold and became self loathing have you seen a movie that not only makes you regret losing the hour you spent watching it but makes you grieve for another hour after that mystery science theatre disciples beware this is soulsucking cinema go rent circle of iron or the killer shrews instead
