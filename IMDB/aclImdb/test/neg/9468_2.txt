a couple of clarifying comments are in order herschell gordon lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of doctor gore aka the body shop wherein he touched upon his collaborative efforts with jg pat patterson director and star of doctor gore patterson concocted the gore effects for the gruesome twosome and a few other lewis movies in the late 60s lewis remarks that whereas 2000 maniacs was a five gallon film referring to the amount of stage blood required the lewispatterson productions were fifteen gallon pictures lewis does not describe doctor gore as a fifteen gallon film  hes only talking about the films he  patterson made together lewis has confessed elsewhere that his introduction to doctor gore was improvised before hed even seen pattersons film so take it with a grain of salt br br this may be an unfinished film but like some unfinished novels it does have an ending its just missing some connective tissue br br patterson has definite stage presence  a dry sense of humor helping to make this simplistic show somewhat more watchable than it should be theres an extremely barebones plot  even blood feast is more complex  and a gratingly repetitive musical score by william girdler a bit of nudity  lots of skin the entire middle section of the film involves the construction of a perfect woman this is concentrated gore for the bloodthirsty and laughable br br patterson the director is in way over his head but he tries hard to tell his story creatively if its possible to use frankenstein clich√©s creatively but the best reason to see this film on something weirds dvd if possible is that it features a perfect nashville weeper bill hicks a heart dies every minute aint it the truth
