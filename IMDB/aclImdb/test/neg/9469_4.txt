telly savalas put on a passable but no better than that performance as pancho villa the notorious mexican banditrevolutionary in this account of villas raid on the town of columbus new mexico in 1916 villa is not really a historical figure who im overly familiar with so i wont say much about the historical details of the film as a movie this isnt great although it has a smattering here and there of both action and humour chuck connors performance as colonel wilcox commander of the us army base near columbus struck me as a bit over the top and clint walker as villas gringo sidekick scotty didnt really do very much for me the movie is obviously a pretty low budget effort of limited technical quality for a movie with a runtime of only slightly over an hour and a half i have to say that this movie dragged in places particularly in the last 20 minutes or so villas raid into the united states was an interesting if in the overall scheme of things not especially important historical sidebar and probably deserved better treatment than this 410
