synopsis kid is not accepted into any colleges he creates a college where he and his friends can party by using their parents tuition money br br wow a paean to ignorance br br if you believe that were all ok man then this movie is for you furthermore you must understand thatbr br 1 kids have it all inside themthey just need to let it outbr br 2 teaching really stifles the innate creativity that everyone is born with br br 3 someone else should pay for you to follow your passion br br 4 300 teenagers can live together in harmony as long as you take away those restrictive rules br br 5 extemporaneous speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation br br 6 if the board of education allows you to open a charter school with nontraditional teaching techniques its because they have your best interests at heart not that they are willing to let go of lowfunctioning students who will end up working fast food anyways br br this movie is one in the college comedy genre ie animal house it follows the pattern pretty closely whats new here though is a complete attack on higher education not a parody of the bad elements its missing the sympathetic insider a professor who embodies the worthwhile part of university life br br this lack of balance will doom this film to the back rows of blockbuster it is so one sided that i wondered if it was an ironic selfreferential take on the whole genrefor about one minute the movie has no deep meaning no layers no introspection its as if they let some kids who never went to class do what comes naturally and what is natural is what the name of the school is s br br never thought id say this go see something with will farrell instead his comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated
