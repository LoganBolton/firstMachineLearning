this movie was definitely on the boring side the acting was decent and the film looks pretty nice the soundtrack is definitely for fans of kenny g and michael bolton speaking of the soundtrack i found it very ironic that a film about telling the truth and not stealing decided to use a song in its titles that was a blatant ripoff of paul simons you can call me al  except that they dont acknowledge it at all isnt there something a little hypocritical there the scene that the main kid was in where he was mimicking a game show host was my favorite 10 lines i have to write ten lines about this movie to be included what a ripoff i dont think its too fair to force people to write more than they would just to get it included
