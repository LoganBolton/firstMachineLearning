this movie was alright marykate and ashley play twin sisters sorry for stating the obvious who against their will are sent to paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something like thatbr br right away two french boys who looked slightly inbred start talking to them and taking interest blah blah blah its an olsen twin movie  we already know whats going to happen between them anyway along with that the twins meet a fabulous french model because theyre in paris the fashion capital of the world they make bffs with the model and spend a fun montage of shopping in the city of lights yepbr br plotwise i frankly cant remember what happened i guess that could say something but hey its an olsen movie olsen movie seems to be synonymous with light entertainmentbr br overall this movie was annoying i mean can i really identify at all with two girls who are devastated upon hearing that theyre going to paris really also the jokes really werent that funny however i watched the whole movie so it had to be somewhat entertaining the fact that it was set in paris was what probably kept me watching
