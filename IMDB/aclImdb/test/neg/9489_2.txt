i saw this at my inlaws house one night when it popped up on tv and my motherinlaw said it was one of her favorite movies well she can have itbr br look i can enjoy a chick flick now and then as long as its good but this ones extrasappy unrealistic and just plain predictable despite some decent performances from rock hudson and jane wyman its uncanny how quickly a woman can accept having her eyesight taken away from her oh well they say love is blindbr br the neat and tidy happy little ending nearly made me gag too and how often did we need otto kruger repeating the title it happened not once not twice but three times
