daft potboilers dont come much dafter than this but its a douglas sirk movie which makes everything alright except in this case it doesnt based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas he wrote the robe and already filmed in 1935 with irene dunne and robert taylor its got more uplift than a cantilever brabr br rock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight to make amends he takes up medicine becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it no it sint quite that daft he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy in between times they fall in lovebr br try as i might i cant quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of sirks films this one isnt too deep on the plus side rock hudson isnt half bad i think i am rediscovering him and of course it looks great in sirks films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soapopera terms this is definitely daytime tv
