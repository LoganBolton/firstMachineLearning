the revisionist history  making the evil marquis de sade a semiheroic romantic  is mindboggling enough but the atrocious acting amateurish cinematography and terrible dubbing make this film achingly bad the only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the film are gorgeous and amazingly being tortured for days with hands bound overhead apparently doesnt detract from a womans beauty hairstyle and makeup my guess is that the producers filmed mostly in russia choosing women for their looks  and willingness to work cheap  rather than acting ability if you decide to watch this because you have nothing better to do or are a film student looking for bad examples fastforward through every scene not involving nudity
