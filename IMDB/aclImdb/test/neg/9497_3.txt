i love ustinovs distinctive literate narration and the photography is quiet nice we put the film on for our 35 year old who sort of wandered in and out of the room so for our first viewing we only saw about 13 of the movie and were quite charmed when we rewatched sitting down for family timewe were all mortified at the violence and lifethreatening situations the poor otter got into about halfway through the movie theres a rack of dead bloody furry animals lots of blood not just a little then at the end theres a wild struggle with a dog then blood clouds the water youd think given the g rating thats all youll seethat they will imply one of the animals died nope they drag the carcass out of the water and show it plainly for several traumatizing seconds personally as an adult i love horror movies and am fine with violent movies ala scorsese cronenberg tarantino heck i love the ultra violent battle royale but those arent kid movies and dont advertise themselves as such if you are deliberately raising your young ones to see the harsh realities of life for cute animals then this is the movie for you if you are like me and my wife though you might want to spare your child nightmares and avoid this one
