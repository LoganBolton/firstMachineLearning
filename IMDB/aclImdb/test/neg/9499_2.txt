i dont know where to begin perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen there is nothing slightly humorous about a kidnapping i dont know what was more offensivethe subject matter or david arquettes performance it was like watching a bull get its penis cut off although i think the bull felt better afterwards the filmmakers should find something about sinatra other than his sons kidnapping to show like i dont know his talent as a singer his family shouldnt have to relive that horror thank god it was just shown on hbo and not released in theaters please dont watch this if you have any self respect
