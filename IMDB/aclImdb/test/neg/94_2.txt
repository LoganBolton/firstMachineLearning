the most positive points in this film were the credits text style and some moments in icets acting the storyline two rival gangs having to fight it out with the subplots of betrayal power and change are well worn plots but in this case painfulvery to wade through the decrepit scenery which added slight believability in places and questionable lighting constantly distracted from any interestidentification with the characters the shine off of the actresss foreheadnose was blinding not to mention other scenes with the same problem not even half way into the film i wanted to know more about how and why it came about as opposed to what was going on on screen a disappointment if you have seen icet in other roles kudos to other actorsactresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weak direction corrupts side kick and the other restaurant worker
