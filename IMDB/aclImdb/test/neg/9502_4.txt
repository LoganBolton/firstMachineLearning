only light spoilers in herebr br stealing sinatra is a halfslapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers dimwit victims and a few other sidestories thrown in to eat up some timebr br you will see some poor performances all around in this movie the drama is forced and the humor makes no sense whether youre watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who wont shut up or a victims father responding to the criminals death threat with care for some tea none of it is believable this quite comfortably fits into the wannabe movie categorybr br you will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie its quite unprofessional and adds nothing its really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat wittybr br however if youre able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief you might be entertained by the adequate storylinebr br i voted 410
