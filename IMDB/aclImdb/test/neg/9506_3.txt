i am partly a fan of miyazakis work i say partly because most of his films fall into two categories brilliant and boring sadly this film falls into the later categorybr br this film suffers from the same fundamental problems as miyazakis recent film howls moving castle an intriguing premise is set up but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain itbr br the first third of the film reveals the postapocalyptic world the story is set in and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold from then on things go down hill the middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinlyveiled ecopropaganda and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of japanese animated filmsbr br overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators what is left is something which is visually stunning although sadly the version i saw was an nthgeneration copy with poor colour  which gives rise to the common myth that nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused
