franco zeffirellis the taming of the shrew romeo and juliet jesus of nazareth othello third stab at transferring shakespeare to the screen works very well with the casting of mel gibson mad max lethal weapon and prethe passion of the christ notoriety in the role formerly owned by sir laurence olivier and rightly so see my review on his hamlet arguably the best interpretation of one of the bards timeless and most quoted tragedies and redone 5 years later by kenneth branagh as a fullbloodied treatment explaining its 3 hour 22 minute running time combined with a dream cast and a lot of little additions which were wellchosen and expertly done by the contemporary master of william shakespeare kenneth branagh the director of henry v and dead again joining the lethal weapon star are glenn close the big chill paul scofield a man for all seasons alan bates ian holm michael maloney who would be cast as roderigo opposite kenneth branagh and laurence fishburne in oliver parkers othello see my review of oliviers stage version of the tragedy though he only starred in it and who branagh would cast as laertes in his 3hour version of hamlet a proper homage to sir laurence olivier and his classic version of the play see my review on that one as well 5 years later nathaniel parker who would be cast as cassio in his brothers version of othello 4 years later and helena bonhamcarter who would be cast in mary shelleys frankenstein 4 years later br br zeffirelli intended this movie as a homage to sir laurence olivier who had died 2 years prior to this movie and it works pretty well for the most part what i was slightly uncomfortable with was zeffirellis misplacing a lot of lines and in one scene he gives one of hamlets lines to the ghost also helena bonhamcarter did not convince me as ophelia she was too dull and unreal whereas jean simmons who had immortalized the role in oliviers version and kate winslet who did an acceptable job in kenneth branaghs uncut epic revisionist reworking of hamlet were good in the role with jean simmons being the best ophelia ever thats why she was nominated for best actress in 1948 she didnt winwhat a shame ian holm said his lines too quickly not slowly as i expected him to in a scene with him laertes and ophelia but then again im more used to felix aylmer and richard briers interpretations of the role and i think that they did better jobs than holm in their respective versions of hamlet both done by great directors actors texteditors producers and stars of all their versions of the bards work as polonius br br the rest of the cast however was excellent the scene where hamlet confronts his mother was very well done but olivier and branagh heightened the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and suspense that the scene required br br i recommend this version just to pass the time but its ideal as a teaching tool for 12thgrade english teachers i recommend showing oliviers version first then branaghs and finally this version despite the films pg rating there was really nothing objectionable in the movie only what the play called for br br the best versions of hamlet are br br 1 sir laurence olivier and kenneth branagh both were so good that i cant decide which one was the best see my reviews on these versions for more information br br 2 franco zeffirelli this one was alright it started out alright with a scene not in the play but shouldve then progressed to the actual beginning of the play where a guard cries out whos there nay answer me stand and unfold yourself that scene scares the hell out of you because youre sitting quietly and thenbam you almost jump out of your skin in short that scene sets the tone for the rest of the play huge blunder on zeffirellis part to omit that scene it also misplaced a lot of lines and cut others that i think shouldve been put in such as the line where hamlet says to ophelia get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners that line was supposed to have occurred in that scene not where it was placed in the film after the to be or not to be soliloquy this version struggles between cutting out too much or too little from an excellent piece of literature kenneth branagh would remedy that 5 years later with his uncut version of the tragedy making his version a more fitting homage to sir laurence olivier as several of the actors aside from him had performed hamlet on stageor on film many times on different occasions however zeffirellis take on hamlet is faithful to the play and thats what i was looking for the setup for the final act duel was the same as in olivier and branaghs versions only that the denouement in branaghs version was more violent than the denouement of the previous two faithful versions more in line with the play olivier toned it downand it worked equally well and stuck more closely to the play with branagh throwing in a few harmless touches of his ownto very good effect br br this version is not rated
