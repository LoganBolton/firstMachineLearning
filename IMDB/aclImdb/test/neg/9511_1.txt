it is one of the joys of shakespeare that there can be no definitive performances  no single performance can be right but some can be wrong and this one is there are at least two things about hamlet which cannot be dispensed with 1 his indecisiveness and inability to take any kind of action for gods sake that is what makes the play last as long as it does if you had othello there instead of hamlet claudius would be dead by the end of act one any production has to try to explain why hamlet delays why he is incapable of action 2 his sexual disgust his total revulsion at the thought of what his mother and uncle get up to in bed fill him with an utter disgust for all things sexual and this means that any kind of relationship with ophelia is impossible at the slightest hint of sex hamlet throws up so what does mel gibson give us lusty actionman you could not get further from the character of hamlet if you tried there are lots of ways hamlet can be played but this isnt one of them what i dont understand is since they managed to get such good actors for the other parts  claudius polonius and so on why couldnt they find one to play hamlet as well mark rylance in the part would have made this a great film this mel gibson whoever he is completely let down the rest of the cast and lets face it hamlet without the prince really doesnt work
