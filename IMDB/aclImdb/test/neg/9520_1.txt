what a selfindulgent mess duncan roys film is apparently autobiographical however its impossible to find any glimmer of emotional truth in this chaotic badly acted and woefully amateurish fiascobr br in a way you have to admire the balls of a man who through grim determination and a very generous benefactor manages to make a film about his own rise and fall  from abused working class lad to criminal english lord however the tone is either so selfpitying or so arch that its impossible to engage with either characters or plot the raw material is potentially great stuff however roy seems unable to tease out the kind of tale that should grab you by the throat then move you to tears and its a complete mystery why it was ever made to be screened as a triptych of images  presumably because a single image would have been too tedious to watchbr br its also interesting to see so many otherwise good actors  bill nighy diana quick lindsay coulson  giving careerworst performances
