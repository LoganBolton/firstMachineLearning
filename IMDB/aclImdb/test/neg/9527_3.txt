the story as i understand is based on real events that can be either good or bad depending on what sort of license is taken with those real events and how they are renderedbr br in this case the results are enough to gag a maggot i wasnt expecting much going in  anticipating a story of rich highschool kids taking an ocean cruise under a stern skipper that is what i figured was a comingofage movie along the lines of something about boot camp or basic training the kind in which the drill sergeant says my duty is to snap you out of your winsome civilian ways well it is that in a way the kids start out as kids and end up as an organic group but this is far hokier than any bootcamp movie ive ever seen outside of a deliberate comedy who wrote this thing the air is filled with slogans that belong not in high school but in the third grade the dialog offends the earbr br jeff bridges usually does a betterthanaverage job but in this case his performance is mediocre he brings nothing extra to the part although given his lines its hard to know how he could do much with them the rest of the cast is undistinguished and a few of the kids are painfully inadequate theres a lot of tearing up and considerable crying the best scene involves a dolphinbr br the immature clich√©s continue to the very end the coast guard is cast in the role of the hardhearted court at the hearing that follows the disaster the interrogator does nothing but hit bridges over the head with his misinterpretations and misconstruction of events you let the crew drink alcohol didnt you a couple of harmless drinks and you didnt punish them though you punished them for killing a fish the dolphin business the technical details surrounding the sinking are left murky what is a white squall anyway and if its as dangerous as bridges claims why werent the whole crew alerted and wearing life vests but why go on if the albatross were a dreadnaught it would still be torpedoed and sunk by the ludicrous comicbook script
