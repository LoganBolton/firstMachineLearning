i like bad films but this thing is a steaming heap from the shaky cameramen to the horrible sound and devastating acting dont waste a second on this pile fifth graders could have made a better film and first graders could have written a better script want a real synopsis ugly chicks in neon bikinis dancing for way too long a disjointed plot made worse by hideous acting the onlocation sets werent even passable the church scenes take place in a dance studio and oh yeah  whats with the two tapdance numbers that come up out of the bluebr br oh and the total number of naked breasts which couldnt have even saved this film  0 add this one to the trash heap
