is where im assuming this movie came from i mean ive watched plenty of b movies over the course of my young life so far and i wouldnt even classify this as a b movie i remember seeing films in my high school mass media class that surpass this onebr br so the premise isa bunch of dancing numbers and goofy crap happens women in bikinis who arent even that great looking to begin with dance in the beginning and sing guys with hairy chests show up and girls with fangs who are out in the sunlight i mean i can barely put together a cohesive sentence just thinking about this movie according to most people on this site manos the hands of fate and pod people are the worst movies mst3k classics di used to be one of them then i saw this movie usually i dont try to trash a movie too much but the people who made this really do deserve it it is that bad and that unbearable and im assuming the director or an actor in the movie is the only person who rated this a ten
