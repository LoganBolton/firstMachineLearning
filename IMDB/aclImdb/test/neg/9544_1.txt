i wouldnt recommend this to anyone except cinemagoers who like to laugh at a film not with itbr br quite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film i wont spoil it but basically the most overused set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film everbr br the movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever the attempt at onscreen chemistry between the two lead roles when were presented with a close up of angela jolie stroking denzel washingtons finger lovingly it may be the only thing he could move but quite why the viewer is treated to a zoom of washingtons finger getting stroked amidst the kind of dimmed lights and music appropriate for a sex scene is beyond me i laughed out loud and shook my headbr br the direction of the storyline borrows heavily from se7en but here it is executed far more simplistically and far too obviously to call it a poormans se7en would be an understatement this really is nothing more than a made for tv movie and even jolie and washingtons best efforts cant convince that this is a box office film
