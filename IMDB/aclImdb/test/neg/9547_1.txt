i can envision the writers of this story thinking up this scriptbr br 1lets make a serial killer movie like se7en knight moves copycat and silence of the lambs people like serial killer stuff itll sell 2the killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern i know hell copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel that hasnt been done yet at least not exactly like that 3now we need some kind of way to make this movie unique of course the good guy can be bedridden like in rear window 4lastly we need a twist ending that will give this movie the success of the sixth sense and the usual suspectsbr br okay now that you know these things you know the whole movie so dont waste your money one thing i really hate about moviemakers is that they take a perfectly good concept for movies and completely run them into the ground i wrote better stories than this when i was in junior high i just kept checking my watch every five minutes when the twist ending finally came i wasnt shocked i just said oh who cares the characters are twodimensional they have your typical movie personalities this movie is just proof that stealing the elements of other successful movies is no excuse for a bad script i give this movie 1 out of 10 normally it would earn at least 2 or 3 but im so sick of the unoriginality when will they learn 110
