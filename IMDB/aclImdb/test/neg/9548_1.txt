criticism does mention spoilersbr br i rarely make user comments but this is one movie i have no problem slandering this movie stinks and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp the bone collector is not at all the same calibre of film that silence of the lambs or seven were despite what its ad claims this is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller the pace of this movie was extremely slow i actually left for about 10 minutes halfway through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression i refer to you the part where angelina jolies character debates denzel about cutting off a corpse hands the movie is not at all scary but tries to compensate this with a lovesubplot albeit sexy angelina jolies character and denzel washingtons of course what you get is something comparable to that of the mentorstudent relationship as seen in the brillian epic silence of the lambs with hannibal lecter and starling however even this lacks all effectiveness and i was personally routing for the villain to kill denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two with such a crappy movie i was halfexpecting a plottwist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit things that mediocre movies like arlington road and scream pulled off anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved  a situation which mimicks alfred hitchcocks rear window the cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen esoterically speaking i even think the murderers intention was completely lost as denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial chess game and gets with his pet project angelinabr br if you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts like i am you will not appreciate this film if you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catchup on every single hollywood cliche ever borne the latenight knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer the ridiculous serialkiller to prime investigator relationship the horrible woman trying to get by in an allmale dominated workforce aka sotl  see this moviebut even then its too slowpaced and youd be bored
