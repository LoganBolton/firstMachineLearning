the storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile jolies acting is pretty flat and poor washingtons is ok the rest of the cast are cardboard cutouts somehow almost everything about this film oozes mediocrity the plot is lame the only thing i liked more or less about this film are the fairly original methods the perpetrator uses to end his victims technical details are worse than the most farstretched csi knowledge and gizmos and halfway the movie one wonders if the director even cared about detail credibility some spoilers hereafter i mean an ekg machine with a pure sinus wave reflecting a mans heartbeat a quadriplegic with full body muscle spasms and one working index finger sure a killer gutting a mans bowels whilst keeping him alive to allow the rats to feast on him followed by a rat aiming for the guys face whats with all that stupidity then there are quite a few continuity goofs but you can find those elsewhere here on imdb honestly i found it a bit of an insult even to my limited intelligencebr br waste of time still 4 out of 10 to keep my girlfriend from kicking me
