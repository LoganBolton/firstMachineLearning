i just saw this early this morning on the fox channel quite by accident my dog woke me up  i had seen it years ago and thought i remembered it fairly well as a kid i had enjoyed it but now as another poster commented several of the reels were out of order and while it was disorienting at first and bizarre it seemed to fit the production  what was just awful became surreal and amusing musical numbers for what i think was the big fundraiser showyoure in show business im in show business most of the kids are in show business lets put on a showcome out of nowhere before all the talk about putting on a show and then fade without applause to totally unrelated straight scenes the leading mans girlfriend shows up spits out lines and lines of dialogue then disappears i was half awake and loved every insane minute of it
