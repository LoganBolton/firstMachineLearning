my girlfriend wanted to see this lol this is the case a lotso i rented it then i saw how acclaimed this was nominated for 10 oscars great this should be good ol drama this movie had a lot of potentialthe direction and the way everything was paced was very well but once the movie ended i couldnt help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a film for virginia hill annette bening was extremely annoying i just couldnt tolerate her character at all warren beatty was excellent in the film actingwise but again i just found it hard to have sympathy for his characterhe just came off essentially as a idiotic hotheaded loser of a gangsterwho had no place in the life in the first place howd he get in with the likes of meyer lansky and lucky luciano anyway this film just left me with a bland but uneasy feelingwhat was the big deal with this movie i just didnt feel a completeness with bugsy beattys antics although acted quite well just seemed too random and illogical im guessing thats how siegel really wasbut it was just too much of that there just didnt seem to be much of a real story here my basic assessment of it would be br br a hotheaded playboy underachieving gangster falls in love with a loser of a woman comes up with the idea of las vegasbut his failed attempt at the casino he builds along with having no regard for his mob bosses money gets him killedbr br what else is there besides that i just didnt see the big deal with this and it was a big disappointment there mustve not been many movies to come out in 1991 how this was nominated for 10 oscars is beyond me although the two it won is justifiable 154 stars
