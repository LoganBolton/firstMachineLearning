a tedious gangster film that leaves you wishing someone had edited it farce more ruthlessly i would have thought that the story of the creation of las vegas would prove interesting but it fails at almost every turn warren beattys performance as the stupid and unlikeable bugsy seigel leaves you wishing you were watching someone else once or twice he flashes through the fog of his performance to deliver an interesting scene but most of the time you just cant care about him annette benning gives a skilled turn as his untrustworthy lover but even shes only faintly more savoury than he isbr br i really wouldnt bother with this turgid drama unless youre a benning devotee
