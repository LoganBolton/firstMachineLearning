it goes without saying that a modicum of allowances has to be made when a true story is being adapted for the big screen but if you shoot a fairy tale that has next to nothing to do with what actually happened  why call it bugsy and make the audience believe this was a halfway true story the godfather trilogy processes many real characters and events once upon a time in america does it too but they dont claim to be telling true storiesbr br  spoilerbr br in the movie benny has this grand vision of a gamblers eldorado in real life lansky had to argue him into going to nevada benny deemed the notion of a counterpart to monte carlo idiotic and hed have preferred to continue his life as a playboy in la not until much later benny warmed to the idea but of course hes the hero of the movie so naturally the idea had to be hisbr br in the movie benny wants to use count difrasso to get close to mussolini in order to assassinate him because he was hitlers partner and hitler killed jews in gas chambers after all obviously were supposed to like benny so the screenwriters invented this nonsense in real life at that time nobody knew about the gas chambers least of all benny who was completely uninterested in politics in fact he did use the countess connection and he did visit mussolini but not to kill him but to sell explosives to him he even met goebbels and goering during his sojourn in italybr br the whole greenberg subplot was nonsense greenberg didnt turn stool pigeon he didnt seek refuge with benny benny didnt kill him that was up to albert tannenbaum at least they got the name rightbr br i guess it was supposed to be very romantic to have virginia return to benny offering him the money she had stolen the movie even goes so far to tell us via text panels that she ruefully returned the money to lansky after bennys assassination let me just say revisionism just doesnt get more impudent than thisbr br this list is by no means exhaustive  theres the issue with bennys family not living in la the way benny deals with dragna and adonis the portrayal of costello a disagreeable corporate type lansky a lovable teddy bear benny himself an aging windbag who wouldnt have reached age 12 if he had regularly gone bugsy in situations like those in the movie and whats more who neither has the good looks nor the charisma of benny siegel and many others apart from a few hard facts nothings right in this flickbr br  spoilers end herebr br all in all this is the one mafia movie that manages to be even more ridiculously bad than harlem ny but honor where honor is due this is a feat in itself
