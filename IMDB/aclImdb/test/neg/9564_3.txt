its funny how instinct warns you of something  for example as soon as the company credits read nu image i knew instinctively id seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldnt remember where  nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be crap and it was  maybe im psychic br br  mild spoilers br br the opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time  i dont know about you but im geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language  especially if its spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie  anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife  oh did i mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night  yeah hes a serious badass mofo  in fact hes so bad  and i dont mean the acting  ill get to that in a moment  that hes impossible to take seriously and this is before hes executed only to return as elton john  elvis  a french chef etc  i wonder if keith david got paid for this  because he looks lke hes having so much fun on screen thats the only reason hes playing the role  what a pity this reviewer didnt have any fun whatsoever watching judge and jury  hey maybe the producers could send me keiths fee  gawd only knows i deserve itbr br i disliked this movie a lot as if you hadnt guessed and my main beef isnt with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence  if like me youve had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times youll know violence is an obscene painful thing  but judge and jury will have you believe that if youre thrown through a window  crash through some bannisters and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but youll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs  it could of course be argued that any film starring sly  arnie or bruce also suffers from this same dishonest showing of violence but with judge and jury it yanked my chain
