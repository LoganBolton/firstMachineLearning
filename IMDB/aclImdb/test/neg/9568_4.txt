before i begin let me get something off my chest im a huge fan of john eyres first film project shadowchaser the film a bgrade cross of both the terminator  die hard may not be the work of a cinematic genius but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit  spawned two sequels  a spin offbr br judge and jury begins with joseph meeker a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the socalled bloody shootout which seems like a poor name for a killing spree  meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store being led to the electric chair there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love who was killed during the shootout expressing his revenge for the person who killed her  michael silvano a washedup football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team and ends up harassing his sons coach but once executed meeker returns as a revenant or as kelly perine calls a hamburger without the fries whose sole aim is to get his revenge which basically means making silvanos life a miserybr br let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film it is a supernatural action film with meeker chasing silvano using his ability to change form which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator a french chef with an accent as bad as his moustache a drag queen a clown  a standup comedian a shotgun which fires explosive rounds  an invulnerability to death although that doesnt stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle to pay silvano back for killing meekers wifebr br director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations instead focusing solely on action scenes which the film has plenty of but that is the films main flaw since theres nothing to connect the action scenes together the acting is surprisingly good with keith delivering the best performance supported ably by kove as well as paul koslo who plays the washedup cop quite well kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse
