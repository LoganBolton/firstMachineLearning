as i write this in november 2005 ive become aware that the great british boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the british government not giving film makers tax breaks i think the cause is much simpler  a lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years  lets have a look at what the brits were producing 19952005br br funky gangster thrillers  lock stock and two smoking barrales was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape guy ritchies style with usually disappointing results br br romantic comedies  yeah okay i do realise four weddings  notting hill etc were produced by american studios but theyre still vaguely  british films   unfortunately because theyre guaranteed to make a profit for the studios they have to follow a winning formula which usually involved hugh grant playing hugh grant for the umpteenth time br br black comedies  can anyone explain what a black comedy actually is  in the british context its usually a rambling film with often contemporary political statements made and which often resembles mike leighs naked br br jasmin disdars beautiful people is a good example of the third type of british movie  filmed in 1999 but set in 1993 it opens with two men having a fight on a bus and its later revealed that ones a serb and ones a croat so we get a bite sized rundown of what was happening in the balkans at that time  though whats the odds of two former enemies in the balkans bumping into each other on a london bus  this sums up one of the major flaws of the movie  irony takes precedence over likely situations  you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots but is the outcome likely  perhaps the greatest irony is the title of the film  its called beautiful people but certainly this audience member found them clich√©d stereotypical people that i couldnt believe in as three dimensional characters
