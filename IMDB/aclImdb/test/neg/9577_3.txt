this spanishitalian coproduction tells an interesting and weird story about dr bannister a woman that not only has the best years behind her but also has a scarred face that makes her look like a freak but in madrid a professor she knows has conducted some experiments on animals with a substance which regenerates cells the experiments were successful but the animals became aggressive because the professor wont allow dr bannister to be the first human guinea pig she kills him and consumes the substance she becomes a beautiful young woman but also a vicious killer when it comes to keep her secret a secretbr br the plot of the film is great fun but piero vivarelli had not enough skills and money to make a cool movie out of it also the film becomes boring after a good start and doesnt manage to regain a fast pace even though the films running time doesnt exceed 83 minutes and as the setting changes to swiss city geneva for the last third of the film it sometimes even looks like a vacation movie as we see how beautiful geneva is which it is indeed  but it doesnt help to push the plot forward so with a more talented director better actors and a bigger budget satanik could have become an obscure italian classic but as it is its just a lacklustre and boring crime film that isnt really worth looking for rating 3 out of 10
