they call this film euro trash horror br br well its not horror the film takes place in europe so yes its euro trash ah yes its trash all rightbr br you know youre in for a great movie when right at the beginning the dvd gives you text on the screen apologizing for the quality of the print youre about to watch expect crackles odd jarring cuts and for the movie not to fit the screen plus theres the sound  at first i thought i was watching a dubbed film then watching the lips carefully i realized that no its that the sound quality is embarrassingly bad and out of synchbr br the plot itself is fairly goofy  an old disfigured woman named dr bannister kills a scientist for his youth formula im not giving much away because when you see the old woman its pretty obvious shes under a layer of thick badly applied makeup anyone with a lick of sense seeing the fake old age knows whats coming nextbr br yes the old crone is miraculously transformed into a beautiful young woman  complete with face makeup and a long wig of hair zoundsbr br when i say the old woman is disfigured i mean she has cornflakes glued to her face the film makes no attempt to explain how the cornflakes got there for that matter there is no attempt to explain anything at all relating to any of the characters theyre never developed beyond the level of finger puppets br br the two policemen pursuing our antiheroine just wander about apparently baffled by the simplest clues the murdered scientist was working on a youth serum the old woman has disappeared and we keep running into a young woman  how do these pieces fit together what does it all mean one of the cops sweats a lot and pats his face with a cloth the other smokes a pipe thats pretty much all we get characterwisebr br dr bannister the crone now a beauty goes around wearing odd costumes and then taking them off so we can see her flesh she has affairs with men she gets in a catfight with a young woman in a nightgown she goes to geneva so we can see the lake there she water skis a bit then takes off her wet suit to reveal a strange beadcurtain bikini she takes off her clothes again in a strange ninja costume stripteasebr br the ending well without giving anything away its just a bizarre tacked on conclusion that makes about as little sense as the rest of the picture its the sort of thing a writer comes up with when the director wakes him up at 4 am and says quick we need an ending for our movie what happens nextbr br the writer mumbles something half awake and the director runs with itbr br whats good about this movie some of the music is campy and fun that classic 60s organ music thats so corny its enough to make you laugh out loud there are some odd seduction scenes bizarre dialogue goofy moments br br its very close to being so bad its good i did manage to watch it from start to finish without gouging out my eyes or sobbing i guess thats praise of sorts
