possible spoilers br br i love dennis quaid and i like meg ryan i was looking forward to seeing them together being married and all i wanted to see their onscreen chemistry okay that being said i guess the fact that they are actors their offscreen relationship didnt have to permeate their performances especially with this scriptbr br how stupid can a professor be to glue himself to anyone i dont remember the original but i can only assume that obrien probably was handcuffed to his leading lady probably in a more inevitable way if i were bonded to someone id be pretty angry the crush i would have would definitely have dissipated quickly meg showed not even a little annoyance only slight surprise dennis would have to take me kicking and screaming that whole section of the movie was so horrible  especially meg having to go to the bathroom 2 between dumpsters in the dark at night ewww no fing way br br whats with dennis socking every single suspect in the movie sock first ask questions later not once not twice but too many times  i could have kept count if i were so inclined br br the most interesting part of the movie was nick and his family drama too bad that couldnt have become more of the plot the assumed offscreen drama leading up to this tragedy i think it could have been written in without distracting from dex quest br br my blame lies with the writer of this screenplay unless the director and others doctored it up so much that its unrecognizablebr br i wont even get into the real reason poor dex was murdered how ludicrous is that even when dex confronted the real killer and the reason was explained a true film noir moment everyone on screen seemed bored oh  happened oh yawn dex even says this is a silly reason for a triple murder oh the tension you could cut it with a spoonbr br if anyone but dennis had been in this movie id have to give it 12 star only because i really have seen worse but in this case 1 12 starsbr br for dennis and meg stars see anything else
