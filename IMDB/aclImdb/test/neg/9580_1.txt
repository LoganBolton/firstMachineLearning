i bought the dvd out of a big bin for 499 thinking id lucked into some documentary pearl that would actually show extensive footage of the karakoram mountains and k2 in particular fastforwarding through the film i reached the climactic scene in which the climbers catch their first sight of  mount waddington towering to all of 13260 ft in canadas coastal range at least one of the several bozos geared up to climb k2 clearly has no idea what the real mountain actually looks like  he has to be assured by his friend and climbing partner that he wouldnt have been brought by said partner to an ugly mountain given that one of the films premises is that 27 or so people have lost their lives on k2 you might think that the jerk in question might have taken a minute or two to bone up on a few basic facts but the clown seems to think that preparations on this scale while good enough for the likes of reinhold messner are beneath him to be honest i havent watched the whole thing what ive seen makes me cringe they say that you get what you pay for at 499 ive been ripped off
