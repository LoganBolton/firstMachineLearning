mount godwinaustin otherwise known as k2 is the worlds second highest mountain and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed k2 is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering while the outdoor photography takes in some truly awesome scenery the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore  and therein lies the fault with the whole filmbr br cocksure lawyer taylor brooks michael biehn and his quiet married friend harold jamieson matt craven spend their free time rock climbing during one of their trips they meet up with another bunch of climbers funded by wealthy mountain enthusiast philip claibourne raymond j barry claibournes team are in training for a forthcoming shot at the infamous k2 a mountain that taylor and harold would both love to tackle but could never afford to do so during their training run however two of claibournes team get themselves killed in an avalanche taylor and harold put themselves forward as potential replacements despite initial reluctance claibourne gives them the nod of approval and the pair find themselves joining his team in the himalayas harolds wife cindy julia nicksonsoul is distraught that her husband is going to take on such a dangerous climb especially since he has recently become a father tensions in the climbing team mount as taylor repeatedly clashes with another member of the group the equally brash and arrogant dallas woolf luca bercovici meanwhile claibourne himself grows increasingly ill as altitude sickness takes its toll on his body will the guys reach the peak of k2 or is their quest destined to end in disappointment or even deathbr br k2 spends an inordinately long time introducing its somewhat dislikeable characters biehn as a foulmouthed pushy adventurous type is especially hard to like as is barry as the hardnosed mountaineering millionaire but on the other side of the coin craven is so dull that it becomes difficult to believe his wife could possibly give a damn about him going off to climb k2  heck shed be better off if he never came back rounding off the main characters is bercovici whose characterisation as dallas woolf is as campy and overthetop as every other role hes ever played the story itself is totally tame and disposable  just a straightforward yarn about guys trying to reach the top of a mountain theres a bit of male bonding thrown in but the whole subplot about harold and his wife amounts to nil and the personality clashes between taylor and dallas ring totally false k2 scores its few merits solely from the stunning cinematography by gabriel berastain  during the himalayan sequences the scale and awe of the mountains is quite nicely captured im completely with critic kim newman on this one who hilariously stated in empire magazine on this evidence climbing k2 cant be any harder than sitting through it quite true kim quite true
