seems like a pretty innocent choice at first the name employee of the month might ring bells with office space and the show office clerk i think not this isnt even a dark comedy the director of this movie whoever the guys name was a complete jerk and has a sick perverse mind there is no pleasure in being lured into feeling sorry for a complete loser who cheats on his wife steals from his topnotch job and lies through his teeth 247 the second i walk in to the room when my family are watching it and believe me they were only watching it more because they were praying that there would be at least some relief perhaps even some fable in the end sending a warm message of good justice done and when the good guys look good all the good guys were killed so long ago that they had no time to look good no memorial was madebr br this movie has borderline insanity it disrespects the elderly the dead and women and the director tries to make people to like itbr br i gave this movie a two only because the soundtrack was good but not even that was all that memorable if you were lucky enough to not see this in theaters definitaly my friends do not do this at home
