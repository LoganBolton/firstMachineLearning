this is a crummy film a pretender to a genre of surprise ending movies and a genre that has been done so much better before the plot limps along with a predictable ending yawn the characters are unlikeable and some are so unlikeable they are almost unwatchable matt dillon a fine intense actor is totally miscast here and is stiff and mannered the others are forgettable much of the dialog is sophomoric again a pretender trying to be witty i wouldnt hire the screenwriter to write my grocery list yes its that bad veering from misogynistic to just plain gross as in beyond frathouse gross with so much real talent out there im really surprised this movie ever got made it shows the total lack of imagination of the office suits
