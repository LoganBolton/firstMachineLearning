 why watch a tv drama billed as a comedy in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people  i can sort of see what the writer david renwick was trying to achieve the misdirections and badtaste surprises that he put into one foot in the grave etc i admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on british tv at the moment but really  who cares about these people  they are cold boresbr br another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased exboyfriend shagging that was the moment when i switched off this programme never to returnbr br ps its interesting to note that the posters who didnt like this series are all british whereas those who praise it are mostly in other countries this reflects the fact that when the bbc broadcast this series it was ignored by viewers and sank like a stonebr br pps good news for those who liked it  there will be a second series in autumn 2007  though without the male lead it sounds like the bbc have decided to turn it into a more conventional 30 minute sitcom
