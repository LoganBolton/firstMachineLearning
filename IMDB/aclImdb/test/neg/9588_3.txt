this film tries to skewer the studio era in hollywood and the morals of the 1950s guy stone is intended to be a rock hudson type but both the script and actor matt letscher end up channeling a smarmy cruel baritonevoiced version of george hamilton instead which makes for an unpleasant characterbr br guy stone is such a reprehensible human being that the audience has trouble liking this waste of human skin unlike hudson who was sweetly promiscuous stone is a hateful person who knowingly uses and then throws away the sweet handsome young men who share his bed every few hoursbr br veronica cartwright is jerry stones celibate lesbian manager cartwright is very good but the director doesnt quite know what to do with her the fault lies in the dialogue which is a bit clumsy and the film suffers for itbr br carrie prestons sally owes more to ellen greene in the little shop of horrors as written prestons sally is good for a laugh but little else newcomer adam greer is lost in this movie he cannot act and seems to have been cast for his hot body and good looksbr br like many recent films straightjacket is a dramedy  a comedy film which switches messily to a drama about twothirds of the way through the film and like almost all dramedies straightjacket fails miserablybr br despite the expensive services of skywalker sound the sound quality of the film leaves a lot of be desired the overuse of the musical soundtrack creates a distracting amount of cues as wellbr br the film really doesnt managed to satirize anything about the 1950s unlike singin in the rain which perfectly captures hollywoods ambivalence about the advent of sound as well as the studio mentality about formula films straightjacket doesnt manage to depict hollywood in the 1950s at all well the dialogue sets and behavior of the key characters are nondescript rather than deadon stereotypes of the 1950s hollywood the same can be said for the lampooning of the general mores social trends and fads of the 1950s as a whole compare the transformation of guys home to the deadon satire of the 1950s home in little shop of horrors there is no comparison little shop hits the nail on the head while straightjacket doesnt even know there is a nailbr br motivations too seem haphazard rick foster is supposed to be a principled liberal yet he falls almost immediately for a materialistic schmuck like guy stone rick is fine with guys closeted status for many months but when it comes time to go to italy he becomes conflicted for reasons that are completely unclear and even though sally appears to fall in love with freddie during the party this plot point simply disappears a few minutes later without comment rick comes off like a gay man from the 1990s not a gay author of the 1950s indeed modern morality suffuses this film  which it shouldnt if it were really a satirical look at homophobia in 1950s hollywoodbr br plot holes in this ragtag film also abound saul repeatedly says that hes going to turn freddie stevens over to the feds but never does so  allowing freddie to out guy jerry and sauls plot to in guy never makes any sense nor does sallys sudden decision to take the blame and although guy has admitted he is a homosexual apparently it doesnt matter and he ends up a famous star and playwright anywaybr br unfortunately none of the production values manage to save this film the cinematography by michael pinkey is pedestrian at times the film almost looks like a filmed play rather than a motion picture especially the scenes in sauls office everything is restricted to medium shots and the film has an incredibly static the editing by chris conlee doesnt do the film any help either long scenes which would benefit from the insertion of closeups or shifts in point of view remain uncut whether this is due to lack of coverage or bad editing is not clear but the overall effect is to create a sense of lethargybr br the film relies heavily on cgi effects of guys home created by visual effect designer thomas dickens but the cgi looks clumsy and hokey and it is very noticeably amateurishbr br my overall impression of this film is that the jokes are cheap and easy the plot muddled the characterizations wildly inconsistent and way off the mark the satire nonexistent the performances overbroad and off the mark and the comic timing off its almost an amateurish film it is as if someone took a high school production and threw 10 million at it
