this review contains a partial spoilerbr br shallow from the outset doa at least starts as if it might be a slick entertaining piece of nonsense like finchers the game its central characterdennis quaid suffers from a nightmarish sequence of events that appear to be setting up a twisted and cunning thriller but the plot rattles along at too great a pace leading to a dramatic twist not half way through when the character learns that he has been poisoned and has only 12 days to live and this simply is too big a twist to add casually to a story once this has happened the films only chance of success is if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its principal indeed its only subject matter but doa continues as if this was just a normal revelation like any other you might usually encounter in a thriller the problem is twofold firstly quaids actions dont convince as what someone is his situation would be likely to do and secondly even if they did convince its hard to care about what happens next when the most significant point of plot has already been prematurely resolved the rest of the film is pretty standard fare for a film of this sort but made more tedious than usual by the characters slightlytreated predicament which logically dwarfs the events the film is interested in dennis quaid in the lead role doesnt convince either as a burnt out professor or as a man who is destined to die meg ryan is as often ditzy and annoying another negative feature is the ugly 80s soundtrack watch the game instead which from similar roots remains tight and characterdriven whereas doa drifts into developments that only undermine its own premise as the premise is itself quite intriguing its a shame to see it drowned in a surplus of overcooked plot
