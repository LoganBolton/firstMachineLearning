i saw this movie yesterday on a public service channel they had advertised it as an awful movie and so i was drawn to see it and i was not let downbr br a group of 1819 year old go to an excavation site at an old viking castle in denmark to try to uncover the myth of the berserker vikings strange things happens something is in the forest and people start disappearingbr br the main thing about this movie that really bothers me is that the story is supposed to take place in denmark where i happen to live there were so many places in the movie where the hollywoodstyle overlapped danish reality it really made the acting and drama look ridiculous in my eyesbr br you never see the characters interact with any of their surroundings its feels like a minihollywood in denmark and it takes away the credibility of the movie when at one point you hear someone speak old danish it sounds exactly like modern day swedish really bad research considering the director is from denmarkbr br the characters in the movie used gps and maps and thats really funny since denmark is about the size of your backyard nomatter where you are there is never more than 50 km to the sea and 500 meters to civilization and if you are at a castle there are going to be tourists everywhere we see a lot of overviews of forests in the movie and sometimes we see what appears to be north american vegetation the story did not exactly appeal to me maybe because the acting was so bad when the characters see the bog creatures for the first time they are not even scared i guess their acting skills were insufficient to display realistic emotions at the end there is an unexpected twist but it didnt impress me since i didnt really carebr br the bog creatures are cheap but they had the potential to be scary unfortunately they fail since we get a good look at them standing in the forest when the characters arrive at the castle also there are no really scary scenes since the bog creatures are mostly just standing aroundbr br anyway conclusion disregarding the facts the movie is your typical bhorror flick i guess people from other countries can enjoy it more as long as you are unaware of reality it doesnt matter just like i think of usa as one big action movie set everyone else can think of denmark as a forest with a castle and some livingdead people in a bog
