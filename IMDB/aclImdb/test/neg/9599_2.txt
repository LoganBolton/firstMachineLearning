all right let me start by saying i love the original rs for the 64 the graphics were new the ships were really fast and cool the missions were a challenge but you had a strategy to come up with the computer didnt tell you every step of your mission you could wander and explore br br thats the first thing thats wrong with rl everything you do is under a timetable and controlled by other people i mean shouldnt you as the leader be telling people how to handle each and every mission br br and speaking of missions why do they intersperse the original trilogy with completely made up crap never mindbr br i was so waiting for this game when i heard they were going to allow you fly through the asteroid field from empire strikes back i think anyone who is a fan of the films wanted to do this so they give it to you its the stupidest level in the game you start by flying through the asteroid field with ties chasing after you and your whole objective is to get farther into the field while shooting the ties you have to kill them all to get ahead hey remember how many han killed when he was in the field none they all had poor piloting skills compared to him i just wanted to be able to dodge the asteroids as they came at me but instead i have to use my automatic aim guns to kill ties behind mebr br that was the biggest disappointment you have no control over your flying everything is sluggish all except for the awing probably the fastest and most maneuverable ship in the entire fleet but oh yeah didnt han say the falcon was anywaybr br you finally get to the battle of endor here is the ultimate level you get to destroy the death star everyones first instinct is to pick the falcon and be the leader but of course you get there and have to do stupid prechosen strategies like finding not to mention deciphering the difference between the tiebombers this is impossible in the falcon by the time you have spotted one group the frigate gets destroyed the only way to get passed this part is to pick the awing after this you have to attack the star destroyers and thats a real stupid chore this game makes you feel like youre the only one defending the rebel alliancebr br after you frustratingly get through that fun fight you get to the death star and here you might think yay i get to destroy the death star and again like in the asteroid field you have to do some tedious thing while narrowly getting passed the tunnels of impending doom your mission is to protect the ship in front of you remember that from the return of the jedi its so moronic because if you pick the falcon youll die because youre not maneuverable enough but if you pick the xwing you have to keep locking and unlocking your sfoils so its a choice to either kill the bad guys or try to catch up to lando who apparently doesnt know how to maneuver thus dying in the processbr br the bonus stages arent even worth aiming for as each level just gets more and more frustrating it makes me feel the way i did when i saw the new three films upset and in need of killing something lucky for me smash bros melee existsbr br i hope with the wii they come up with something a lot better and have the original trilogy levels to full capacity im going to sell this game the first chance i get
