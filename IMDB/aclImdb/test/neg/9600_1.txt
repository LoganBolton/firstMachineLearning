i am a lover of bad movies i own rotor and boa vs python and am working to build up my collection to such great titles as troll 2 and whats up superdoc but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies its just lame the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right everything about this movie is stupid when the robot guy runs into the car it seems almost as if he knew it was going to blow up there was just no reason he would ever run in that direction judge jury and executioner the perfect copbut they went too far i mean come on why do people bother making these movies anymore rotor makes it because it is hysterically awful but storm trooper is just a waste of cinema because it isnt even bad enough to be so bad its worth watching this belongs in someones home movies collection something they can be sort of proud of but that is all i am pssed off it was on an hbo channel with only 1star which is why i watched it because it didnt belong there even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie it is shameful
