alright a scifihorroraction bhybrid directed by jim wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a defleshed metal head killing off multiple people as with any wynorskiflick he throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly dont lead to anywhere but storm trooper is more like a twomoviesforthepriceofone kind of deal on the one hand we got the dramathriller part as such the film opens with carol alt killing her incredibly annoying  ungrateful husband a plot that simply leads to nowhere and on the other hand we got the escaped cyborg on a rampage part night of the living deadstyle with carol and the cyborg being the ones trapped inside the house and a bunch of special opsbounty hunters playing the role of the zombies trying to break into the house needless to say this flick is not up there with the greatest zach galligan of gremlinsfame especially is painfully bad and corey feldman in a small supporting roll is once again completely wasted on this movie wynorski even rips off one of his own movies here since i am 99 sure he used some stock footage of his previous film 976 evil ii the scene with the exploding truck and the motorcycle yes its so not good and so much fun this is strictly for wynorskifans only and i am one of them in case you didnt know already
