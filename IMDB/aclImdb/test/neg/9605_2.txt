normally i dont bother wasting my time writing comments for junk like this that i forget almost as soon as i see it but since i saw this movie just yesterday on one of the comcast showtime channels 346 i think i decided to make an exceptionbr br besides the fact that i enjoyed watching carol alt i cant give any rational reason why i watched this movie through to the end im always amazed that goodlooking women are willing to appear in awful movies like this but i suppose she thought this movie would lead to something better i hope she was right for her sakebr br otherwise this is an alltootypical straighttovideo laugh riot or just a piece of garbage depending on your point of view while there are a few decent moments of action in this movie they dont really connect well with the story such as it isbr br the setup as i recall involved carol alt as a depressed housewife who believes her husband a cop is cheating on her there was also something about their child dying in an accident and she blaming him for it but before that storyline went anywhere she shot and killed himbr br on the same fateful night a wounded stranger comes to her door and she tends to him and almost immediately her house is under siege by government stooges and mercenaries intent on capturing the stranger who appears to have almost superhuman fighting skillsbr br this same kind of material has yielded decent entertainment plenty of times before most notably in matt damons the bourne identity and could have done so this time as well but this particular movie was let down by poor production values and a lousy scriptbr br this movie really falls apart at the end when the mysterious stranger turns out to be a cyborg  who was programmed to be a policeman and after discovering that carol alt killed her husband he tries to kill her the movie wasnt particularly good up until this point but the ending really ruins it by trying to turn a modest actionthriller into a lumpy terminatorrobocop wannabebr br i also thought that the violence in the movie was a bit excessive at the end with the demented cyborg gouging out poor carol alts eye before it finally bit the dust what was the point of that for that matter what was the point of anything in this movie it held my attention and entertained me for about an hour until the end when it reminded me that i wasnt watching a firstrate movie it wasnt even really a secondrate movie for that matterbr br the final scenes seem to hint at a sequel which i dont think ever happened although i havent carefully checked the web for it needless to say that im not in any hurry to see any sequel to this movie
