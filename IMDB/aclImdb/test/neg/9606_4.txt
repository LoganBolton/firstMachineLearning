i tried to give this show a chance but it really doesnt sit well with me although the performances are good the writing isnt the two oldest stepsiblings derek and casey are equally annoying i get the impression that were supposed to side with casey given that shes the protagonist but i dont find her at all likable the parents are continually portrayed as utterly clueless the three younger children are the most watchable things on the show lizzie and edwin are sweet the way they team up and marti is adorable the plot lines are a bit farfetched and the whole premise is mostly hard to swallow  blended families are common yes but this family isnt really trying all that hard to blend on the whole i think it grades thumbsdown
