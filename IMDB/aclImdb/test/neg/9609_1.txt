there is so much not to like about this show its hard to know where to start unlikeable characters horrible plot lines terrible writing and terrible acting dont even get me started on the obnoxious theme musicbr br on top of all that the show is out of touch with us audiences due to the heavy canadian references all throughout it oh say derek will you be going to queens college in the fall how have you bean we should go oot br br granted other shows are filmed in canada for financial reasons like stargate atlantis but while those shows may have suffered from some annoyances like rodney calling a zpm a zedpm the show didnt focus on life in canadabr br mtv is running degrassi another show based on the experiences of the canadian teenager during daytime hours when no one is watching to fill time most teens are at school when it airs id wager its for the same reason shows that focus on teenage life in canada dont translate well to a us audiencebr br this show should be canceled and the remaining masters burned in a furnace
