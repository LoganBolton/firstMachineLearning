im a fan of the 1950s original and about 20 minutes into this remake i started to think this was going to be as good as the original but it wasnt the motive for the murders was incredibly stupid two of the lovers in the movie turn out to be brother and sisterexcuse me while i barf the main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex which doesnt make sense considering the situation hes in if the film makers wanted a sex scene they should have put it earlier in the movie before the main character dexter played by dennis quaid found hes about to die and that hes accused of a crime there is a reason for where the sex scene is at early in the movie dexter isnt living life to the fullest so hes not interested in sleeping with meg ryan i still feel it would make more sense for the sex scene to have either been cut or earlier in the film and the two siblings not to have been loversbr br one of the dumbest parts of the movie involves a gun fight a couple people getting killed and one person being run over all within 15 yards of a crowded carnival and yet nobody at the carnival notices also in the scene is the tar pits the university where the movie takes place is built on if you fall into the tar you sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds not only is it hard to believe stuff would sink that fast in tar but more importantly who builds a university on tar pits i would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is but i dont want to put a spoiler in my post
