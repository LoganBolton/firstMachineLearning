i wont be too hard on this show because i enjoyed the first season but then things got worse the concept is nothing special just about a girl named casey who is trying to cope with a new stepbrother derek and his loud crude family while she gradually forces her princess standards onto each of thembr br in season 1 the story was actually interesting i liked casey back then because she was smart strong independent and conservative she was wellmannered and deep i felt bad when she was being harassed at her new school by her new stepbrother she was a perfectionist but not as annoying as the later episodes oh and she dated a nice guy who is now currently portrayed as one of dereks idiot friends the season grasped the true tension the title of the show was trying to capturebr br now i cant say the show has really gone downhill because the story is sometimes interesting but i root for derek now instead of casey now there is little if any interaction between the two siblings if they interact its only briefly oh and i dont want any dasey fans in my face people thats called incest even if they are stepsiblings my tolerance can only go so far but thats not the pointbr br its strange derek as the antagonist has gotten more sensitive over time while casey the supposed protagonist is more neurotic and unlikeable than before i like how the younger kids get more airtime but the parents are even more clueless than before but thats not the biggest problembr br unfortunately we are forced to see everything from caseys point of view with lame nauseating background music she has gotten stupider and more shallow over time in one episode she got whiny and wanted her boyfriend to be more chivalrous so she purposely dumped food on herself and blamed derek now what happened to being a strong independent feminist i havent watched much of the fourth season but i hear she is dating a guy named truman who is a jackass and is arrogant oh i remember that fencing episode she constantly reminds him she doesnt like him freaks out over being goosed by a sword and in the end hooks up with him because she can handle him what the hell why go with a guy like that in the first place the 1st season casey would have just punched him in hisnever mind or maybe that would have been my reaction oh and shes a cheerleader not that thats a bad thing but i think she fell on her head at one of her practices and in a prom episode she cried because she couldnt find the dress in her dreams and wasnt completely satisfied until she became prom queen one thing ive noticed is that no matter how bad casey tries to tell us her life is things almost always go her way in the end she gets the guy she wants derek gets some kind of revenge people all love her etc derek is still quite immature but i see that he really has matured i dont see why many people hate sally she seems nice and its good to see derek in a serious relationship with someone he cares about rather than playing the field he is also treating edwin slightly better and is a good brother to martibr br really the show is soso and i rated it low because despite some character development the character i once admired has now become like any fashionable teen queen you can see anywhere on tv but it was good while it lasted
