i saw this film when it premiered in la i think i laughed 2 or three times the rest of the time i was in shock at how ridiculouspoorly shot and poorly written it was kirby is in fact the only saving grace in the film i was disappointed at the performance of larry bagby  whom i usually find entertaining if you enjoy watching your friends crappy homemade short films that they shot on their moms 8mm video camera then theres a slight chance you might enjoy this film then again part of what makes those movies enjoyable is that its your buddies playing all the parts you dont know these people so youll probably find it as dull and stupid as i did dear mr nelson go back to film school intern for a while as a pa or a grip or some low level job so you can see how things are properly done in film  then look for as long as you must to find a director of photography who knows what f stop means make sure he has nd filter on hand then try again repeat as many times as needed
