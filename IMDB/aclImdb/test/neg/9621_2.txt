mirrormask was a terribly disappointing film for me i had expected much from a jim henson production and had found favourable reviews comparing it to the labyrinth and alice in wonderland unfortunately the film ended up in one of those style over substance pile of moviesbr br whereas most kids dream about running away from home to join a circus helena is a kid who has grown up in a circus child labour anyone who wishes to run away to join real life helena wishes that her mother drop dead which is a bad move for a spoiled brat with a princess complex in a kids fantasy movie next thing you know helenas mother flops over and for some reason she is suddenly transported to another worldbr br meanwhile i felt as if i was transported to the museum of contemporary art with a pair of foggy sepiatinted glassesbr br the showcase of cgigenerated creatures and backdrop was interesting at first and i liked the orbiting giants it got a little too tiresome after a few minutes though and i felt my mind wandering br br with no sense of narrative and mtvstyle clips and soundtrack the sphinxes reminded me of basement jaxxs wheres your head at i did not feel involved in the plight of the protagonist and also frustrated as we waited for the film to lead us wherever it wanted hopefully towards the exit signs of the theatre
