having enjoyed neil gaimans writing especially his collaboration with yoshitaka amano in the dream hunters in the past i figured mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed the beginning liveaction section of the movie was intriguing enough the relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with and i loved the sets the costuming and helenas artwork the subsequent computergenerated scenes however were excruciating the dialogue was awkward and pretentious the interaction between the live actors and the cgi horrifying events occurred for the flimsiest reasons and most events seemed superfluous to whatever plot may have existed i only watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie so im not exactly an authority but i strongly recommend that you dont watch any of it at all and stick with gaimans strong written work
