well that was sure a waste of dave mckeans talents wasnt it dont get me wrong when it comes to graphic design dave mckean may be the best in the world right now the layered textured look he can accomplish with just a few pencil lines on rough paper make the efforts of people like peter greenaway and david fincher look like what they are hackwork mckean has been the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics film even magazine ads which borrow the distinctive collage effect he has pioneeredbr br but this movie its junk complete junk the story from neil gaiman is unfortunately exactly what gaiman has been giving us ever since he ripped off clive barker for the first time a pseudomythic overblown dreamscape populated by characters which have titles in all capital letters rather than names everything is allegory to the point that it is impossible to get any human drama emotion or empathy from anyone involved people make pithy postulations speaking in riddles which bring to mind what rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead might have sounded like if tom stoppard had suffered a debilitating stroke halfway through its composition really gaiman get over yourself youre not a prophet youre a poserbr br mckeans directing doesnt help  his pacing is poor taking fully half an hour to actually rev himself up for the main picaresque plot and then simply providing a disconnected sequence of events none of them given any weight the monsters dont menace because theyre not foreshadowed simply thrown at the screen the plot doesnt engage because we dont really care about the rancid little protagonists half the dialogue muttered into into shirt fronts and ubiquitous masks is unintelligiblebr br some of the visuals are pretty and im sure the fanboys will lick it up pity think of the amount of really good work mckean could have produced if he hadnt been stuck with this lame projectbr br grade dd
