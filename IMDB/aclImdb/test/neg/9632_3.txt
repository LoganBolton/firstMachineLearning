ive watched this film a few times and i never really liked it im not a fan so termed nu horror so i cant be dismissed on that account i found it a little sleazy i think the thing that irks me about hammers is the sexploitation aspect not sex mind you but sexploitation im surprised at how many people have rated this film so highly so ill have another look at it but for me it wasnt creepy it had no atmosphere just a bit of omigod look at those badstupid london prostitute women and that little innocent anna about to get raped by yet another nasty man ooherh i suppose ultimately for me the film had no depth whatsoever just a bunch of nasty priggish men and women only there for the titillation value this no doubt was to some degree what victorian england was like but the sets are even too clunky and dull impart a sense of victorian menace roger cormans horrors on the other hand now thats style atmosphere and elegant horror for me this was just exploitative flat footed trash
