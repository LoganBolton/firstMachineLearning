this is one of those socalled hollywood social commentary films that wants to have it both ways and believe me in this film both ways are clichéd and stereotypical stoploss is a 21st century john wayne film dealing with some antiwar sentiment but clearly ending on the note that if you are a man in todays society you get your act together and march off to war with your buddies in many ways the film was a great sequel to taxi to the dark side as it portrayed a military equally as insane and out of control a quasi frat partyanimal house extravaganza mixed in with a texas red neck world of repressed homoerotic proofs of masculinity this movie had it all in one scene after another of clichéd imagery and then rebellious military deserter ryan phillippe goes on a road trip with best friends girlfriend an artificial storyline manipulation to visit families of dead servicemen maimed soldiers in military hospitals etc and finally to broach the issue of fleeing to canada or mexico but male honor and patriotism win out in the end as all freshly scrubbed and handsome he rides off into the sunset on a bus with his buddies back to iraq and a world that a few minutes before he assured everyone he could never again tolerate full metal jacket meets sands of iwo jima  but in the end john wayne rides again and a hollywood blockbuster ultimately gets to keep both sides of its audience in the palm of its handat least it would like to think so as far as i wasam concerned just take me back to the more convincing reality of in the garden of elah
