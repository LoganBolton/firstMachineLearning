danger watch for falling spoilersbr br boy was this a bad movie i know that they were going for a true love conquers all kind of thing but about all this film conquered was about 3which felt more like 9 hours of my afternoon which i will never get back the movie is about two young lovers named kai and gerta who live in a remote town in a fantasy world kai is the muchabused bellboy at a hotel owned by gertas father at first gerta ignores kais advances but she eventually warms up to him much to the disgust of you guessed it gertas father as if this obstacle wasnt enough to overcome an evil snow queen shoots a shard of glass in kais eye and he becomes a mean person treats gerta poorly kai is eventually taken to the snow queens fortress which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice because the good people at hallmark like to go all out and gerta sets out on a mission to get kai back along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way but gerta escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way all the while you will want to turn it off but cant force yourself to do it its probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the snow queen anyways i will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it so in conclusion the snow queen is an incredibly boring movie which takes the fan out of fantasy
