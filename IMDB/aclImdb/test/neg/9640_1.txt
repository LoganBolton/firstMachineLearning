i find it terribly ironic that left wing hollywood continues to hedge its bets making these awful lukewarm movies that neither condemn the war on terror nor embrace itbr br if youre a sixties survivor and a committed pacifist and youre hoping for an allout condemnation of war like born on the fourth of july or all quiet on the western front this movie will really feel like a rip off none of these soldiers actually question this war or any war or the idea of war they just gripe about having to do another tourbr br on the other hand if youre a patriotic american who wants to see a story of courage and honor this movie will really feel like a rip off none of these soldiers loves america or even loves the service the way they pout and sulk makes them come across more like suburban teenagers than blue collar tough guys its not we were soldiers and its not sands of iwo jima its not even mindless action and the war scenes are less rambo and more buffybr br ryan philippe so completely cannot carry this kind of movie though hes devastatingly sexy in a rough trade mens room bisexual sort of way its hard to picture him as a slowtalking texas boy who wants to stand up and be counted this is no sgt croft in mailers the naked and the dead hes more like joel in truman capotes other voices other rooms he cant sell you on the idea that hes been in combat and done his bit or that he wants his woman and wants her right now he fizzles on the battlefield and in the bedroom scenes looking as if he would much prefer to bend over and take a good stiff attack from the rear
