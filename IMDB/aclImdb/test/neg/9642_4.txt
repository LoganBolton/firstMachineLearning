over acted heavy handed full of speeches preachy on the nose and over stylized in a way only mtv could be guilty of stoploss is agitprop garbage i expected a lot more with talented young actors such as joseph gordonlevitt and ryan philippe but screenwriterdirector kimberly peirce does a hatchet job of portraying the ill effects of war on american youth im sure she did some work researching the iraq war and the young men fighting in it but youd never guess it from watching stoploss in many ways this mess reminded me of catherine hardwickes lords of dogtown an equally inept overly stylized tv movielike waste of solid subject matterbr br httpeattheblindsblogspotcom
