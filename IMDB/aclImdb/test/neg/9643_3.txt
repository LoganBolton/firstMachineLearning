the story isnt very strong dont expect a bourne identity kind of movie it started of strong tara speaking russian and it even sounded credible not that im the russian language expert moscow had that darkish depressing look what gave this movie potential i still believed in it to bad it only took about half an hour to see they really missed the spot with this one acting was poor maybe because the story itself was not very strong there is this part in the movie where gordon patrick nick moran is having a conversation on the phone with the cia like youre listening to a chinese synchronizer wtf too bad the writer didnt even take little effort to give the main characters depth also bit of a cheap and easy endingbr br plus point is almost every scene where tara reid is in not that shes acting that well in fact she doesnt but she really looks great in this movie overall it was a bit of a disappointment rental materialÂ…maybe
