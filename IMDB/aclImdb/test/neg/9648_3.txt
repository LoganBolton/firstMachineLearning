this selfimportant confusing bw film watches like an infant on a very bad acid trip youre dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of rotting lettuce that accidentally fell out of the back of a garbage truck no one cares to touch it because it will probably be washed away on its own down the storm drain theres no room for plot when youve got visceral imagery and subtle allegory to me it seems like the director tries to make the next great art movie while begging for intellectual accolades i didnt bring my beret either watching this i felt almost insulted since the film does such an effective job of distancing itself from you
