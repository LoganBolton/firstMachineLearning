first let me say im not someone who usually cringe at the fact of having to think while seeing movies i love tarkowsky movies for example berghman is also a favoritebut this the positive points can be summed up easily the photography is splendid and the music is perfectdoes it make a good movie i used to think so but this one is a perfect example of one that for me doesnt make it maybe its because im too dumb possible but i dont think so tarkwosky for example also used very long shots but what he never did was filming 5 minutes of the exact same image of two people walking and i mean just their heads because in this movie there are a lot of those shots but sometimes it is effective the general result is plainly boring even with the intelligent undertones which are done in a way that while intelligent is above all very pedanticbr br you also always feel that the director is making some of the long shots not for the aesthetic or symbolic effect but just to spare on budgetbr br im very disappointed in this film because i really liked the first 30 minutes or so but it just went on and on without even keeping the same level as in the first scenesbr br while reading the very praising comments on this page i also get the feeling some people just try to see much more in the movie than there is to itwhen a movie is slow and arty it doesnt necessarily mean it is very profoundyes it is an allegory on musical theory placed in the context of a small town which is quite interesting on itself but it does not make a profound movieexcept for people who absolutely want to make some sort of intellectual masturbation out of it but then its not what you find in the movie but what you find in yourselfan exercise that in my opinion can be made much more effectively while watching stalker or solyaris than werckmeister harmonies that owes much to tarkowsky but cab never equal its level
