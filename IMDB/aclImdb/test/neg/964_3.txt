the snow queen is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by hans christian andersen about a girl gerda who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend kai from the clutches of the snow queen this adaption attempts to capture that storys sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design but fails on a number of countsbr br like so many hallmark productions the potential of the story is completely undercut by heavyhanded scripting and direction the two actors playing gerda and kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable bridget fonda as the snow queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role theres a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering threehour miniseries at least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main charactersbr br that said the snow queen would be just about ideal for preteens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience its great eyecandy without being scary and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime overthetop level that spells out the storyline in very very bold text just make sure you read them andersens story too
