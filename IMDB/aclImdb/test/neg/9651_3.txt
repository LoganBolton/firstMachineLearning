im guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book given the number of characters and subplots during katyn i thought that the movie creators perhaps the writer or director intended to create an epic movie but really there wasnt enough time to properly spend on developing characters or story aggravatingly there were many unrelated sidestories that could have been edited outbr br in relating the events leading up to the massmurder of all these intellectuals and officers i dont think the movie explained any reasons why murder was necessary was it political philosophical revenge the interesting part of historical movies are seeing personal motivations or emotions instead the murderers of katyn seemed like automatons controlled entirely by stalin whos appears occasionally framed as a charcoal sketch the portrayal of the russians and germans seemed entirely onedimensional are polish people just that angry at the russians besides being badly edited and biased or at least unrealistic choices of music and cinematography felt mismatched to each other and to the movie itself i dont think you can really shoot an epic war film or war event on handheld camera but if the director went with a characterdriven story perhaps by focusing on a single family maybe the handycam approach would have worked better and if you use really dramatic music it needs to be better balanced to the type of shots made
