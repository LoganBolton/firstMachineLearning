i bought this because it was 199 and harry carey was in it and a friend of mine was in it and for 199 how bad could it be then i read some comments here on the film and began to get excited  maybe this really was a lost gem one of those terrific little bmovies everyone had forgotten about but which deserved to be resurrected wrong im not sure how anyone else can give this thing the praise it got from some quarters here but i found it one of the most tedious and blatantly bathosfilled movies ive ever seen and im not talking about richard carlsons hokey texas accent straight from the georgia part of texas i guess its just dumb no one in the film behaves like a real human being no one and no one does anything believable or interesting its not even a clich√©fest its just 80something minutes of frames going by it even managed to make harry carey maria ouspenskaya and c aubrey smith boring now thats unbelievable
