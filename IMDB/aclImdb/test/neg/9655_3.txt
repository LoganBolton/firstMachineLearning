this movie certainly is a weird one to say the least the basic plot is 3 old business associates invite 2 strangers into their home for returning a lost wallet with 10 bucks in it the two whom show up fall in love the 3 older business men die and come back as ghosts to try to help the two younger guests out okay so that may make sense but then we have 3 old guys whom apparently have some bread living togetherslightly weird hereharry carey plays his part way off base you cant tell if he is a nice guy or really a prick i mean really make up my mind i can handle it then there is richard carlson playing james houston from texashmmmmm he sounds way more like a southern gentleman from kentucky than a person from texas this one isnt even close then we take the 3 ghosts whom would stand a better chance of helping the new orleans saints win a play off game than actually helping outin fact they are really no help at all and why they are even in the film is beyond any scope of knowledge silly film in which a cast of characters act totally out of characteryou can avoid this one
