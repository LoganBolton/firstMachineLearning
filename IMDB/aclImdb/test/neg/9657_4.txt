i find it amazing that so many people probably poles have voted for this movie giving it such grades mostly tens ok the movie was fine funny but it was nothing special on the other hand the only good thing about kiler is the dialogues rather not comprehensive for nonpoles screenplay is primitive the acting except for jerzy stuhr as ryba  awful its too much ado about nothing  fortunately its not included in the top 250 ps the sequel kilerow 2och 2 kilers is on the way and its just the same story
