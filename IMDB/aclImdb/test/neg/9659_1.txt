first off this movie is not near complete my guess is that someone actually bothered to steal every other page of the scriptbr br the movie contains bizarre timetravels without notice inconsistent dialogs misplaced details all over the music isnt very bad at all other then misplaced tracks and besides the fact that the volume goes up and down between the different tracks the cuttingroom did a descent job actually and that says a lot missplaced sound effects ruin the tension thoughbr br luke perry does what he does best just looking worried and occasionally coughing up punchlines from hellbr br i seriously rate this movie as the worst of 2007 and ive seen a few bad ones do not spend money on this one its not so bad its a laugh its worse ratings above 1 star should render a blacklist at imdb because its a damn lie
