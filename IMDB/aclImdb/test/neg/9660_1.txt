just in case the title didnt give it away  this movie is garbagebr br short review yeahbr br i decided to spend as much time writing this review as hollywood probably decided to put into the script i doubt itll be published considering how poorly i worded everything but if this is and anyone reads it  stick to cherishing the first sandlot movie it completely surpasses its predecessors in every single way the sequels arent ever worth buying or seeing and everyone involved in making them should be ashamed for ruining what has to be one of the most classic original films of our childhood
