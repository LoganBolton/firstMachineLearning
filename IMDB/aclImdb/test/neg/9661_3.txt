wow this movie suckedbr br this movie was a embarrassment to the original sandlotbr br everything about this movie was awfulbr br the acting was horrendous every part except the part of the mexican sandlot manager was terriblebr br luke perry though only bit parts was absolutely awful this was is worst role ever even the kid actor playing him as a kid was someone youd want to punch even in the end lolbr br this movie reminded me of those kid movies that go that extra mile making a part goofy way beyond the funny stage the humor was for 6 year oldsbr br if your over 12 and want something worthwhile to watch skip this movie and watch a sitcom instead
