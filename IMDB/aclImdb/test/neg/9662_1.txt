the caluwhat now yeah i thought it was a stupid name as well chris carter remains blissfully unaware of the scum in his writing staff starting off with the usual cheery xfiles teaser a baby getting run over by a train this episode well i cant really say it goes downhill because to be honest it was never going uphill br br poorly written with us feeling no pathos for any of the characters except maybe that baby at the start the writer makes us hate characters before brutally killing them off its the worst technique ever are we supposed to feel sorry for the characters of hate them dont ask me br br not only is it boring and unscary but its like watching a really bad omen sequel with overblown and disgusting death sequences and rotten special effects although to be brutally honest thats the least of my worries br br sara b charno began her xfiles career with a whimper and thankfully ended it with one as wellbr br verdict br br in the words of my maths teacher mr laverack horrible awful
