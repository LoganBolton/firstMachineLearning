i dont think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about the main thing youll notice is the extreme amateurishness of the entire production the acting is what youd get if you chose people at random off the street the sound is really annoying  a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear while at the same time the dialog is perhaps onefifth as loud miscellaneous onset noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree with dialog taking a distant back seat the theme music sounds as if it was about a quarter done when the movie was released as large portions of the film dont have any music at all camerawork can best be described as a gnarled mess with closeup shots where a medium angle would be much better cameramen walking around and jostling the camera every which way absolutely no attention paid to framing any scene they just shot everything from whatever position it was most convenient for the cameraman to stand if the cameraman was a foot taller than the actors and you end up looking at the tops of everyones heads well so be it editing is just a butcher job everything is tossed together in the most abrupt manner possible nothing flows or transitions in any sense of the word i dont know if this was shot on video or perhaps a rented camcorder i tend to think it was the latter br br i only made it about threequarters of the way through this thing before i turned it off i just got so annoyed at the low quality of the production i couldnt take it anymore its like a ninth grade audiovisual class project
