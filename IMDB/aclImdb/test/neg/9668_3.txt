visually this film is interesting light is literally thrown in a way together with cinematography and an alluring introduction before the titles that had my hopes up at the start but then  a bmovie is a bmovie is a bmovie no matter how much spectacle is seen this film surrounds the life of albert fish one of the most wellknown serialkillers in the world active around the start of the 20th century fishs life is hastily and blurry dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age this film is based upon two tracks fishs life and that of william f king lead investigator of the case what saves this film from becoming a hallmark spectacle and debacle of the usual sort whenever films about serial killers are concerned is the direction which is a doubleedged sword director scott l flynn sheds focus enough upon the bactors not to let their flaws shine through too much but at the same times created a truly dull and stereotypical view of the american police through the kingangle sure enough he dealt quite thoroughly with fishs meet with grace budd the 10yearold girl that he killed even though im not really sure if her mother was the mediacrazed person that flynn really tries to emphasise that she was i miss more psychological diving into fish not to mention the very little time which was spent on fishs postcapture all in all interesting for those who are into serialkillers but mostly a letdown however if the director will make another film about another serialkiller id definitely see it in hopes that holes were patchedup
