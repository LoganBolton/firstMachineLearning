just when i thought nothing could be as offensive andor irritating as a billy mays infomercial i had the intellectually shattering experience of renting this piece of garbage peter barnes and john irvin should be brought up on criminal charges for smuggling this script into the public venue the actors need to be charged as accomplices serving no less than a lifetime away from the public eyebr br this production offers the disclaimer for dramatic effect we have taken poetic license with certain facts or some such inadequate statement to fully brace you for the absolute repugnant rewrite of a bible story which needed no drama added what they did add was enough to make your iq drop three full points for every five minutes of viewing timebr br the poetic license taken invents characters so bizarre youll recognize nothing but the names of a few and of course the arkbr br for some reason noah and lot are both living in sodom so maybe abram was vacationing in switzerland on a skiing trip lots wife played by carol kane is a harpy and when shes turned to a pillar of salt lot breaks off her finger and carries it around in what appears to be an empty baby food jar if thats poetic im a kumquatbr br when noah  who has now begun drinking wine in quantities that could help float the ark  whines about the tough job of the building project he awakens one morning to find that god has delivered enough precut lumber to lighten his burden at least i think it was god it looked like a delivery from 84 lumber neatly stacked and bundled maybe 84 lumber is really an agent for god rather than bore you with the cargo being loaded ill regale you with the account of the pirate attack on the ark incongruous you think this movie is filled with such insulting nonsense after an untold time on the waters noah spies a pirate ship heading right for them and who might the salty seacaptain be well duh its lot of course my only surprise was that his uncle abram wasnt aboard if youre going to slaughter a plot line slaughter all of it the piracy attempt is unsuccessful and the swashbuckling was pathetic not poetic i think it was around this mark that my nausea prevented me from punishing myself anymorebr br an ugly senseless moronic distortion of anything remotely resembling a bible account on a scale of 1  10 this movie is premeditated mind abuse stupid and insulting youll be more entertained by reading the yellow pages
