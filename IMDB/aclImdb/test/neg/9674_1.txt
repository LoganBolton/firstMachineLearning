this is pure crap and probably the worst biblical theme film ever absolutely inaccurate i mean theyve put sodom and gomora before the great flood theyve described lot as a friend of noah although he lived after noah to make things worse later lot became a pirate and attacks noahs ark during the flood and whats with the merchant who comes along on a boat which is moved over the water with a bicycle mechanism and exchanges alcohol for a food and water and then noah is portrayed as alcoholic mockery and continuous blasphemies one after another and it goes on and on and on film maker and all participants surely secured themselves the front row in hell with this garbagebr br please stay off this crap because you will save yourself nearly three hours of your life
