ive seen some biblebased trash this one tops it all to make matters worse it lasts about three hours a horrible waste of time unless you want to match your kids biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations do yourself a favor  take a walk in the sahara instead since i am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it gods conversations with noah are ridiculous the whole thing has a stench of lets make the biblical account look retarded the basic logic goes if they spent the money on a biblical film why not make it worthwhile since the basic logic is not met something is amiss the movie starts with a disclaimer about poetic licenses takenthat is the understatement of the century poetic rape but then poetic would be an unmerited favor
