how offensive those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible i can imagine those at nbc saying ok lets make a movie to appease those pesky christians but theyll never know the difference if we dont have anything factual or in the correct chronological order well they were wrong anybody associated with this atrocity needs to find a church and repent for their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity i only gave this movie a 1 because i couldnt give it a 0
