ill dispense with the obvious review of factual inaccuracies they are too numerous to name a much shorter list would be what they got right 1 dude named noah 2 ark with animals on it br br if you want a much more accurate portrayal of noahs ark and the destruction of sodom go rent the bible 1966 it depicts the story of creation through abraham attempting to sacrifice his son isaac its a much better movie and it may be that the abomination called noahs ark 1999 drove you to seek just such a film httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0060164br br i really couldnt stomach watching the whole movie from reading other comments i can see that even the atheists found it grossly inaccurate as a christian it was intolerable to me possibly the worst movie ever made no real point to this movie either except maybe to showcase their subpar computer animationbr br was it a complete waste maybe not god can use evil to work good br br romans 828 says 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purposebr br genesis 50 says 20 but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alivebr br in the second example josephs brothers meant to kill him but god turned their evil into a very great good he may have done the same thing with this moviebr br people were so astonished by its lack of biblical foundation that they probably broke out the dusty old bible and read the story for themselves to find out about lot and sodom they would have to go the whole way up to genesis 19 before god destroys sodom and gomorrah by then they have read almost half of genesis so they might want to finish the next book is exodus which the movie the ten commandments was based on and much more accurately if they have seen that movie then exodus becomes an easy read so now they have read at least two whole books of the bible just because they watched a pathetic movie about noahs ark im sure this actually happened to someone out therebr br god works in mysterious ways
