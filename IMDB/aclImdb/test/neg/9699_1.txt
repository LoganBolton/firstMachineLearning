ive spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film im in total agreement with almost every reviewer in saying that noahs ark is crap crap crap crap crap dont the executives at nbc have any class i feel sick to my stomach for actually watching both parts of this miniseries the script is so dumb so pointless and yes totally inaccurate i can understand making a few changes for dramatic purposes but this film changed just about everything in the story god himself is going to go through the trouble to kill off the entire earths population but he somehow misses one guy thats sailing around trying to sell stuff to noah give me a break and what was up with noahs sons acting like indiana jones saving girls in distress if all that isnt bad enough theres the part where god apologizes to noah and says im sorry noah i was wrong newsflash nbc god can not be wrong this film is the most tasteless and disgraceful biblical film ever made
