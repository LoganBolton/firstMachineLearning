bubbling just beneath the surface of showtime is a good idea actually its more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for screentime this film doesnt just have its cake and eat it too it has the whole bakerybr br detective mitch preston robert de niro has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a brash copslashactor named trey sellars eddie murphy when prestons partner is shot he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of a pestering newsman and the tiff lands him in a new reality cop show produced by chase renzi rene russo in the first of many errors and oddities in the movie that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the filmbr br de niros best gag is his speech to a classroom of small children to open the picture about how tv cops dont act like real cops funny thing is as the movie progresses his character and murphys begin to act more and more like the clich√©s they supposedly clash so strongly with in a smarter movie de niros diatribe could have played as ironic comment here it only shows to point out how truly lame the movie is while a spoof of a reality based cop show could be funny the team of writers and director tom dey who made the far superior shanghai noon a few years ago see that movie instead seem to be on unsure footing and instead of slamming the tv industry they really let them off light the harshest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs is they like to play ping pong at work russos character has a glint of fiendish delight in her eye but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress enthusiasm br br with little on screen to keep my attention my mind began to wander and thats dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes for instance if showtime the name given to the cop show is such a popular smash why doesnt anyone seem to recognize de niro and murphy when they are on the job for that matter if their investigation of smuggler and all around mean guy vargas is being televised why the heck hasnt someone mentioned to him that they are on his trail then again given this villains actions maybe i shouldnt be surprised this is the same joker who is very angry at an associate for using his new supergun without approval jeopardizing a deal and then dispatches him how by using about ten of the superguns to level his entire house of course thats like putting out a fire with a bigger fire br br occasionally showtime gets laughs but there simply arent enough for the films nearly two hour running time even worse the really smart gags suggest that this movie really could have been on to something if only they had put in a few more drafts of the script murphy mugs and talks as fast as he can with minimal results and de niro looks flat out bored through most of this after a completely unnecessary fistfight between cops and gangsters that remarkably results in no injuries and no arrests russos character shouts thats great television perhaps its great television but its far from a great movie
