maybe if youve never read any english literature or only ever watched the hollywood version of any book you might find merit in this awful film it has the directorial and scripting skill of shoreditch the bbc 1995 adaptation is both very enjoyable and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between elisabeth and darcy very wellbr br the characters in this production are badly miscast sutherland as bennet seems a total buffoon bingley likewise acts the fool and it is imcomrepnsible that he my be a friend of darcy i cant imagine how judi dench could have accepted the role maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy versionbr br quotes from the book are thrown in out of context huge chunks are missing the important episode with wickham is glossed overbr br mr collins is however very good and towers above the other members of the castbr br the only good thing is we didnt pay to see it wait for the dvd and use to keep a table from wobbling
