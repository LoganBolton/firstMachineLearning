well wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800  as he so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published  but it is his not austens and shouldnt claim to be an adaptationbr br mrs bennett looks like a rural washerwoman this is a pampered woman  they have servants remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair etc but wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest rough hands and working in the kitchen and the pigs wandering through if he wants bucolic he should try tessbr br mr bennett  the script makes too cuddly and modern and ignored the weakness in him the scene where he stops mary playing is supposed to make you cringe  not pass in seconds if it doesnt  dont include itbr br macfadyen is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some kind of pride by numbers acting the first proposal he looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a man overcoming his pride to make a proposal beneath his station most of his lines he could as well be reading a shopping listbr br lydia is awful completely over the top with excessive shrieking and skipping indeed knightley plays elizabeth more like the giggling inane character lydia actually is in the book at timesbr br and elizabeth half the time knightley is clearly mimicking ehles voice and intonation  close your eyes to see what a copy it is and in her role you see wrights major error  there is no prejudicebr br from the first encounter with darcy she clearly fancies him when he comments to bingley on the attractiveness of the women in the hall she initially looks hurt  not shocked and affronted the latter should set up the prejudice side of things and when she and caroline are prancing round the room she comes across like a tease obviously all over him and by virtually cutting out wickham you dont get elizabeth invested enough there to set up the prejudicial aspects falling out of that relationshipbr br and apparently it is caroline not miss bingley and mr bingley happily wanders into janes bedroom and and and  wright can boast about how great he is with period all he wants but a few panorama shots of rural life which show the preference for hardy dont excuse him the glaring blunders all over the placebr br the cinematographer  who clearly wants awards  should have been reined in he veered between bronte and hardy throughout the film  and wasnt the last proposal shotslighting from tess the need to see darcy walk along through the scape with unkempt shirt was just dumb but most importantly  when going between those 2 very different landscapes they forget the most important one  austen shed have laughed out loud at the elizabeth  sad therefore  rain running through to picturesque folly wet darcy rubbishbr br i admit i found it impossible the watch the film without using the book as context i was prepared to give it some leeway as it had to provide the story in a short space of time but to forget fully one half of the core of the book in prejudice and darcy to continually look more constipated than prideful made it almost unwatchable i could only see it as a mess with generally poor performances when knightley wasnt aping ehle she was gurning or skipping or both and only calmed down a couple of times to indicate she does have some promise  but faffing about on swings to convey emotion isnt a substitute for a poor script and poor direction  although for some it was simply a case of bad scriptbr br tom holland alone would escape censure while he toned down the comic aspects of collins he did turn in a very interesting approach dench does superbly the schtick she can do in her sleep whether it be here or in oscar wilde  but this was supposed to be lady catherine de bourgh not lady bracknell she was just a little too sanebr br the shortened length could have been handled by a competent screenwriter surely not characters filling in story gaps and helping along the audience all over the place elizabeth couldnt have come up with the Â£10k figure and while they wanted to cut time with her learning of darcys involvement in wickhams marriage the lines didnt fit with lydia it was the worst case of incongruous exposition in the piecebr br it really is appalling stuff anyone who reviews it saying it works well in the context of the book is someone i frankly dont believe has read or understood the characterisations in the thing wright seems to think his characters are in the 1990s not the 1709s from their behaviour im not convinced he has read the book  he certainly doesnt understand it he doesnt understand austens acerbic wit or lightness of touch  he certainly made a dull plodding film out of itbr br what is possibly worse was the sad pathetic need of the chick lit lovers to need the i love you i love yous all over the place so they can sigh and get off on it the fact that it has no place in a work by austen is apparently irrelevantbr br anyone who reviews it as a film alone well more difficult for me except i would note the poor acting the weak darcy and the gurning skipping inane irritation of the whole thing if you are going to adapt you can change a lot  but if it loses the spirit and key motivations then dont insult the book by taking its title
