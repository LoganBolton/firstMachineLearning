this movie is simply bad first of all the story is just weird and its not good written it leaves you with questions when youre finished sometimes thats ok but not in this casebr br the acting is nothing to write home about the adults does a ok job but the kids taken in consideration they are kids does not a good job i thought the lead role ian costello as mickey was worst well to be honest im not sure that was the lead role never quite figured who this movie was about mickey or petebr br there were some shots that stood out but over all there were nothing exiting about the cinematography the sound however was better there was a nice score a little adventure kind of score though this didnt look like an adventure film to me it had some elements of an adventure film but it was more of a drama however it was hard to tell who this film was meant for children hardly there is too much language and violence for that adults i dont know it had to many elements of a childrens movie in it it was like a adult movie in a children movie wrappingbr br the story was just weird i dont have much of an idea of what it really was about you was thrown right in to it without knowing anything but there were all the time references to something you felt you should know the fact that the childrens parents were dead for instance and that mickey blamed pete for it you expected to get to know what happened  but you never gotbr br all together this movie was bad and a waste of time there was no drive in it nothing to really move the story forward this is not what you spend your saturday night on
