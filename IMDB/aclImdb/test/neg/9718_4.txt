think charmed with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture a very lame story with mediocre effects and an anticlimax ending to let the door open for a part 2 lets hope someone has the sense to spend their money wiser id suggest a charmed  the movie because compared to this charmed kicked ass and i only watched that show to please my girlfriend wait and watch it on dvd on a rainy sunday when youve got nothing better to do or better yet download it so you dont waste your money the first 15 minutes were alright but the funniest line from the movie and also the only highlight of this movie is when reid says  kiss my ass harry potter while driving of a cliff although they are not worthy to kiss potters ass because potter is way cooler and at least his movies have a story the goblet of fire was even scarier than this
