okbefore i even start the more or less constructive criticism of the movie id like to say a few words which come from the heart this movie sucks dont go to see it unless you really like sweaty boybands and woodenacting noplot stories so lets go to why i think the movie is so bad 1 there is not story line there is no plot the director tried to create a mystery it the feeling just wasnt there 2 the whole thing looks like a big hour and a half promotion for some kind of gothwannabebutstilllookinglikebsbband all guys in school have perfect abs no fat or ugly young people there is no good looking girl in the movie as well not one the main character is either wet in the swimming pool or all sweaty in his bed poor guy must be awful to go on a date sweating like that 3 can those guys do something good with their powers anything good like put off the fire in that old barn or help his friend who got into the accident instead of just running around breaking things and showing of in front of each other 4 wooden acting the main character only has two expressions on his face expression number one sad expression number two trying to look seductive but still seems sad in that boy band there are 4 guys the main characted his best friend who got into the accident the blondy and the fourth one what was the name of the fourth one i think he only spoke twice throughout the whole film once in the beginning  he said the jumping from the cliff using the power wont kill them and second time at the end when he and the blondy lost the girl the movie could have been done without him and no one would notice anyways my verdict 1 is the perfect score for this film guys  do not go to see it there is very little action no suspense no hot girls girls  a least the actors are good looking what i would advise you people is to get a soundtreck of this movie  thats the only thing i liked about it
