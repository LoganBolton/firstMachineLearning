i feel really bad for reviewing this movie because i wish that i had only watched it as a concept production the covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screenbr br the story follows four five teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of ipswitch a survivors of the salem witch trials they also happen to be a part of the secret sect called the covenant their power must be used sparingly as it drains their lifeforce in small amounts and is highly addictive in theory this would make a pretty good action scifi movieÂ…or at least an interesting teeny flickbr br but there were just too many glaring downfalls that dont allow this movie to reach its plots full potential that acting wasnt good the sound track was mediocre and we found a lot of unnecessary sync issues for sure the biggest issue is the poor editing job the movie has little to no coherent flow and makes one fight to keep a mental timeline or any feel of pacingbr br the movie has its moments but overall was a little disappointingbr br a witchy 410
