if i were to pitch this movie idea to some hollywood bigwigs im sure it would sound like this br br me four boys at a private high school are good friends and they are witchesbr br hollywood that sounds like the craft br br me no no i said four boys not four girls br br hollywood that still sounds like the craft just with boys instead of girls br br me ok but there is this fifth unknown boy that comes into the picture and he wants more powerbr br hollywood still not much difference because one of the girls in the craft also wanted more powerbr br me ok ok ill make these boys part of the in crowd theyll be rich and the school is on the east coastbr br hollywood now that sounds original that is nothing like the craft heres a billion dollars br br this movie was so cliché and uninspiring even the manufactured drama between chase and the brothers of ipswich was very blasé a bunch of rich kids with their biggest problem being what color bentley they want for their 18th birthday and 18th car dont interest me at all even if they have powers every single kid in this movie looked like they stepped out of a magazine and of course there had to be the gratuitous male nudity and female 80 nudity just to drive home how out of shape you are i wanted to rename this movie the witches of oc oooh rich kids and their problems let me pretend to carebr br this film was completely unimaginative and predictable the final fight was lame and dragged out and the ending was very anticlimatic this was a movie best left on the cutting room floor
