i feel very generous giving this movie a 2 out of 10 okay noted that the special effects are okay and renny harlin did make one my favorite geneticallyalteredsharksattackaresearchstation movie that of which you may know as deep blue sea also the opening credits are done fairly well with a remix of whitezombies more human then human and it does go fairly well with what is in the context of this movie but enough praise lets get to the reason why this movie sucks so muchbr br not since uwe bolls alone in the dark did i ever feel that the special effects in a movie were totally wasted okay our story starts with four guys who are descendants of four different families each of which possess a never fully explained power from a never fully explained family background that did a never fully explained art of witch craft oh and for some reason these descendants are all 17 all go to the same school are all on the swim team and all for some reason or another sit in bed with their shirts off sweating and talking to each other on the phone i have nothing against gays gothic or thirteen year olds but that is what this movie is aimed at13 year old goth who question their sexuality yeah theres girls in it who sit on their beds in their panties or whatever but how come they dont take their shirts off hey its only fairbr br anyways the characters in this movie are told that when they turn 18 they will ascend and be granted new profound almost godlike powers but before i go any further i forgot to mention that when they use their powers they age slowly and they grow more addicted to it that explains why they got people in their late 20s to play 17 year olds oh and if something needs explaining dont worry someone will explain it all in one large piece of dialog god this movie suckswhere was i oh yeah the ascension partbr br okay apparently there was a supersecretalphaone family that the others forgot about or some st like that i dont know i was dozing off at this point but they were written out some how and the new kid at school who is befriending the group is secretly one of these descendants from the fifth family and i say secretly because anyone who has seen any of the previews of this movie knows that this new guy is the bad guy he has greater power then the others because hes older i think anyways bob loblaw say it out loud things happen and we get to the final fight in the moviebr br to be honest i was all game for a witch battle you know like saurmon vs gandalf or anything along the lines with magic battle because you know this is about witches and stuff now when these two witches throw down its more of likehow can i put ita very very crappy version of a dragonball z type battle they throw stuff at each other talk throw stuff talk throw stuff talk etc when i say throw stuff i only say that because i have no clue what the fk their throwing at each other it looks like big gobs of slimy water god this movie sucks anyways when our main witch ascends he doesnt get very powerful at all he just throws bigger gobs of slimy water things happen and it ends in a way that you as the viewer know its gonna end the good witch wins bad witch losesbr br you know how shitty a movie is when the bad guy says something so incredibly stupid as im gonna make you my wiotch thats where i wanted to punch myself in the face for sitting through this wholethingbr br yes i admit the thought of witches doing battle using powers in the modern day does sound kinda cool but when the execution is this bad i really wished they didnt make this movie maybe if it was rrated had tits and threw in more deaths with a dash of gore it might have workedmight have workedbr br if your interested in watching this dont buy it or even rent it wait for it to come on tv or borrow it from your sucker of a friend who bought it just dont waste your time with this hack of a movie if you spend any money on it theres a good chance your putting an effort towards a sequel to be made by uwe boll called the covenant 2 alone in the dark with the house of the dead
