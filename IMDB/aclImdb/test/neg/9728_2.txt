no one really knows how the power came to be not even the book of damnation recorded its beginning but those who mastered it have always been hunted the families of ipswich formed a covenant of silence bla bla bla after this intro we suddenly see take that or was it nsynch the backstreet boys perhaps well i dont know which of these they belong to but one things for sure the descendants of salem are a boyband can you tell them apart i couldnt if you can tell me which is which id very much appreciate it these boyband boys looks so damn alike seriously now is this a horror movie or a film for teenieboppers its sad that the anyway weak horror genre has been kidnapped by teens and this is one of the teeniest ive seen so far the movie is visually solid but the cast is so bland the acting so awful that it was a trial finishing the movie as bad as the cast was after all boybands and fashion models are rarely good actors the absolute standout in this regard was the guy playing the villain sebastian stan this guys overacting is right up there with the worst in the history of film i have rarely seen someone make such annoying and silly grimaces in such a short space of time whats worse he has the most babyface of all the boyband babyfaces in the entire cast i mean its a joke
