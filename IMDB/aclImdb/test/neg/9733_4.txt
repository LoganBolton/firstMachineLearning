basic summary ipswitch used to be a community of witches and escaped the salem witch hunts by forming a covenant of secrecy the first born males descended from these families have supernatural powers and must come to terms with the seductive addictive nature of using those powersbr br well i usually give movies the benefit of the doubt and start from a 5 going from therebr br production 1 for very obvious audio out of sync 1 for nicely done special effects the darkling actually gave me chills 05 for nice colorization i like the dull blue 05 for the stupid sound track 05 for the opening sequence  im a sucker for stylish compositing and flashy title designbr br story  script 1 for decent main idea 05 for dbzmatrixstreet fighter ripoffpastiche 1 for not explaining some plot threads very well spiders darkling 1 for boring predictable ending 1 for gratuitous exposition both as words on the screen and as bland monologuingbr br acting  characterization 05 for bad bad acting although it gets a little better as the film progresses 1 for lack of character development especially among all the femalesbr br other 1 for gratuitous male and female nudity which is fun to watch and 05 for no sex scenes which for this genre are usually done very badly and end up being boring rather than hot 1 for hitting its target audience teenage scifihorrorthriller fans even though this movie is not exclusively any of those genresbr br conclusion this is not a film this is a movie theres really nothing to analyze its just good relatively clean fun lots of really attractive actors and actresses lots of boys fighting in the style of dbz and street fighter if you like cute actors and actresses supernatural special effects andor mindlessly fun plots this movie is for you if you prefer oscarworthy exquisitelyproduced film masterpieces with tons of multilayered allegorical plot threads and groundbreaking visualization techniques you probably wont like this filmbr br using my twisted logic this movie gets a 410
