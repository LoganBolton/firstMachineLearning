despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century erwin rommel is generally wellregarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman a soldiers soldier and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare if only hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in africa the argument goes things would have gone very differently and thats probably true rommel was in fact a military genius and by all accounts an upstanding honest manbr br but this film goes out of its way to portray him as a nearsaint he does his job trying to win the war for hitler but constantly the fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders which rommel james mason expresses amazement with but rarely actually questions and never ever disobeys only when its patently obvious that hitler is leading germany to ruin does rommel think of treason against him this dilemma plays out as the main theme of the film a good man in bad circumstances trying to do the right thingbr br mason is fine as rommel but its hardly a memorable performance along the lines of say george c scott as patton of course rommel wasnt as colorful as patton but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent human being that it forgets to make him interesting he occasionally lapses into some warmth when with his wife lucie a young jessica tandy wellcast but usually mason is called upon to give a stiff british performance Â– as if the brits were trying to claim rommel for themselves though in all fairness all the nazis have english accents except hitlerbr br done on the cheap with any battle scenes swiping stock footage and the beaches of southern california doubling for tunisia theres nothing to particularly recommend this film a remake could be interesting id pick ed harris only because of a slight physical resemblance and well harris can act were it spiced up a little but this movie mostly demonstrated to me how much more demanding we as viewers have become in the last fifty years a biography this bland would never cut it any more
