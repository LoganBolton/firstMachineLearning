for me this movie was a disappointment somehow i expected that it would explain the reason for general rommels popularity and his success as a military strategist in ww ii but there is none of that it deals with the last year or two of his life and tries in a way to whitewash him so i just have to suppose that rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical technocrat in the conquering and killing business without any particular charm or notoriety in behaviour such real life people just do not make good movie material i almost feel sorry for james mason really one of my favorite actors who had to impersonate a pretty wooden character actually a good director and a lot of great acting talent was wasted on this movie  with the exception of luther adler who gives a really memorable and weirdly naturalistic portrayal of adolf hitlerbr br there might also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the german speaking world famous british actors impersonating germans are just not credible rommel for example is perceived here not just as a german but as a typical southerner from badenwürttemberg you immediately think of a certain dialect a certain kind of wit a certain way of seeing the world the total opposite of eg a prussian junker i also think that there are now mixed feelings about the assassination attempt of july 20th many of those who were in on the conspiracy were not democrats and just wanted the german troops to join the western allies against the advancing bolsheviks thus prolonging the war foreverbr br the best movie portrayal of an intellectual intelligent military mind is in my opinion still patton 1970 incidentally general patton can be glimpsed for a short moment in the ample documentary footing used for this movie a low angle shot while he is inspecting passing vehicles the open holster and the revolver with the mother of pearl grips are clearly visible
