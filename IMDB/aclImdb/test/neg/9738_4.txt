perhaps its just me but this movie seemed more like sequel or followup than the separate project why when it was filmed just few years after the war most of the viewers probably knew why rommel was so famous why his death was so important to allied why he was hitlers favorite general but now 50 years later it isnt so obvious anymorebr br desert fox the story of rommel is a decent war movie but its just isnt in any way explained how rommel did get his nickname what was he doing that allied considered him as their best general why their soldiers were so afraid of afrika korps thats what is missing in this movie  we see his fame his character his way to treat soldiers and enemies but fe we also see that hitler was complaining about his achievements in africa calling him coward etc so were missing the big picture here  it is the story of rommel but unfortunately the desert fox part is missing
