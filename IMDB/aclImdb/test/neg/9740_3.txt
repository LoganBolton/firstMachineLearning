this is a stupid movie when i saw it in a movie theater more than half the audience left before it was half over i stayed to the bitter end to show fortitude i caught it again on television and it was much funnier still by no means a classic or even consistently hilarious but the family kinda grew on me i love jessica lundy anyway if youve nothing better to do and its free on tv you could do worse
