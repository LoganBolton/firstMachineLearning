how this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me the test that postal workers take is so difficult there is no way that a guy this stupid can work at the post office everyone in this movie is just stupid and that is probably the point of the movie how they could go their entire lives and not see an elevator is also puzzling i didnt take this movie too seriously but it was so stupid then he tries to start the car without his keys lots of horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all its just a sad stupid mess i liked the moms dress thoughbr br send it back to sender as soon as possible
