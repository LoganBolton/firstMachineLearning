i dont care what anyone else says this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film what was john landis thinkingbr br i know its based on a series of childrens books but cmon even kids hate this movie its pointless and boring tom arnold once again amply demonstrates that his only talent is wasting production moneybr br i think the only reason the stupids hasnt appeared on the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 or so people will admit to watching this garbage at least hobgoblins made it on mst3k
