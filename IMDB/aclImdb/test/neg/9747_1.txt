would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word stupid over and over again probablybr br this is arguably the worst movie ive ever seen seriously there are better movies on mystery science theater 3000 i saw this movie for the first time at a friends birthday party when it was still in theaters even though it was actually with friends and at one of their birthday parties i had to leave i actually had to leave i just excused myself and walked out fortunately some of the parents were doing the same thing so i didnt look like a total jerk anyway this film is awful there is nothing to like about it its painfully as in actually causing physical pain slow and sickeningly literally does induce vomiting unfunny you almost feel sorry for tom arnold but then you dont because you remember he was actually in the movie it really does pain me to even think about itbr br it was on tv a few months ago and i decided i had to watch it all the way through just once i remembered then why i walked out in the first place and felt guilty for boosting its ratings by even one viewer the gags arent funny the characters arnt interesting its just a senseless mess of pratfalls and stupiditybr br there is a small crowd of theneightyearold kids who watched the movie when it came out and considered it brilliant if you think that having your face removed piece by pece with an ice cream scoop is brilliant then by all means go rent it but if you have any dignity whatsoever avoid this big stupid mess altogether score 010  maybe a negative 1 actually
