this is probably the only film ive seen where the imdb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100 accurate the stupids is an atrocious dimwitted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever and is a denigration to a director like john landis and thats what makes it greatbr br in order to appreciate the stupids you have to keep in mind a littleknown but very true maxim spoken by director abo kyrou i urge you to learn to look at bad films they are so often sublime in order for any film to work the film must establish and follow its own logic and if it does so convincingly and sincerely then its actually possible for the film to work for example when you watch freddy got fingered as a traditional grossout comedy its complete and utter garbage when you watch it with the understanding that its actually a neosurrealist comedy its brilliantbr br it works with good movies too if jaws hadnt accepted the reality it created the airtank explosion ending wouldnt have worked but a lot of people think jaws is vastly overrated for this type of reason and they arent wrong but it has its strengths doesnt it the point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective some people like me get it right away while others never will no matter how often its explained jim jarmusch made a compelling defense of showgirls once and even afterwards i still cant see it from his pov doesnt mean hes wrong though if you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie and no i do not mean stoned im gonna put that to bed right now you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb cheap pointless slapstick late80searly90sstyle farce that it isbr br the defenders and haters of this film are right its stupid and thats the point the movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way the jerk accepted navin johnsons idiocy and because it takes that and runs with it the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters a bad movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along whereas movies like the stupids knows where its going what its doing and why from the beginningbr br i cant defend the film from an artistic standpoint which is why i give it such a low rating the acting is mostly bad the jokes very superficial and the liveaction quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon but i cant deny that it is entertaining in its own way and thats why i defend it i got it right away and i pity those who dontbr br ill admit i was drawn to this movie because of christopher lees delicious cameo appearance hearing him say release the drive bee would have been worth the rental price even if i hated this film but was amazed to find that aside from the tv studio applause sign segment with jenny mccarthy i was never bored and never disappointed in fact many of the jokes because of their cartoonish context were hilarious in particular the airbagcigarette explosion they were dumb but they were funny and the movie doesnt pretend to be anything else a stupid comedy about stupid characters and instead of apologizing for it it enjoys itselfbr br and thats exactly why it works
