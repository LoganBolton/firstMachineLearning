i just saw this movie i liked the soundtracki saw first the trailer and was magnificent like all hollywood movies they know how to sellbut the movie is almost awful first 30 minutes are interesting but then like almost all new movies they blow it up i dont get the idea why that kid diedis a clich√© every nigga movie must have a kid to be killed and everybody must become good after his deathloli dont understand what is the connection with the movie and is so predictable you know the end from the very first minutesnothing new in this movie i saw you got served same idea but also something new this is something like honey but is not a little bit difference between themif you have no other option watch this movie but be sure is the last option you take and the choreography is worst than everything before this is not a must see for sure
