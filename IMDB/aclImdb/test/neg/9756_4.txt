going into the movie with the right expectations i somewhat liked this movie like most reviewers who have seen this movie i fully agree that the plot was razor thin clich√©d and i could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie but the dancing sequences were very well done and i really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hiphop dance both which i enjoy watching the musicsoundtrack of the movie was also very good which made the drama scenes more bearable the leads jenna dewan and channing tatum were ok as actors but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizingbr br all in all a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences and this movie is much much much better than you got served in terms of the plot and drama then again that doesnt say much does it p
