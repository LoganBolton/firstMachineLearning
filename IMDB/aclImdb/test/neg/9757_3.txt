teenage exorcist is one of those godawful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics adolescent humour and empty writing this film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver it is about a girl moving into a house where a baron de sadehmmm once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon her sister and brotherinlaw along with an irish priest her boyfriend and a pizza delivery boy try to save her and exorcise her demon well not much here in way of horror or suspense in fact one line from the film pretty much sums up what to expect mikethe girls brotherinlaw has tied herthe name is diane by the way and she is played by brinke stevens up after trying to chainsaw her sister he removes a gag from her mouth and says something like this wont be the last gag we see tonight indeed it was not the special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted and the film makes use of this by playing on its comedic appeal some of the lines and situations are funny robert quarry old count yorga himself really steals his scenes as an irish priest he hams it up wailing biblical verses and crooning irish songs you know you are in trouble however when eddie deezen gets top billing deezen does his schtick and has a couple nice moments as well but the material is just too threadbare than to be anything more than teenage sophomoric time filler michael berryman from the hills have eyes also has a brief but interesting cameo in the film as for the other thespians well they are all pretty good at being pretty mediocre stevens is lovely in fishnet stockings and frenchcut panties but beyond that dont expect too much more from her her sister is played by elena sahagun and she shows a bit more than brinkea very lovely young lady by the way and out acts brinke by miles her husband played by jay richardson shows off his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity again not a bad film to waste a little time that involves no thinking on if you are a robert quarry fan watch it for his performance at the very least
