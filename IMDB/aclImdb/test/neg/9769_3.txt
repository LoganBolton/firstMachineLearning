im going to be generous here and give it a 3 only because i live in huntsville and it was great to see how well the city was filmed that said this movie was pretty bad its like they started off with hardly any script and the director just told the actors to stare at each other meaningfully with a lot of music playing over it and billy d williams looked like hed rather be anywhere but in this movie its just a mess i think i could write a script better than the dislodge for this film and im no writerbr br there is one thing ive seen mentioned throughout the reviews and message boardseveryone is under the impression that the movie begins around world war 2 and actually it seemed more like it was supposed to start out in the late 1950searly 1960s while the military was not segregated by then im pretty sure that any troops waiting to board a train would still be segregated in a place like huntsville al if the beginning of film was supposed to be the 1940s then billy d lesley ann  rae dawn would have to have been in the 70s and 80s instead of their mid 50s or early 60sbr br dont waste your time unless you really really like the actors because the story isnt very interesting
