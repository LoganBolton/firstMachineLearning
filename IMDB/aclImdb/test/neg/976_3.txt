watching showtime i got the impression that the producers got the idea to put robert deniro and eddie murphy just for the sake of having a film that costarred the two of them other than that i cant think of a reason to justify the films existence not that it isnt amusing in spots it certainly is but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat mutedbr br the thing that really got me was eddie murphys character i cant seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job when i was working person at new york state crime victims board i had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs but i cant think of one who thought that this was just something i do until i get my career going in an area far afield i mean can you really see eddie murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real police academy not the screen version just to get a day jobbr br anyway deniro is your basic hard working detective whos on the trail of a major gun dealer hes undercover and murphy is part of his backup so what does the showboating murphy do he calls a reality based tv series like cops to film the action br br so deniros bust gets blown sky high but the producer of the show gets some good footage of murphy and deniro and decides on a new reality based television series so these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working deniros case with all the tv cameras aroundbr br eddie murphys a funny guy i loved him in beverly hills cop and in the doctor doolittle movies but hes done better things than showtime and robert deniro certainly has br br i guess murphy wanted a chance to work with deniro and deniro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film
