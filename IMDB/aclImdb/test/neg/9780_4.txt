this is another alien imitation and not a very good one at thatreplace outer space with the south african desertthrow in the same ingredientsa group of people stranded in an inhospitable landscape have them hunted down by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film trying to ape a classic film a group of miners and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert stripped clean of fleshtheir vehicle breaks down and they head for civilisation while being stalked by the monster the african location is pretty enough but that is basically all this film has going for it there is a vain attempt to build up the tension but i found this didnt really work and made the film rather boringthe creature didnt appear much and when it did it didnt really install a feeling of horrorthere is one scene where someone gets the flesh ripped from his arm but that was basically it on the gore front in conclusion i found this film about as exciting as watching paint dryi give this film 410 and that is only because of the interesting location which alone isnt enough to save this movie from being a total snoozefest
