being a former mst3k watcher even i found this movie unwatchable the awful attempts at humorheck the awful attempts at acting nobody needs to read a harangue on this piece of junkbr br i just like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by cast members or family friends just click on their other reviews and wowthey are all reviewing modern vampires give me a couple of bucks and i can make a movie better than this one of the most incompetent pieces of filmmaking ive ever seen and thats saying something watch at your own riskbr br rating 010
