its impossible to make a film based on such a book as the brothers karamzov by fm dostojevskybr br richard brooks is a great director but that film is on a very low levelbr br the worst part of the film was the ending well lets think of the book in the end we have the guilty dimitrij karamazov afterwards they sent him to siberia in the end the famous epilogues of dostojevsky the friends and family making a plan to save him but thats it  a nd now the film takes two steps more and shows us an illusion ending of the escape of dimitry and gruschenkai think just from the moral point im sure that dostojevsky would finish the book with an open end because one the one hand he is not guiltysmerdjakov is the real murderer and so he have to be a free man but on the other hand he goes to his father to kill him so he has decided to commit the crime thats a moral dilemma and so the following point is an open endwell for real its just not full openbr br william shatner as aljoscha karamazov im sorry  nobr br the others characters playing in a good performance as we have to expect it from such great actors  in front of course a superb performance of yul breynner as dimitrij i think that there are not many actors who can play this part in a better waybr br but as i said in the beginning this book is unadaptable it never should be film in two hours thats impossible i think that there are some longer films so maybe they could do the right thing but i just keep the opinion that this book cant be adaptedbr br so  3 pointsbr br a point for the great director richard brooks br br a point for a superb performance of yul brynnerbr br finally a point for one of the greatest writers of all time dostojevsky
