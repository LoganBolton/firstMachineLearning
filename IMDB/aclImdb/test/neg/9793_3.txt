a tedious yawn of a film that retains nothing of the zing and raciness of its predecessor gold diggers of 1933 the production code was firmly in place by the time of this films release so the humour is all of the hokey wockawocka variety and gone are the dry oneliners that sounded so cosmopolitan dripping off the lips of the gorgeous dames from the first film a cast of secondtier stars and character actors go through the motions here and the puttin on a show motif seems awfully forced instead of the make or break world of broadway the show here is a charity event hosted by a swanky hotel who really cares whether or not the show goes on the score here is bland too of course the movies big number is lullaby of broadway which accompanies a long fantasy dance number about a new york socialites eventual demise from too much partyingdoesnt exactly have the same effect as the searing forgotten man number used as the finale in 33 busby berkeley directs as well as choreographs this film and whatever promise is built up in the films fluid opening scenes quickly deteriorates unfortunately no one learned any lessons from this and there was yet another gold diggers movie two years laterbr br grade c
