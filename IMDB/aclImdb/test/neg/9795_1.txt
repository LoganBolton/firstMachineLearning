dreadful a friend of mine who obviously thought i had an abysmal sense of humour recommended thisbr br its bobbins i almost switched it off it is only my anal desire to not leave things unfinished that prevented me doing sobr br this was evidently a british attempt to make a movie with a bunch of also ran tv actors using some lame script from their mate in the business i struggle to think of anything even approaching the paucity of this movie less funny than global warmingbr br im not normally so vehement but i watched this well over ten years ago and thought that i wasted an hour or so of my life on it is destructivebr br puerile plot less useless toshbr br id rather eat my feet than watch it again
