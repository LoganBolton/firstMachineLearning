big spoilers flesh feast of 1970 is a more than unworthy conclusion to the great veronica lakes career this has the wide reputation of being an awful stinker and rightly so i must say as a huge fan of lowbudget horrorexploitation especially from the 70s i nonetheless chose to watch this mainly due to the cool camplooking picture on this site but after watching it i had to recognize that the picture actually has nothing to do with the film the picture here on this site is the cover of a dvd collection entitled flesh feast containing four films including sergio martinos mountain of the cannibal god and dal tenneys i eat your skin what the collection does not include however is this boring turkey flesh feast is not only camp and ridiculous but mostly quite tedious which is even more pathetic regarding that the film is only 70 minutes long also dont get fooled by the title the film is not gory at all yet it is watchable if only for its trashiness and especially the extremely stupid but therefore somewhat entertaining ending the film follows a ridiculous plot about dr elaine frederick veronica lake an ingenious female scientist who can somehow rebuild youth with the help of flesheating maggots dont ask how a bunch of criminals or terrorists or whatever who are paid by a radical political group assign the doctor to restore the youth of a mysterious commander after an endless hour of nonsensical drivel it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually hitler himself it was quite obvious before but i still had to burst out laughing because the films finale was so unbelievably silly and unintentionally hilarious this is a film that is very inadequate as the last film of a great actress and former beauty queen like veronika lake except for lake the performances are ridiculously bad even for a zerobudget production like this bad performances however are something i can easily forgive in films like this one what i can not forgive though is extreme boredom the final five minutes make this watchable for hardcore fans of camp stuff but i would still recommend to skip it
