once upon a time way back in the 1940s there lived an actress named veronica lake a beautiful talented young woman who was once in high demand for many bigbudget hollywood pictures fast forward to the late 1960s age alcoholism and allaround bad luck has tarnished everyones favorite actress now a hasbeen miss lake decides the time has come to follow in the foot steps of her peers joan crawford and bette davis and fall back on good ol reliable horror but flesh feast really she couldnt have possibly been that washed up to put it delicately flesh feast is a lifeless pile garbage possibly one of the top 5 worst films ive ever seen and ive seen them all lake plays a scientist who is plotting with nazis to bring hitler back to life with youth restoration experiments involving maggots thats right maggots unless youre a huge fan of heather hughes run away and never look back br br i know very little about this veronica lake person as well as 40s flicks but to think that such a successful career actually became that dismal is actually pretty sad flesh feast is almost impossible to get through and by almost i mean absolutely directed by brad grinter director of nudist camp pictures and the man who coincidentally brought us the greatest bmovie ever made blood freak just a couple years later one has to wonder is this what blood freak would have been like if grinter hadnt codirected with steve hawkes if so then god bless steve hawkes you wouldnt think that a religious dopeblood craving turkey monster could be that much better than experiments involving maggots and hitler but it really really is so forget you ever heard of this one and go find blood freak its just waiting to entertain you fast forward a couple years later veronica lake dies of hepititas broke and forgotten the end i hate you flesh feast 110
