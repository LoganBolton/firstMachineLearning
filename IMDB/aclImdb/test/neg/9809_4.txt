pretty twisted horror film that has a few good moments here and there with some creepy blood transfusion scenes however its just too dull for its own good all the characters are ok and the story while had a lot of potential is rather dull however the blood transfusion scenes looked frighteningly real and as a result they were extremely disturbing its well made and decently written and it started out really interesting but it just couldnt keep up the pace plus i found the ending to be disappointing linnea quigley has no more then a very small role in this so i was also disappointed about that and stephen knight does a good job as the lead as he was pretty twisted plus i got this in a dvd horror set called a taste of evil along with a bunch of other horror films there is lots of bloodhowever its not all that gory and for its low budget it was pretty well done however as i said it just couldnt sustain its interest this is a pretty twisted horror film that has a few good moments here and there with some creepy blood transfusion scenes however its just too dull for its own good i would passbut i guess its worth a watch if you have nothing better to do the direction is ok elly kennernorman thaddeus vane do an ok job here with decent camera work and doing a good job on its low budget however the pace is too inconsistent for my liking the acting is actually alright stephen knight is great as the lead he was creepy twisted sick and gave a very creepy performance the most creepy thing about it though was he seemed like a normal person linnea quigley did well in her small role christopher mcdonald is ok i guess sin his short time rest of the cast are ok as well overall i would pass but i guess its worth a watch if you have nothing absolutely better to do 12 out of 5
