but unfortunately no one thought about having van killed in order to save this doomed production the only positive thing about him in the film is his nice singing voicetoo bad the songs are mostly insipid and sappy why did i hate van so much well throughout the film he seemed like he was doing a thirdrate soupy sales imitationwith lots of mugging bad jokes and way too much energy spent trying to make everyone laugh the worst of these moments was when he was teaching the classthese kids laughed at everything he did heck van could have read the phone book or showed them autopsy photos and they probably would have laughed now van was not the only bad casting decision in the filmhe was just the most obvious of course having john gielgud a lovely actor play an asian was ridiculous as well as having michael york play peter finchs brother the bottom line is that because of these insane casting choices the film was doomed from the startand the worst of them was the godawful bobby van now in real life he might have been a lovely person and its sad that in real life he died so young but with the material they gave him here i just wanted to rip out his tongue to get him to be quietbr br now i also mentioned the songsegad those terrible songs the original lost horizon by frank capra was a subtle delight throughoutand not a single song and dance number in the film so why did they decide to add a bazillion songs that did nothing to help the film they only served to make it seem like a gooey messlike the original doctor doolittle combined with lost horizon the end result is a sickly sweet childrens movienot one that can be enjoyed by anyone over 8br br now if you can remove these problems you have the basis of a decent film after all the plot is lovely and is still hidden beneath all the goo peter finch is particularly good though certainly not the equal of ronald colman in the original but considering that the original was a nearperfect classic why bother with this sticky confection who wants to wade through the treacle br br by the way this film was included in the 50 worst films book by harry medved while i too disliked the film it wasnt bad enough to merit inclusion in the book i think it was included mostly because it was such a huge box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared an excellent bookjust not one of the best selections to the hallowed hall of dreck
