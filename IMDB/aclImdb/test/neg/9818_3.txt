essentially a undistinguished bmovie that mysteriously is directed by one of the golden eras major talents fritz lang even with the stellar names of lang walter pidgeon joan bennett and george sanders be prepared for a ludicrous storyline bad acting patently phony sets and miscasting for transparency sake i have to admit i am an ardent nonadmirer of walter pidgeon who was lucky to have found a niche at the artificial dreamfactory of mgm and somehow worked in secondary roles supporting greer garson and others he is wildly miscast acting in a chipper 30sray milland madcap comedy tone in a role where his life is in danger and he is in hiding joan bennetts cockney accent is excessive but her lacquered hair perfect makeup and classy outfit belies a streetwise cockney slumgirl george sanders is incapable of bad acting but disappears after the preposterous opening finds pidgeon somehow pretending to shoot adolph hitler surprising for fritz lang is the unevenness of tone i found the film wavered uneasily between occasional moments of suspensethriller surrounded by lighthearted comedic interplay hitchcock totally reversed the ratio using comic relief to occasionally pace the suspense there is a reason this film is unknown it didnt serve or propel anybodys career or reputation and is forgotten because its a surprisingly bad film from such a pedigreed group
