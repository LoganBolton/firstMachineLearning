even though this films trailer and poster imply that sally hemmings was an important character i might not have been as shocked to discover she was just a minor and i do mean minor character if this movie was suppose to being told by sallys very own family i mean if you are going to tell the story of a member of your family that has been ignored by history would you really tell it with the man who relegated her to obscurity at the main character his other lover who happens to be white as the actual love interest i know i wouldnt i am as pale as they come and normally a big fan of merchentivory flicks but i couldnt stomach this films treatment of poor sally hemmings
