to remake lost horizon as a musical the need for a rodgers  hammerstein or lerner  lowe type musical composition was needed burt bacharach and hal david were the wrong choice having said that my favorite thing about lost horizon is its score its just that the score doesnt fit the piece the cast is madeup of mostly nonmusical talents ullman finch and hussey were all dubbed and still dont sound all that greatbr br frankly the novella on which this and the earlier nonmusical film versions were based is mediocre at best while the possibilities for a truly good cinematic musical version exist they are not realized here the film succeeds at being a good rainyday vehicle to pass the time otherwise you are better off buying the cd of its soundtrack only recommended as a curiosity piece due to the films awful reputation ive seen much better but ive seen much worse
