the girl in lovers lane is one strange little lowbudget film on its surface the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named bix brett halsey who spends his time looking out for a young kid named danny lowell brown and the girl carrie joyce meadows that bix meets who would like to look out for him nothing overly interesting happens bix goes out with carrie bix gets danny out of trouble carries father drinks a lot etc until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when carrie is murdered her father blames bix pulls him out of a jail cell and just about beats him to death now their roles are reversed and danny has to save bixbr br until i read the reviews on imdb i thought that maybe it was just me reading more into bix and dannys relationship than was really there but i see now that im not alone it was quite obvious to me early on that bix and danny had more of a relationship than you usually see in a movie from 1959 the homosexual nature of their relationship while never openly expressed is still quite obvious their living and sleeping arrangements bixs reaction to finding danny in bed with a prostitute bixs inability to commit to carrie and that phone call at the end when danny tells his parents hes brining home a friend are a few examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that theres more to their relationship than initially meets the eye im sure they exist but i cant think of any movies ive seen from the 50s that scream homosexual quite as loudly as this onebr br as for the movie i dont know any other way to put this Â– its boring as i wrote earlier nothing much at all happens for 90 of the run time the characters are dull and the actors arent good enough to give the girl in lovers lane much of a spark the lone exception is jack elam his crazy jesse is the one character interesting enough to be worth watching elam had creepy down pat but i guess the biggest problem i had with the movie was with character motivation and logic carrie is killed and bix is immediately blamed what about crazy jesse who has been stalking carrie for probably her whole life anyone think to ask jesse where he was that night her father has seen him bother carrie at the diner yet he never considers that the leering jesse might have something to do with his daughters death not a lot of logic there and what about jesses confession danny grabs jesse by the lapel and this is all it takes to force a confession out of jesse real tough guy huh why would he confess so easily and after he confesses no one thinks to grab him its awfully nice of jesse just to stay put and not run off in any other reality he would have never spilled his guts and would have run like a rabbit if he had been fingered for the murder the fact that the girl in lovers lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions on the part of the characters is something im not willing to do overall im giving the girl in lovers lane a 410
