here is a movie that was so pedestrian for 90 of it that it had no right to become so challenging and frustrating at the end did the director decide to become auteur suddenly 80 through the making of this movie yeesh spoiler alert thing start out typically enough for 50s youthgonewild there are drifters good girls bad girls gangs the kindly old diner manager and the town creep things follow the expected path until about 15 minutes before the end when the only likable character is killed off and the antihero is blamed this would not be so unexpected if this were the main plot of the movie but all this stuff starts happening and unravelling during the final reel major curve ball then things get weird the kindly old codger forms a mob and beats the hero to a bloody pulp the mere presence of the heros friend somehow drags a confession out of the real killer  the leering creepy town nut which in any real universe hed have been the prime suspect to begin with even if the antihero was found with her bodybr br were left with a somewhat feeble happy ending which is about as out of character with the rest of the movie as the events of the 10 minutes preceding itbr br even more odd is this films insistence on playing homosexual innuendo to the hilt but constantly presenting the two male leads as straight maybe this was on purpose  perhaps bixs resistance to settling down with the girl was more because of his sexuality which in the 50s would have to be kept quite repressed and thus not discussed or even admitted by him than his need to be a drifter if the directors intent was to spin this as a sexual yarn  that the drifter drifts because he feels hes an outcast sexually that his paternal regard towards danny is not in fact paternal but spousal that his inability to remain with carrie is rooted in a sexual revulsion that even he does not quite understand  it could have been made more clear instead we get this very bizarre alchemy of homoeroticism and behavior that is completely heterosexualbr br these young men sleep next to each other even when they can get some room to spread out when danny is propositioned and once even in bed with a woman bix flips out and takes him away danny pays bixs way sure there is another explanation for it but it still strikes a chord every time you see danny buy bixs lunch they end up living together at the end not since hitchcocks rope has homosexuality been so blatant but deniedbr br mst3k did the right thing by taking this one on aside from jack elam there is little to commend the film
