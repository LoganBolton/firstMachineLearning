this film is terrible not only is the story unbelievable the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly to the point where it isnt shocking i find it sad that daisy eagan star of broadways the secret garden decided that this would be a career step the idea is interesting two young girls coming of age very quickly but the sex isnt even arousing the film is silly the story is silly the performances are silly and the whole concept while interesting falls flat im sure all 14 year old girls make out with guys after theyve had their first period and tried to flush their panties down the toilet better luck next time guys my scale  tscale
