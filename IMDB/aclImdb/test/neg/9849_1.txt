there are so many things wrong with this movie i dont even know where to begin the story is not cohesive at all i guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching hisher head in confusionbr br heres what i remember of the movie before i was bored into unconsciousness a quasiabusive dad chases some preteen sisters through a house but turns out to be not that abusive after all in the next scene the girls are about 15 theyre driving with their parents and hit a deer the deer must have been explosive because their car blows up one sister drags the other from the burning wreckage then the girls are drifting in a boat on a lake and make a huge plan to go to kentucky  and start a new life in the very next scene the girls are hitchhiking toward a military base and what a military base it is actually its more like a hog farm converted to look like a military base with plenty of confused extras playing soldiers the base commanders office is particularly awesome because there are random things like an ak47 hanging on the wall and a drill sergeant hat mounted to a plaque  so the audience is sure to know that this is a military guys office then some random dude pushing a motorcycle shows up and the base commander orders him to go into town to buy some porn mags and to make sure the soldiers dont think that hes on the pink team so our character takes a pickup converted to look like an army truck to town and loads up a box from a nondescript book store with a blowup doll by the front door the girls hide in the guys truck when he stops to gas up and look through the porn stash to find items inside like the anal invader i guess thats enough of the plot to scare most people away plot aside the sound quality is terrible and the movie is full of cheesy attempts at symbolism like a radio preacher talking about forbidden fruit during the scene where the slutty sister meets the main character for the first time or how the camera lingers way too long on certain shots to try to convey a messagebr br if you ever see this for sale or rent or whatever stay away its not worth the money in either case
