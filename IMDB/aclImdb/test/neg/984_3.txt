i always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a sneak preview at some of the old movies that are rereleased on dvd before you purchase them that way you could save yourself some time money and a certain degree of aggro when you feel so utterly let downbr br the buddy holly story is such a moviebr br i do not wish to go into the characterizations or the holes in the plot or the messing around with historical facts that this movie encompasses for i had already come to terms with them twenty years ago when i first began watching itbr br i had recorded it on the old monaural beta machine back in the early 1980s and liked it so much that it became a regularlyplayed favourite the best part to my mind was gary buseys performance as the young buddy and his nearperfect vocals and guitar playingbr br i looked forward to the day when i could have it in stereo and that is where the disappointment comes inbr br this dvd version is supposedly remastered in both audio and video according to the shell information but im afraid it left me sadly letdown and glancing at my watch wishing for it to endbr br the sound is murky bordering on the unintelligible and so unprofessionally mixed that it had me yearning for the crystalclarity vocals of my old beta tape br br despite what you think of the images or the plot or the characters the real draw card here is the musicand if you cant hear the lead vocals because they are drowned out by the cymbals or the backing harmonies or other ambients then theres not much left is there br br im going to convert my old beta version to mono dvd for subsequent viewings and put this one where it belongs out with the rubbish br br extinction is the rule survival is the exception
