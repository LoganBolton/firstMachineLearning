the tv show was slow moving and the offbeat characters were sometimes irritating only through the miracle of fast forward was i able to make it through the first 2 hours br br the writeup indicates that its some kind of comedymystery but i didnt see much of either br br if it really picks up after the first 2 hours please let me know because i doubt that i will watch the rest without a recommendationbr br this review is supposed to be without spoilers so i will continue in a vague nonspoiler fashion i found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic i found myself asking would a normal adult do that the man with the hedge trimmer looking out the window was irritating and when the male lead interacted with him he looked pathetic would a normal adult put up with someone as irritating as him
