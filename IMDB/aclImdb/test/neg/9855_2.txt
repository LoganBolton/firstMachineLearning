in watching enterprise for the first time as we all no doubt do with all shows i went into it with an open mind enjoying about half of the past star trek efforts and disliking the other halfbr br enterprise has fallen short but this episode a night in sickbay made me seriously question why i bother tivoing the shows from monday night on sci fibr br masking some idea that it is one of those a day in the life episodes in which we learn about what makes certain characters operate as humanoids the writers seemed to forget that this was supposed to be a starship vessel not the ricardoes and the mertzesbr br a planet especially one whose people had been offended previously by the enterprise crew for eating in public was no place for a dog as an animal lover myself i would have never taken one of my pets into an environment that had proved in the past to be tensebr br but what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these st shows constantly depicting things that are sacred and insulting to other cultures as tho they are offering some insight into american religious zealotsbr br the aliens were now offended when the dog urinated on a sacred tree yet the aliens were quite capable of taking the dog urinating as an insultbr br strange how the dogs urinating wasnt regarded as some form of worship i wonder how that one got by the shows writersbr br from there we are subjected to a captain who was misguided by his duties in watching the episode i found it very easy to forget that bakula was supposed to be the ships captainbr br he chose to sleep in sickbay and from there we are given more inanities of behavior sigh that we arent supposed to understand and that causes us to furrow browsbr br the doctor nonchalantly clips long hairy toenails and feeds them to hungry caged animals ewwwwww then a white bat creature escapesbr br oh how is anyone supposed to sleep with all of this going on toenail clipping for crying out loud i was waiting for something that feeds on vomit to be presentedbr br then we were inexplicably given some idea that the captain was in love with tpol and that perhaps he was masking those feelings with his concern over the dogbr br endless amounts of rubbishbr br your dog is ill so go have sex youll feel better and of course the captain had to apologize and we humans had to regard his apology as completely ridiculous because we are so everyone smile very sarcastically narrowminded saw depictions such as this endlessly droned out on tngbr br oddly enough the only thing missing from this awful episode was that trip person offering his smirks and downhome boyisms tho bakula seemed to be covering all of that with the silly dogbr br oh the dog survived so now go play fetch
