i was disappointed in this documentaryi thought it would be about the second chess match between grandmaster garry kasporov and deep blue the supercomputer designed by ibm computer experts to beat any human chess playerkasparov was and still isconsidered the greatest chess player everthe movie takes us back to 1997 where kasporov had agreed to have a rematch with deep blue after defeating it 1 year earlierbut instead of focusing on the gameit focuses more on what happens before and afterthere are snippets of the gamebut not very manymuch of the film centers around kasporovs paranoid obsession that the match was rigged as part of some conspiracy theory and that he lost the match unfairlythe movie also includes interviews with people who are not interesting in any waythey even chat with the manager of the building where the match took placewho caresi also found it very dry and slowultimately this movie was unsatisfyingthis is just my opinionof courseif you like conspiracy theoriesthis movie might interest youfor people not into chess or conspiracy theoriesthis movie would probably have no valuei am a chess fanand i only stuck it out because of thati givegame overkasparov and the machine 410
