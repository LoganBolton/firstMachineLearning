drifting around on bootlegs sometimes thought an urban comic book legend the first ff movie is pretty much as bad as everyone fears i guess marvel comics now pretends it doesnt exist what with the 2005 version out in theaters earlier this year but its out there a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad low budget marvel superhero adaptations captain america punisher most of the tv movies low budget is too easy a description for this ff pic due to basically no funds showing the powers of the super foursome was limited to very quick shots mrfantastic quasianimation torch and fades invisible girlthe easiest to do the thing suit was not bad and probably half the budget the face part was especially almost convincing the acting alex hydewhite as reed is pretty good the other 3 are ok tho jay as johnny acts like a spaz at times to sort of show off his fiery temper the dialog is comicbook style and its the supporting cast which ends up floundering trying to make it work drdoom is way over melodramatic and unintentionally comical and his two main henchmen are a case study of how not to act or write dialogbr br the plot not too good it was quite faithful to the origin story of the ff more so than the later big budget version and even though the nonbudget again restricted showing for example the actual crash landing it kept the essential ingredients of how they discovered their powers in an isolated area  its the best part of the picture tho you have to wait a full halfhour for it i also found the music odd in places when the 4 are bathed in those cosmic rays a kind of church choir is heard as if its a religious experience the rest of it however is hopeless even with no budget the story could have done without the jeweler character resembling the mole man villain of the books it spends way too much time with him and his underground gang as well as the blind alicia these sections are a waste of celluloid and very boring the climactic struggle with doom  his men starts fine but degenerates into an awful mess as the torch races a laser beam cool animation but belonging in a cartoon fans can have a laugh at the bad ff fx and witless storyline if they dont get depressed  outraged first
