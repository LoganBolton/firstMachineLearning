this is truly awful the feeblest attempt at a comics adaptation ever committed to film every possible thing about this movie that could be bad is music acting lighting sets special effects about the only positives i can find are that sue looks cute in her blue tights and that the thing makeup is almost passable face only thats it zip dont bother tracking down that bootleg copy its really not worth your time even the aborted captain america movie from the early 90s is far less excruciating than squirming in your seat while you try to endure this mess
