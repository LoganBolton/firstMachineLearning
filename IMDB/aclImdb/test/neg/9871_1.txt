whether or not this adaptation of the marvel comic was made  and shelved  so its production company could retain the copyright to the characters it doesnt change the fact that its utter rubbish the dr doom and especially thing costumes are surprisingly good but everything else suffers from a deficit of either cash or talent director oley sassone cant even point a camera at stuff without including such howlers as a blind womans pov the dialogue is absolutely dismal the teams costumes dont fit properly and the effects are appalling the human torch seems to be drawn onto the film with felt tip pens while mr fantastics powers are brought to life using a bendy blue stick with a glove on the end joseph culp compensates for having to wear a mask by wildly waving his arms about jay underwood is incredibly annoying the rest of the cast hit various levels of terrible and while its hard not to feel sorry for all these guys who thought this movie would get a release its equally difficult to imagine any of them believing it was actually any good
