i am almost a two decade old human whos been reading comics most of my life im not a huge fan of the fantastic four but im fairly familiar with them in 1994 roger corman bmovie legend produced the first i think feature length fantastic four film the result was such pure schlock that it was never given a release still copies exist mostly on the net and at conventions if youre looking for a laugh and can find a copy do yourself a favor and check this thing outbr br the film basically retells the ffs origin and an encounter with doctor doom and a villain named the jeweler essentially the mole man with a penchant for petty larceny as is the case with these comic book movies everything has to tie into everything so the ff play a vital role in dr dooms creation and he and the jeweler play a vital role in theirsbr br first id just like to mention that despite everything that went bad in this movie i actually sort of liked the guy that played doom he doesnt get many decent lines but when he does he hits them the armor looks pretty good toobr br as for the restits a dirty dirty mess bad plots bad acting bad effects bad everything basically boos especially to jay underwood bringing new meaning to the word overacting as johnny storm hes not overacting hes ultractingbr br as for the ff well they all sort of look right and sues played by a very attractive actress but they just dont seem like a real team for one thing they have no reason for sue and johnny to go into space in an early section ben and reed go to visit the two johnnys like 8 and sues about 12 it only stands to make their eventual romantic pairing a helluva lot creepier the thing costume looks more reptilian than anything else not very rocky and the only time the human torch is really a human torch he looks like the silver surfer tinted redbr br i could type for hours but i think the scene that best sums it up is a climactic encounter featuring the aforementioned notsohuman torch hes racing a laser beam and he eventually destroys it with a punch yes a punch a laser beam with a punch then he flies around and goes yippeee a whole lot whereupon the camera tilts down and he flies back toward earth evidently reed the intellectual forgot to inform johnny that fire doesnt exist in the vacuum of space this and many other scenes operate like looney toones if the character doesnt know they are over a cliff they dont fallbr br i laughed i cried i was glad it was never released
