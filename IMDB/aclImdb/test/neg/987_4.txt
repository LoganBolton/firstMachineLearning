possible spoilers below br br what a long and mostly uninteresting movie who were these characters why didnt i care about them if im going to watch a movie for two hours id like to care about somebody or something br br we know that salvatore dreamed of the riches to be found in the new world beyond that though we learned little about most of his familys hopes fears etc as they embarked on an adventure into the unknownbr br and why was lucy even in this movie she said little we knew little about her or what she was doing was she forced to service men in exchange for being allowed to board the ship or what her plans were upon reaching new york to those who might suggest that she was needed to underscore the point that a single woman however cultured could not get into this country alone i say that that fact is not enough justification to give her so much screen time that point could have been made in five minutes with lucy as a momentary characterbr br more questions why wasnt the twin brother at the boat to meet the family we heard about the brother and some closure on that point would have been helpful in giving the movie some cohesiveness also how long was the journey from italy to new york given the conditions on the ship it makes a difference to the viewer if the voyage took five or 10 or 50 days someone said something about seeing land a week at one point but i think that was when they were already en route i needed these types of details to better appreciate what they were going throughbr br the only scene i really liked was when the boat filled with passengers left the dock br br if you choose to rent this movie do so with remote in hand you may want the fast forward button handybr br finally may i suggest that with the right voiceover providing helpful information about the times and the circumstances for immigrantsparticularly during the slow stretches of endless shots of the countryside people walking etcthis movie might have made an interesting public tv documentary
