ok to start with this movie was not at all like the book i read the book when i was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite when im waiting for a different book to come out this is the book i turn to to fill in the time i have 3 copies for gods sake anyways i knew this was not going to be anything like the book but come on they could have done a little better than this i mean seriously if i wanted to watch american werewolf in paris or london than i would watch those movies they took a perfectly good story and twisted it around into a copy of a story that has been told over and over again and quite frankly im tired of watching it i mean hello the best part of the whole fg sorry story is she ends up with gabriel he doesnt die what was that about and hes old in this movie gabriel is supposed to be only 24 not 44 da it awww and astrid who the he came up with the idea of astrid being vivians aunt no no no no astrid and vivian hate each other awwww anyways yeah that was my little rant seriously pied off hope this helped
