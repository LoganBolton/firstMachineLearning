there were only two redeeming features about this movie the beauty of bucharest and its architecture and the way they depicted the transformation from human form to wolf form forget about the plot or storyline from the book  theyre completely absent from this movie in fact about the only things carried over from the book are the names of the main players even then youll barely recognize the characterizations if the film makers had made a good movie even though unrelated to the book i wouldnt have been so disappointed unfortunately they did not the plot and storyline are typical of low budget horror flicks the acting is wooden and the directorial efforts mundane oh yes the way the loup garou bow to their leader is pure hoke i suppose a nod of recognition is due for the animal handlers the wolves were beautiful animals and well managed in their roles
