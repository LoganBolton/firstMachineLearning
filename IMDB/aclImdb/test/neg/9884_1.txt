this movie was boring very much like underworld only even less interesting its not much of a werewolf movie and no where near a horror film the lead couple were boring i totally didnt care about vivian and aiden and there was so little character development that i didnt care about any character in the film the plot was paper thin the transformations were basically nil i did like the wolves themselves might as well have have done a wolf documentary i would have liked that better i wouldnt recommend this movie i didnt find it fun or interesting it just drags and everyone in it is a boring drag this movie could win an award for how not to make a werewolf film
