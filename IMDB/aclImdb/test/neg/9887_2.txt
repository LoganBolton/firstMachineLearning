i read the book after seeing the movie and didnt care for it finding it somewhat trashy but trashy books often make good movies and this one certainly could have the story of a teen girls exploration of her attractive power over boys which she finds as irresistibly stimulating as it is doubtfully controllable and which has an even tighter grip on her than it would on a normal girl because it affects her through her werewolfrythis story would have an obvious appeal to the young audience for which movies are made an appeal of one kind to girls and of another kind to boys and i dont understand how the movie makers could be blind to that and turn the story into one with little appeal to anybodybr br to begin with take the title which is the best thing about the book its drawn from a hesse quotation also used as an epigraph about a person running in fear and tasting both blood and chocolate in his mouth one tasting as bad as the other this is a wonderful metaphor for the heroines state torn between her human and wolf sides savoring each but equally fearful of both the movie dispenses with the epigraph and instead introduces the character working in her aunts chocolate shop i can understand how the books title might have suggested to the movie makers the erotically charged chocolates of like water for chocolate and led them to want to link the same symbol to werewolves but they didnt so why is it in the movie in the book the characters are in high schoolor in and out as with the five a teen gang who favor black jeans and tshirts and fall somewhere between being the heroines nemeses and her pet peeves in the movie theyve become decadent twentysomething clubgoers in the book the heroine is 16 just of an age to be discovering how her sexuality operates on the boy she wants as well as on herself shes the one who initiates the contact then steps back reinitiates and so on in the movie shes no longer a girl but a woman and the guy is no longer a high school poet on the fringe of campus life but a fugitive from the law and a comic book artist to boot its he who comes on to her in a manner as unattractive as that of her wormy cousin she initially puts him off but then gives in as hes confident she will hey you know you want it i would have thought a female director would have taken the chance the book offered to show a female protagonist in an uncompliant proactive role but nobr br in the book the heroines clan is driven from their home because of the fives delinquent behavior in the movie its because she went for a run shes a great runner prone to kicking off from building walls and both she and her clanmates scale buildings in a trice very like heroes of martial arts movies and very unlike wolves or anything resembling them in the book they dont turn into actual wolves but things bigger than wolves in the movie theyre just ordinary wolves in the book they metamorphose in howling style with crunching of spines this is one of the things that make the heroine aware of the pain her body brings her as well as the pleasure in the movie the werewolves have become magical acrobats taking great swan dives and transforming in midair shimmering yellow like tinkerbell it looks cool means nothingbr br in the book the clan is a slightly whitetrashy family that has relocated from west virginia to maryland in the movie they live in bucharest but all talk in different accents none romanian in the book nearly the whole pack want to lead normal lives and agree that to insure thatand indeed their survivalone necessity is to keep their true nature secret from humans and so the characters keep saying in the movie yet the head of the clan is some kind of underground bossbut apparently not a crime boss since he despises criminalsand has a standing deal with the police who supply him with meat for the pack this seems a big exception to the rule of keeping humans from knowing but maybe the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for eccentricity and cult murderbr br at the end of the book the heroine learns she cant be something shes not when in her effort to live a divided life she gets stuck between the human and animal states unable to be all one thing or the other her boyfriend isnt sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is the pack cant risk having him around and the two are forced to separate in the movie she rescues him like lassie and they drive off to paris why paris in an ending thats smileyfaced but not really happy since the conflicts between their naturesbetween her naturesremain unresolvedbr br but the difference in the movie that hampers enjoyment the most is that whereas the book characters behave conventionally within the realm of young adult novels those in the movie for some reason have been made as annoying as possible every other line is a threat or some other kind of oneupsmanship youll be sorry you dont belong here you wont get rid of me i gave you your chance etc i prefer to steer clear of people who deal in that waybr br there have been many good vampire movies never a good werewolf movie had this one stuck to the book it might have been the firstbr br but no
