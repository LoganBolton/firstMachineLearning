i think the best way for me to review this title is to split it into its pros and consbr br pros  they turn into wolves rather than plasticcartoony monsters  the chase of the wolves through the forest  cash machine by hardfi being playedbr br cons  some parts of the script makes you cringe for example the terrible part where the woman escapes the games of the fortunate five boys and theres about half an hour of dear cousin and a round robin of yes see we know gabriels law  the diving transformation is ridiculous  the obvious and ridiculous ending  aiden being told thousands of times to leave and then goes if you cared about me you would have left me  the obvious characters  the unnecessary parcour  the completely unnecessary slashing of the arm by aiden  cringey speeches by gabrielbr br you see what i meanbr br i adore werewolf films and i tried watching this a few times to see if id like it better but it just made it worse i think ill just read the book and see how i get onbr br dont bother with this unless you have a 12 year old brother or sister into spooky things anyone over that age may suffer and want their hour and a half back
