i should have realized that any twovideo set being sold for only 6 would be bad i even read the reviews before watching this film and that still didnt sway me i loved the book and i knew it couldnt be as bad as people saidbr br yeah it isbr br a patchwork of film video and what appears to be stock footage combine to make a threehour tour of one chapter of james a micheners epic novel well the time period covered was one chapter but i dont remember many of the situations actually occurring in the book the packaging on my copy of the movie gives maria conchita alonso top billing  though it turns out that she is only in one speaking scene on the second tapebr br the actors are to be commended for playing their roles well despite a smarmy overwrought script they are to be insulted though for accepting the roles in the first place
