the texas revolution of 1835 to 1836 including the periods preceding and immediately following is depicted in this mediocre 3hour madefortelevision film whose only redeeming value is bringing light and paying homage to stephen f austin the socalled father of texas whose life story had long been overshadowed by that of the legendary sam houston the rest of the film is simply the usual santa anna is a tyrant storyline and with a weak attempt to show the mexican perspective with a fictional hispanic character displaying stereotypical latin machismo combined with short lowbudget battle scenes such as the alamao and san jacinto this film is recommended only for real history buffs who who do not come from mexico to its credit the mexican uniforms look accurate and the romantic subplot another love triangle doesnt take up too much screen time overall this movie depicts the violent secession movement by texas anglosaxon racial minority to be a positive and just revolution against mexican tyranny as personified by the general antonio lopez de santa anna the socalled napoleon of the west
