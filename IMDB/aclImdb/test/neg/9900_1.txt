this made for tv film is about every clich√© you can come up with for a disaster movie the only problem is it isnt very well donebr br my brain is still insulted from the scenes in which brian dennehy is supposedly looking at a computer monitor looking for weather pattern data and showing on that monitor are stock footage scenes of weather turmoil ala the weather channels commercials why would watching local news footage of a washed out sidestreet give insight to global weather patterns you got mebr br also interspersed through out the first two hours are some of the worst cgi effects known to man watch for the semi truck and the airplane that look like they were rendered on a commodore 64br br all the foreshadowing in this movie is done with the subtlety of a sledgehammer the dialog is forced and i cant think of a likable character that i want to survive the second halfbr br the character i hate the most is the stupid wife whos husband is cheating maybe if she lifted a finger at anytime during the show instead of being a helpless woman who stands in the the same 10 square feet of the kitchen all day her husband wouldnt be sleeping with the pr rep for a rival energy company she is so helpless in fact i want to put her out of her and my misery i hope everyone in this movie dies in the second half
