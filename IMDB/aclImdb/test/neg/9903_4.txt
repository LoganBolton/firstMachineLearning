i think category 6 day of destruction was very unrealistic the digital effects where like a childrens cartoon br br the actors didnt act realistically for example when the girl was shot she acted like she got tomato sauce splatted on her br br the movie was boring but i watched it because it was on br br the only interesting character was tornado tommy he was funnybr br please keep the special effects realbr br i liked the comment what did we do to pissoff mother naturebr br i dont know what else to write to fill up the 10 lines what else can i say the movie is so boring i think my comment will be equally boring
