anyone who complains about peter jackson making movies too long should sit through this cbs event theres about 45 minutes of story padded by 2 hours of unnecessary subplots featuring bland bythebook tv drama clich√©s bad science is a staple for crappy weather disaster movies so im not going to complain about that silly science can be fun to watch if its executed in an amusing fashion what kills this movie is its 10 subplots all of which could be excised without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot the one character that is entertaining to watch in category 6 is tornado tommy despite being a very annoying stereotypebr br note that i also didnt bother commenting on special effects their quality should come as no surprisebr br not recommended
