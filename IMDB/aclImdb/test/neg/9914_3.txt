if you thought day after tomorrow was implausible wait till you see thisbr br okay so the premise of most disaster films is usually a 1 in billion event occurring compounded by other circumstances in this case the even is the joining of two huge storm systems fair enough so far oh but hold up no the event is the sabotage and subsequent destruction of the power gridbr br next throw in loads of human interest elements  in this case a cheating husband a psychotic gunwielding boyfriend a rebellious daughter a hacker with a point to prove a senator trying to push an agenda a reporter trying to stand up against the man and a pregnant women stuck in an elevatorbr br finally add a handful of taster events to add excitementbr br jeez if the director tried to fit in any more meaningless plot lines there would have been no time less for the actual disaster which given the pitiful state of the computer graphics was almost certainly the intentionbr br jeez if you cant even model a truck convincingly you really should not be taking on twisters exploding power stations las vegas getting ripped apart or destroyed oil stationsbr br in case you didnt already gather how appalling this movie is let me just add that all three bad guys get killed in separate and wholly ungratifying implausible manners that stunk more of moralising that good filmmakingbr br im have no problem with first month film students writing jaded hackneyed clich√©soaked scripts but for gods sake that doesnt mean anyone has to make them into moviesbr br it manages to make the abysmally implausible 100 apocalypse look not quite so dreadful avoid them both
