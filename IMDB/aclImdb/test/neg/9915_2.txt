a wasted effort on the surface its a typical disaster movie were involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the big event however the script is so awful and theres so much explaining of the characters background within the dialogue that we feel were being treated like morons even sesame street didnt explain the origins of mr snuffleupagus or how mr hooper died we can work it out someone thought that entering enron into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies the acting is by and large bland with the exception of the older performers randy quaid brian dennehy and after the first hour i couldnt care less about who the storms took outbr br but maybe there are the special effects to watch sadly no even on a 20yearold tv set i could see one tractor and trailer were computergeneratedÂ—badly maybe there are budgetary limitations so i can forgive that one footage of a plane trying to land looked pretty real but i kept telling myself i had seen that before this site confirms it it was from an earlier film nowhere to landbr br so in summary the only good bits are from another film and when you see the best action sequences compressed into a 30second network promo it makes category 6 look quite good my advice rely on your network to do some good 30second clips watch them and save yourself two nights
