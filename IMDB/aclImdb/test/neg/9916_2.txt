i hope that matt dorffs original script for this was much better there are signs of it  dialogue that should happen well before big fx scenes to introduce characters that would make sense much earlier is jammed in later in the timeline perhaps the original script was for a longer runningtime but maybe not  in any case this reeks every character is uninteresting and everybody speaks expository passages as if they are speaking the word of god there are characters that are entirely expository  dianne wiests secretary abbot is just awful explaining things to her assistant and incidentally us in endless speeches that no one would say to anyone ever in real life when she isnt explaining things to her assistant that she already knows her assistant explains things to her that she already knows there are characters who are entirely onedimensional  the evil power company guy the pilot who will just not shut up about his personal life and concentrate on his job the wellmeaning powercompany superdooperuber hackerguy who can crashbr br everything in chicago including the phones  and then gives the ohnowhathavei done speech but not leave himself a back door the crusading reporter who abandons her principles at the drop of a hat the powercompany shift supervisor who abandons his post in the middle of the worst crisis in chicago since the fire  with no consequences hospitals abandoned by the doctors and nurses during the crisis im not kidding thats in the movie br br oh yeah and its filled with hollywood morality clich√©s  generally women are good men are evil unless influenced by a woman the ultimate is the punk with the gun  deprived of a womans influence he literally goes insane an evil stupid act like what the reporter did with hackerbozo is all right so long as you mean well evil men die capitalist evil men die as horribly as possible everybody else lives well except randy quaid and did i hear someone say that the nuclear electrical power generating stations had to shut down because there wasnt electricity to run the safety systems think about that onebr br there is one ray of sunshine if youll pardon the expression  randy quaid basically plays his character from independence day you know  hello boys  im baaaack  this time as a storm chaser with an infiniterange suv and superdooper batteries for his camcorders nevertheless they kill him  mostly it seems so that the audience will appreciate that tornados are pretty dangerous things kinda shallow thatbr br give this one a pass
