this contains some spoiler information but the movie is not worth watching anywaybr br why ellen barkin and peta wilson agreed to be a part of this debacle by writerdirector damian harris is beyond me the story is full of unrealistic police investigating techniques which includes going to a party with a suspect and inviting that suspect over to your house and getting intimate with them the tale also features a male psychiatrist who seems to have nothing but female clients  and he sleeps with them allbr br even more overthetop is the notion that the female victims to a horrendous sm crime belong to a large yet secret group of sm lesbian executivesbr br full of bad editing and continuity errors the film is sterile in all of its ritzy locations  including barkins detective salary apartment and the lame dialogue is fit to put one to sleep br br damian is a bad writer and a bad director he tried and failed miserably to create a noiresque atmosphere at times furthermore he couldnt get ellen barkin to give 110 i firmly believe she realized the film was pathetic and gave up trying br br standouts were peta wilson who wasted time studying with a dominatrix for the part the highly underrated character actor marshall bell gave his absolute best as alwaysbr br and since damian couldnt deliver on any level it was hard to feel emotion for any of the characters br br most importantly he doesnt know much about the real world of bdsm and chose to create the typical hollywood reality of gorgeous men and women who are perverted and dangerousbr br save your time money and braincells and pass this one by
