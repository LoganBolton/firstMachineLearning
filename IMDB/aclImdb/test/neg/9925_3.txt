as much as i love ellen barkin who is really underrated i have to boo this movie if you cant tell who did it and why in the first half hour you obviously have never seen a psychosexual thriller or have never watched 2020 its like the filmmakers and actors didnt care that they way they were shooting it and they way they were playing the characters would be a dead giveawaybr br overall this movie serves to turnon the dirty perverts who like to mix violence and sex not a fun movie to sit through although if you like ellen barkin its nice to see her place a tough lady
