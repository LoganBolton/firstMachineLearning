than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie what was the motive the details of the murders were used but never explained i guess the team got too much into the atmosphere which is great but the story is definitely lacking there is no thread to follow i guess if that was done properly the movie wouldve lasted a bit longer but it wouldve been worth it at least for mebr br casting is very good i loved wilson as the vulnerable vickybr br not much more to say really but i really wish theyve concentrated a bit more on the less obviousbr br
