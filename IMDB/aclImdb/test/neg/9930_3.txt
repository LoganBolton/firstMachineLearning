this film tried but ultimately it was a waste of talent it tried to hard to be sexy im not putting down the works of such actresses as ellen barkin and peta wilson who will find something besides tvs le femme nikita worthy of her talents i just didnt find even in ms wilsons socalled nearseduction scene with mrs barkin any real emotion even though i know the thespians tried very hard to make the scene work if the sexual elements of wilsons disturbed sex victim didnt touch our heart which it didnt even by an ending it didnt deserve neither did the murder element of the plot perhaps it was the script or perhaps the direction but i didnt feel for anyone in this movie and without this feeling a movie doesnt work for me if you are interested in a movie about lesbianism there are a least two films on either side of the specturum to check out 1 the gulity pleasure of bound which works well in a noir setting and 2 the more honest and touching story of a lesbian growing up in hells kitchen called all over me its a welldefined indie from the mid90s that handles that comingofage issue with feeling not forced sexuality both would be a better rental than mercy which has next to nothing
