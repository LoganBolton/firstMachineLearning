wow this is the movie that should be shown on tv at two in the morning on cinemax for all those insomniacs lord knows theyd probably pass out from boredom watching this movie terrible acting the killer is quite far from scary ive seen clowns at carnivals that were scarier lots of unnecessary skin in this film pseudoporn scenes which are just horrible in more ways than a million a gawdy soap opera style script which really hurt the movie and the director really had no flair for whatever genre he was trying to create with this film i could see a group of teenagers with their parents camcorders doing better work than this i dont think there is a part of me that could recommend this film to anyone
