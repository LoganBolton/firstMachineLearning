creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle people often assume that it was john carpenter that started the trend but as is the case with many of the genres clichés  the italians did it first movies like eyeball torso and blood and black lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery there were also a couple of american prehalloween slashers that warrant a mention classroom massacre keep my grave open and savage weekend clearly predate 1978 whilst the town that dreaded sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teenkill movies br br carpenters seminal flick may not have been the maiden masked nightmare but it certainly started the competitive race between directors to unveil the spookiest disguise for their bogeymen over the years weve seen some memorable contenders but my favourites would have to be my bloody valentines maniacal miner the prowlers sadistic soldier and wicked games copperfaced assassin im also keen on many of the killer clowns that have made an appearance throughout the category the final scene in the house on sorority row has to be listed as one of the best and the clown of midnight also ranks highly amongst the greatest madmens costumesbr br a leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie probably because they are widely linked with sexual perversion which of course doesnt exactly make for a scary disguise but in later years both blackout and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with a gimp suit heres how the later of the two fared br br the screen lights up with the rush of blue sirens as cops race to the scene of a hostage situation it seems that a stressedout gentleman has possibly had enough of being cast as an extra in cruddy lowbrow turkeys so hes decided to hold his wife and kid at gunpoint detective shine david clover manages to wrestle with the gunman but unluckily for him he looses the fight to grab a loose pistol and it looks like its the end of the road for the grey haired officer fortunately he is saved in the nick of time by some precision marksmanship from lisa ryder donna adams the california police departments hottest female lawenforcerbr br her heroic encounter earns the brunette a promotion to detective first class and its a feat that is heavily envied by her male counterparts meanwhile a leatherclad maniac is jollying around town slaughtering hookers and dumping their bloody corpses on street corners ryder and shine are put on the case of the murderous gimp and their first call of questioning is a sleazy back street photographer called michael walker john mandell lisa is such a top notch inspector that normal police regulation doesnt seem to apply to her so before long shes dating the cameraman even though hes suspect numero uno when the bodies continue to pile up around the city she decides to go undercover in an attempt to flush out the s  m madman br br if anything zipperface effortlessly sums up all that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the end of its rein what started as a great steppingstone for up and coming filmmakers and thespians had been reduced to a sewer of cinema faeces by movies with flat direction zero suspense or shocks and talentless mediocre actors the boom years of early eighties splatter flicks managed to conceal their lack of strong dramatic lineups with gooey special effects and exciting directorial flourishes unfortunately by this point in the cycle titles like rush week deadly dreams and the majorettes had seemed to be produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the aforementioned features characters ended up in an early gravebr br donna adams doesnt even vaguely convince as an officer of the law and her inexplicably idiotic behaviour  which includes doing a striptease for a top suspect in a nationwide murder investigation  is more mind numbingly pathetic than you might ever expect it to be mansour pourmand couldnt direct traffic and the wide majority of the cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial i searched and searched but found nothing here of merit or notebr br on the plus side if you manage to keep the tv turned on until the end then you may be fairly surprised by the killers identity to be honest though i doubt that by that time youll even care and another plus point well erm the disc is perfectly symmetrical which means that you could use it as a matt to place your cup of tea upon aside from that theres really no other reason to go out and buy zipperface bad bad bad and not in a good way this is 90 minutes of my life that i could have spent more constructively by plucking my chesthair abysmal
