the monkees head is one of those peculiar phenomenons ive noticed that when something doesnt make sense people will try to read things into it and give it great deep meanings which its creator never intended such is the case herebr br the movie is a streamofconsciousness spectacle of the monkees floating in and out of various sketches blackouts set pieces etc similar to the ones on their tv show but while the tv show was played for laughs this doesnt seem to be played for anything except a sort of deep trippy pseudointellectual state that this brand of psychedelia imposes all in all its the monkees doing the same schtick but now its consciousnessraising because the laugh track is removed there is not a stitch of humor or meaning to the whole thing it just drones on with colored lightsbr br the music in head should prove to anyone beyond the shadow of a doubt that the monkees had not a scrap of songwriting ability the tunes are mostly garbage the only one thats even listenable is porpoise song which opens and closes the film but the thing is that was a gerry goffincarole king song and while its aboveaverage for the monkees its belowaverage by goffin and king standards its like hearing one of the old peter and gordon songs that paul mccartney wrote for them you might think its a pretty good song but then you find out who composed it and you realize its a throwaway mike nesmiths song is maybe passable the rest is worthless davy jones has i guess what the filmmakers imagined to be the big number in the picture since its the only song presented as show biz and not cut into a film montage or dream sequence but it falls flat too just because the song isnt any goodbr br i have to admit i always liked the monkees so the movie is a real disappointment sure they were cheesy but they were so cheerful about itbr br they knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it but then they got ambitious in head they actually joke about being a manufactured pop product but the truth is they wanted something more they wanted to be great musicians and taken seriously as artists maybe not like the beatles but something approaching that head proves that they failed on all counts 1 out of 4
