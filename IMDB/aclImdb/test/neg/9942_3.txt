this is among one of many usa attempts of remaking a old classic british tv show thats more famous than this one from what i see none of you havent mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a tv 50s60s called secret agent man the original secret agent man starred the great patrick mcgoohan the prisonerbraveheartice station zebrathe phantom etc a man who was tapped to be the first james bond but he turned it down because mcgoohan was a very devout man and he considered james bonds bed hopping and violent ways to be against his valuesbr br this show was done in black and white and its a pity for those who havent seen ityou are missing out on a lot the character mr mcgoohan played in secret agent man was named drake and after he finished with that show he went on to the do the very popular though at times bizarre and controversial tv series called the prisoner the character he played in the prisoner was that of a agent whos identity is not revealed is kidnapped and transported to a island where he does not know where he is or who it was that is responsible for kidnapping him what he does know is that his captors want to know the reasons behind his resignation from the british secret service and on this island the populace dont have names but they are referred to by numbers and patricks character is assigned a number which is 6 it was argued that his prisoner character was in fact the same character he played in secret agent man but mcgoohan himself disputed thisbr br ofourse there is the unmistakable famous theme song that the original secret agent man spawned it was written by johnny rivers a famous 50s and 60s pop musician and from what i read some of you are actually think that the song comes from this version of the show youre very wrong about that it was johnnys and it comes from the original tv series so let me help to set the facts straight to those of you who complained about the name of the show being stupid well in england it was actually called danger man and in the us it was retitled secret agent man for such a supposedly stupid name the show did well enough when it was first airedbr br granted this current show has little to do with the original no such main character named drake in this one and i guess they did their best to make this show their version of secret agent man but it does use the redone version of the original theme song so that does tell you that this show was indeed meant to be a redone albeit however inferior redone version of the original series
