this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen its supposed to be a remake or update of the onearmed swordsman by chang cheh the hamfisted direction and crappy fight choreography mean that the fight scenes arent even worth watching the script tries desperately hard to seem serious but is full of cliches like and i knew then that nothing would ever be the same again or if only id known what a heavy price i would have to pay ugh and who is that girl who plays sing someone find her and have her eliminated shes awful if you like chinese martial arts movies youd be better off with lau gar leung this stinks
