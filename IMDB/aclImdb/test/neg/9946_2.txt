as jennifer denuccio used to say on square pegs gag me out the door i would definitely vote this movie on imdbs worst movie listbr br dennis christopher plays tt a guy from chicago who goes to california peddling his brothers jazz records he is supposed to be a barney placed in the localsonly surfing community but he acts more like he is new to civilization just try to get through his sex scene without squirming there are also the ongoing adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure that of duke seymour cassell the volleyball expert who tries to get tt to act like a normal human being the obnoxious drunk surfers who cheat on their girlfriends and the guy who makes a bet with another that he can live in car for sixth monthsbr br california dreaming is just a big old mess it starts out like a typical seventies romp complete with bad 70s music even though this movie came out one year shy of the 80s and dennis christopher comes off as the most irritable loser it makes the movie hard to watch keep your finger on the fast forward button even if this movie was supposed to be about the surfer culture the surf scenes are almost total garbage the people at the surf contest look as though they cant keep from falling asleepbr br i guess the only cool thing is seeing tanya roberts outside of her role as midge on the sitcom thats 70s show and cassell wasnt bad he was just in a bad movie
