two little girls strike a friendship one tries to convince the other shes a witch the other is a pushover who bends to the would be witchs will on and on the movie drags with the pointless interaction between the two little girls with many a dramatic cut away as they pose shocking questions you know the kind sweet little children shouldnt ask such as how do you make a deal with the devil oooh creepybr br in the end the pushover is sick of being controlled by her witchy friend her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end but by the time it comes you wont care in the leastbr br i can imagine this film may have been frightening to a very religious 1960s mexican moviegoer but it doesnt even hold up as a charming relic it merely drags on it is boring it is pointless it is not to be watchedbr br there are many here who have a lot of good things to say about it based on their knowledge of the directors other works and of course that common denominator everyone says about pointless films ah the cinematography is wonderful those reviewers probably have a point but for the ones who found this movie with no prior knowledge who dont care about its photography its atmosphere or itswhatever else it has  for these viewers then who just want a good movie that will entertain them for an hour and a half do yourselves a favour folks br br skip it
