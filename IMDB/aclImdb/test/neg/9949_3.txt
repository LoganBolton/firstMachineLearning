as i sit and think about poison for the fairies i realize that i may not being fair with the film my rating of 310 may have more to do with my disappointment with the film than its actual quality or entertainment value based on the plot description reviews on imdb and the 76 imdb rating i would sure that i had stumbled on a little known gem sadly it just didnt do much for me for whatever reason poison for the fairies all but put me to sleepbr br poison for the fairies is the story of two young girls in 1965 mexico city one of the girls veronica is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she veronica is a witch the other girl flavia is so gullible that she believes and is frightened by everything her friend tells her thats really about it in reality nothing much happens and the film drags on and on as veronica attempts to terrorize and dominate flavia one commenter on imdb described it as the scariest film in 80s mexican cinema my comment  if thats the case there must not have been many horror films made in mexico in the 80s another commenter wrote watch it if you wanna get scared my comment  are you sure were talking about the same movie my opinion is diametrically opposed to these examples ive given to me it was dull uninspired and poorly acted the scene framing is especially annoying as director carlos enrique taboada doesnt ever show the faces of any of the other characters veronica and flavia carryon long drawnout conversations with members of their families and their teacher but we never actually see these peoples faces its an annoying gimmick
