this is a poor excuse for a movie a film noir done by busbee berkeley please first lets forget about the plot a truly simpleminded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde yechh so what turns her from despising him to loving him along with a group of other guys he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is siphoned off stranding them it isnt exactly heroics but shes suddenly smitten its truly painful to watch claude rains trying to portray a hardbitten toughtalking noirtype cop a crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool along with a growling voice most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles how he ever got talked into taking this job ill never understand enjoy it if you can for a few period details the old cars and gas pumps but dont expect a decent film experience it wasted 1112 hours of my life
