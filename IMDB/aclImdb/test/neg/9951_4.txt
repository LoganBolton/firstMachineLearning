not to be confused with the 1943 george zucco movie the mad ghoul the mad monster is a film that zucco appeared in the year before in this fairly paintbynumbers affair zucco perfects a way to turn his dimwitted handyman petro into a wolfman hybrid by means of wolfs blood injections and then wastes little time in sending the transformed doofus to slay the former colleagues who had scoffed at his experiments it is a very simple plot really and an extremely lowbudget production glenn strange who plays the manwolf here would soon achieve greater fame playing the franky monster in films such as house of frankenstein 1944 and abbott and costello meet frankenstein 1948 the makeup job on him here is pretty lame and only succeeds in making him look like a hippy with bad teeth like the one in 1957s teenage monster the sets in this film in addition are fairly nonexistent and the denouement is abrupt and unconvincing i have given the movie a very generous 4 stars in part because i have an abiding love for 1940s horror films but truth to tell most objective viewers would probably deem it laughable crap and i suppose it is its certainly no wellcrafted universal affair or val lewton masterpiece thats for sure still zucco is always fun to watch even in undemanding piffle such as this if you can spare 72 minutes of your life i suppose you could do worse than the mad monster not too much worse of course ohone other thing this dvd is from alpha video and you know what that means fuzzy images lousy sound indeed the worst sound of any alpha video dvd ive encountered so far and no extras youve been warned
