george zucco was a fine actor often playing gimleteyed villains with a lascivious intensity however even he couldnt save this dull and flatfooted b flickbr br zucco plays the usual mad scientist dr lorenzo cameron who believes that wolfs blood injected into humans can create an invincible army of wolf men who can win the world war ii go figure experimenting on pedro the handymanglenn strange zucco creates a werewolf that looks rather like the ones dave allen used to play in his comedy sketches pedro is obviously based on lennie from of mice and men and you almost keep expecting him to say duh okay george theres one startling moment when the werewolf kills a child by reaching in through the window and grabbing it but for the most part this is a routine and pedestrian  very pedestrian  77 minute tread through all the old clich√©s that are done far better in other movieswe also get the revenge motif from the devil bat worked in in itself a borrowing from son of frankensteinbr br zucco is wasted and you only have to see him in films such as adventures of sherlock holmes the mummys hand and dr renaults secret to see how wasted a few atmospheric swamp scenes are all it has to offer really and the scene where zucco demonstrates his wolfman technique to those who doubted him again shades of dr jekyll and mr hyde is unintentionally hilariousbr br not one of the better 40s b movies
