for reasons i cannot begin to fathom dr lorenzo cameron george zucco begins injecting wolfs blood into his dimwitted handyman petro glenn strange the result Â– petro is transformed into a hideous as hideous as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth can be killer beast dr cameron uses petro to get his revenge against those in the scientific community who scoffed at and ridiculed his ideas and why wouldnt they dr camerons nuttier than a fruitcakebr br overall the mad monster is one dull and poorly made poverty row thriller theres really only one positive i can come up with to write about in the mad monster george zucco can be fun to watch as he plays the mad scientist about as well as anyone his dr cameron is a regular loony he has no qualms about killing he has entire conversations with people who arent there and as with most mad scientists he messes in gods domain actually im not sure anyone accuses him of this but it fits but beyond zucco theres nothing here to recommend everything else from the monster effects to the supporting cast to the music is plain old bad there are far better examples of poverty row horror from the 1940s than the mad monster
