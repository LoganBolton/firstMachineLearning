first of all i have to say that i am not generally a big fan of werewolf movies in general its not that i dont like them just that i dont like them a lot there are some that i have enjoyedwerewolf of london 1935 stuart walker an american werewolf in london 1981 john landisand some that i have thought were okay but nothing specialthe wolf man 1941 george waggner the howling 1981 joe dante dog soldiers 2002 neil marshall are some examplesbut overall the werewolf subgenre is not my favorite but i had this one on one of those 50 movie sets so i thought id give it a watch and see how it wasbr br spoilers followbr br the mad monster is a werewolf tale but the werewolf is primarily used as a vehicle for revenge by a mad scientist dr lorenzo cameron george zucco dr cameron has discovered a way to transform human beings into beasts specifically wolves but was ridiculed and ostracized by the greater scientific community forced out of a prestigious position he goes mad and plots revenge on those who mocked him in an old country mansion where he lives with his daughter lenora the lovely anne nagel and his assistant petro glenn strange of limited mental abilities using his serum dr cameron transforms petro into a werewolf and sends him off to kill his old rivals eventually though the werewolf petro gets out of control and both the mad doctor and his creation are killedbr br the movie also plays out somewhat as a murdercrime drama with lenoras journalist suitor johnny downs investigating the doctors strange behavior and the rash of murders the story seems to borrow many elements from other big pictures that came before it there are reminders of frankenstein 1931 james whale in the creation of a monster which runs amok and the creature killing an innocent child visions of dr jekyll and mr hyde 1931 rouben mamoulian or the 1941 victor fleming version and the wolf man 1941 george waggner also come to mind and that is one of the problems with this movie in my viewit comes across as a mediocre melding of some great films it doesnt add much to the genrebr br true there are some redeeming qualities george zuccos performance was convincing and the scene showing dr lorenzo talking to his visionshallucinations of his tormentors works well for me in showing his insanity there is some reasonable character build up at least in the case of his character but glenn stranges character is not at all convincing and seems to have this comedic qualitywhether intentional or not im not surethat just doesnt fit into the movie as a wholebr br i seemed to like it more than most imdb users based on my rating of 410 but it was still a below average film perhaps worth a view if you are a fan of early werewolf movies or a big fan of the 1930s and 1940s horror films but unlikely to appeal to you if you are not
