thankfully you dont need a lot of book learnin to understand where this things going obviously a poverty row cashin on universals big hit the wolf man which was made just one year earlier this finds the alwayswatchable george zucco in another of his patented mad doctor roles as brilliant vengeanceminded scientist lorenzo cameron cameron who has set up shop deep in the swamp lands of what im presuming is the louisiana bayou is plotting revenge against four of his former peers who both humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job you see they scoffed at his claims of being able to mix man with beast to create an unstoppable army of wolfman creatures that would come in handy during wartime thankfully cameron has found the ideal test subject for his wolf blood injections  a hulking childlike halfwit named petro glenn strange petro is pretty clueless as to whats going on doesnt ask too many question and lets the doc strap him down to a table and shoot him up with whatever happens to be in his syringe this results in a timelapse change of man turning into a werewolf cameron lets him out of the mansion using a secret passageway so you basically get a big guy strange was 65 dressed in overalls with a bushy beard hairy paws and a set of oversized plastic teeth running around in the woods the majority of the time after an eyewitness sees the beast and a little girl is killed the locals grab their rifles and organize a posse to hunt it down dr cameron who can control the beast with a whip and also has a handy antidote to reverse the effect also drags petro along to the big city to try to track down the professors who had made a mockery of his original theories and destroyed his reputation in the process also hanging around the house is camerons daughter lenora anne nagel as well as lenoras nosy reporter boyfriend tom johnny downs whose first inclination is that theyre dealing with an uprightwalking prehistoric creature br br though a typically chintzy prc flick in many ways with unimpressive sets cinematography and makeups as well as a fairly bland supporting cast it remains watchable thanks to the histrionics of star george zucco i have no clue why downs received top billing he shows up halfanhour in and really doesnt have a whole lot to do nor is he all that impressive doing it this is zuccos show all the way and hes great ranting and raving talking to himself while fantasizing that hes talking to his peers im not interested in your imbecilic mouthings and temporarily sliding in and out of sanity strange seems to have patterned his performance as the hilariously naive and slowtalking semiretarded country bumpkin around the entire oeuvre of lon chaney jr from his turn as lenny in of mice and men to his performance as the aforementioned wolf man in any case strange and zucco do a fairly good job playing off one another my favorite part is when zucco calls him his guinea pig in front of a colleague while petro just sits there grinning and staring at a doorknob some of the foggy swamp scenes are pretty atmospheric too
