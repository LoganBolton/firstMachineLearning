ok ive now seen george zucco in at least four separate horrorsuspense films recently as i worked my way through various 50 pack collections and i have to say the guy had a limited range but he was good at what he did he wasnt karloff but prc was lucky to have him br br but the poor guy was stuck in a kind of backwater ghetto of horror films and he wasnt good enough to take them to the next level of interestnot with the threadbare screenplays and direction and budgets he worked under thats the case here br br this movie is well slow stodgy and unexciting for the most part the heroine seems to be doomed to be a rentacenter version of judy garland the hero is bland as white rice and the poor guy playing the monster doesnt even get a good transformation scene out of the deal his make up effects arent scary at all  he looks like a slightly more shaggy version of a farm hand is all br br its not a total waste zucco looks good on camera he chews the scenery while managing to deliver some terribly affected and contrived set speeches without flinching or losing the flow there are some moody bw shots here and there that dont completely suck br br so all in allthis movie helped some c through z level actors pay their rent for another month and it never sinks below a certain hacked out level of quality watch it once if you like george zucco or just feel the need to see every wolfmanthemed movie ever made
