im working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and the mad monster is one of the movies in the setbr br i am sure that george zucco was a good actor but this was only the second film in which i saw him the first being dead men walk in which he played two parts however even good acting couldnt save the mad monsterbr br zucco plays a mad scientist dr cameron who was banned from academia because of his unethical and inhumane experiments he believes that he can control evolution by bringing out the characteristics of one animal into anotherbr br in this case like so many others of its ilk it is a transfusion of i assume wolfs blood into humans his goal is to create an invincible army which he can control through the antidote the subject of his experiments is his hired hand a retarded gardener whose dialogue slows down this snailpaced classic to almost a fullstop br br beyond his experiments dr cameron also plots revenge on those who discredited him using his transformed gardener however he loses control of his subject who begins to transform without the transfusion  yikes br br the werewolf transformations are classic hollywood stopaction  makeup effects no doubt these were groundbreaking techniques of the time but in todays digital age its hard to imagine audiences being scared by this
