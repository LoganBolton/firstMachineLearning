i heard legends about this film quotes used so as not to insult films for a while so when i finally got the dvd with it i impatiently started watching it by the end i had to fast forward through just a few of the most moronic ineptly made nonsensical scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end quickerbr br this may be the worst film ive even touched  and i used to be associated with troma for a while manson family makes the bottom of tromas entries look like daring and groundbreaking arthouse filmwork i could go on and talk about the syphilitic skeleton of a plot it has the revoltingly bad acting the painful inept directing the sets and props with their dollar ninety nine look i especially loved the plastic toy guns used in the tate murder scene or the nauseating look and feel of this whole bag of garbage i think it was supposed to represent a druginduced hallucination i have absolutely no idea how a druginduced hallucination looks or feels nor do i want to find out  but i guess drug junkies with burned out brains will love this film they seem to be the ones who made it ive seen many films from various worst 50 lists traditionally opened by eddie woods ones  and eddie wood would be appalled by the sheer ineptitude and talentless of van webber or whatever his name is i certainly dont want to remember it ive never seen superbabies or its sequel but i strongly wish that manson joined them on imdbs rating fortunately this obscure garbage probably wont be seen by enough viewers to warrant it sufficiently many 1 votes  and so much the better
