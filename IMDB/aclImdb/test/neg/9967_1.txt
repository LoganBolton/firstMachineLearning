i got encouraged to watch this film because ive heard good word of it it was supposed to be this thrilling true crime milestone disturbing shocking all that jazz well i am disturbed because i spent money on it and i am shocked that something so godawful actually got released thats about itbr br this is a supposed new look at charles mansons family of insane loser junkies and their murders but if this is a new look then its probably new as in fresh and totally inept just watching it gave me a headache and i had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even understand just what the director intended it to bebr br i suppose i should say something about the plot but fact is it was so stupid and incoherent that i barely remember if there even was a plot at all there was something about a manson tape delivered to a radio dj or a tv producer then an hour of pointless random footage of the family in 69 then the polanski murders looking like a bad school play and finally some idiotic part about a bunch of skinheads getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another in an alley i kid you not and then it ended thank god dont ask me to make any sense of that im just recalling what i saw the performances were terrible too and how difficult is it to make a convincing manson get a short skinny scrawny bloke put a dirty wig and a shaggy beard on him theres your manson but this manson doesnt even look right he just looks like uh a bloke in a cheap wig and a glued on santa beard painted blackbr br or maybe thats what this film is actually about mansons family didnt make any sense so this film doesnt make any sense either its symbolic yeah right im still so angry at spending money on this i stopped my normal lurking on this site and registered just to vote 1 for this film and post this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage stay away from it its not even worth rentingbr br ps the recent us tv production helter skelter got bad reviews here but i saw it last month i saw the 1976 original too and let me tell you compared to manson family that new helter skelter is brilliant and flawless and i was disappointed in it thats how bad manson family is it makes a flawed and mostly disappointing tv movie look perfect
