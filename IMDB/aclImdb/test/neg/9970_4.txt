strikes me as routine as far as tv movies go i can believe that its based on a true story because the plot seems too clumsy to have been written by anyone with storytelling skillsbr br for instance good old john ritter now a rather bulky and bearded villain poisons his wife enough to make her ill then accuses her of being psychosomatic and leaves to marry another young woman immediately fourteen years pass before the story picks up again why fourteen years i would guess that though the narrative doesnt demand it history doesbr br some of the particular scenes however are so cinematically apt that they were almost certainly dreamed up by a writer pawing through her attic helgenberger ritters first wife stumbles across an old electrical appliance and has one of those blackandwhite flashbacks with stings on the score  suddenly she recalls when fourteen years ago she discovered ritter shaving selenium filings from a rectifier carefully collecting them and putting them in her shampoo and her eyelash liner or whatever its called later it develops that he was putting it into her coffee as wellbr br frankly i dont believe it i dont believe either that she had that particular epiphany in the attic or that ritter put selenium shavings into her shampoo or eyeliner selenium is referred to in the movie as a toxic metal and i suppose it is in sufficient quantity but its also an antioxidant thats sold over the counter in drug stores and swallowed someone will have to demonstrate  as no one does in this movie  that it is a topical poison many people have tried the nicotine patch and failed so how come some selenium in her shampoo gives marg helgenberger immediate and drastic headaches and her eyes become as painful as boils when she applies makeup i think the anthropologist e b tylor called this simpleminded idea sympathetic magic but im not surebr br mais je divage anyway ritter evidently tries the same stunt with his second wife fourteen years later although no evidence of trickery is ever produced when she becomes ill with the same symptoms wife number two is taken to mexico and apparently cured but suddenly drops dead shortly after her return circumstantial evidence piles up against ritter who plays the villain with all the stops out  when his first trial is dismissed he smirks at helgenberger who has prompted the investigationbr br you see helgenberger was good friends with ritters second wife and was terribly disturbed at her demise and its manner ill bet and she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the wealthy young woman who seems lined up for third place in ritters marital schedule sure the best performance is given by the guy who plays detective mauser  lawrence dane everyone else acts by the numbers they project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railroad crossing but dane does little things that are original im told you want to report a murder long pause while he sits down and waits then abruptly thrusts his face towards helgeberger and inquires in a reasonable and curious voice so who was murdered i suppose except for the bare bones of the historical events nothing prevented characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life i mean what the heck ritter is still in jail convicted of murder and helgenbergers character is dead so who is to object i wish the forensic stuff had been made clearer ritter seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals  let me see selenium cyanide a massive dose of chlorine and maybe something else  that i was confused by it all not that i was rooting for ritter heres a mathematician with a phd who insists people call him doctor he even corrects people who address him merely as professor most phds get that narcissistic problem behind them very quickly jes call me whitey even though i know how to get a standard deviation and you dont average tv fare
