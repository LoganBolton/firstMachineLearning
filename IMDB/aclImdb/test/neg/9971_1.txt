one of the most boring movies ive ever seen three immature young people have sex and talk about very little except their love of each other they dont seem to be interested in much but each other and only passively so i was left feeling shut out most of the exterior scenes take place at night so one cant even enjoy welllit sights of paris i gave up after an hour and ten minutes
