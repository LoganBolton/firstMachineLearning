this film is about a woman falling in love with a friend of her boyfriend from then on she has to divide her time for the two boyfriends jack during the day and joseph during the nightbr br this film feels like as if it was made with minimum budget the majority of the film is set in a flat with minimal furniture there are only three main actors all the other actors listed in the credits make only momentary appearances the wardrobe designer doesnt seem to have much to do as the actors wear very down to earth clothes and actually most of the time they are naked anywaybr br the film is very dialog heavy which should have made up for the shortcomings described above however the dialogs sound too composed and awkward in the beginning of the film most of the dialog is a person saying a very long sentence and then the person says me too after the frenzy of agreement the dialog descends into a mess of disjointed and confused word saladbr br the only merit of this film i can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet which conveys that it is not just men who can be unfaithfulbr br this film is a great disappointment
