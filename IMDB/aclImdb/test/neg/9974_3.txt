this hbo original is pretty straightforward and pretty dumb armand assante once again doing a poor stallone imitation is ray wellman a excon just out on parole all he wants is his old girlfriend lacy played by a young marcia gay harden back unfortunately for ray lacy has hooked up with stalwart elliot played by sam neill further complicating matters is that rays old cell buddies want some favors and they kidnap lacy to make sure they happen ray and elliot team up despite mutual dislikebr br what follows is violent and slow but marcia gay harden shows us why she would win oscar in the future shes not as polished here but her raw emotion sincerity and some rather explicit nude scenes almost make this worth watching almostbr br rent fever no the title doesnt fit the film if your a fan of hers otherwise skip it and be grateful its stars went on to better thingsbr br notethis is a hard r flick for language violence and nudity
