i was expecting born to kill to be an exciting hightension film noir instead its got two good action setpieces one at the beginning and one at the end and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by robert de grasse usually a glamor cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir but the rest of the film is pretty boring lawrence tierney goes through his psycho kick but its a strictly bythenumbers performance mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after dillinger an overrated movie but at least better than this claire trevors character is too stupid and unmotivated to have any audience appeal and the action such as it is stays so resolutely inside that damned house in san francisco the film becomes claustrophobic instead of genuinely thrilling its one of those movies in which the supporting players  notably elisha cook jr whose characters homoerotic itch for tierneys is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise pretty obvious script and isabel jewell  outact the leads it also doesnt help that nearly half a century after alfred hitchcock and anthony perkins revolutionized the depiction of psycho killers on the screen in psycho tierneys is so gross and obvious he might as well have psycho tattooed on his forehead also theres no indication in the film as it stands as to why the source novel was called deadlier than the male  but perhaps james gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the film born to kill is a real disappointment from robert wise who already had some quality movies under his belt and would go on to a stellar career
