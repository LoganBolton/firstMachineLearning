fellow giallofanatics beware andor proceed with caution  for this movie isnt exactly what it appears to be it surely looks like a giallo with its juicy vhs cover showing a busty naked girl and a big bloodied knife rhythmic title and the names of two veteran italian actors in the cast john phillip  fernando rey but its basically just an erotic thriller without much of a plot the version i watched is presumably harshly censored  with a running time of barely 77 minutes  but then still theres a severe lack of suspense character development and most of all sadistic and typically giallo carnage eyes behind the wall can briefly be summarized as the gathering of a bunch of perverted characters and the extended depiction of their sexuality issues its an interesting effort notwithstanding because writerdirector giuliano petrelli his only film clearly attempted to do something special but the overall result is unsatisfying and regrettably tame inspired by hitchcocks rear window the main character is a frustrated elderly and wheelchairbound writer he and his much younger lover get their sexual kicks from spying on the single male tenant living across the road the tenant respectively likes to perform gym exercises around the house whilst being naked and clearly has bisexual desires wheelchair guy sends his wife over and they have sex then theres also ottavio the butler who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls are there any normal characters in the story well no of course not the film benefices from a continuously ominous atmosphere with a moody soundtrack and nifty photography but none of it ever leads anywhere so its all just sleaze  sex without significance theres a truly bizarre twistrevelation at the end of the story but it comes too late and too randomly to boost up the overall quality not recommended to fans of italian horrorcult cinema but maybe it is great viewing for psychology students to analyze the characters freudstyle
