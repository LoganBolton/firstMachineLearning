im almost embarrassed to admit to seeing caligula twice the problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention the script is substandard its easy to see why vidal tried to disown it the direction is worse most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with closeups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly unerotic porn more prevalent obviously in the uncut version the cinematography is especially sub par giving the whole production a cheap washedout look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs the movie shouldve looked a whole lot better the overall concept of placing name actors in what wouldve easily been an xrated movie guccione called it paganography wears thin after the first hour after peter otoole and john guilgud exit bob guccione obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste if you want a far better understanding of the roman empire in the 1st century watch the mid79s bbc production of i claudius instead and if you want porn jeezelouise look somewhere else
