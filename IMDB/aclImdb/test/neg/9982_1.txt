as a semifilm buff i had heard of this infamous movie a long time ago i had heard that it was basically a 15 million dollar film about the tyrannical rule of the roman emperor caligula complete with hardcore pornography what struck me was that it was a porno movie yet it had great thespians like peter otoole john geilgud malcolm mcdowell and hellen mirren in it a week ago i saw a documentary about caligula on the history channel and this film came back into my head and finally my curiousity got the best of me i foolishly rented the dvd and even more foolishly watched itbr br within the first 30 minutes i was seeing acts of sex and especially violence that would earn an nc17 even by todays standards was it really necessary to have a scene of a man having his urinary track closed and then have gallons of wine poured into him and then have his stomach cut with a sword all in very graphic detail and a scene where a guy gets his d cut off and fed to dogs again in very graphic detailand this just scratches the surface the argument for this movie from those who like it seems that it is the only film that honestly portrays pagan rome and its excesses when in fact what this movie really is is sheer exploitation from beginning to end you see nothing but endless torture and decapitations and every kind of violence and crude behavior imaginable sadomasochism rape necrophelia it just never stopped there is no insight into caligula himself what might have propelled him to go mad the horrible childhood he had that molded him into a sadist as an adult this is not a historic film it is sleaze even the porn in this movie stinks and through much of this when i wasnt gagging i was just incredibly bored by the time it was over i was depressed didnt feel much like eating and this movie does the impossible it actually can turn you off of sexbr br what were these great actors thinking when they got into this i did read that the porn segments were filmed after the principal shooting was completed which explains why none of the main actors are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so poor but still and all these actors must have known what they were getting into right at the opening credits it says penthouse magazine and bob gucionne presents and the scenes that the famous actors actually take part in are completely repulsive in and of themselves apparently director tinto brass wanted his name removed from the completed film entirely as did the screenwriter gore vidal of all people even john geilgud and peter otoole were begging people not to see this when it opened at the cannes film festivalbr br for the amount of money the producers spent on this the movies quality is terrible everything is underlit and murky as if the film was dropped in a swamp prior to being developed and thats when youre lucky enough to view a scene thats actually infocus the sound is poorly dubbed much of the music is awkward and the editing is god awfulbr br anyway i brought this movie on myself my advicedont watch this dont watch this dont watch thisas for myself tomorrow night i am going to watch something lighterlike dawn of the dead
