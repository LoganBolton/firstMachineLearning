incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all roman emperors who went insane leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path i know there are several versions of this and this is based on the 102 min one that i watched  but i cant fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muckbr br id heard for long about the alleged shocking content of sexnudity which honestly there isnt much of here at all  and boring when there is and blood but beware  its the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project camerawork is hopelessly inept full of strange zooms failed framing and confusing pans to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage complete with a grainy cheapish photo quality lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven  is it day or night are they in or outside have they changed scenes who is or is meant to be in the shot editing is the final sin here making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum story progression  and involvement there is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story but these faults distract so much its tragicbr br a story with so many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan burnt and fellinilike turkey thats only good for a few gobblelaughs and peter otoole who makes a most memorable tiberius oh yes which brings us to the bigname actors id like to line them all up one by one and just ask who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this there ive wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time  periodbr br 1 out of 10 from ozjeppe
