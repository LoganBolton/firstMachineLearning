its a rare sensation to come across a film so embarrassing that you feel an urge to turn away from the screen but when you see a noble actor like sir john gielgud surrounded by naked copulating couples thats just what youll want to do add to that peter otoole as syphilisridden emperor tiberius and malcolm mcdowell sticking his finger up a male victims anus and you begin to appreciate that caligula is solely of interest to addicts of sickoutrageous filmsbr br the film charts the life of notorious roman emperor caligula mcdowell a highly disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters decapitations betrayals murders incestuous relationships and lesbian sex scenesbr br although caligula was totally mad in real life and probably did succumb to his base instincts more often than not the film is still inexcusable filth the sex in the film isnt used as one aspect in a multilayered story  the sex is the story after a while all the nudity hip thrusting and nipple sucking becomes tedious due to sheer repetition the performances are totally undisciplined particularly mcdowell who throws caution to the wind and gives a performance that is all wildeyed posturing otoole seems to be treating the script with the contempt it deserves surely hes in it purely for the money rumours abound that additional pornographic scenes were added without the directors consent during post production but in truth there isnt a single minute in caligula that is dignified or wellmade it is doubtful that this amount of time talent and money will ever be thrown at a porno film again so in that sense caligula is a oneofakind experience on the other hand its so monumentally awful that perhaps the fact it is oneofakind is a blessing in disguise
