its rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but caligula surely must hold this title im not sure what is more horrendous the violence the sexual perverseness the acting or the plot or severe lack thereofbr br the two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous roman caesar caligula to to throne in 37ad and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power the acting is lifeless and dull  but thats just the tip of the iceberg obviously knowing that this film was severely lacking of anything legitimately interesting the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was conceivably possible but dont be fooled these scenes dont ease or take focus away from the hideousness of this film the camera work is shoddy dialog is laughable in fact youd have to congratulate malcolm mcdowell playing caligula for keeping a straight face through such farcical lines and then theres the violencebr br if you are about to see the film be prepared some atrocities are committed in the film not just through the writing but through disgusting violent acts which are of little point or purpose other than to repulse the viewer this is only objective this movie achieved one must wonder how the makers of this film thought that bestiality necrophilia and castration just to name a few would be appealing to anyone when it belatedly ends after two and a half hours you take nothing from this film other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst film everbr br youve been warned
