many people said this was a great movie with hoffman delivering a great performance i went from suspended disbelief to fidgety boredom to almost walking out there is no there therebr br hoffman does go all out he is committed to the performance but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenerybr br no characters in the movie other than capote are much more than placeholders  nell jack perry shawn the sheriff are all onedimensionalbr br yes the film shows the manipulative preening dishonest sides of capote it shows them so many times i started to wonder why  do the filmmakers think we need to have everything spelled out and again and again it refers often to capotes genius but does not show it it shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers but never convinces us whybr br but my goal is not to deconstruct the film i am sure others will have other interpretations for me this was a twohour movie that felt like five
