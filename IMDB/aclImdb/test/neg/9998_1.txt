i occasionally let my kids watch this garbage so they will understand just how pathetic the shows contestants are they are pathetic not because they are fat but because they whore their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortunebr br for anyone to appear on national tv and blubber sniffle and whine about being fat entirely their own fault is nauseating what does this say about us as a nation does it suggest that your lifestyle choices and the consequences of them arent our responsibility br br the biggest loser is an appropriate title but it has nothing to do with ones weightbr br absolute trash
