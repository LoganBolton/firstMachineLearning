four things intrigued me as to this film  firstly it stars carly pope of popular fame who is always a pleasure to watch secdonly it features brilliant new zealand actress rena owen thirdly it is filmed in association with the new zealand film commission fourthly a friend recommended it to me however i was utterly disappointed the whole storyline is absurd and complicated with very little resolution popes acting is fine but owen is unfortunately underused the other actors and actresses are all okay but i am unfamiliar with them all aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie and pope and owen this film isnt very good so the moral of the story isdont watch it unless you really want to
