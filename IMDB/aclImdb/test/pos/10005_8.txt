maybe im reading into this too much but i wonder how much of a hand hongsheng had in developing the film i mean when a story is told casting the main character as himself i would think he would be a heavy hand in writing documenting etc and that would make it a little biasedbr br buthis family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about hongshengs life i think the best view would have been told from hongshengs family and friends perspectives they saw his transformation and werent so messed up on drugs that they remember everythingbr br as for hongsheng being full of himself the consistencies of the jesus christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life metaphorically of course hes obviously still alive as he was cast as himself for his familys happiness huhbr br the viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex he lies on the grass coming down from during a high by himself and with his father he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while outstretching his arms his head cocked to the sidebr br its fabulous that hes off of drugs now but hes no hero he went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middlebr br this same device is used in ted demmes blow where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed herobr br however quitting zuotian is a film that is recommended mostly for its haunting soundtrack superb acting and landscapes but the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of jia hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play it makes the viewer feel as if hongshengs life was merely a play told in many difficult parts
