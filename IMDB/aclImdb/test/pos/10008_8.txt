quitting may be as much about exiting a preordained identity as about drug withdrawal as a rural guy coming to beijing class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents acting success troubles arise however when the new man is too new when it demands too big a departure from family history nature and personal identity the ensuing splits and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grimbr br but what an exceptionally convincing particularity honesty and sensuousness director zhang yang and his actors bring to this journey no clich√©s no stereotypes no rigid gender roles no requisite sex romance or violence scenes no requisite street language and to boot no assumed money to float character acts and whims br br hongshen jia is in his midtwenties hes a talented actor impressionable vain idealistic and perhaps emotionally starved the perfect recipe for his enablers soon hes the cool actor idolized by youth he was hot in the early nineties he always had to be the most fashionable he needs extremes and goes in for heavy metal adopts earrings and a scarf his acting means the arts friendsand roles but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input and his selfcriticism dulled by the immediacy of success opens the doors to an irrational selfdoubt selfhatred i didnt know how to act i felt like a phonyand to readily available drugs to counter them he says i had to get high to do what director wanted so his shallow identity as an actor becomes via drugs an escape from identity br br hongshens disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual intermittentand doggedly his own solitude space meditative thinking speech refusal replace therapy the abstract is out and a great deal of his change occurs outdoorsnot in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways bridges and highrises of beijing the physicality is almost romantic but is not the bike rides to ritan park the long spontaneous walks the drenching sun and rain grassy picnics the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific he drifts in order to arrive all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity i started to open up he says of this period in retrospect and the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancers positioning clumsy graceful humorous telling in a current circumstance if mind or spirit is lacking his legs can compel him to walk all night br br central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles to punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity he smashes his videos and tv and bangs his head till bloody against his john lennon forever poster he has let down his iconic antiestablishment artistbut hes the only viable guide he knows he even imagines himself as johns son yoko ono and adopts his mother mary as an intercessor in his hour of darkness and time of trouble the wrenching shaking pain in the parkhallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals music is so much more real than acting he says and speaks of lennons influence as showing me a new way in the mental institute the lifesaving apples resistance nourishment reflect lennons presence as does hongshens need to rehang his heros poster in his redecorated roombr br if lennons influence is spiriting hongshens fathers influence is grounding although father and son are both actors and users drugs and drink it is fegsens differences from his son that underwrites his change for the father is more secure in himself he accepts that hes chinese a peasant in a line of peasants a rural theater director and he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions its this recognizable identity that drives hongshen to treat him like a sounding board sometimes with anger and rage sometimes with humor the blue jeans beatles and passivity in his most crazed and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar and a fake he exposes more of himself than his father all the acts i acted before were bullshit life is bullshit and to hongshens emphatic you are not my father he softly replies why cant a peasant be your father br br under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother sister friends inmates at the rehab inst he makes some tangible connection to a real not whole self as the long term drug effects recede so does his old identity indebtedness replaces pride trust distrust integrity banishes his black cloud all his edges soften you are just a human being he repeats endlessly after being released from the strapdown incurred for refusing medicine back home lard peasant soap is fine with him now and his once rare and true friendships begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant backtoback fence scene with his musician buddy hongshen says of this movie its a good chance to think about my life and i might add become a new actor one bound to art and life like lennon he has gained success without a loss of identity
