i went into night of the hunted not knowing what to expect at all i was really impressedbr br it is essentially a mysterythriller where this girl who cant remember anything gets rescued by a guy who happens to be driving past the two become fast friends and lovers and together they try to figure out what is going on with her through some vague flashbacks and grim memories they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty coolbr br i really liked the setting of this one a desolate postmodern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings very metropolitan groovy soundtrack and lots of nuditybr br surprising it was made in 1980 seems somewhat ahead of its timebr br 8 out of 10 kids
