since this cartoon was made in the old days felix talks using cartoon bubbles and the animation style is very crude when compared to today however compared to its contemporaries its a pretty good cartoon and still holds up well thats because despite its age the cartoon is very creative and funnybr br felix meets a guy whose shoe business is folding because he cant sell any shoes well felix needs money so he can go to hollywood so he tells the guy at the shop hell get every shoe sold felix spreads chewing gum all over town and soon people are stuck and leave their shoesrushing to buy new ones from the shoe store in gratitude the guy gives felix 500 however felixs owner wants to take the money and go alone so felix figures out a way to sneak alongbr br once there felix barges into a studio and makes a bit of a nuisance of himself along the way he meets cartoon versions of comics ben turpin and charlie chaplin in the end though through luck felix is discovered and offered a movie contract hurray
