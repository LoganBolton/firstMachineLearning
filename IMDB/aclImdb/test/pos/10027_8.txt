if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it this film is actually quite entertaining its got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere casting matchups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles as evident on this board the picture doesnt pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling to get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction i know i know thats hard to do when you consider custers last stand at the little big horn and its prominence in the history of post civil war america so i guess theres an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at itbr br theres a lot to take in here though for the pictures two hour plus run time custers arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher riding up as he does in full military regalia the practical joke by sharp arthur kennedy putting him up in the majors headquarters probably should have gotten them both in troublebr br ironically a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy as in custers first meeting with libby bacon and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie hattie mcdaniel i hadnt noticed it before in other films but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties mantan moreland so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress with that in mind the owl scene was a hoot toobr br as for flynn its interesting to note that a year earlier he portrayed jeb stuart opposite ronald reagans depiction of general custer in santa fe trail both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland in that film reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers while in flynns portrayal here its more than evident but it doesnt come close to that of richard mulligans take on the military hero in 1970s little big man lets just say that one was a bit over the topbr br the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on ones point of view earlier a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custers character when he stated  you take glory with you when its your time to go
