i first viewed they died with there boots onabout 1970 and though it has been many years sincethis film and its impression remainthe cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroicwhen i first saw this film i knew the wisest as well as the only real position to have was to enjoy this film as a rousing bit of entertainment and then somei felt then as i even feel now that the silver screen does not as such provide for a true depiction of much of anything let alone the life of george armstrong custerhowever the director raoul walsh was to contribute to the real value represented in this film when i watched a semidocumentary with other great directors like vincent mennelli wherein these central figures talked about there accomplishments with valuable comments providing a glimpse into the hollywood mind setthis is what i considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyableyet there have been so much made of all the problems with the silver screen and its story telling ability that some of the enjoyment has been lost and perhaps you would find that to be true here as wellcuster ranked 34 in a graduating class of34much has been made of custers final class rankingbut of the 68 cadets who entered the military academy with him in 1857half of them had already flunked out or quit by graduation dayjune 241861it is suggested in the movie as the various instructors are determining if a soldier is fit for command and then they come upon the name of george armstrong custer and there is to be certain an exchange between the two sides and here is where the sargeant on duty says in almost a low tone even to suggest as if that came out by accidenthis squadron would follow him to hellyour at attention sargeantreprimands tapeif iam not mistaken when flynn shows up at a initial battlefield it acknowledged that custer did not see action right away and indeed he was doing work as a reliable attach√© to not only sheridanbut hancocks forces as well only to end up for a time with the army of the potomac under general george mcclellanthere is some truth to the audacity attributed to custers battlefield heroics as was illustrated when in a counterattack young custer spurred his horse to the lead and boldly plunged in among the stunned confederatesas a lone union soldier surrounded by rebelscusters audacity shone throughhe accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiersincluding a rebel captainyet most outstanding was that in this action he personally captured the very first confederate battle flag taken by the army of the potomacthis notable act of courage marked him as an officer of great battlefield promiserobert lbatemanarmchair generalthere is a problem here and that is the telling of the story and the truth as to george armstrong custerthe story is good hollywood entertainment perhaps even great entertainment but for whatever reasons all that could be told was changed for entertainment purposesthough this maybe jumping the gun it might be well to know that tom custer was to lose his life at the little big horn only a few feet from where george custer was to die as wellthey were brothers and tom custer to this very day holds a honorable distinction of being amongst a very small group perhaps only 3 others to have been awarded the medal of honor twice in his military careerthe list of engagements that the motion picture shows indicate that custers indeed was an active young officerhe was not with union forces at either chancellorsville or for that matter fredericksburg however he was with them at the battle of antietam and at that point in time he was actually promoted to captain by general mcclellan but that was not to last as mcclellan was soon to be replaced due to the historical fact that the army of the potomac had the meansand the informationdiscovered wrapped around some cigars was general lees plans to split his forcesand yet he failed to act for some 17 hoursit can be speculated that the war could of been over then and there had that occurred but when mcclellan failed to act president lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost as a result custers greatest victory may of in fact come at gettysburgpahis forces which occupied an area called cemetery ridge at the field at gettysburg in the summer of 1863 were able to defeat a jeb stuart led cavalry of some 6000 rebels with but a force of 2300i think the heroics at gettysburg by custer are worth some discussionthere is speculation had in the movie that custers appointment was a blunder well you better guess again because not only did custer have men in his corner but he established a petition to present to the governor of the state of michigan which by the way was relatively new to the union cause and where preparing to form cavalry regimentsthough custer was severely admonished for that kind of shenanigan when he showed up in all that gold braid it was not by accident as you would be led to believethe truth be told custers defense at gettysburg prohibited jeb stuart from having lunch at the unions rear stores and vitally protected that flankthis action by the way occurred and it was timed to coincide with picketts charge so to make for the greatest likelihood of successit was a critical victory and custer was at his bravest and besthis men did follow him to hell and lived to tell about it
