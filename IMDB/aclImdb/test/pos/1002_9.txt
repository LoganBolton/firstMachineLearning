i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressivebr br i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable characterbr br spolier alert i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance end spoilerbr br keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna millers performance that was truly oscar worthybr br i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards
