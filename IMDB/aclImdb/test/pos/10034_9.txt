its true that they died with their boots on gives a highly fictionalized account of george armstrong custers errol flynn life and career but a remarkable one especially with regard to the battle of the little big horn because it is not a given that a 1941 movie tries to portray both the usamerican cavalryman and native american leader chief crazy horse anthony quinn in a favorable light im almost tempted to say that little big man in its unqualified anticuster stance seems unbalanced by comparison further one should not be mislead by the title of the picture Â– this isnt just a movie about the battle of the little big horn its a movie about that shows the unreliable west point cadet the famed civil war hero the indian fighter and last but not least the husbandbr br the movie begins with custers time at the west point military academy where his recalcitrance and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits during a punitive military exercise he meets his future wife elizabeth bacon olivia de havilland who like custer himself is a native of monroe michigan custer intends to court her but the outbreak of the civil war calls him away custers legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes the greatest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary southern cavalry general jeb stuart during the battle of gettysburg while on leave he travels to monroe and courts elizabeth who promises him her hand in matrimony immediately after the war custer and elizabeth bacon are marriedbr br with the civil war over custer is demoted doesnt get a real command and has to go through the painstakingly slow process of promotion in the small professional american army as he starts to drink his wife intervenes in his behalf with former generalinchief winfield scott custer is given the command of the us 7th cavalry which he trains to be an elite unit neither custer nor crazy horse are desirous of battle but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through indian lands in clear violation to earlier treaties custer explicitly acknowledges the justice of crazy horses cause but rides into battle to do his duty as a soldier exposing the conspiracy of the moneyed interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battlebr br they died with their boots on though short on historical accuracy is as good as war movies and westerns in the 1940s got both custer and crazy horse are played by major actors neither the indians nor the southern confederacy are denigrated and the courtship scenes with beautiful livvy de havilland are just charming the only minus and thats why i cant give this picture a full 10 is the undercurrent of racism in the portrayal of african american servants elizabeths servant callie is the stereotypical overweight goodnatured superstitious black mammybr br it is also interesting that the movie does not find fault with either custer or crazy horse but with the greed of the railroad companies pressuring washington politicians with semicriminal methods into breaking assurances they had given to the native americans just a couple of years later the insinuation that american entrepreneurs could even think of doing anything remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a hint that the film makers were communist sympathizersbr br needless to say that they died with their boots on omits the fact that custers overly aggressive tactics often bordered on the foolhardy greatly overstates the importance of his engagement with stuart and doesnt mention the lack of reconnaissance prior to the battle of the little big horn nevertheless custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to point to in the battles of brandy station gettysburg trevilian station and others though his feats of arms were not as decisive for the civil war as they died with their boots on suggestsbr br in any event they died with their boots on is a wellmade war movie with western elements three outstanding performers flynn quinn and de havilland and offers a positive view of native americans as well as a negative one on big money which wouldnt be seen in major hollywood productions for decades to come it would deserve a 10 if it werent for the racist minstrelization of african americans
