this movie is good for entertainment purposes but it is not historically reliable if you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself oh i want to learn more about custers life and his last stand do not rent they died with their boots on but if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film with a little bit of romance and just for a good story this is a fun movie to watchbr br the story starts out with custers errol flynn first day at west point everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything the movie follows his career from west point and his many battles including his battle in the civil war the movie ends with his last stand at little big horn in between the battle scenes he finds love and marriage with libby olivia de havillandbr br errol flynn portrays the arrogant but suave george armstrong custer well olivia de havilland plays the cute sweet libby very well especially in the flirting scene that custer and libby first meet their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance the acting in general was impressive especially the comedic role  although stereotypical of callie played by hattie mcdaniel her character will definitely make you laughbr br the heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes the beautiful costumes set the tone of the era the script at times was corny although the movie was still enjoyable to watch the directors portrayal of custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable some will watch this movie and see custer as a hero others will watch this movie and learn hate himbr br i give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film
