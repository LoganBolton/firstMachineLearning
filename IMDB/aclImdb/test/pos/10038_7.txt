naturally along with everyone else i was primed to expect a lot of hollywood fantasy revisionism in they died with their boots on over the legend of custer just having someone like errol flynn play custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production and for the most part my expectations were fulfilled in an admittedly rousing and entertaining waybr br yet even in this obviously biased and much criticized retelling of the custer story i was struck by some of the points made in this movie that sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly seemed to counter the typical clich√©s of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in westerns of the early 20th centurybr br for instance even while this film attempted to whitewash its hero certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the reallife custer br br 1 his initial entrance at the west point front gate in which his arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of his characterbr br 2 his miserable record at west point which seems to be attributed as much to custers cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor there are moments in the way flynn plays custer at west point where he seems downright stupidbr br 3 custers promotion to general is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake but it plays out as slapstick comedy i halfexpected to see the marx brothers or abbott and costello wander into the scenebr br 4 custers stand against jeb stuart at gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership but is presented as reckless and wildly luckybr br 5 custers drinking problem is certainly not ignoredbr br and although the music and some of the ways the indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the black hills squarely at the foot of the white man in fact no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not anthony quinn as sitting bull but arthur kennedy  co as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the black hills sure that part of the story is true but i didnt expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivically in a movie like thisbr br and one other thing usually in these films it is the indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol in this movie it is actually the troops of the 7th cavalry and not the indians who in at least two scenes are portrayed this waybr br all in all this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the hollywood bunk
