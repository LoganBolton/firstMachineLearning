the saving grace of this film is its humour playing up to the strengths of their star warner brothers cast their version of general custer as a cocky dashing irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism it was robin hood all over again and flynn blossomed in the role all his best action pictures made use of his talent for mischief and comic timing and this one was no exceptionbr br it also benefits from the return of former costar olivia de havilland despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership the part of strongminded libby custer is a better role than the sweet loveinterest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in flynns later films and after seeing the script he had specifically requested de havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part in this final collaboration she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is at heart basically a romping adventure movie and the screen chemistry is rekindled  for once she and flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple to equally winning effectbr br the flynnde havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this films durability when most of flynns other westerns  held in such affection by the contemporary american public although allegedly not by their star  have long since been forgotten the action scenes are fairly cursory despite ironically the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges and the villains of the piece turn out schoolboyfashion to be the same people who were horrid to our hero on his very first day at west point and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career it cuts down on the cast list but its a trifle too morally convenientbr br however these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players memorably including anthony quinn in an allbutwordless role as the sioux leader errol flynn gallops his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal charmingly sheepish looks unexpected sweetness mischievous twinkles flashpoint indignation cheerful fellowship and sheer highoctane charisma hes a reckless braggart but you cant help but like him and its hard to go away without the tune of garryowen threading its jaunty way through your ears for many days thereafterbr br this is one of flynns lasting hits it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun and is a film worthy of being remembered
