i have to rate this movie at a 10 im sorry but i think its classic comedy then if youre rating it to other madonna movieswell what you wanna tell me it wasnt her best movie ever didnt mira sorvino win an oscar for almost the same performance not ten years later please this movie deserves much more credit than it gets plus i like to think of it as an a sociological study into the lifestyles of the 80s remember when you could shoplift from sam goody and cartier in the same day remember when women wore bushy eyebrows proudly so it was no last emperor it was still good there are certain movies id be willing to watch everyday three actually that pep up my day and make me smile if you like whos that girl then id also recommend party girl and romy and michelles high school reunion
