when i see a movie i usually seek entertainment but of course if i know what genre the move is then i will seek what it is meant to do for example if it is a deep film i expect the film to rile thoughts up in my cranium and make me ponder what it is saying but whos that girl is not a deep film but it is entertaining nonetheless its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts ive watched it when i was younger the cast is always entertaining as usual i had a small crush on griffin dunne even though he wasnt the typical male heartthrob at the time haviland morris also stars and late austrian actress bibi besch is here too overall a delight
