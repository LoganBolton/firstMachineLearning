if this film had been made in the 50s or 60s critics and fans alike would have praised it i myself enjoyed the film from beginning to end its not a timeless piece and has not aged well over the years but it is enjoyable to watch nonetheless as for mrs ritchies acting in the film not the best on the planet  but it adds to the films unique slapstick comedyaspirations and showcases madonnas often underrated sense of comedic timing madonna plays nikki finn an exconvict who was framed for a crime she didnt commit griffin dunne plays the hapless future groompuppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station where a series of unfortunate events occurs thus creating the plot and there is one folks give the film a shot you might be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is
