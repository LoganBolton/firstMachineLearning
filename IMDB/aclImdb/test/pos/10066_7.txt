madonna gets into action again and she fails again whos that girl was released just one year after the huge flop of shangai surprise and two after the successful cult movie desperately seeking susan she chose to act in it to forget the flop of the previous movie not suspecting that this latter could be a flop too the movie received a bad acceptance by american critic and audience while in europe it was a success madonna states that some people dont want that shes successful both as a pop star and a moviestar the soundtrack album in which she sings four tracks sells well and the titletrack single was agreat hit all over the world as like as the world tour the truth isthat madonna failed as an actress cause the script was quite weak butits not so bad especially for those who like the 80s its such a ramshackle trash colorful and joyful action movie  at the end its very funny to watch it
