whats his name loudon loudon what clearbr br that gag still gets me twenty one years after the film was releasedbr br i loved the film back then and i love it today i must have watched this a hundred times back in the day and when i bought the dvd recently i could still remember some of the dialoguebr br madonna plays nikki finn a young woman jailed for a crime she didnt commit when she gets out she decides to seek revengebr br griffin dunne whatever happened to him plays an attorney for his fiancées father john mcmartin the future fatherinlaw asks loudon to take nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus as part of a supposed new public relations programme a seemingly easy task but there are complications aplenty some funny dialogue and some admittedly stupidbutfunny scenes along the waybr br madonna has a stupid voice in this film which until i was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me hence only 810 but on the other hand i cant imagine her doing it in her normal voicebr br this film shows madonnas comic side too lacking these days perhaps and she genuinely is funny in the role dunne makes a great foil while haviland morris is perfect as the uppity fiancéebr br yes its predictable yes the jokes could be better but i think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times more
