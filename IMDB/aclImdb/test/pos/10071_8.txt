i kid you not yes whos that girl has the distinction for being one in a string of madonnas films that bombed but i actually liked this movie more than desperately seeking susan in susan madonnas character is relegated to being secondfiddle to rosanna arquette and is not given much to work with no disrespect to rosanna but in wtg madonna plays this zany outrageous character only done in an 80s style while it may seem cheesy today this is actually one of madonnas best and one of her most underrated filmsbr br madonna plays nikki finn an excon who is sent to the slammer for a crime she didnt commit shes being released from jail after four years of good behavior griffin dunne who is also a very underrated actor plays louden trott a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station of course when these two get together thats when the madness happens sir john mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of manhattan with a rainforest on his roof br br this movie parodies everything rich people the sleazy characters who live in harlem and totally destroy loudens rollsroyce the gay cops who follow madonna and dunne around town and dunnes stuckup fiance wendy worthington who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in new york city played by haviland morris who was jakes girlfriend caroline in sixteen candles hilarious plus dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of bringing up baby plus madonna had a great platinum blonde 80s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of wtgbr br madonna is the queen of deadpan acting there are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly it turns out to be funny thats how some of the best comedy should be played  straight madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark sexuallycharged roles in the notorious movies body of evidence and dangerous game br br some people say madonna cannot act and that is fine people are entitled to their opinion but i believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between madonna playing a character on film instead they still see only madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies its still a fun screwball comedy of the 80s not for everyone im sure some of you will dislike it so i would recommend it mainly for madonna fans but you never know you might be surprised and like it br br interesting note one of madonnas friends from her early80s new york club days coati mundi who plays raoul was a member in the bands kid creole and the coconuts and savannah band
