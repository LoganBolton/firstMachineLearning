i saw this movie the day it opened in nyc at the ziegfield at the time madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now she had a couple of hits was very good in desparately seeking susan and i had tickets to see her in concert at giants stadium br br whos that girl gives madonna an actual role to play which is not just a variation of her own personality she does the madcapheroine routine better than you might think griffin dunne is very well cast as the man around to witness all the shenanigansbr br the story involves a huge cat named murray a bridetobe who has slept with every cabbie in nyc a mean fatherinlaw and a key there are a lot of car chases and cops trailing their path all the elements of a screwball comedy intact br br sir john mills is seen briefly he shares a glass of champagne with the leads and has the greatest apartment on the upper west side complete with a rain forest and everything br br compared to most madonna movies the ones ive been able to tolerate anyway this is fantastic on its own its not that bad 610br br ps the concert was lousy
