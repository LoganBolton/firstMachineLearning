watching this little movie is a sheer delight from start to finish the story is always entertaining the tension never loosing up the whole cast is wonderful the teaming of walken and bracco works to perfection it is almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance bracco is very sexy and really funny as the scam artist who fights for her independence for some reason they gave walken a very strange make up and the weirdest haircut i can imagine Â– its sort of a parody of the one burt lancaster had in elmer gantry for me it added to the pleasure its the first movie i saw miguel ferrer in probably one of the most underappreciated movie actors of his generation hes very good in a small role as braccos pimp even the jamaican thugs are a sight to behold i can highly recommend this movie
