its strange how the least known movies sometimes end up amongst the best youve seen this movie has all the elements of a standard modern day thriller guns techno baddies cash etc and yet it stands out from your average hollywood alsoran i would credit this to two very charismatic people christopher walken has a cool confidence and lorraine bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women ive ever seen on screen another major reason why this film stands out is coz the setting shifts to jamaica after the beginning the jamaican resort is so beautiful youll wish you were there sitting by the pool at night with a runncoke   i know i did im very glad i saw this movie  it was just too nice to miss
