this was a great movie it was a completely enjoyable adolescent fantasy so what makes a movie great technical details i think that if that were the sole criteria our culture would be the poorer for it so this movie is to the godfather as new wave music is to mozart the point is it is one of the best movies of its type ive seen the women are all beautiful as are only seen on california beaches when movies are being made it has a little of everything a kind of battlestar gallactica meets baywatch meets the playboy centerfold video meets waynes world there is plenty of charm and a reasonable albeit predictable storyline that keeps you interested until the next bit of eye candy graces the screen joe estevez may not have his brothers career but does a good job of bringing focus to the story as the eternally adolescent uncle bud contains plenty of expected absurdities such as female rock band playing without the guitars plugged in was that intentional if youre attracted to the box rent the video you wont regret it as is promised it is good nonviolent erotic fun
