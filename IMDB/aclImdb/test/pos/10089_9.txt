disgused as an asian horror a tale of two sisters is actually a complex character driven psychological drama that engulfs the viewer into the problems of a seemingly normal family i was really surprised at the depth of this movie director jiwoon kims decision to focus more on telling a story rather than providing cheap scares has proved a correct one creating one of the most ingenious new horror moviesbr br a tale of two sisters tels the story as its name suggest of two sisters sumi and the younger suyeon who after spending time in a mental institution return home to their father and apparently abusive stepmother from then on we witness how the sisters deal with their stepmothers gradually rising aggression and erratic behavior to say what would happen next would be to be spoil the entire experience so ill just leave it at thatbr br the plot is very tightly written with the characters nicely fleshed out jiwoon kims focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view on them and their relations to one another furthermore each of the four main cast has a vastly different role and type of character from the protective sumi the weaker suyeon the visibly uninterested father to the stepmothers frantic and later deadly behavior there is great sense of mystery with a lot of the plot not revealed up into the end and even after that the movie still leaves a great room for interpretation even after watching it once the viewer will be compelled to see it at least once more so that he can gain a better understanding to itbr br the actors superbly fit their roles it is especially hard to create strong emotional scenes in psychological movies but it is a great joy when one succeeds in creating them and this is a prime example of such a feat jiwoon kims direction is slow paced and gripping building up tension for the films horroresque scenes while few in number those moments are strong and quite frankly terrifying the cinematography and score are top notch further helping to establish an atmosphere fitting that of a psychological filmbr br a tale of two sisters is a demonstration how the horror genre is in fact so much more than a simple thrill ride with its strong focus on character and mystery this is one complex movie that could easily seduce you in watching it again and again just so that you can understand it better
