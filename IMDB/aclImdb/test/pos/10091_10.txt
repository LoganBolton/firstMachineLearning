i must say im an avid horror movie fan and currently i cant get enough of foreign horror since us horror really depends too much on gorebr br this movie is fantastic this movie reminded me a lot of m nights sixth sense the way the film was directed was great the director took his time to set everything up it took about a good 40 mins just to set the movie up into a horror movie i thought the movie was just a drama this movie just builds up and the pay off isnt too muchbr br ive never done this before but this is the main reason i liked the movie i actually screamed out loud because one scene just startled the hell out of me which is kinda pathetic but for a film to do that its great
