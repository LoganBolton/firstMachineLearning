the idea is not original if you have seen such kind of story before you would know what the ending would come out after watching for the first twenty minutes the script the positioning of the actors and the screening is too obvious if you havent seen such story before it is definitely a good experience you will enjoy the twist at the enddont forget to watch it again after you know the truth you will even more enjoy the plots even though i have a right guess at the very beginning i still couldnt help stick on my seat till the endbr br conclusion a must see this one from korea is better than any recent movies of the genre from japanforget hollywoodbr br dont miss it
