to most of us life is an unfolding process of love for others like soomi however it is dominated by darkness and fear based on the korean folk tale jangha and hongryun kim jiwoons brilliant gothic horror story a tale of two sisters revolves around two sisters soomi lim sujeong and sooyeon mun geonyeong who are part of a dysfunctional family that live together in a creepy victorianstyle mansion feeling alienated from the world they cling to each other for survival with the older soomi obsessively protecting the younger sooyeon against danger for soomi however not coming to terms with the circumstances surrounding her mothers death means mental illness and a mind at odds with realitybr br while we may recognize staples such as haunted houses with apparitional sightings doors that open and close on their own a cruel and overbearing stepmother and other events of high strangeness a tale of two sisters superbly explores deeper psychological meanings including the inability to let go of inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge soomi says do you know whats really scary you want to forget something totally wipe it off your mind but you never can it cant go away you see and and it follows you around like a ghost there is a time line but it is left for the viewer to unravel the plot cannot be summarized only suggested and the film keeps us wondering whether what is happening on screen is objective or subjectivebr br in the films opening soomi an obviously disturbed young woman is being questioned by a doctor in a setting that looks like a mental institution when the doctor asks her to describe what happened that day the film flashes back to when soomi and sooyeon return to the home of their father moohyeon kim kapsu and stepmother eunjoo yum jungah the stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant but it is obvious that it is soomi who is really hurting as the girls try to readjust they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house which may be nightmares or supernatural occurrencesbr br soomi sees a figure at the foot of her bed that hovers over her and oozes black blood a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into convulsions a monster emerges from between the legs of one of the sisters people mysteriously disappear from photographs and many other maniacal schizophrenic devices to keep the viewer dangling on the edge of insanity while we sense that much of the story is the projection of someones mind we do not know whose and the film keeps us constantly challenged at least until an important clue is offered in the films second halfbr br shot in gorgeous lowlight cinematography a tale of two sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that transcends all the scares and there are plenty it is haunting in more than one sense of the word and its images may stare back at you when you least expect or want them to while the film may not offer the weary traveler much in the way of light it shows us where we can end up if we opt for the darkness in the words of a wise observer blame is never the answer  whether it is blaming yourself or others rather the answer lies in stepping out of judgment entirely  both of yourself and others forgiveness and understanding have great power of healing
