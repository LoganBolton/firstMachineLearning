three words piece of art this film is just great its beautiful sad frightening and thoughtprovoking at the same time the score constantly stays in my head the acting is wonderful the scenery scary and beautiful at the same timebr br it was more by chance than on purpose that i saw this movie at the time i decided to watch this movie i was just bored and read lists of asian films which maybe good well i saw the title a tale of two sisters which sounded very interesting then i read the summary of the plot and decided you dont just watch this film youve gotta buy it said done i bought this film and was hooked from the very first minutebr br the plot kept me interested from the beginning till the end the twist near the end of the film made me scream i really didnt see something like this coming and the ending scene made me cryit just made me cry it was so sadbr br well i recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that combines an interesting plot with scary scenes and atmosphere although you should be aware of the fact that the ending is as i mentioned before a very sad one but this just fits in the mood of the film doesnt it
