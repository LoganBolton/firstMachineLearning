i just saw a tale of two sisters last night and really enjoyed it ive been a big fan of asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from south korea there arent many jump out at you scares as in the usual american horror film but the director does maintain the offkilter and foreboding mood very well especially in the awkward character interactions with each other most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyones theres something under the bed fears from when they were a child but in this case its the closet and the sink i also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together hes also good at revealing peoples inner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her makeup in the mirror or her sitting in front of the flickering tv i think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over youbr br major spoilers ahead do not read any further if you do not want the twists of the movie revealed i was following the story pretty well but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part however i think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together the film is very much like the machinist in the way two of the characters joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusionsbr br heres my interpretation of the film the suyeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of sumi or the actual ghost of suyeon that only sumi can see and interact with the initial stepmother that we see is in my opinion a delusion of sumi there is a real stepmother however and she first appears in the film when shes wearing the gray pantsuit i believe its the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she doesnt appear until he pick her up and brings her to the house the stepmother before that point is imagined by sumi perhaps part of her split personality that explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmothers brother looks at her like shes crazy and doesnt remember anything that she recounts i think it was sumi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality the film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her makeup in the mirror which is revealed later to actually be sumi wiping her makeup in the mirrorbr br i think the ghosts in the house arent entirely imagined by sumi and are either of suyeon or the mother or both in the final flashback it is revealed the suyeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died this is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink also its the hairpin that suyeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sinkbr br the real stepmother in the end gets punished by the ghost of suyeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like the ring after that the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death while sumi unintentionally played a supporting rolebr br i wonder if the mother that suyeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry in the flashback is a ghost already perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet thats left ambiguousbr br other things that are suggested but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother at some point was a nurse perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too its not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself its also suggested that the mother had mental issues too requiring a nurse the stepmother alludes to this when she tells sumi youre beginning to take after your mother i dont think she meant just physicallybr br also if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually sumi then theres the suggestion of incest too since the father sleeps with her is that why sumi freaks out and shouts dont touch me each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes is that the filthy things that youve done that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father this film is interesting in its capacity for different interpretations a few of the scenes however were kind of derivative such as the woman in the black crawling around scene which reminded me of the herkyjerky movements of kayako in the juonthe grudge films also the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of the ring furthermore just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from the sixth sense or the othersbr br overall i enjoyed it however and it will be interesting to see how the hollywood remake thats already in production turns out i have to be honest i liked both the ring and the grudge so im not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes cant be good too one remake that im really excited about is dark water coming out this summer i havent seen the original japanese version yet but both films are definitely on my tosee list
