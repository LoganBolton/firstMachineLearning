this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces br br the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute quite literally jiwoon kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels a seemingly insignificant object may be shown  a rack of dresses two diaries a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack a bottle of pills etc  but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more  a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene or perhaps the movie in total which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewers intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie but in a tale of two sisters such events occur in such a rapidfire relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness lest they miss something important in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginablebr br the most commonly cited criticism of a tale of two sisters is nicely summarized by zaphod b goode who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions he posits that jiwoon kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that in reality however nothing could be further from the truth a tale of two sisters provides a series of unassailably objective facts that help the viewer to identify the exact occurrences of each and every scene of the film if our good friend zaphod had been paying attention he would have noticed  for example  the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film these flashbacks convincingly contradict zaphods assertion of complete subjectivity the objective elements of a tale of two sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them can jiwoon kim really be faulted for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film i think notbr br please note that i will not insult the intelligence of critics such as zaphod that cannot get a tale of two sisters because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence the movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture you need only put them together remember the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind  he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that  when completed  bestows an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awebr br dont misunderstand me there are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design spider forest 2004 perfect blue 1998 and donnie darko 2001 are perfect examples of this a tale of two sisters is not its ironic that zaphod claims darko to be more masterfully constructed than a tale of two sisters especially considering that darko not only provides almost no objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina cliché that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence im ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence but the contrast is an important one although it does perplex me that zaphod would cite a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant application of intellectual effort he apparently likes his intelligent films in the most superficial form possible this is evident when he makes 17 consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself just read the threads by opiemar within the imdb a tale of two sisters discussion forum anyone who carefully reads those threads and still asserts a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned obviousbr br id like to say more but ive come to my 1000 word limit all that has been said here needed to be said so be it now said
