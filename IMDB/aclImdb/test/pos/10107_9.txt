i love horror films but i think they work way better when they hide a dramatic impact behind the devils backbone the exorcist for example this is that kind of film and its not only eerie and terrifying when it has to be it is also really beautiful a tale of two sisters starts really slow so if youre in a hurry to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes you will be disappointed actually this is not a ghost story though there are some its something more complex and its done in such a way that it beats ringu and the grudge out of the ring no sweat a tale is a way more clever film than those huge cultural hits because it really cares for its characters and the direction is flawless every detail in this film will leave you breathless if youre the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie the acting is superb specially from the stepmother and the main girl those two are worth the price of the ticket alone do yourself a favor and watch this awesome film
