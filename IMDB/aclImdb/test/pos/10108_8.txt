perhaps im one of the only avid horror fans who thinks that the recent overload of asian shockers is so overhyped films like ringu or the the eye  which are praised all over the world  simply didnt convince me and they looked more boring than frightening well this blunt opinion doesnt go for the south korean gem a tale of two sisters this is a stylish and utterly complex psychological terrortale that really gets under your skin the plot based on a local folklore tale might be a little too confusing to get this film listed among the alltime greatest genre achievements but the atmosphere and tensionbuilding surely provokes feelings of great respect this is one of those few films that are impossible to label the events in two sisters qualify as mindbending horror as well as intense family drama and a deeply psychological portrait besides a mesmerizing story a tale of two sisters also has all the great elements that i feel are usually missing in asian horror films like compelling music good acting and innovative camerawork the mansion were the family events take place is brilliantly illustrated like a truly creepy place where secrets and danger lurk behind every door several sequences like the dinner with relatives or the nightly appearance in the girls room are pretty much the ultimate in eeriness they really made me feel uncomfortable and i do like to believe that ive seen my share of spooky horror a tale of two sisters is a terrific movieadventure and a definite must see for asian film fanatics a little warning for people with a short attentionspan though this movie forces you to have your eyes and ears focused at at all time its also a film that requires repeated viewing even though no one will never really get it for a full 100
