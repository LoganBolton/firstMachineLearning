the beauty the terror the poetry the horror the innocence the guiltbr br maybe thats just about all i should write in this comment for a tale of two sisters the best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it i myself didnt even know one single thing about the history of the two girls when i went into this movie i just took a look at the nice coverart didnt even read the synopsis on the back and popped it into dvdplayer i only knew that it won several prices on festivals around the world and that it came highly recommendedbr br the dvdcover read the most frightening film since the ring the grudge and dark water though the frighteningpart might be right you can forget about the rest because the only thing a tale of two sisters has in common with those movie is a ghostly apparition with long black hair its even a bit unfair to compare it with those famous japanese movies because this korean movie has a lot more to offer and is in fact a bit more complicated and intelligent than those othersbr br this movie simply is a small masterpiece and here are some reasons without telling anything about the plot the movie itself caught me off guard at least two times with clever surprisetwists and just when you think youve had the conclusion whether you get it or not thats irrelevant for the moment and you think the movie will end this movie goes on a bit longer the cinematography is amazing using bright colors during the day and dark shades at night the camerawork is excellent with the director sometimes choosing impressive if not innovating angles some shots are pure poetry eg the topshot with the two sisters at the lake it all looks very stylish there are only four main characters but the intrigue surrounding them is intense the story itself starts a bit slow but theres a lot of variety in tone and emotions to keep it interesting there was even one scene when the girls took off towards the lake that suddenly had me remembering peter jacksons heavenly creatures but when the horror kicks in its quite effective there are also a few successful surprisescares in it damn i jumped right up from my sofa the musical score is great and at times when its not supposed to be scary i couldnt help but noticing that it had sort of an italian feeling to it a bit strange for a korean movie but nevertheless a great score so much care went into every detail of this film including a perfectly balanced surround soundbr br i also think that calling a tale of two sisters just a horror movie is giving it not enough credit its more a mysterious horrordrama that works both on a psychological and supernatural level no matter how you look at it this is asian horror that ranks way up there amongst the finest it might not be gory but it gets pretty scary at times and the subject matter is pretty disturbed so if you havent seen it yet then find a copy pop it into your dvdplayer go with the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for its 110 minutes running timebr br there i hope i did a good job praising it without spoiling anything
