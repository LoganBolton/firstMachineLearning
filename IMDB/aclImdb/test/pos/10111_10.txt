the recent history of hollywood remakes of ghosthorror films from the east has been dismal this film will inevitably suffer the same fate so get a copy on ebay or similarbr br it is well photographed and the sound is superb viewing on a good screen and with a good 51 or dts enabled sound system is recommended obviously it is subtitled so if that puts you off then i wouldnt bother with this dubbing rarely works and simply would not do herebr br it is also genuinely frightening with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to western audiences i would particularly single out the stepmother character who was utterly brilliant the ending will have you wanting to watch it again if you can cope the plot is relentless and offers no comforting moments of release along the waybr br if i do have a small criticism there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the japanese version of the ring we have however accepted straight copies of other peoples ideas for western films for years and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 1010 i believe most fans of this genre will derive huge pleasure from this film which i for one hope goes down as a classic
