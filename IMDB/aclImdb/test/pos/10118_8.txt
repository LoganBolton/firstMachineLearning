br br having read the unemployed critics review i went to a screening of radio not knowing what to expect thankfully the unemployed critic now appears to me anyway a frustrated film directormovie critic his review is callous and totally uncalled forbr br this is a movie that will make you laugh it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of pausebr br to paraphrase a line delivered by actor ed harris in the final barbershop scene and all this time that we thought we were teaching radio truth ishe was teaching us he treats us all the time like we wish we treated each other some of the timebr br yes the movie tugs at the heartstrings yes it is emotionally manipulative and yes cuba gooding jr in an oscar worthy performance is a little over the top at times see the christmas day dance scene but you know what so what every once in awhile the community of america needs to be reminded what tolerance can do for our great country we need to be reminded how great we can bebr br this is a solid cast i was particularly pleased to see s epatha merkerson portraying radios mother do something outside of law and order i always wondered is ms merkerson a great actor or is it the quality of writing delivered buy a strong cast on law and order after watching this movie it is easy to see that she is indeed a very fine actorbr br also joining the cast in small but important and powerful roles is alfre woodard as the principal debra winger in a careerresurrecting role of coach joness wife and chris mulkey as protagonist frank claybr br we cannot over look ed harriss performance as coach harold jones after reflecting on this movie and having grown up in the deep south my self it is hard to truly appreciate mr harris and his contribution to this film as coach jones ed delivers a quiet rock solid performance that of a man on a mission coach harris will not let the town or circumstances divert him from what he knows in his heart is the right thing to dobr br if you see this movie make sure you hang around for the end credits you will be in for a treat as the real james robert radio kennedy now in his mid 50s is shown still leading the tl hanna football team on to the field every friday nightbr br one final note if you were a teen in the mid to late 70s this movie is worth the price of admission for the sound track alone
