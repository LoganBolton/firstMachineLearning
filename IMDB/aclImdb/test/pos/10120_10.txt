i just got home from seeing radio ive not seen such an inspiring story in a long time my kids are ages 8 and 5 and i would like to take them so that they may feel the message as i did  you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are not judge them for their differences cuba gooding jr and ed harris both deserve academy awards for this movie i dont know why we cant have more movies like this rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basis
