this is a movie youll either love or hate i loved it if you are looking for suspense great special effects action sophistication cynicism etc you wont find it in this movie it is a feel good movie sentimental positive uplifting the heroes of the movie are coach jones played by ed harris a man of strength and integrity and radio cuba gooding jr a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world i guess i didnt find this movie to be sentimental hogwash as so many did because it felt very real to me i know people like these ive seen jocks who think its fun to pick on the vulnerable ive seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable ive seen people who think high school football is serious business ive seen people who know what really is important in life any of these people could have been people i knew i did laugh i did cry i left the movie feeling good remembering that there are people like coach jones and radio in my world if there arent people like them in yours you might not like the movie if you dont like a movie that shows the better side of human nature youll hate it
