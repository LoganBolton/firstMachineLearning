this was unusual a modernday film which was ultranice in fact it was so nice it bordered on being too hard to believe in parts as i watching this basedonareallife story i was thinking nobody is this nice this tolerant mainly i was referring to ed harris role as coach jones i think they went a little overboard on his character but thats better than the reverse showing him worse than what he was in real life odd to see harris playing the role too since he has a long resume of playing nasty profane charactersbr br anyway i never complain about a nice feelgood film and it is nice to see a bunch of well meaning kind people those folks direct their friendship love and compassion to james kennedy better known as radio a mentally slow high school kid played by cuba gooding jr the story takes place in the mid 1970s in south carolina gooding does a nice job with the role too however like sean penns role of a mentallychallenged man in i am sam an hourandahalf of a character like this is plenty after that the loudness of those guys gets tiresome to hearbr br note it was interesting in one of the documentaries on this dvd to find out that in real life in took years for radio to make his transformation not months as shown in the film
