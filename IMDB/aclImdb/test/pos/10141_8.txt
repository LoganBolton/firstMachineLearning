certainly this film has the ring of truth about it as it purports to be based on actual occurrences at a marine base it deals with the attempted coverup by the local marine commander of unacceptable conduct by a marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend a marine captain the man and woman had been lovers but the captain attempted to break off the relation when she discovered her boy friend was married he continued to stalk her going so far as to fire his side arm in her direction at one time finally he broke into her home attacked her with a knife and was shot twice with her service pistol and killed the civilian prosecutor ruled the killing self defense but the marines decided to charge the captain with murder the major you see was a decorated hero from vietnam and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the marine base the captain too had made some enemies in her motor pool command rejecting some male advances in a very butch stylebr br there is considerable psychological freight motivating and controlling the actions of the principal participants in this drama which the very capable cast gets across nicely the director and editor however seem determined to obscure the happenings as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and shifting points of view youre lucky if you know where youre at most of the time bear with them though its a worthwhile story as the captains court martial trial unfolds and it seems every mans hand is against her even her attorney at times br br the verdict well after all this is rather a suspense story so youll have to see for yourself there is a kind of pacifist message folded into the film but forget about that sure war is hell but sometimes it cant be avoided well need those marines then even if they arent always the best champions of fair play internally as kipling says in his poem tommy atkinsbr br its tommy this and tommy that and tommy wait outside but its room for mr atkins when the troopships on the tide
