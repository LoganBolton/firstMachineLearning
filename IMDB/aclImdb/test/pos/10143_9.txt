the man who knew too much1956is a remake of a film that alfred hitchcock made in england in 1934 with the same name in my opinion his later effort is far superior many critics and fans of alfred hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and doesnt have the spine tingling suspense of the original with peter lorre in both films the plot is essentially the same except the original is set in switzerland and the remake in marrakech  it tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris dayvacationing with their young son and meeting a suspicious man that is very curious about their past it just so happens hes an agent thats looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leaderthen he gets stabbed in a marrakeck market because of it being found out that hes a spyand proceeds to fall into stewarts armsdyinghe tells him the whole story of the assassination plotstewart and day then find out that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and have kidnapped their sonthe film contains excellent performances by stewart and dayin a straight dramatic roleas worried and frightened parentsthis film proved that doris day could act in suspenseful dramas as well as carefree musicalsthe direction by alfred hitchcock is topnotchthe film keeps you on the edge of your seat every minutethe scene in albert hall is a classicthe original is so slowpaced and drabi dont know how people can compare the twojust watch the remake and youll enjoy iti give the movie a 9 out of 10
