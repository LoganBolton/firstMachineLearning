1956s the man who knew too much is exceptional entertainment to those who prefer the 1934 original i will say that that one is faster paced and wittier however even though the american version was heaven forbid a big budget blockbuster i believe it blows the british version out of the water i think this is one of hitchcocks 10 bestno small feat considering he made over 50 films and many of them were among the greatest of all time i find so many things to lovebr br 1james stewart americas favorite everyman for so many years does an excellent job playing the distressed father here he can make any film enjoyable and working with such a likeable character in such a gripping story he had me rooting for him very intensely leslie banks in the original is nothing in comparisonbr br 2doris day yes doris day despite all the criticisms directed toward her i think she makes the loving wifemother an extremely sympathetic person i disagree with the negative remarks towards her character just because she is softspoken and gentle it doesnt mean she is docile and helpless i dont want to spoil anything but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed she gives the story a level of warmth that just wasnt there in the first one and for those who care about that this version is the way to go and i loved que sera sera i think it is one of the most beautiful songs ive ever heard and deservedly won its oscar it elevated the film to another levelbr br 3the albert hall sequence i dont think it was too long at all i think the suspense built the whole time to that terrific crescendo and hitchcocks direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant and the assassin was truly frightening br br 4the ending really put a smile on my face even after the aforementioned scene was over i found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again the last line in the film is highly amusing i dont think the film started out slowly hithcock was trying to get us to know and like the mckennas and he did a great job i wasnt a huge fan of the kid playing hank but i didnt have a problem with him since hank was ben and jos kid i cared about him too its not like he was a brat or anything br br i found no major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues way to go hitch
