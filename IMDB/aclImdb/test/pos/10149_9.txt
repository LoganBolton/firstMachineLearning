i cant believe this movie only scores 74 this surely ranks up with the best of hitchcocks movies such as vertigo or marnie the only reason i can think of why the score is so low is that for the most part the man renounces violence and certainly wont get a diploma in sex and crimebr br what it derives its tension from is not violence its the reckless energy of these criminals that take a child from his parents and are ready to kill the kid if the operation fails today having seen a lot of hardboiled kidnapping movies as mel gibsons ransom this seems normal but in the 1950s where family was all in contemporary america the thought of such a crime surely has stirred up emotions a lotbr br and this tension still works for me today yeah these guys are selfish ignorant bastards disturbing in how they act its a deal for them and they want to be good businessmen disregarding the fact that business here is kidnapping kids and assassinating politicians in the opera br br what makes the movie great however are the creative aspects the kinky ideas of hitchcock the outrageously disturbing scene in the church which brings it to the viewers attention how alone how abandoned the protagonists are nobody caring nobody helping the people in the church just going home the meeting with the owner of that shop stuffing and preparing dead animals which stresses the somewhat oriental flair the movie has from the opening scenes abroad last not least the role of music in this moviebr br music is the key principle here as spoiler the assassination of the targeted politician is to be done exactly in the moment of a loud orchastra tuttigong so hitchcock lets the camera follow the orchestra score and you now it will happen in a second bang and then of course doris day singing que sera which became more famous than the movie itself she sings it to notify the kid of his parents being in the embassybr br all in all a classic
