less a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements the man who knew too much should not be really be compared with such hitchcock masterpieces as vertigo rear window or psycho it is instead more akin to such enjoyable romps as to catch a thief and north by northwest shot largely on location in morocco and london the film tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris day whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently run afoul of an assassination plotand when their young son is kidnapped in order to insure their silencebr br james stewart and doris day are quite effective in their roles of the allamerican couple and the characters are given an unusual twist stewart a midwestern doctor is outgoing but has a touch of the ugly american abroad about his personality day who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired upon her marriage has a suspicious nature these qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the storybr br the man who knew too much contains a number of famous scenes both the scene in which stewart drugs day before telling her of the kidnapping and the very complex albert hall sequence involving what seems hundreds of cuts are very powerful less often noticed although to my mind equally if not more satisfactory are the more subtle scenes in which hitchcock combines an edge of suspense along with perverse humor as when stewart attempts some detecting at a taxidermist shop and day belts out que sera sera written for this film in a most unsuitable way at an embassy cocktail partybr br although the man who knew too much lacks the depth and impact of hitchcocks greater work it remains an enjoyable film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole its hitchcocklight but recommendedbr br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
