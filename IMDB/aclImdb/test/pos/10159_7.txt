i hate to admit it but i didnt find it to be one of hitchcocks best but nonetheless a riveting climatic thriller in a remake of hitchocks 1934 movie of the same title dr ben mckenna james stewart Â– the man who knows too much  and his wife jo mckenna doris day are holidaying in morocco with their son hank christopher oslen when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot the conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot kidnapping their beloved hankbr br i found it surprising that doris day who i usually associate with rock hudson comedies was cast in a hitchcock film as i was watching it i soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to hitchcocks other works example psycho and she had singing ability needed to pull off que sera sera which she did beautifully she was well cast as herself and james stewart had chemistry which helped make the couple believablebr br in comparison to the great directors other works i believe this isnt as good but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thrillermystery there is also the added bonus of que sera sera which turned out to be a smash hit for doris day well directed well acted a fine film
