ostensibly a story about the young child of jimmy stewart and doris day the kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet they know something about a plot to assassinate the ambassador of an unnamed country during a performance at albert hall in londonbr br the movie is rich in hitchcockian incidents a friendly but opaque frenchman seems to grill the innocent stewart  a doctor from indiana  a little too intensely to be merely idly curious later the frenchman shows up in arab disguise a knife in his back and whispers some information about the murder plot to stewart stewart tells his wife  doris day looking very saucy indeed  but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk his sons lifebr br instead the couple try to track down the assassins buy them off and get their son back taking them from morocco where hitchcock has given us his usual tourists eye view of the customs locations and food to london there is a hilarious wild goose chase involving a setto between stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop the staff are more concerned about guarding their halfstuffed specimens than anything else and they shuffle around protectively holding the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish in the course of the scuffle stewart manages to save his throat from being cut by the swordfish bill but is bitten on the hand by a stuffed tiger the action boosted along by bernard hermanns bumptious score the scene ends with stewart rushing out the door hitchcock ends it with a shot of a lions head gaping at the slammed door there is also a running gag well done about some visitors waiting around the couples hotel room in london waiting for things to be explainedbr br there are two serious issues that are lightly touched on one is the relationship between stewart and day which is not as rosy as it ought to be considered as a bourgeois ideal shes been a stage musical star for some years and is internationally known and shes given it all up to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be a doc thats understandable in say a nurse or a flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star with a promising career in her own right it isnt delved into but the edginess is noticeable as it was not in the original version it reminds me a little of an exchange between joe dimaggio and his thenwife marilyn monroe who had just returned from entertaining the troops in korea oh joe she gushed did you ever see ten thousand people stand up and cheer seventy thousand muttered joe former hero of the new york yankeesbr br the second problem is one of allegiance who is of greater social value ones own young son or an unknown ambassador do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk for the sake of national stability day is faced with this dilemma in its starkest form at the climax in the albert hall her solution opts for allegiance to political stability although her motives are problematic does she scream to save the ambassadors life or does she do so just to release the anxiety that is overwhelming her cf alec guiness falling on the detonator at the end of the bridge on the river kwai the photography is extremely good and the settings can be menacing even on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood of london its midday and stewart is alone and determined but frightened too there are footsteps echoing on gulliver street from someone somewhere is he being followed is his life in danger and where the hell is everybody who lives on this street hitchcock pays such close attention to location details that we can make out the garden wall bonding of the bricks beside himbr br the director had a rare disagreement with francois truffaut while being interviewed for truffauts otherwise laudatory book truffaut argued that the earlier version of the man who knew too much lacked the depth of the later version hitchcock replied it seems to me you want me to make films for the art house audience but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional no argument therebr br this is hitchcock pretty much near his zenith
