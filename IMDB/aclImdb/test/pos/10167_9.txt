a film that tends to get buried under prejudice and preconception  its a remake doris day is in it she sings  hitchcocks second crack at the man who knew too much is his most underrated film and arguably a fully fledged masterpiece in its own rightbr br this is in more ways than one doris days film not only does she give the finest performance of her career more than holding her own against james stewart but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his this is after all a film in which music is both motif and plot device what better casting than the most popular singer of her generation consider days jo mckenna has given up her career on the stage in order to settle down with her husband and raise their son this seems to be a mutual decision and she doesnt appear to be unhappy but look at the way stewart teases her in the horsedrawn carriage over her concerns about louis bernard implying that she is jealous that bernard wasnt asking her any questions about her career this is clearly a recurrent joke between them  she responds with a hardeharhar that denotes the familiarity of this gag suggesting that she has a certain latent resentment about her confinement and that they both realise itbr br after their son has been kidnapped stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news this is a cruel scene brilliantly played by both actors which illustrates the power imbalance in their marriage  he is seeking to control and subdue her reactions in essence using his professional knowledge to suppress her voice in the marriage just as his medical career has suppressed her singing careerbr br the potency of that voice is demonstrated in the ambrose chapel sequence when she has to reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to blend in with the congregation of female drudges  they almost act as a warning of what will become of her if she continues to suppress her talent at the albert hall it is her need to cry out to exercise those impressive lungs that saves a mans life and in the embassy finale it is her talent and reputation that allows them to locate their son by contrast all of stewarts masculine activity is counterproductive  his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end he gets left behind at the church whilst everyone else moves on to the albert hall and his efforts there only succeed in getting the assassin killed thus depriving the police of potentially useful information it is only when his action is joined to his wifes voice in the rescue of hank from the embassy that he actually succeeds in doing something usefulbr br far from being forced into the film to give day an opportunity to sing que sera sera acts as the first musical device in the film foreshadowing the nightmare that is about to engulf the mckennas the futures not ours to see indeed it also neatly prepares the way for the finale in which the close bond mother and son share through music will allow doris to save the daybr br the most famous sequence in the film makes music the central feature  the build up to the assassination attempt in the albert hall this lengthy wordless sequence may be the single most extraordinary thing hitchcock committed to film the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told visually we see people conduct conversations in this sequence but we never hear a word they say we dont need to  the images say everything it is also his most exquisite suspense sequence with the pieces moving slowly into place as the music builds the editing is incredibly tight matched to the music perfectly there isnt a frame out of place  anything that doesnt relate directly to the assassination is giving the viewer a sense of the environment the geography in which all this is playing out it builds slowly but by the end the suspense is nearly unbearable when jo screams it isnt just a relief for her but for the audiencebr br the ambrose chapel sequence is witty and particularly effective for anyone who has had to sit through a service at a particularly stickinthemud nonconformist church the embassy sequence seems a little flat after the albert hall one that preceded it on first viewing but second time around actually seems more effective with the final walk at gunpoint really benefiting from the gorgeous use of day singing in the background reminiscent of the musicasambientnoise in rear window the score as a whole is subtle allowing the music from onscreen sources to be foregrounded effectivelybr br bernard miles is a lowkey villain a little banal but with a dry wit hes outshone by brenda de banzie as his wife who walks a fine line between sinister and sympathetic just look at the way she smokes a cigarette whilst her husband preps the assassin  her stance is pure gangsters moll belying the middleengland exterior but she clearly has a soft side and possibly maternal feelings towards hankbr br stewart is excellent although if hitchcock really did always cast him as everyman as the directors daughter seems to think then it confirms that hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who espoused fascist ideology in rope a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in rear window and an obsessive necrophiliac in vertigo day is nothing short of phenomenal just look at her reaction to the news that her son has been kidnapped  she never overdoes anything but neither does she sell it short this is one of hitchcocks most emotionally effective films he never lets us forget what the stakes are for the mckennas they feel the most fully human of all his central characters
