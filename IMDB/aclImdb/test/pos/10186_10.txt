this is the best 3d experience disney has at their themeparks this is certainly better than their original 1960s acidtrip film that was in its place is leagues better than honey i shrunk the audience and far more fun barely squeaks by the muppetvision 3d movie at disneymgm and can even beat the original 3d movie experience captain eo this film relives some of disneys greatest musical hits from aladdin the little mermaid and others and brought a smile to my face throughout the entire show this is a totally kidfriendly movie too unlike honey and has more effects than the spectacular muppetvision
