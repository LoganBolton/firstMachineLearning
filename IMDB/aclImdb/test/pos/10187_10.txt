its not a movie but an experiencebr br not the usual eye candy i thought it would be too many things are happening at once your senses almost couldnt handle it a product of cuttingedge technology we were torn between just sitting back to enjoy the show and putting our 3d glasses on and off to decipher the magic the music is great its a concert the disney characters are in it and you get to be part of their world its funny its magical its excitingi know this is beginning to sound like an advertisementbut it really is that awesome beats christmas in bringing out the kid in youbr br this attraction alone already makes going to disney all worth it
