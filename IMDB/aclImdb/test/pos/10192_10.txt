the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to due in no small part to john woos masterful direction coupled with kats superb cinematography some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental there are moments when this one borders on becoming an arthouse film both james tien and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you cant help but love to hate tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad its a role reversal the likes of which i dont think ive ever seen before tien normally played a hero and in fact with his moustache i didnt even recognize him at first sammos goofy buck teeth only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable in a villain you love to hate kind of way his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic jackie chan appears briefly early on and late in the going as a blacksmith and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent
