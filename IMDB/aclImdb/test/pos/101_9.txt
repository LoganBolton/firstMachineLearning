this is a very very odd filmone that is so odd its best you just see it for yourself the film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is you can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynicfinding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of selfimportance additionally he seems tired and bored with the monotony of lifebr br later in the film he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head oddly this is only halfway through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life this is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature professors novelsone that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say thembr br see this weird filmits amazingly compelling and not like anything ive ever seen before
