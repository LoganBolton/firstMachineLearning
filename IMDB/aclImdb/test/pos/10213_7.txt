i saw this years ago and its entertaining but not profound the basic story is of a young man who dreams of midian though hes not sure where it is or even if it really existsbr br spoilers follow he finally visits it gets transformed to a nightbreed creature by being bitten by another one then he has to help the other members of the nightbreed because theyre being attacked by canadians save for the accents they all act like good ol boys not much in tune with the canadian psyche eh someone observed for monsters or nightbreed substitute jews and for the canadianshumans substitute nazis and youre supposed to get an insight into the struggle by the monsters versus the humans well maybebr br one major objection i had was that while the underground city was interesting it was rather ramshackle and frankly dirty this must be a convention for movies with underground settlements one would think that if the monsters were the good guys some would have at least a little sense of decorbr br the storyline is a tad thin but thats to introduce characters but its entertaining enough for a repeat view
