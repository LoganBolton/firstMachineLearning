nightbreed blew my mind the first time i saw it and its held up quite well over the years the sets and monster effects work are some of the best ive ever seen nobody i know seems to have seen this film which i believe tanked at the box office because of the lack of interest in horror in the early nineties it plays like a dark horrific fairy tale and is a lot deeper then youd think with a strong message against bigotry presented by a rich mystical past that clive barker created what sucks is the film ends on a really cool sequel note that well probably never see my only minor gripe is that craig sheffer is only a passable actor at best and the the project might have benefited with a better actor in the part just a minor complaint though as sheffer does alright i had a similar issue with scott bakula in barkers lord of illusions not really a terrible performance but i just didnt like him in the role as much as i would have other people
