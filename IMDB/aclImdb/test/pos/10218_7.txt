clive barker of hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is funny and excitingbr br the makeup done by bob keen and geoffrey portass was fantastic it took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground it was really a treat to see the quality of workbr br it wasnt particularly horrible as the worst creature was actually a human serial killerbr br i just saw craig sheffer in shadow of doubt the other day and he did a good job in this film also nothing spectacular but fair this was only anne bobbys third film and she was good alsobr br the ending was spectacular and the rednecks got their just desserts as did david cronenberg ha
