the film nightbreed is one of the best horror films i have ever seen overall im not a big fan of horror films but there is something about this film that is more atmospheric and different from any other horror film i have ever seen many horror films ive seen ive enjoyed watching however as they are based on horror i know that the stories are unreal as they are fictional therefore i cant take them all seriously nightbeed on the other hand is a unique horror genre as it has a feel of realism that ive seen in very few other horror filmsbr br this films story on how a man gets murdered and ends up living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would get from a dreaming nightmare as its a very unique and original storyline most horror films ive seen are all quite fake but because nightbreed was so incredibly sophisticated and geniously directed with superb acting especially by craig sheffer aaron boone amazing special effects great lighting and fantastic dialogue i found this film to have a sense of depth and maturity with no silly fake horror parody whatsoever that many other horror films have nightbreed as well as being horror has elements of thriller romance and action all rapped in one if you havent seen this film i recommend you watch it as i rate it a 1010
