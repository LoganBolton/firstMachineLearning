i experienced nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago and i was pleasantly surprised with the resultsbr br clive barker is said to have revitalised horror with hellraiser but this is a film that effectively stalled his cinema career somewhat what an unfortunate thing to happen because like the inhabitants of midian this film seems to be misunderstoodbr br barker has created a crossbreed of genre staples in this story  it begins as a traditional horror film but soon becomes a fable regarding mans inhumanity to man evoking sympathy for the devil is tough at the best of times but when the characters are as visually demonic as they are in this film it becomes nigh on impossible cue the child the practically klanlike human insurgence pitchforks and holy wrath at the films conclusion becomes doubly upsetting in the face of what has gone before as a parable of ethnic tension and white supremacy this film can be quite evocativebr br i pity those who will not see the film from this angle and think of it as barkers fantastical indulgence gone too far we have a genuine forgotten gem here and the sooner the studio and mr barker make nice and devote some time to it  the better
