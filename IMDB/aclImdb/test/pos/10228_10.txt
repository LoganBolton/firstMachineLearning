id love to see some tiein between nightbreed the fury and the xmen series sort of the way the second outer limits series would tiein particular stories and plotlines after the fact to create a story arc although one was never intended id also like know if some more information  anecdotal or otherwise exists anywhere about the relationship andor collaboration between clive barker and david cronenberg i simply cant get my mind around the fact that david cronenberg appeared as a mere actor in a clive barker film does any additional information on the subject actually exist finally its been 17 years since the film was released and i had hoped there wouldve been a sequel by now does anyone out there know if there were any plans in the making that never came to fruition or if in fact there are plans even now for a sequel
