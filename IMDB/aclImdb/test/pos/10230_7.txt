i enjoyed this film the way these mutants looked along with the tone of the film is very good plus david cronenberg as philip k decker was great it makes me wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life except for the killings of coursebr br i was impressed with the creatures for this film although this movie probably had a somewhat low budget the mutantscreaturesmonsters looked great especially from 1990 this is definitely a unique film and not crap it makes me want to go find a read the novella its based off of this is an interesting film because it shows how humans can be monsters and the monsters are the one with humanity
