why didnt critics like this movie i dont get it this is easily my favorite clive barker effort hellraiser is a bit too rough around the edges the film just never leaves that stupid house and lets face it lord of illusions doesnt move at all i have loved barkers writing for years especially his books of blood terrifically entertaining he has a vicious side to him that is totally unlike a stephen king he freely mixes in his own homosexuality and odd religious and occultic elements i love love love love it i also realize  however that barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as he is a horror writer and fantasy just isnt my bag puts me right to sleep always has i also think barker works best with short stories his novels tend to wander a bit that was my experience when trying to read the damnation game it started out well then 100 pages in i thought where is this going because it wasnt going anywherebr br i read cabal the book nightbreed was based on and thought it was good i especially like the elaboration on deckers character the way the mask talked to him and controlled him i like the way barker simply presents it black and white there it is he gives it a simplicity thats attractive and believable when asked why decker kills he says simply because i like it probably something jeffrey dahmer said at some pointbr br but i actually liked the film nightbreed better than cabal i adore the visual attention to detail that barker gives to his films adore it i think it is just beautiful lord of illusions had some of this as well some of the drawings in the beginning during the nightbreed credit sequence its like an entire vocabulary barker dreamed up just for the nightbreed world id be curious to know how much was purely his design i know he is an amazing artist who his own style and language as an artistbr br nightbreed is also i think barkers most entertaining film it moves very quickly well edited it doesnt drag like lord of illusions does a little bit very quick everything in it is just perfect it also works as a fantastic and scary little slasher movie the stuff with the killer in the beginning killing the family and later tormenting the old man in the shop is really scary stuff that mask is frightening id be curious to know if barker designed that as well its not just a hokey jason or screamtype mask something about it is really disturbingbr br anyway this is a great flick definitely check it out if you havent seen it highly recommended one of my favorite horror films of all time in my opinion clive barkers best it is scary and violent though be warned
