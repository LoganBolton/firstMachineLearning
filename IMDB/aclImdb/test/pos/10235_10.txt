nightbreed is definitely my most favorite movie ive worn more than one tape as it is the makeup is awesome the story is lovely it takes a few different twists and isnt quite as deep as the story its based on cabal by clive barker but for a movie adaption it stays very true to source material the only problem with this movie were the producers vain attempts to turn it into a teen slasher movie hence the changed ending to allow for sequels eye rolls apparently someday were going to be getting a directors cut that will i hope clear up this bit of nonsense until then id suggest it to anyone who like dark fantasy type horror as opposed to freddyjasonmicheal type slashers i really dont know what would be comparable
