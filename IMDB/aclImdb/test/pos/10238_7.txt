whats fun about barkers nightbreed is that its the story of a human on a rampage a deadly threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the night breed of the title are the good guys it shares its sense of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with the first addams family movie and much of tim burtons work it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barkerbr br especially fun is the performance by cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed as happens in most classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankensteins monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the moviebr br this isnt a masterpiece and even barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling work but its pure fun it looks great and remains light without mocking itself worth a look
