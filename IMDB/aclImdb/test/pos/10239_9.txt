i was peeved that the best makeup academy award went to dick tracy a horrible film with horrible makeup the nightbreed based on the better titled cabal novella look terrific the acting is excellent and david chroneburg makes for a truly creepy and terrific antagonistbr br the plot focuss on aaron boone who has recurring nightmares about a society of monsters living under a cemetery is he making it up or are they real and calling to him his pyschologist chroneburg convinces him hes a murderer a slayer of familiesbr br troubled and suicidal boone seeks refuge in midian but the monsters dont want him at first he is also tracked by his girlfriend lori who refuses to give up on him even after he dies and comes back cold and monstrousbr br but decker isnt about to let boone continue on he raises the locals on an all out assault on midian like a holy war in gods name led by the devilbr br barkers themes of misunderstood monsters may come from his experiences as a homosexual male but they are always strong and honest nightbreed turns the genre on its head the monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone but man is hunting thembr br a 20 minute longer cut was originally submitted by barker but the studio chopped it into this fractured masterpiece barker is hard at work trying to locate the missing footage for a directors cut release until then this version will have to do
