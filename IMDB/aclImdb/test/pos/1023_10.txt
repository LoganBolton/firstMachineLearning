although i dont like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago i still think it is one of the best comingofage movies i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch i saw the opening titles of that movie and theni was so immersed in it that i felt i was there it really affected me personally i still remember how i felt when i first saw it i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days what i really liked about that movie is the main theme of a shy boy fantasizing about kissing his dream girl no offense but if that was an american movie you would certainly seeat a certain point mainly climax the shy boy making love to his girl and i really cant grasp this contradicting concepts till nowi have a simple request if anyone knows how to get this movie on a dvd by mail please let me know cause i need a shot of memoriesthanks
