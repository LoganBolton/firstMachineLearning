it is interesting to see what people think of this movie since it is in fact quite unique though it bears some of the trademarks of clive barkers writing even though it might seem a bit cynical to say so the movie is just intricate enough to deflect those that need standard hollywood plot hooks and layered so that if you expect to be fed you will see a normal monster flick with lots of monsters and a disjointed plotbr br those who need a linear specific and untangled plot line will hate this movie because the story lies like in the novella partially between the lines or in this case partially off screen in comments and the imaginationbr br another possible hangup is the ending of which i can say without spoiling it that it is not entirely good and not entirely bad it is in fact not very defined at all which i know sends some people into raging tantrums about that they didnt get to know what happened but to me and to many others im sure just adds another dimension to the story  the dimension of speculation and in addition the point that great disruption has a tendency to cause ripples that extend quite farbr br there is definitely moral here but of a rather different kind than the standard hollywood inyourfaceattheendofthemovie sort of display summing that moral up is simple even though it is not quite that simply displayed prejudice and the human tendency to hate the differentbr br i love this movie even though as many of the reviewers have noted the expressions of the actors with the exception of david cronenberg who does a wonderful appearance are rather tacky im not sure they are entirely to blame for their rickety appearance and lack of depth though seeing that these are common problems in converting literature to screenplaybr br all in all this is a great movie provided that you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie
