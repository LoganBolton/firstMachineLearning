instead watch it as a great coming of age tale about african american males in the mid 1960s in the ghettos of chicago for all of you out there under the age of 50 whats happening was a lighthearted rather quirky sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years 19751979 concerning a group of young african american high school kids living in a working class neighborhood i liked it a great deal  it just has no real connection to this film cooley high started out as being the basis for whats happening but its serious nature did not register well with test audiences so it was redone as a comedy even though the credits on whats happening still read that it was based on this moviebr br this film starts out light but touches many aspects of life unique to the turbulent 1960s and also some other aspects of growing up that are timeless the guys deal with sex betrayal joblessness hopelessness and even early death the ending is quite powerful and serious and the film has a great motown soundtrack highly recommended unfortunately this film is not new enough to be played on premium cable channels and not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and played in the few venues for those films either
