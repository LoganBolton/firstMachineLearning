cooley high is such a great film that even with the periods sound track urban landscape wardrobe and slangit still doesnt feel dated the sound track by the way is a timeless classic in itselfbr br instead it absorbs you right into it that is a staple of a good movie from start to finish it doesnt miss a beat and i never grow tired of watching itbr br its ending is unique in the respect that its one of the saddest and at the same time uplifting of all movie endings there may have been a few since backdraft comes to mind but cooley was the first and much more emotional
