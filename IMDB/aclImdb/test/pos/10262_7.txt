shameless screen entertainment is a relatively new and british i think dvdlabel specializing in smutty and excessively violent cult movies  mostly italian ones  from the glorious eras when everything was possible namely from the late 60s up until the mid80s the labels selection feels like a crossover between the oeuvres of mondo macabro and no shame they probably even borrowed the name of the latter and they already released some really rare sick italian puppies like ratman my dear killer killer nun phantom of death and torso the frightened woman was completely unknown to me but since fellow reviewers from around here whose opinions i hugely value described it as one of the greatest and most mesmerizing psychedelic eurosexploitation movies of its era i didnt hesitate to pick it up this is a very weird film and probably not suitable for about 99 of the average cinemaloving audiences if youre part of that remaining 1 however youre in for a really unique treat the style atmosphere and content are similar to jess francos succubus and massimo dallamanos venus in furs yet theyre both widely considered as classics whereas the frightened woman is virtually unknown its all a matter of profiling and good marketing i guess the story revolves on a literally filthy rich doctor he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion owns multiple oldtimer cars and has a very impressive collection of artsy relics including a lifesize mannequin doll replica of himself with a bizarre and slightly offbeat attitude towards women he considers them a threat for the survival of the male race and thus spends his days kidnapping humiliating and sexually abusing random he picks up from the street dr sayer then abducts the ambitious journalist maria with the intention to completely crush her female spirit but he slowly falls for her just he starts to believe in actual love she strikes back with a vengeance this really isnt for everyone but if you can appreciate moody  sinisterly sexy ambiances bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches that seem utterly implausible and surreal you can consider this one a top recommendation its slow stylishly sleazy and totally bonkers shameless entertainment all right
