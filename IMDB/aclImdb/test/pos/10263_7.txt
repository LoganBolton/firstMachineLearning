dr sayerphilippe leroy a wealthy physician with psychological issues regarding the opposite sex kidnaps an employee mariadagmar lassander a freethinking liberal woman who believes men must be the ones fixed instead of females sayer retreats to his palatial estate running maria through a humiliating series of mind games threatening to molest and kill her sayers desire it seems is to dominate her body mind and soul making her his sexual slave obeying his commands adhering to his every wish and whim after resistance at first maria slowly teeters towards his objective but has plans of her ownshe says she wishes to help sayer relinquish his sadistic behavior towards women so that he could love and not feel such yearning desires to harm it seems that sayer has her under his grip agreeing to certain rather embarrassing scenariossuch as lotioning his toes making love to a blowup doll which is a recreation of himself often spending time topless and even getting hosed down when she slaps him hard across the face bringing blood from his nosewhich almost break her but something happens as the troubled doctor slowly falls in love with mariaand through what appears to be a desperate attempt to end the madness maria gains an upper hand toying with sayers lust for her bodybr br more of a battle of wills a kind of sexual warfare where it seems one is in charge when in fact the other truly has the upper hand through a great deal of the film sayer mistreats maria forcing herit seemsto submit to his series of psychological games of a sexual nature her attempts to escape fail because his home is such a well designed fortressits a typical european art deco kind of palace fashioned and orchestrated by a man who has kept to this weekend retreat of his for quite a spellit features walls and doors opening at his command with an area quarantined off for his victims but once maria seemingly downs a bottle of pills as a result of her anguish at his hands the tables are turned and she has him where she wants him he finds that he actually craves her and maria uses this to her advantage playing hard to get when sayer wishes to embrace and ravage herand i could understand his frustration because she has this allure that can drive a man crazybr br i felt the film works ultimately as a war cry for women their empowerment and uprising against men who have the notion that they should always have control sexually and mentally the twist finalizes this ideal i couldnt swallow sayers fate because of his rigorous cardiovascular activity and exercise regimenwe see how he develops his toned athletic figure and how this regimen is part of the normal routine every weekend before the true mind games with his victim begin if he is so well fit and spends such time developing himself for the extracurricular activities which follow his regimen how could he suffer the fate which follows his finalizing the deal with maria at the end when she stops resisting his advances br br maria he would later admit is the first hes actually kidnapped others from the past callgirls were paid for their services so that sayer could feel the power of dominating a woman even if its all a fictitious charade brought about by a deeply troubled individual with an inability to connect with the opposite sex the spontaneous decision to do so to take a leap from the norm costs him more than he could ever knowbr br all this psychosexual subtext is rather fascinating to see unravel but dagmar lassander such a yummy sex kitten was my reason for enjoying it sowithout her i couldnt have liked it as much because shes vital as a victim worth striving to obtain perhaps the films highlight the delicious dance as lassander clothed in gauze unravels the wardrobe exposing her breasts to a jazzy scoreits the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes your mouth water and forehead sweat dagmar lassander mustve been a joy for fashion designers because she wears those clothes so wellshe has this kind of cool a sophistication and screen presence along with her beauty and seductive powers dagmar transcends the part to create an iconic character which would define her careereven if the film isnt well knowni found about through word of mouth the provocative nature of the script and risqu√© subject matter might not appeal to certain crowds as it deals with sexand pain in many different forms the dialogue quite illustrative and elaborative at times i couldnt help but chuckle at sayers comments towards an imprisoned maria regarding how he enjoys making women suffer and the thrill he gets at forcing them into a type of slaveryin an attempt to make the words poetic it all feels rather hokey but dagmar is the real reason to see it and the film to me works at its best as a fetish film a possible male fantasy with this seemingly prim and proper idealist captured and held against her will forced into a precarious situation her fate possibly at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist her submission and how she reacts towards his aggressive behavior with herthere are times where she unfolds to a wavering desire to embrace him unveiling a possible attraction towards him which in itself might startle some who watch itare among the most fascinating highlights of this exploitation feature my other favorite scene besides the dance is the piano concerto with sayer fondling maria as she plays a soothing melody
