a slick production which holds the interest from the very first scene where max is choosing a ring in a jewellers shop much of what follows reminds us of shakespeares a midsummer nights dream in which demetrius and lysander fall in love with each others girlfriends here max and lucien both prone to love at first sight get mixed up with lisa and alice and alice complicates things when she calls herself lisa on top of the merry mixup max is inclined to get involved in incidents which bring back memories of two years ago and because max has a lot of these dreamy episodes we are subjected to one flashback after anothertoo many in my opinion because at first viewing of the film  i wasnt quite sure if i was in the present or the pastthere is much running down corridors stairways through doorways into elevators etc i accept all that in a fastpaced film but do we have to have so many people colliding with each other after four collisions it ceases to have any impact if youll excuse the pun high marks for art design the apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor but i do ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in paris saving a person intent on suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is in this film too when max almost exits at the same time however a kiss or two soon makes him feel better if you can manage to find your way through all the flashbacks youll finally find yourself at the airport where maxs devoted sister gives him a most affectionate kiss it can be said it is she who resolves the complications of love like puck in a midsummer nights dream
