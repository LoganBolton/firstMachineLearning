so heres a bit of background on how i came to see this movie as you probably know this is the original french film that was then remade quelle surprise by hollywood as wicker park well i avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released simply because a i knew it had absolutely nothing to do with wicker park and living in chicago i didnt see why they called it that  it was filmed in fricking canada for a start  b i have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes done purely because hollywood thinks were too bone idle to read a few subtitles i am dreading the remake of infernal affairs by the way and c i cant stand josh hartnett nuff said there br br however i came across wp on tv the other day probably about half an hour in and i have to say initially it made no sense at all until about half an hour from the end when it started coming together by the end i was really surprised to find myself really into it and then the ending just seemed so good  a perfect combination of story passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices ive ever seen heardbr br since then ive heard a lot about the lappartement vs wicker park argument and looking at wp i still say it has bugger all to do with chicago but there seemed something about it that i liked so when it was on again i watched it again  unfortunately still missing the first chunk ive still yet to see it and i still thought it was pretty good heck even josh hartnett seemed good but i was curious about lappartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was about so i waited and waited to catch lappartement somewhere somehow netflix let me down so i ended up getting a copy from some website in ireland and ive just watched it br br its really kind of weird but a good weird a classic french film great acting romane bohringer is an absolute gem  sorry but she acts monica bellucci off the screen in every scene vincent cassel was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works and ive seen jeanphilippe ecoffey in a lot of movies and i just love him  the scene where alice dumps him in the restaurant and he just looks like someones told him his puppys been run over was excruciating but i can honestly say having seen wp and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy as about 75 of the rest of the movie had been  maybe in a different order but come on the scene with the coffee in the glasses word for word you can imagine my surprise when i watched the ending of lappartement i can literally say i was blown away  hmm a bit like poor old lucien was through the cafe window really so be prepared if youve seen wicker park and you fancy taking a look at the original like i did do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie because youll either be disappointed or exhilarated at a piece of french movie history  a prime example of how you can watch a movie think youre going to watch a pithy happy ending and get whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end definitely catch this movie oh and while youre at maybe not too near the same time but down the road take a look at wicker park itll surprise you too
