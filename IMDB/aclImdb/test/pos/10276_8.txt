i loved this it starts out as a fairly normal slightly ponderous french art movie and then all of a sudden halfway through its turned on its head this part is brilliant as you realise you have been watching 2 plots not one sadly the ending doesnt make much sense which is a great shame oh yes and its brilliantly filmed
