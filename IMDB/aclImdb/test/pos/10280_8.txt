not all movies should have that predictable ending that we are all so use to and its great to see movies with really unusual twists however with that said i was really disappointed in lapartments ending in my opinion the ending didnt really fit in with the rest of the movie and it basically destroyed the story that was being toldbr br you spend the whole movie discovering everyone and their feelings but the events in the final 2 minutes of the movie would have impacted majorly on everyones character but the movie ends and leaves it all too wide openbr br overall though this movie was very well made and unlike similar movies such as serendipity all the scenes were believable and didnt go over the top
