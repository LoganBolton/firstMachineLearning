this sad romance is untellable because the director decides to break its narration and to offer the points of view of each characters so there are a lot of flashbacks of reshooting of the same scene but it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments in order to see the result br br and it would worth it because its for me just one the best french movie ever made br br it has everything br br cast first steps of monica bellucci and vincent cassel such a presence and such voices even for a hardofhearing its symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this moviebr br directing his camera is bright alive plays with the sets or can be mysterious with long closeup à la david lynchbr br cinematography the light is beautiful between gold and rust like their lovebr br a neverseen before paris its a paris outoftime of more accurately a composite of a lot of districts huge search here its look like gotham city modern and old at the same time br br music not the big orchestra but in perfect tune with the frames and the song of charles aznavour made me discover this great singer br br ah  the story as i said its a love story but rather tragic saying that love can be for nothing that it doesnt make all people happy or isnt guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message isnt often told love is passion which is derivative from the latin pain you can suffer a lot when you are in love because of the why   of the endless waiting the lack of courage the indecision br br and when you can ease yourself fate destiny god  devil  can stab you in the back  just because you arrive too soon or too late and above all because love means 2 in a world of billions a lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written so whats love br br personally i lived some moments like this in a car with the dear one her mobile rings and you know its her special friend whom she kisses goodbye and not you even if we are always together so you want to go out of this car to leave them together to not hear the sweet but cruel words but you cant because an amazing hard rain just started br br i found that this movie depicts those moments of tragedy as no one else
