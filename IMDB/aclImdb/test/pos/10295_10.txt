i watched this film for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as beforebr br there are more than a dozen modern stunning french films from en couer de hiver to the three colours trilogy and all of them are special this film is one of them a true delight with so many great things going for it from the homage to hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in romane and monica while monica is very beautiful romane is a very sexy lady and steals many of the scenes she inhabitsbr br i am not sure why people think this film is convoluted as the scenes are such a perfect blend of past and present acting as a counterpoint to the characters own remarkable journey that the film simply flows and you barely realise that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have left the viewed enchanted and bewitched br br like most french and european films this story would never translate across the atlantic as no studio could capture the magic without throttling the life out of it with the hollywood bleaching common to most movies that become lost in translation americans make brilliant films but not of this type perhaps if they let someone like a young polanski work on it then maybe they would not totally butcher an english versionbr br for those who do not watch subtitled films you will spend a lifetime in ignorant bliss for those who can read then you would be spiting yourself to miss films like thisbr br i would describe this as neofranconoir but only to cheese off the reviewer who called this film elitist i think i saw him doing an add for fourandtwentypies he thinks romane bohringer is a type of french mayonnaiseit is arty in the way that pulp fiction is artybut with more gallic savoire fairebr br 10 out of 10 with every viewingand has anyone got romanes phone numbershe is the perfect french salad dressing
