forget the recent dire american remake which sadly tarnished the reputation of the french original by virtue of the directors involvement in both this is a deftly drawn romantic 90s noir with many twists and turns it works best as a gallic ode to hitchcocks rear window because the notion of voyeurism is the constant theme that fires the intricate screenplay the story is stunningly realized like a picasso painting offering multiperspectives on the same event and demanding the viewers participation throughout the settings music and haunting score are wonderful as well as the excellent contributions from the cast watch it more than once
