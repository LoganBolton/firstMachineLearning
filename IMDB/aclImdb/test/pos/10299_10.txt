this is an astonishing film a romantic thriller with a convoluted but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot brilliantly buttressed by the use of recurring visual motifs everything in it is beautifully filmed the women the apartments but more amazing is the devastating juxtapositioning of images almost every scene has echoes of another this is a story told in light in colour in many almostparallels every time i watch it it fills me with delightbr br the acting is great too romane bohringer is stunning as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown everything about her changes with her mood vincent cassel plays a very different role to his part in la haine but no less excellently shifty and sympathetic at the same time and monica bellucci  ah monica bellucci well put simply she plays is the worlds most perfect woman theres one small scene about three quarters of the way through where she does nothing more than smile yet in that instant says more than hours of hollywood junkbr br one cannot do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb sequential climax sad shocking ironic and subtle in turn but if one moment captures the brilliance of this work its the scene at the start of this fabulous denouement the prospect of which has been teasingly laid before us throughout the entire story yet when the moment comes it is handled so delicately so briefly so deftly that on reflection it makes you gasp only a director of staggering confidence would dare to underplay this vital point but the confidence is justified cinema doesnt come much better than this
