insanely well crafted miniseriesbr br i recall seeing most of it twice when shown on american playhouse on pbs was heavily promoted at the time i believe it might have been one of the very early miniseries showing on pbs outside of the masterpiece theater seriesbr br the full length production was shown i believe only once during its first broadcast was 68 hours total this length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours cut some interesting but slow scenesbr br i am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete not edited version to dvd not worth creating a vhs version at this pointbr br would fit in very well in the miniseries or dramatic history genre
