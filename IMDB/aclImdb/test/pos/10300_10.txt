on the outside this film is better because of vincent donofrio law  order criminal intent but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version in some ways the 1999 version is better because its more up to date a decade as compared to the 27 years the actors in this film were great like terry kinney mcmanus of hbos oz as james daly and tony shalhoub usas monk and gary sinise csiny obvilubuly dialogue was changed for contemporary audiences nut much of the writing remained the same there were stuff that wasnt in the 1982 version that gave this one a boost in drama and comedy but in the end this film was just as great at the 1982 one characterwise vincent donofrio playing phil romano was excellent better that paul sorvino its a match up between stacy keach and terry kinney in terms of james as for george i would praise shalhoub and between martin sheen  sinsise as tom i would say sinise wins
