a very moving and thought provoking film that raises issues of mental health terminal illness and euthanasia sound a bit too heavy it is a little but this is all treated in a realistically straight forward way within a story of the changes that take place to the family who have to deal with these things this is a positive story of facing up to life and responsibility that isnt overwhelm by the subject matterbr br afterlife is beautifully shot and crafted film set in modern times and dealing with modern issues it is a character driven enthralling film with a strong cast and some very good performancesbr br unfortunate it is not the sort of film that always performs well at the box office so catch it while you can
