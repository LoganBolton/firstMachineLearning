the films subject is poignant and very real it happened one can debate some artistic liberties taken by director and scriptwriter the subject is what makes the film ticknothing else i saw the film for the first time after the real phoolan was gunned down in new delhi and had served several years as an elected member of parliament in india by the way she was not the first untouchable elected to parliament as some reviewers stated the socalled untouchables have been elected to the indian parliament for decades in reserved constituenciesbr br while shekhar kapur as a director is a hero to many india because he made commercially accepted international filmsbandit queen and elizabeth and a tolerable kiddie movie called mister india which was accepted by the average indian audiencesand even got oscar nominations for elizabeth i do not place him as a top notch film director from india he fails in every department as a director except perhaps that he succeeds in getting some aboveaverage performances from his actors subtlety finesse charm are not easy to find in his filmsmelodrama brims in thembr br his idea of using nusrat fateh ali khans vocal rendering of the song in the early parts of the film was perhaps his single major achievement on the undistinguished sound track of bandit queen and then perhaps the creaking doors during the gang rape sequence otherwise the film looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence minus the great music one associates with them br br if you are looking for a good living indian film director who makes realistic cinema of international qualityit is not shekhar kapurs movies you should see it is the later works of three indian filmmakers adoor gopalakrishnan mrinal sen and girish karnad and of course muzaffar alis umrao jaan it is unfortunate that none of those directors had the financial support that kapur had to give them and their films an international viewership for instance sens oka oorie katha made in telugu or satyajit rays sadgati based on munshi prem chands kafan are more complete as films to an intelligent viewer dealing on the state of the untouchables in india sen did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence but merely suggested them of course sens nugget did not make headlines while kapurs effort hogged thembr br to kapurs credit he is articulate and used his limited talent and modest resources in the mumbai film industry to take his products beyond home audiences for that effort i salute kapur but bandit queen will remain a great subject awaiting an accomplished director to deal with it
