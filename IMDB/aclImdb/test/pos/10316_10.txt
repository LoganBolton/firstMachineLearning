there are one or two other shempera shorts i like more ie scrambled brains but i think one can saywithout much argumentthat in this particular episode shemp gives his greatest comedic performance as a stooge after rejoining the team in 1946br br scene for scene this episode hardly lets up from professor shemp howards voice lessons with the glassshattering dee green to his futile attempts to win a dames hand in marriage this is your little snookums will you marry me click to the uproarious finish it never fails to keep me in stitchesbr br i would be remiss not mention that immortal scene with miss hopkins the always lovely christine mcintyre btw isnt she rather underdressed and over amorous in greeting the man she thinks is her cousin basil who knows maybe the actual basil was a very distant cousin which makes it legal in some states as far as i know
