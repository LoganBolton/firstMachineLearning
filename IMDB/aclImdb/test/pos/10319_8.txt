for the record i am a curly fan through and through but i do have to say that in reality shemp wasnt really that bad yeah he might have lacked the same kind of slapstick that curly had but in his own way he was hilarious at least he wasnt as bad as joe besserbr br in brideless groom shemp plays a music professor stooge a professor yeah right who recently inherited a half million dollars from a dead uncle and moe  larry have to prepare him to marry a woman by six oclock that night or no moneybr br this was one of the stooges first skit with shemp before they started recycling their material perhaps it isnt surprising that shemp was part of the stooges before curly came into the picture so he seemed natural at this the slapstick gags are hilarious especially this one scene with moe and shemp in a phone booth essential stooge short to be honest
