clyde bruckman borrows the premise of this short from buster keatons seven chances recently tepidly remade as the bachelor in the original buster has 24hours to get married in order to inherit a large sum of money in this version musical teacher prof shemp has only 7 hours after all it is a short this is one of the better stooges shorts due to the storyline and wonderful routines including the telephone booth scene with moe  shemp reminiscent of laurel  hardys berth marks and the marx brothers famous stateroom scene in night at the opera  here the boys hold their own in their variation of this routine im not a huge stooges fan but this one should be noted by any student of comedy as one of their very best since the early 30s shorts
