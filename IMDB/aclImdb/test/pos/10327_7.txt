this film got roasted by the boys at mst3k but its actually a neat and nasty piece of lowbudget film noir the plot is tight the characters are believable within the goodboygetsobsessedwithbadgirl genre the pacing is solid the climax is wellhandled and the cast is bolstered by several fine character actors true most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick but hes actually quite effectively creepy when he plays the mastermind the scenes between him and his dad are quite powerful in a minimalist kind of way sure its depressing but thats the point good movie
