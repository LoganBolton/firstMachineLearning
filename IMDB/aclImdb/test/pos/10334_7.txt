i havent seen this movie in 30 years so i dont know if i would like it as much as i did when i was 12 at the time however i loved this movie this is a great starter chickflick for young preteen girls be careful of the ending though there are tears and harsh emotionsbr br looking back at it from a 2008 perspective with so much more knowledge of child psychology politics and political correctness i think it would be interesting to watch again pattys uncaring abusive father indifferent mother and favored sister all contributed toward making her vulnerable and starving for companionship patty was sad when anton left she was heartbroken when he was killed the rage that was directed toward her afterward was shocking after all she was only 12 years oldbr br the thing that i most strongly retained is how this movie taught me even enemy soldiers are people too not all german soldiers were hateful nazis when i was older i saw tv shows like hogans heroes and the rat patrol which also made the point that the regular german soldiers were not the same as the gestapobr br regular soldiers were drafted the gestapo were handpicked among volunteers for their special attitudes of hate i believe that one of the privileges of being a nazi was that they had special assignments and therefore didnt go into battle their specialties were interrogation and torturebr br later during the cold war i would think about russian soldiers and remember somgs we were taught that the soviet union was evil but the reality was that russian soldiers werent out to destroy america they had a job their government probably told them that our government was out to destroy their way of life which in a way was true since the us fought to end communismbr br the lesson is still applicable today german soldiers were not the same as nazis just as muslims are not the same as al qaeda
