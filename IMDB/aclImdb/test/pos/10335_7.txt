summer of my german soldier was one of the many tv movies that became a staple of the small screen in the 1970s others were brians song sybil and someones watching me it portrays a jewish girl kristy mcnichol befriending a german pow bruce davison in wwiiera georgia one of the things that the movie shows is that many of the german soldiers werent really nazis but were just drafted watching the movie i got a real sense of how things must have been in the south back then i mean can you imagine being a jewish person accused of supporting the enemy br br so i certainly recommend this movie i believe that its always important to show the things portrayed here occasional overacting keeps the movie from being a fullscale masterpiece but they usually do quite well i hope that the movie eventually comes out on dvd also starring esther rolle and michael constantine the my big fat greek wedding patriarch
