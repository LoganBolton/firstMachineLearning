a touching story told with tenderness awkward young jewish girl in wwii america befriends an escaped german pow who is hiding out in her clubhouse they discuss their lives and beliefs hes antihitler she sneaks him food he becomes her only friend and ally all this reminded me of the muchbetter theatrical film whistle down the wind where hayley mills befriends convict alan bates but you certainly cant fault the direction here which is smooth or the performances which are sterling mature in her preteen years kristy mcnichol carries most of the picture and never hits a false note suddenly when the prisoner is discovered and kristy is found out as well the movie gets very tough her father shocked and ashamed that his child would consort with that nazi lays into her with a quiet fury i have seldom seen before he tells her you are dead to me which must be devastating for a little girl to hear the final scenes dont cop out there are no big reunions no handholding climaxes the girl has to face the world and in doing so learns a bitter lesson about neighbors friends and family a startling film
