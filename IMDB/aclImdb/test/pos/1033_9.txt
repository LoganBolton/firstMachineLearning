i too found oppenheimer to be a brilliant series and one of the finest offerings ever on american pbs david suchet was particularly effective as edward teller as i recall and the overall conception was spectacularly good the only reason that the series doesnt rate a full 1010 is for the lowbudget production values in some areas actual content is absolutely firstrate in my recollectionbr br the oppenheimer miniseries will be released in the uk on july 31st it will be a region 2pal set but it would seem that a region 1ntsc set should be soon in the offingbr br if you have a universal player in the us you can order the series right now from amazon ukbr br httptinyurlcomznyyqbr br huzzah
