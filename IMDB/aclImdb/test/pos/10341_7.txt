this movie is still alive and kicking today thanks to the presence of alan ladd this is good in one way because the movie has some interesting things to say but bad in another because everyone who watches it expecting that toughguy ladd is going to hoop through his usual paces is going to be mighty disappointed without fanfare or introduction ladd is suddenly introduced in the third reel true his role is a key one but its small and likely to get lost in the shuffle there are many key roles in former newspaperman martin mooneys ambivalent screenplay which hits out at all political alliances and quite ruthlessly denigrates reform candidates its the lovely and extremely talented joan woodbury who ties the various strands of the wideranging story together unlike the usual hollywood production the plot actually proceeds in a series of jumps much like the films later turned out by the french new wave though easier to follow here especially if you are aware that the films original title was paper bullets nonetheless some of the films narrative and character switches are a little disconcerting particularly in the role played by jack larue who has wisely elected to act the part in a strangely noncommittal way one of jacks best acting jobs ever but noone is likely to notice alas
