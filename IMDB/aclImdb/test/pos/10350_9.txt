im so glad i taped this film when it came on bbc last month it blew my mind so gut wrenching and real david tennant is absolutely fabulous in this even though his character isnt always that easy to like or identify with the final scene where he plays the song just broke my heart those eyesbr br im guessing that he made this film in between the dr who series and that makes it even more of an achievement for me i just love dr who and yet i saw absolutely nothing of him in mr tennants portrayal of this man who knows that he has changed and struggles to create some sort of new identity and lifebr br great little intense drama
