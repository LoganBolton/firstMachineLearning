when i saw this on tv i was nervouswhats if they messed it up millions of families like mine that live with a brain damaged man in my case my dad would be let down i watched it with my mum and we both ended up crying it was so accurate and captured how the family feels as well as the person having suffered the brain injury the actors were all wonderful and i had no complaints my mums told me she hasnt been able to stop thinking about it i hope this program made many people aware of what its like living with brain damage and what its like for the families more programs like this should be made i was surprised at how good it was and its really shook me up emotionally
