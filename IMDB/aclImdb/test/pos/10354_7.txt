i felt compelled to comment on this film because its listed as the fourth lowestrated scifilm of all time on the imdb what sure this movie is crappy but its hilarious its not awful on an ed wood level its more surreal and unevenbr br there are some classic moments in the film the brain surgery is gross and great and even nuttier when you consider that the film was rated pg gor chasing after his dolly before getting battery acid dumped on his face mine gimmee zandor vorkoffs speeches at the beginning of the film before amir kali was but another weak nation struggling to break free from centuries of stagnant feudalism angelo rossito also has some great lines no gor no you want these keys dont you my pretties it is absolutely wrong that this is the 4th lowestrated scifilm on the imdb because it is entertaining no matter how bad a film is if it still manages to be weird quirky unsettling or entertaining it has merit and doesnt deserve to be dumped on and dismissed i wont defend most of al adamsons films but this one along with dracula vs frankenstein and blood of ghastly horror are entertaining enough to make up for their awfulness
