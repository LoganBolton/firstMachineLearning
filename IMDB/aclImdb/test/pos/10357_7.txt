brain of blood starts as abdul amir reed hadley the leader of a country called kahlid is close to death because of cancer however if he dies kahlid will tear itself apart without anyone to lead them so doctor robert nigserian grant williams  one of amirs devotees mohammed zandor vorkov have devised a plan to take amirs dead body to america where mad scientist dr lloyd trenton kent taylor will transplant his brain into a fresh body  with a bit of plastic surgery noone will ever know he was even dead things dont go according to plan though as when the time comes to transplant amirs brain trentons freak assistant gor john bloom brings a dead body of someone that fell from a balcony trenton needed a strong fit living body  since theres no more time he decides to use gors body as a temporary stopgap until another more suitable one can be found unfortunately when amir wakes up in his new body hes not very happy at what he sees i mean would you be if you found out your brain was inside a badly burned freakbr br also known as brain damage the brain the creatures revenege  the undying brain this cheapo exploitation flick was produced  directed by the one  only al adamason  quite frankly im offended at the pathetic 15 rating brain of blood has on the imdb personally i think its terrific fun in a so bad its good sort of way the highly entertaining script by kane w lynn  joe van rodgers is as loopy  silly as they come from sloppy blood soaked brain transplants to crazed mad scientists from 7 foot tall acid scarred freaks who play with toy cars to 4 foot tall midget medical assistants from basement dungeons to rooftop chases from car crashes to assassinations kidnaps to screaming scantily clad women from regina carrols hairdo which should get its own mention during the opening credits to teenage girls imprisoned in the basement for blood to a laughoutloud hilarious ending which includes some deep meaningful speech its all here  brain of blood has quality cheese stamped all over it if your a fan of bad low budget exploitation flicks with a sense of fun then this film should be right at the top of your list of must see films despite its lowly 15 rating i am proud to admit that i liked brain of blood a lot i thought it was an absolute hoot to watch it slows down a bit at the end with a few too many shots of people wandering around doing nothing in particular but until that point it had moved along like a rocket at only 85 minutes its relatively short its difficult to second guess the barmy plot  i just think its loads of campy funbr br this is director adamsons masterpiece as far as im concerned along with dracula vs frankenstein 1971 which he made a year before this those who have seen an adamson film before will know about the none existent production values cheap special effects  cardboard sets  that all adds to the fun this film manages that fine between incompetence  seriousness to create a memorable viewing experience i love the opening shot of kahlid which is obviously just a photo of the taj mahal in india complete with statuesque people in the foreground regina carrols hair seems to be a separate entity on its own it seems to change styles between shots  is frankly horrendous dont get me started about her makeup job either that she must apply with a a paint sprayer there is another hilarious moment when we see amirs body has been transported to america wrapped in what looks like ordinary tin foil why is the question i asked myself why the effects are variable theres a terrible looking fake spider gors burned makeup job is pretty bad although there is a surprisingly gory brain removal which is actually quite impressivebr br the budget for brain of blood must have been practically none existent i must admit i thought trentons lab was quite good with various computers  medical instruments although the rest of the film looks cheap  nasty the production values are low the music was taken from another film beast of blood 1971  the acting is awful but in a campy fun sort of waybr br brain of blood may have the best title for an exploitation film ever  as far as im concerned its a highly entertaining piece of nonsense that i had a great time watching  laughing at they just dontcantwont make them like this anymore impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good film but bad movie lovers should enjoy it i liked it but then again im just weird
