i saw this black and white comedy noir yesterday at the london film festival structurally it has been compared to pulp fiction but it is perhaps closer to the structure of amores perros and the slacker mood of kevin smiths clerks four stories intersect at a french motorway diner the first vignette has franck edouard baer bungling a hold up at the diner the waitress suzie anna mouglalis takes pity and tell him her story the second has two incompetent kidnappers leon bouli lanners and paul serge lariviere take a teenage girl from her rich family unfortunately for them she is suicidal and her family dont appear to want her back the third is a dialogue between two ageing rock stars who bump into each other at the diner alain bashung and arno playing themselves the final part is about four excriminals who smuggle their old partner out of hospital to visit their old hideout which has since been turned into Â… the diner an epilogue returns to franck and suzie to complete their story not really an epilogue more a conclusionbr br the structure does not really work the stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in pulp fiction nor is the diner crucial to the action to at least two of the stories in the way the car crash was crucial in the four stories of amores perros the quality of the individual stories varies the hideout story is a cute idea with a couple of good gags but does not come off and the rock star reunion is pointless and dull on the other hand the kidnap story is hilarious although its connection to the diner is tenuous the most balanced and successful story is the franck and suzie onebr br this film isnt entirely successful but has moments of interest and hilarity i look forward to seeing more of writerdirectors samuel benchetrits work
