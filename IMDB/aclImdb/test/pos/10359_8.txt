this is a slightly uneven entry with one standout sequence involving an overthehill gang reminiscing in the diner that once  thirty years previously  was their hideout one hohum duologue between two ageing rock musos a noirish kidnap turned on its head and an opening sequence plus epilogue involving heist artist wannabe edward baer and current hot property anna magloulis which has its moments no movie in which jean rochefort appears can be dismissed lightly and here he shines as one of the overthehill quintet indeed the film is worth seeing for rochefort alone but each of the sequences has something to offer and its definitely worth a look
