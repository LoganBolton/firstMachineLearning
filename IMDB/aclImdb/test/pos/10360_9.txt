i first saw it at 5am january 1 2009 and after a day i watched it again and i want to watch it again love everything well almost so 9 stars about it no color beautiful naive stories funny gangsters anna camera work music well sometimes you just want to listen little bit longer and the music just stops but this is not a musical after all i like annas acting this naive wannabe gangster girl how she speaks holds the gun everything makes me smile no its not that funny though i have laughed a bit at some moments its just so subtle excellent work by samuel benchetrit though 3d nouvelle seems weaker but they are also gangsters maybe even worse cause they are stealing ideas and the last scene is my favorite makes me feel so warm and romantic yes i would recommend this movie for the romantic souls with a taste for such arthousish movies and i dont agree with those comparing it to pulp fiction its not about action and twisted story though all vignettes intersect its calm and maybe too slow movie for most of the people its about characters their feelings very subtle anyway probably this review wont be of much help to anyone my first just wanted to express my appreciationbr br spoiler this movie doesnt have a goofs section wonder didnt anybody notice that hand in the 2 part when the kidnappers decided to go home looks like a part of crew hehe i know i should better post this in forums but i dont agree with some policies here
