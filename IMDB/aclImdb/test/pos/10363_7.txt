i actually flipped to lifetime channel by mistake just as this movie was beginning and endedup watching it br br it certainly deals with a serious issue probably more prevalent than we realize in terms of this type of attack of a young woman by an egomaniacal fellowstudent who feels hes above the system and unfortunately often isbr br the cast here was believable and the performances credible a lot of these canadianlifetime flicks are decidedly overthetop however this is one i might label as underthetopbr br while appreciating the fact that it wasnt presented in an overblown fashion this film somehow seemed like a record being played at a slower speed than proper the 96 minutes seemed like many more and it had the effect of looking like a shorter film looped overandover seemingly going on and on and on and on  before reaching its inevitable and predictable conclusionbr br yet the engaging characters and performances made it better than the average film of this type despite these criticismsbr br and while these pictures often milk the climax this one could have given it a bit more detail and length
