count me as being one who is happy to see no hastings in this episode the poormans dr watson does nothing for me as he simply drags down every scene hes in japp is often necessary to the story as the representative of officialdom and a little miss lemon is fine for seasoning but hastings swings from painfully dim to overmannered in different episodes if i have to sit through one more vacuous oh i say there ill take the gaspipebr br as a general rule the more poirot you get in a poirot story the better every line for hastings is one taken away from poirot and ive never read the books so i really dont care about fidelity to christies characters a lot of viewersreviewers seem to have a problem with separating the movies from the books if you want the book as written then read it i dont see the point of watching the television version if you know what will come next at every stage theatre is not prose  dont expect a transcription
