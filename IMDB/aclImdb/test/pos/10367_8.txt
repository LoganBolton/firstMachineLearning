richard abernethie a very wealthy man has died and his relatives have assembled for his funeral included in the funeral party is abernathies youngest sister cora galaccio while none of the family has seen cora in at least 20 years they all agree that cora was always a bit different so when cora says something about abemethie having been murdered most laugh it off as one of coras eccentricities but someone is obviously taking cora seriously the next day cora is found dead in her bed having been beaten violently is there a connection between the two deaths its up to hercule poirot to find a killerbr br after the funeral is one of the most well put together episodes of the entire poirot series ive always been a fan of this particular agatha christie book and from what i remember the movie is as faithful to christies source material as any of the poirot installments the mystery is top notch with plenty of clues suspects and red herrings and as ive written before i always enjoy an christie story where hercule poirot gathers everyone together in a drawing room for the final reveal it might be old fashioned but thats the way i like it getting beyond the plot technically and artistically after the funeral is a winner sets editing direction and cinematography are as good as youll find in one of these movies the acting is equally impressive ive come to expect an enjoyable performance from david suchet as poirot and he doesnt disappoint here the rest of the cast is just as strong with monica dolan giving an especially noteworthy performance other than a minor quibble with the rapid fire way the characters are introduced ive got no real complaints its a good show all the way around
