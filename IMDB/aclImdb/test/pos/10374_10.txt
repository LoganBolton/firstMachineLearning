aunt cora had always been tactless and her wellbred family ignored the remark she made after her brother richards funeral he was murdered wasnt he they remembered it the next day when cora was found brutally murdered with a hatchetbr br for some reason the poirot movies this year have been far from faithful to the original book i was disappointed about the changes made in cards on the table my favourite poirot book after the funeral is my 2nd favourite poirot book and i was scared the story would be destroyed it wasnt the movie was nearly pageforpage faithful throughout right down to the killers motive all the actors were wonderful but my favourite has got to be monica dolan who gives a great performance as miss gilchrist the companion to the late aunt cora without a doubt the best poirot movie ever
