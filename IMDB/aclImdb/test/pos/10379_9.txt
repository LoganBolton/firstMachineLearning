dont quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there certainly wouldnt have been much comedy i also dont think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times there was much subtle humor sweet feelings and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in real life there are many people whose facial expression doesnt change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right the ending was quite unrealistic id say but happy its a lighthearted movie with a feelgood ending i liked it loved it actually a serious part was krueger going to schwedt and im glad they didnt show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly
