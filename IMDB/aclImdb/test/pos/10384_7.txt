beyond the clouds is an overthetop artsy group of four vignettes each a offering a glimpse into a manwoman relationship from the tenuous to the turbulent although the film offers superb cinematography some exquisite visual beauty and a cast of fine performers theres little meat on the bones of this fragmented work a taste of a relationship cannot impart the fullness of it and synergism suggests that much more can be accomplished with one story in 2 hours than with four nonetheless beyond the clouds will be fodder for dilettantes and a visual feast for the all albeit superficial stilted and lacking in substance
