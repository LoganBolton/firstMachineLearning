looks like the bet movie ive ever seen not too much for intelligent perception but so rich for perception sensitive antonioni is comparably wise to his movie malkovichs so organic roles are so true situations are so real ive change my world outlook after this cinema im a beginner literati in russia  country of tolstoy and dostoevskiy  and im quite sure watching antonioni is good and fun for russkies because i and we do understand his point of view so i dont understand his lesser raiting on imdb im sure speaking from russia and our people we like antonioni because of his romantic soul and positive sensation of surrounding reality
