beyond the clouds is in many ways the weirdest film i have ever seen not for its cult appeal gore or even for its ideas but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema beyond the clouds was directed by michelangelo antonioni one of italys most famous directors however if you gave this film only a quick watchover passively i mean it would seem one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances this movie deserves great attention to the point of embracing all its cheese by cheese i dont mean a slice but a whole brick of cheddar the music seems like its from some italian porno the story and dialogue like they are from a corny japanese soap and the metaphors are so obvious you want to smack yourself on the headbr br but once you get passed all this you are engaged in an existential work of art the cheese feeds into the subtle filming and draws our attention perfectly to what needs to be known the basic plot is of four chapters unrelated and all about love what we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said people cannot communicate to each other instead they can only communicate through each other i suppose thats why the dialogue and plot is so cheesy because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of causality and peoples reaction overly melodramaticbr br i left that film thinking to myself maybe all life is one big melodrama we judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful i hate because i have reason but what does the hated think maybe they think that my hate is stupid and arbitrary in other words melodramaticbr br so melodrama is actually an existential function a corny romance is simply human interaction put under a magnifying glass allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we dobr br this is a great film i recommend it to all
