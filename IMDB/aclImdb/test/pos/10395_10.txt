i was stunned by this film afterwards i didnt even want to see any films for a long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparisonbr br for many it may be the worst of antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions and the worst of wenders verbose confused transcendentalism it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by wenders typical meandering heros stream of consciousness so it doesnt produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinemabr br but for fans the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film wenders and antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of thingsbr br
