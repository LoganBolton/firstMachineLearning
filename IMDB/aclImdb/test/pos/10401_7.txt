another handheld horror means another divisive movie that fans should still seek out and make up their own minds aboutbr br imagine a cross between the blair witch project and the grudge and youre close to the overall content of this movie its another videotaped horror but this time most of it is edited together in readiness for a video doc that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappearedbr br i certainly had a feeling of dread while watching this movie does anyone do dreadful better than our asian friends but the creepy moments the genuinely creepy moments were sadly a bit fewer and farther between than i had hoped i also felt that i was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent revelations appeared throughout so i certainly cant recommend this as highly as recbr br having said that it would be remiss of me not to highly recommend any film that goes on at length about ectoplasmic worms contains at least two subtly spooky ghost moments and made sure that i had to put the lights back on for a while when the sun went downbr br check it out if you have been enjoying some of the other handheld genre releases of late and the finale is a hairraising doozybr br see this if you like the last broadcast pulse angel heart
