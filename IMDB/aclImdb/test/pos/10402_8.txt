a documentary filmmaker explores seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents connected by the legend of an ancient demon called the kagutababr br from the looks of it the film looks like one of those camcorder movies that have been popular these last few months even one thats going to be released next week paranormal activity however unlike movies like cloverfield rec and blair witch where most of those movies are in complete chaos and mayhem with all of the shakiness this one is basically shown in a traditional documentary style it has tv excerpts and interviews and the scares are very subtle well excluding the last 20 minutes where we go into the chaos effect and where the fear factor is raised up tremendouslybr br and it works the film is very engrossing and it makes you think yes you heard me right it makes you think you have to pay attention to those unrelated details given throughout the film and the payoff is great when in course of the film these things start to intertwine one another the film is also very slow moving which in this case is a good thing we as the audience get to absorb the details shown on screen however subtle or blatant they arebr br above all its a frightening little film im a person who is scared of ghosts and the paranormal more than killers who slashes away teenage victims so yes the film gave me some nightmares there are some images in here that are really disturbing to watch including one closer in the end where it makes you go what am i looking at well its better left unanswered there are around ten reoccurring characters in here all of which gave authentic performances in their rolesbr br the only thing i dont like about the film is the ending because most questions are left unanswered the question thats it went though my mind it left a bad taste in my mouth however the rest of the film is just engrossing and really frightening dont see this alone in the dark because youll regret that choice also i can see in a couple of years that hollywood would remake this film that will be interesting
