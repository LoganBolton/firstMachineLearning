i for one absolutely loved this moviebr br it is not a typical asian horror where you would see a gruesome looking ghost usually a woman that is going around scaring people you barely see any ghosts for a majority of the film but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and characters is genius this is not the movie for you if youre into gore eg saw hostel or surprise scares where stuff pops out at you hollywood horror slasher films but this movie has an underlying creepy factor throughout the entire movie which i loved noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror amongst the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap being released by hollywood in todays societybr br please dont let the documentarystyle of filming turn you off why should it it is far superior to the blair witch project because for one the acting in noroi is brilliant and it really makes you really feel like youre watching something youre not supposed to be seeingbr br noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies i have ever seen only a few films have made it into my top 5 horror and this movie holds a solid 1 spot on my list
