i cant praise this film enough it had a lot of that handheld firstperson shaking camera which i love and some hate because it makes them sick like rec cloverfield and blair witch projectbr br it is a long movie for its kind but i didnt even notice because the film was so interesting by just showing the footage from a paranormal reporters work the movie keeps up the pace making it a realtime experience for the viewerbr br while i would never call this film the scariest horror ever made id have to say its certainly one of the best ive seen the fear factor here is constructed by details in the images camera glitches events linked to one another which lend a very mysterious and haunting tone to the movie the horror is more in what is not shown but left to our imaginations the ending is perfect and be warned that you might have nightmares afterwards a second viewing is highly recommended thoughbr br watch this one alone in the dark dont expect anything and youll have fun
