this review contains some small yet significant spoilersbr br br br i just finished watching my copy of noroibr br and it was great this might sound cheesy but several times during the film i forgot it wasnt real xd the acting is convincing although the acting from masafumi kobayashi playing himself i think seems a bit hokey at times marika matsumoto yuka in takashi shimizus rinne seemed to change levels of believability throughout the movie sometimes shes really good then the next moment shes really cheesy especially at the ends exorcism and subsequent repossessionbr br a character that was ridiculous at first was mr hori a man covered in tinfoil believing ectoplasmic worms are coming to eat everyone he provides unintentional comic relief at the beginning acting like the stereotypical alien abductiontype victim but near the end has some really creepy scenesbr br the plot was very interesting and really kept me wondering how everything tied together there are some things that arent really explained like a mass suicide in a tokyo park and where the reincarnated kagutababoy came from but everything else turned out fine the ending has got to be one of the most unnerving if not the scariest sequences ive ever had the pleasure to witnessbr br all in all noroi is a very fun way to spend 2 hours and the new hong kong r3 dvd provides great picture and sound most importantly the english subtitles engrish free for a great jhorror experience i highly recommend picking it up
