i was enchanted by niamis debut i hope that well soon see more of his work i was lucky enough to catch the film during its brief nyc run and it struck me as a worthy successor to such downtown 80s flicks as desperately seeking susan and after hours but with a gentle european whimsey that made it fresh and fun a strong ensemble cast playing mostly against type was a pleasure and i thought the complexly interthreaded plots were just right sandra bernhard puts in her best performance since king of comedy while peter stormare is hilarious and ling bai touching see it
