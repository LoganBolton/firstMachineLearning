wow ive sure seen quite a bit of kelli mccarty this summer i didnt know this woman made so many softcore flicks in the past three years its like seeing a future softcore star blossom in front of me much like michelle hall did a couple of years agobr br passions peak is the third quality softcore flick ive seen kelli mccarty in with girl for girl and house of love being the others desire and deception was okay but it wasnt spectacular theres spoilers in this review so read only if you want tobr br the story begins with christina kelli mccarty heading out of the big city and to the mountains she has inherited a house from her dear departed grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain lodge before she can even set her things down some woman named kim uncredited in this film but quite the aggressive one begins booking guests to stay there now she has to get the house into shape quicklyin comes chip bobby johnston a childhood friend to the rescue chip helps her get the house in workable condition she hires two local slackers to work in her lodgechips sister bait samantha mcconnell and her sex buddy hankbr br now the guests start coming the first to arrive are eric and linda flower two stereotypical moneyfirst lawyers linda and eric get into a huge argument during a dinner party halfway through the film which leads to their breakup sad stuff there next theres romance novelist sophia played by bmovie goddess monique parent shes using that silly alias scarlet johansing again and shes got a very professional look this timewith blonde hair of course it wouldnt be monique if she didnt have at least one scene where she plays with herselfand she obliges during one of eric and lindas sex scenesbr br james and shene devinn laneyes the porn star devinn lane show up for a little weekend getaway as well unbeknownst to shene james and christina have quite a history james and christina used to date but christina broke it off to head to this mountain lodge james comes up to the lodge to get christina back but his plan backfires christina spills the beans to shene which causes shene to walk out on him and down to the local bar to strip for the locals shene ends up in the sleeping bag of the nowsingle eric and they leave together bait realizes she wants something more than just sex with hank and christine finds true love with chip with sophia soaking it all in and writing it into her next romance novel br br in factif you ask me this whole movie played out like a romance novel i dont know if the screenwriter was going for that effect but i sure got that impression sophia had some of the best lines in this film playing up the idea that this is a liveaction romance novel she seems to enjoy all the fighting and backstabbing going onbr br now to the sex there was a fair amount of it and it was the usual bumpand grind stuff monique did her fair share of moaning in her two sex scenes this film was tapeworthy and the story will actually keep the audience somewhat interested in between the sex scenesbr br women a monique was simply monique out of all the softcore actresses ive seen over the years shes the best at acting in my opinion she can really act and be sexy which is why shes holding on to the 1 position in my skinemax top 10 kelli mccarty is better at doing softcore films than she is on the soap opera passions i dont know why shes not doing more of these flower was merely background scenery for the most part in a limited role samantha mcconnell continues to impress me and devinn lane is yet another hardcore actress crossing over into the softcore realm and doing a halfway decent job at itbr br sex b it was good but not aweinspiring spectacular plenty of moaning dont watch the rrated version trust memost of the good stuff is taken out my grade is for the uncut versionbr br story b a solid storyline which throws in a contrived ooh the building inspectors gonna shut us down subplot toward the end which messes up things the underlying story between christina and james was nice and sophias dialogue full of the metaphors and imagery usually found in romance novels was a nice touchbr br overall b i found this movie to be quite entertaining its not a surefire softcore halloffamer like girl for girl is but its a respectable addition to the skinemax collection
