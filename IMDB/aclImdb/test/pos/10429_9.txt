i dont understand why more people have not commented on this other than the fact that perhaps not very many have seen it its an amazing cast of characters one after another after another all done by the guy who wrote the play if you dont like filmed plays you may not like this after all plays usually dont look good on tv but its a oneman show that will have you paying attention throughout highly recommended
