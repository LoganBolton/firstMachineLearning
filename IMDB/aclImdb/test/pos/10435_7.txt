i see there are great reviews of this film already ive got a few points to comment on reasons i thought there was something special about this filmbr br first and foremost the film is realistic it may not seem realistic to an adult who has forgotten what it was like being a teenager but thats really the kind of superdrama that goes on amongst teens all the time second the good guy the guy who treats women with respect doesnt get the girls thats the way it is in real life just the same hes too nice for his own good people are just selfish third it was nice to see a fat guy who had some selfconfidence i mean that role already takes confidence from the actor im not just talking about the character overall i thought the film was a positive surprise that secretly hides amongst wacky partyin teen sex comedies at the rental shelf dont get me wrong its not all sad its a good laugh as well
