i first saw this movie when i was about 12 years old it has been one of my favorites since its so perfect in all its glory complete with awesome soundtrack cheesy dialog and it was both hilarious and terribly sad the first movie i really just had a fit about at the end i wont ruin it for you guys but boy is it a tear jerker i just remember feeling so sad for gary what a bunch of cool characters in this movie its genius they are all so great even the nerdy girl gary doesnt likeshe had a nice little body though i cant believe all the girls go for rick he is such a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck ha ha ha when watching this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseasesalmost but a love story at heart with real problems dealing from insecurity to life altering decisions that make you think and feel genuine sorrow for the cast i love this movie  if you like valley girl another all time classic you will too
