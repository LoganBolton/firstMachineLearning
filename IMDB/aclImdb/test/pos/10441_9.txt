i really like this movie i like it not just because its a great early 80s movie with a great soundtrack but i found that it has some thoughtprovoking moments they are just moments not the entire film its definitely not like less than zerobr br the scenes deal with typical peer pressure and also with more difficult problems like the betrayal of trust these problems are not easily resolved or forgotten by the characters certain scenes will stand out and invite reflection on ones own teenage experiences and how those experiences may have affected ones character and outlook as an adultbr br you can watch this movie and think about the problems young adults must face and about your own experiences or you can just pay attention to the boys quest to devirginize themselves  either way its a good movie
