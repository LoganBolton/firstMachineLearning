as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all timeand one of my personal favorites to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time second only to the breakfast club the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time its underratedand pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people it comes on tbs maybe once a yearbut sometimes longer the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes then the second half is pure honestand most of the time serious with only a few comic scenes in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time ive never heard this many great songs in one movie before there are 4 love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin hes in high school who has a couple of best friends his two friends are sexsarved teens the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures that are very funny gary is major in love with the new girl in school he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her he also cheats on the side you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much you can feel it even more in the second half garys friend turns out to be a creep but his other friend is pretty cool the movie shows how mean people can be you can relate to a lot of this movie the plot sounds like your typcial teen sex comedy but its so much more than that its a very honest movie its also very 80ish which i love if you love the 80s or grewup in the 80srent this movie but there may be some people that dont like the 80sbut still may like this movie i first saw this movie back in 1987 i think its very entertainingand very funny it combines very touching moments with very funny moments its an underrated gem i have the movie i love it i give the last american virgin 12 out of
