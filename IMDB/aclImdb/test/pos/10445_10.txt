it plays like your usual teenageaudience ta movie but the sentiment is incredibly bleak if it was made today itd be considered an art house movie it goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid but the results of his efforts are harsh and cruel and unsatisfyingbr br the whole teen flick formula is adhered to but nothing turns out the way youd expect imagine a directors cut of its a wonderful life where at the end james stewart wasnt allowed to return to the real world an incredible film that subverts all of the expectations of the genre it makes you feel dirty afterwards there is no redemption for the characters im amazed it ever got made the eighties version of detective story
