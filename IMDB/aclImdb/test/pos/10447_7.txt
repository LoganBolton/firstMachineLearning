spoilers this movie has its problems but in the end it gets the message across i liked it because it ends the way things really do the nice guy tries and tries gets his heart broken several times but in the end there is no typical hollywood ending it ends the way such things always end or at least always have in my own and friends experiences anyone who thinks that the ending to this isnt how it really happens as the first comment seemed to believing that the girl would come around realize shes dating an asshole who treats her bad because he doesnt care about her at all is either naive or lives in a more perfect world than i i give it 710 extra points simply because it wasnt afraid to end on a down note give no real resolution just the main character left heartbroken confused and alone as so many men of countless generations have been before
