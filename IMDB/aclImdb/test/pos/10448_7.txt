ahhhthe 80s 1982 makes me think back to the really crazy time we were facing in america fresh off the do what feels good 70s the last american virgin comes as a wolf in sheeps clothing as yet another teenage sex comedy from the glory days oh sure theres sex but i cant think of another movieok this and fast times at ridgemont highthat really wasnt killing time between topless teenage scenesthere was some pretty good stuff here amongst the cleavagebr br the movie follows three hormonal friends gary wanting to lose his virginity rick stud incarnate and david overweight but not inexperienced as they try desperately hard to make sure gary joins the world of manhood but a funny thing happens on the way to the keggergary falls for karen pretty brunette who loves the bad boys and cant seem to follow through with any sexual conquest that david and rick can facilitate only trouble is rick and karen get hot and heavy and karen skips a period its gary who is by her side as she goes to get her abortion and its gary who truly cares but who is karen dancing with by film endrick subtract the r and add a d where necessarybr br what separates this film from others from the 80s we think about is that by god they attempt some real drama here and not of the my parents just pulled in the driveway variety and you know what i bought itbr br it wasnt sloppy it wasnt farfetched and when gary sees rick dancing with karen at the house party at the end of the film i actually felt sorry for the guy our teenage romeo actually believed in unrequited loveand when his heart was broken at the end it all sort of touched mebr br so all the ta aside theres an actually pretty believable and engaging story here oscar worthy not by a mile but i dont know that id lump it into the lets get laid category either like fast times at ridgemont high they actually were trying to do a true film here letting the hijinx in between fall where it may
