i have always liked this film and im glad its available finally on dvd so more viewers can see what i have been telling them all these years story is about a high school virgin named gary lawrence monoson who works at a pizza place as a delivery boy and he hangs out with his friends david joe rubbo and rick steve antin gary notices karen diane franklin who is the new girl in school and one morning he gives her a ride and by this time he is totally in love that night at a party he sees rick with karen and now he is jealous of his best friend but doesnt tell anyone of his true feelingsbr br spoiler alertbr br rick asks gary if he can borrow his grandmothers vacant home but gary makes up an excuse so that rick cant get karen alone but one night rick brags to gary that he nailed her at the football field and gary becomes enraged a few days later in the school library gary sees rick and karen arguing and he asks karen what is wrong she tells him that shes pregnant and that rick has dumped her gary helps her by taking her to his grandmothers home and paying for her abortion finally gary tells karen how he really feels about her and she seems receptive to his feelings but later at her birthday party he walks in on karen and rick together again gary drives off without the girl this film ends with a much more realistic version of how life really is no matter how nice you are you dont necessarily get the girlbr br this film was directed by boaz davidson who would go on to be a pretty competent action film director and he did two things right with this movie first he made sure that there was plenty of gratuitous nudity so that this was marketable to the young males that usually go to these films secondly he had the film end with young gary without karen and i think the males in the audience can relate to being screwed over no matter how hard you try and win a girls heart yes this film is silly and exploitive but it is funny and sexy actress louisa moritz almost steals the film as the sexy carmela moritz was always a popular b level actress and you might remember her in one flew over the cuckoos nest like fast times at ridgemont high this has a very good soundtrack and the songs being played reflect what is going on in the story but at the heart of this film is two very good performances by monoson and franklin there is nudity required by franklin but she still conveys the sorrow of a young girl who gets dumped at a crucial time shes always been a good actress and her natural charm is very evident in this film but this is still monosons story and you cant help but feel for this guy when the film ends its his performance that stays with you its a solid job of acting that makes this more than just a teen sex comedy even with the silly scenarios of teens trying to have sex this film still manages to achieve what it wants underrated comedy hits the bullseye
