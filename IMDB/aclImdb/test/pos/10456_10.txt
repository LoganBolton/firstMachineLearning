i saw this in a theatre back in 1982 i expected a stupid ta movie thats not what i gotbr br its basically about three teenage boys trying to have sex we get the expected sex jokes and scenesbut for once theyre actually pretty funnybr br yeah theyre stupid but i enjoyed them anyways also there was a surprising amount of male nuditybr br then the movie about halfway through takes a sudden dramatic turn as one of the boys winningly played by lawrence monoson falls in love with a girl then the jokes stop and things get very dark im not going to give away what happens but i was very surprised at the sudden turn in events the movie brings up some very important subjects and treats them realistically and with intelligence and it has a real heartbreaking endingbr br im giving this a 10 because this is probably one of the best teen sex comedydramas ever made it mixes fantasy and realism together and works what more can you ask for also it has a great soundtrack
