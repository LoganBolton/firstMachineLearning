feels like an impressionistic film if there is such a thingbr br the story is well told very poetic the characters well developed and well acted by the interpreters or interpreted by the actors br br the film delights in its own sumptuous emotions at times and works well unless you hate such emotion in movies  not so in my casebr br its a very humanistic filmbr br the landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own rightbr br well donebr br a good classic for any good film collection
