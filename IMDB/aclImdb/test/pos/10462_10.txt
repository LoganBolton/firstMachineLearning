this is one of the finest movies i have ever seenthe stark scenerythe isolationthe ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religiona backdrop for some wordliness and sophisticationthe acting is completely naturalbut for me as afoodie the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feasti have spent time in paris and know the cuisine wellwhether or not the cafe anglais really exists i dont know but i do know of similar establishments and babettes menu and choice of wines are authenticand of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could bethis is a 10 out of 10 film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it
