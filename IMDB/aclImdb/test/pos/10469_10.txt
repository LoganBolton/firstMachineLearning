food always makes a good topic in movies as chocolat showed babettes feast is the same type of thing babette harsant stephane audran is a french cook who flees her native land after the repression of 1871 she moves to a very religious danish village the people in this village simply have no use for joy that is until babette cooks them one of her exquisite mealsbr br its not just that this movie deals with bringing fun to a place that has never known it like other scandinavian movies and nonhollywood movies in general it shows that a movie can hold your interest without the use of explosions car chases etc this is one movie that you cant afford to missbr br one more thing do you think that the danish word for feast sounds a little bit like tastebud
