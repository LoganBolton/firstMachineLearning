some have commented on the subtitles not being a problem in this film  i beg to differ  the nuisances in the facial expressions and subtle interactions between the characters is such that you can not afford to take your eyes away for even a fraction of a second i tried to watch on the dvd in english to overcome this problem dont make this mistake the result is a travesty the only way to get the full benefit is to watch it two or three times in quick succession so you know it and then ignore the subtitles an acting master class  not in the dialogue but body languagebr br it is the little things  the postmastershop keeper puffs out his chest and goes in to get his cap before delivering a letter from france the generals bemused expression as his delight in a bunch of perfect grapes elicits a biblical reference with a profundity worthy of being therebr br the cinematography is awesome and the bleak minimalist village with its washed out colour just accentuates the sumptuousness of the feast when it comes i have a friend who claims to be descended from the borgias and whos family motto is if it is worth doing it is worth doing to excess  amenbr br i laugh out loud and cry each time i watch this film
