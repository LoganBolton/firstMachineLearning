i was unfamiliar with this film until i saw it included in a list of the top 20 spaghetti westerns i recently came across following the marathon i made these last few weeks of films from the subgenre it was auspicious then that the film had to turn up almost immediately on latenight italian tv for the first time im pretty sure in a good number of years br br unfortunately the cable reception of the channel on which it was broadcast hasnt been great lately i recorded the film on vhs but i decided not to keep it due to this factor as it happened the very next day i watched the film i found out that it was available on a region 2 dvd from italy featuring an interview with uncredited scriptwriter ernesto gastaldi  and having been sufficiently impressed i decided to order it there and then even if i knew that i wouldnt be getting to the dvd for quite a while as i like to allow some time between one viewing of a film and the next a brief parenthesis here when i recently purchased a spate of spaghetti westerns on italian dvd i opted not to order sergio sollimas face to face 1967 since i was under the impression that it was a barebones affair however ive just learned that the disc actually contains an interview with the director as had been the case with the big gundown 1966 which i bought it did seem baffling to me that sollima wouldnt offer similar contribution to that films dvd edition when he actually considered face to face as his favorite work as per the directors talent bio included on the blue underground region 1 disc of yet another sollima spaghetti western  run man run 1968 the trouble is that i loved the big gundown so much that i followed it with a viewing of face to face via the recording i owned made off italian tv i did order the dvd of that film now  especially since its still discounted  but as i said with respect to a second look at the price of power although i may still check out sollimas interview when the disc arrives br br ok rant over the film under review is quite an unusual spaghetti western and a very interesting indeed ambitious one at that being a transposition of the jfk assassination case to an old west setting actually its reminiscent of anthony manns terse blackandwhite thriller the tall target 1951  which dealt with an assassination attempt on the life of thenus president abraham lincoln it features one of the most popular italian stars from this subgenre giuliano gemma in what is perhaps his most impressive western role many of his other films tended to have a lighthearted bent the supporting cast includes at least two other notables van johnson in one of his few and mainly unremarkable italian films as the american president killed in postcivil war dallas and fernando rey as the head of a conspiracy of southerners  who not only plots his assassination but also conveniently maneuvers the new acting us leader johnsons vicepresident by means of blackmail br br benito stefanelli also makes a good impression as a corrupt sheriff who pursues gemma all through the picture and with whom hes engaged a couple of times in a duel in the dark  with the guns resting on the floor rather than in their respective holsters and the only light in the room provided by the end of the cowboys cigars also involved is ray saunders as gemmas black sidekick whom the narrative eventually turns into the doomed lee harvey oswald figure stelvio massi  who later cut his teeth as director on a number of poliziotteschi  is behind the films luminous cinematography similarly luis enrique bacalov supplies yet another great eurocult score  which is different enough from the style of ennio morricone as to be equally distinguishable valeriis direction here may mot be as imposing as that in other spaghetti westerns but he handles the proceedings efficiently enough the final gunfight is especially nicely done the film is certainly one of the more underrated entries in the subgenre and for those so inclined the novelty of the plot line alone should make it one to look out for
