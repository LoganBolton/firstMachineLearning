this is a gripping story that borrows elements from the kennedy assassination and uses them successfully to create an excellent western talebr br the movie has a good music score though it relies on repeating the title theme a little too much giuliano gemma and the rest of the cast are superb this is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western that relies more on story than action and it succeeds because the story is excellent this is not to say that there is no action in the movie there is plenty and it is very well crafted this movie pulls you in right away and keeps you absorbed til the end youll always be wondering whats in those documents everyones after it also has some biting commentary on american politicsbr br this movie shows why valerii in my opinion is in a three way tie with sollima and corbucci for second place in the rankings of spaghetti western directors
