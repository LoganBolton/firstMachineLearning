this was the film that first indicated to me what a great actor martin sheen really is he modestly claims that charlie is a better actor charlie cant hold a candle to himbr br i found it suspenseful and thoroughly enjoyed the intertwining of the love story with the main plot and i usually hate love stories theres a great plot twist at the end that struck me as being fully credible particularly in the early 80s time period and probably now alsobr br the final scene had me on the edge of my seat this film roundly illustrates that treachery is often doled out by those we trust while declared enemies have more in common than they suspect and finally that human compassion can be found where we least expect itbr br irenerose
