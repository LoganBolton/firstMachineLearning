thank you the filmzone for showing this sleazy soft core sex flick at 1 am i truly enjoyed it to be honest i expected a lot more from a sexy cast with mckayla dru berrymore and of course the talented chloe nicholle as rebecca carterbr br the production values are truly bad mainly because of the low budget but a little more effort wouldnt harm for example the cinematography makes it look like a hard core porno movie theres absolutely no effort in lightning but lets ignore that fact because lets be honest we watched pleasures of sin because of the high amounts of sexbr br the sex factor is pretty good and offers steamy explicit scenes chole nicholle delivers the best performance of the female castbr br so my advice is  watch this movie if you are in the mood for good explicit sex or just watch it if you are a fan of mrs nichollebr br recommended only for the sex scenes dont expect anything else
