progeny is about a husband and wife who experience time loss while making love completely unaware of what this bizarre experience means they try to go on with their lives the hubby begins questioning the bizarre event and gets help through a very annoying psychiatrist he comes to believe that aliens are responsible for this lapse in time and that the unborn baby he once thought was his and his wifes actually belongs to the aliensbr br if ya ask me this is a great scifihorror story taking a highly questionable reallife scenario involving alien abduction and hybrid breeding is definite thumbs up from this guy i love all things related to aliens and this story definitely delivered some good ideas so if you also share an interest in things extraterrestrial you should be pretty happy with progeny at least storywise anywaysbr br unfortunately the movie overall is pretty average with average acting by all actors yep even by the consistently awesome mr dourif who still does deliver the best performance though the black head doctor delivers his lines really well there are a few points in the flick where some of the delivery is cringe or laugh worthy which is fine in my book i like them cheesy and this had a little bit of some nice stinky cheese and i mean that in a good waybr br anyways with a less than stellar script you cant really blame all the actors i especially didnt care for the mother hysteria the film went for she wanted a baby so badly that shed neglect and dismiss everything her loving husband whos a doctor said to her it almost reached a point where you actually didnt care what happened to herbr br the progeny is another flick by brian yuzna from the ickysticky film society again he delivers some slimy effects and again he delivers a pretty unique tale of horror if youre into scifihorror or are a fan of dourif and or yuzna films theres no real reason not to check out this flick if you get the chance a generous 7 outta 10
