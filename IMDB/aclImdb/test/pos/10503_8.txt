first let me review the movie this movie creeps me out and i dont even believe in aliens however the movie has its flawsbr br there are three acts to this movie act one is perfect it sets up the movie and really builds up the creep factor i must say the score is great everything is set up and its set up perfectlybr br act two begins when jillian playing sherry burton goes to the shrink they hypnotize her and she recalls the abduction act two ruins the film when the aliens show up screaming mad george did the effects for the aliens i must say they did a good job except with their depiction of the gray aliens no offense but the grays looked like inflatable door prizesbr br on a side note i liked how they treated hypnosis in acts one and two if you paid attention you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories in the husbands version of events the blue light zaps them and his wife says somebodys here or something like it it makes sense the husband is concerned for his wife someone may hurt her thats his issue however in her version of events she says help me she does not say somebodys here this also makes sense the aliens are after her wanting her husband to help and save her is her issue now back to the filmbr br act three turns the film into a gore fest it begins with a strange ultrasound procedure its a typical gore fest but it does have a surprise ending i wont ruin it because its actually an interesting development br br the dvd and commentaries takes itself too seriously but if you think wilford brimley saying horsesh is funny you might want to check it out in the cast interviews section now on to my praise of jillian mcwhirterbr br i could only hope jillian will read this i had never seen her before but wow what a performance let me tell the rest of you this first of all this is supposed to be a serious film the details i will now describe may sound campy and fun like humanoids from the deep 1980 but it really isnt got that okaybr br jillian is hot naturally goodlooking she is naked for a lot of the film a good thing unfortunately she is usually being assaulted terrorized and raped a very bad thing however she must act in a lot of this film naked she gets points for overcoming that she has to act happy sad horny afraid and physically hurt all in the span of a few moments the turnaround of emotion is astounding she has to cheer for joy when she learns shes pregnant she has to scream in terror when the aliens take out her guts she has to act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby isnt his she has to act like shes in denial saying nothing is wrong with her baby when her husband says otherwise a denial i should note that is really forced upon her by the aliens controlling her i am talking oscarcaliber performance herebr br then there is the rape scene its disturbing but since its just some rubber alien its not too bad in this scene the alien is not a gray alien so i will describe it the alien has tentacles and its kind of like a table jillian is on the tablelike part restrained by the tentacles by her head is the aliens head the aliens head is long and it flips down so that its head is now above jillians legs then the aliens heynanunanu comes out of his forehead its forehead sounds pretty campy right well jillian plays it straight and she pulls it off she has to act like an alien with its heynanunanu coming from its forehead is raping her and she pulls it off its a very intense scene but thats not what makes it you see this scene is done in a flashback what makes the scene is jillians performance recalling these events she is just lying in a hospital bed under hypnosis recalling the alien abduction but her acting here is more intense than the actual rape scene how many actors can pull off a performance in a scene that describes a rape that is more intense than the scene with the rape not many however jillian does itbr br i could go on and on jillian if you ever read this i want you to know that i name withheld alias of megamanx1 believe you are the best actress ever you are the best actress ever i could only hope you read this and take it with you alwaysbr br as for everyone else progeny 1999 is an okay to good film i would recommend it
