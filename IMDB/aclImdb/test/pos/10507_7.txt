i put in the dvd expecting camp perversion from the creators of society and reanimator and was quite surprised to become involved in an authentically suspenseful tale acting was topnotch nice to see vosloo in a protagonist role after a long string of villains the storyline involving and the few twists fairly surprising i figured i would fast forward through much of it to get to the abduction scenes but instead watched it through only being let down at the very endbr br maybe im being too lenient but as i stated before i wasnt expecting much more than alien sex of course if you are looking for some hot alien sex you will be let down it was mostly quickcut exam table nonsense with a blinkandyoullmissit glimpse of an interesting impregnator alien
