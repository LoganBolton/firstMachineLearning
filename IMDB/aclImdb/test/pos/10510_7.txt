now ive seen many many bgrade films in my 15 years of living and i must say that this was one of the better ones i personally enjoyed the real estate and the storyline but it did suffer from amateur acting although adrienne barbeau did give a decent performance as lisa grant joseph bottoms couldnt hold his part well enough to be considered good the other performance which really fit the film was that of barry hope barney resnick it begins with an eager real estate agent taking an asian couple through a house only to find theres a dead girl in the shower of the showhome it progresses with detective speculating and introduces the key characters with reasonable grace i think that for any person whos in for a giggle at the overthetop drama the victim realtors provide during the overthetop gory scenes this truly is a gem xd who am i kidding its not that great but worth a watch if youre insanely bored
