when you read about this film you wanna cringe i have seen it countless times and yet i cringe myself so what is the attraction here i think that for me its the offbeatness of the romance i find it super refreshing to have an oddball coupling between this nyc jimmybreslinlike columnist and a downonherluck healthwise ballerina you feel embarrassed for paul sorvino at his unsubtle approach to wooing this woman like the guy in the bar who cant take a hint hes a bit overweight at least as a wouldbe suitor for a ballerina hope that doesnt sound unkind and possibly a tad too old for her nice change of pace from greek god wooing supermodel the bill conti score has stuck in my head all these years later which is a pretty good sign however some of the acting is just dreadful a subplot involving a young puertorican boy befriended by sorvinos character is just hilariously bad but the opening scene where ditchburn is warming up to carole king draws you right into this story good luck finding it youd think that lifetime would be reairing this or even we but i havent seen it on in quite a few years
