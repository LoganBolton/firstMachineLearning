i was never all that impressed by night gallery but this one episode stands outbr br a tv network executive auditions an odd act  a young nerdy boy who proceeds to make prognostications the exec dismisses the whole thing as a flaky waste of time until both predictions come true the next morningbr br what first seemed a parlor act becomes a hit show as the kids predictions prove consistently accuratebr br then one day he refuses to do the show facing imminent showtime everyones at wits end even threatening him with legal action if he doesnt fulfill his contract and make his daily predictionsbr br the young boy relents and foretells a seemingly utopian tomorrowbr br after the show the befuddled executive asks for an explanation only to learn why the complete truth is too terrifying to reveal
