i adore the ln chaney version of phantom and i appreciate webbers version if only for the growing interest in the book wish i find more of a mystery slash horror with the romantic aspects downplayed i dont approve of the fact that andrew lloyd webber made the relationship between raoul and christine less restrainedbr br luckily since this is a comedic short with only erik and christine this version doesnt even have to bother with any other charactersbr br i thought i would still be waiting for another version to match up lons performance i was dead wrong leslie nielson is fabulous as erik though of course this is a spoof its still brilliantbr br i especially appreciated the fact that erik looked more like a living corpse than an accident victim i still have as of yet to see a phantom like that other than lonsbr br however i do not recommend this short if you dont like spoofs because this is in no way supposed to be taken seriously
