bridget fonda has disappointed me several times over the years but she had my attention in break up its true the story is missing critical details in several places but i just kept scrutinizing fonda for clues about what was meaningful in the story and she didnt let me down the look in her eyes in the last scene as she musters up courage to literally put one foot in front of the other toward her uncertain future is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of face acting ever i believed her completely possibly because ive known and admired several tough broads who survived similar abusive situations and they did this without becoming manhaters but thats my own hopeful projection of fondas character at the break up
