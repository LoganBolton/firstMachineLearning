ive tried to remember the name of this movie for years and years finally read something today 03092005 that mentioned stacy keachs name and it reminded me that i had seen a movie that he was in in 1974 at the atlanta film festival so i did a google search for keachs movies and found the gravy train we were supposed to see duddy kravitz at the film festival but for some reason they were unable to show it and instead substituted the gravy train we were terribly disappointed that we werent going to be able to see the much hyped duddy kravitz and had heard nothing of the gravy train and have heard nothing of it sincebr br however i recall we were pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was and as i recall it was quite humorous would love to find it on tape
