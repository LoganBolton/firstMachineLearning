this interesting lost film written by terence malick stars stacy keach and frederic forrest as two wacky southern brothers on a quest to open a seafood restaurant margot kidder was never prettier and forrest should have been nominated originally titled the dion brothers this lighthearted flick with a violent ending is a pure joy br br where is this film ive been searching for it for 30 years keach was still great back then and im surprised it doesnt have more of a cult following maybe it does these guys are a crackup with more ambition than brains but totally lovable dudes a 7 out of 10 if you can dig it up somewhere youll have fun
