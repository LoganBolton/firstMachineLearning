great adaptation of the christie novel surprising attention to authentic period details for the time many films of the mid1970searly 80s that try to do 1920searly 30s look far too mid70searly 80s for my liking so expected the worst here and was gladly proved wrongthe costumes and sets are very well done i liked this production very much  largely due to the adorable francesca annis portrayal of a carefree bright young lady frankie and james warwicks charming bobbie the pair would go on to portray christies tommy  tuppence which is funny as some contemporary book critics compared frankie and bobby to her earlier characters of tommy  tuppence the supporting characters were equally well done  the over the top mrs rivington acted by miss marpletobe joan h and badger is played perfectly as the post wwi bertie wooster type
