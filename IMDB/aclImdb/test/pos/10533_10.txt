i had such high hopes for teletoon retro to air this but instead of having shows such as this ones that dont get the treatment that they deserve they air things that i may have seen dozens of times beforebr br the centurions was the highlight of my preteen years i know that may seem a little bit clich√©d but its true after duke from gi joe jake rockewell is another one of those cartoon characters that i really had a crush onbr br its too bad that teletoon retro doesnt see it the same way people of my generation do otherwise teletoon retro would be a lot better than it is
