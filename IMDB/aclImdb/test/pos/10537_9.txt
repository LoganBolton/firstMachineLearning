i saw this at the tribeca film festival in the family section im not sure either of my kids really got the movie but i have to say that it was a wonderful short filmbr br nostradamus and me is an interesting short film about the hopes and fears that we all felt growing up in the 1980s which in turn extends to how my kids feel today then we had regan today we got bush instead of nuclear war we have terrorismbr br i really identified with the main character and i myself dated a curehead in high school we all felt like nothing mattered when we were 16 but its great to see a film where they discover that everything matters br br again i probably wouldnt have put this in the family sectionthere were a few too many curse words for younger children but it was a wonderful and enjoyable film to watch
