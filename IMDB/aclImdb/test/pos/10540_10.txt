this review contains a huge spoiler but i dont know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away i saw pinoccios revenge a while agobr br now you might think its just a ripoff of childs play indeed there are similaritiesbr br however chucky was a possessed doll who works independently of the kid it is possible that pinoccio is possessed with a demon or cursed or something however the puppet itself is actually completely inanimate the kid is insane and the kid is the one killing people everyone including the audience the survivors and the kid herself thinks its the doll but its the kidbr br the nudity is almost a pity because otherwise i could tell everyone to see it because it really is an interesting horror movie
