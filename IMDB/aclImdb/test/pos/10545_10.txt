i can honestly tell you that this movie is the most awesome movie ever if you are in the mood for a comedy i totally recommend this movie so heres the summary there is this girlnikki who is fourteen and a half and she goes on a vacation with her fatherandre whom she hasnt seen for about two years she expects the vacation to be totally boring until she meets this boyben who is much older than she is so to try to impress him she says that she isnt on vacation with her father but her lover this is a hysterical movie from beginning to end and i highly suggest it so rent it and enjoy
