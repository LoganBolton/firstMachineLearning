this is a funny movie theres not a lot of those ok the plot is a bit disturbing but very original a teen trying to get even with dad because he hasnt been around and almost sending him to jail because she lie to impress an older boy how could that not be funny plus it not the typical movie featuring teens first remake ive seen that is better than the original the only problem with both gerard depardieu with another actor this would be a perfect 10 because he plays all rolls the same way sucks another problem its all the women melting over him thats not remotely believable he is not attractive y had a rubber troll that was better looking than him come on
