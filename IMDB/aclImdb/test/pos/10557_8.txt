my father the hero used to be my favorite movie when i was younger its about andre a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter katharine heigl on a vacation hoping to get a little closer to her but of course nicole isnt that easy to get along with she just started puberty im guessing she is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time one day at the beach nicole meets handsome ben and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad the whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie i would give my father the hero 810
