wow where to startbr br this adaptation of sarah waters third novel is one of my alltime favorite moviesbr br im not to big on fiction novels seriously i never read fiction but the book is just as fabulous as the film or should i say the film is just as fabulous as the book i just love this storybr br anyway i put off watching this three hour long film 2 part series on dvd 3 part series on tvbook for about a year and half it simply did not look that interestingboy was i so wrong br br i became immediately immersed into the rich and suspenseful plotutterly enthralled just like the book you cannot stop watchingreading it grasps your attention for the entire 3 hoursand when it does endyou wish it hadntbr br the story just flows so beautifully and youll be wondering where the time wentbr br the lesbian subplot was just icing on the cake the parts i love most are the subtle facial expressions and glanceseye contact between the two characters you really feel their desire for one another and yet they cannot act upon ituntil they must br br may i point out that the lesbian theme is an important part of the film obviously at the heart of the film is a genuine unexpected love story but it is most certainly not what the whole movie is about for me thats what makes this story so unique and intriguing ive never read or heard of anything like it sarah waters is pure geniusbr br the twists and turns it takes leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat seriously my hands were clasped on to my couch with every surprising plot twist and i even yelled out several times oh my god no way that did not just happen did iti never do thatbr br the only negative thing i have to say about this film is that i wish theyd added more from the book but obviously having the adaptation be restricted by time they couldnt add everything that i wouldve liked how awful it is thoughi think im just being brutally selfish nowforgive me br br the last 20 minutes does seem a little rushed however they put all the important bits in where even if you only watch the film and choose not to read the book you will be most satisfied with the outcome br br the actors are just superb brilliant even sally hawkins sue and elaine cassidy maud have such great on screen chemistry they steam up your television set simply electric the emotionsthe desperationthe struggle each of them feel is expressed seemingly effortless by these wonderfully talented actresses rupert evans plays such a good bad guy as gentleman i found myself seething every time he came on screen but loving it because hes just so damn cute and somehow still charming even though you want to wring his neck imelda staunton gives yet another fantastic performance as mrs sucksby shes such a warmhearted actress you cannot help but love hereven when the character shes playing isnt as delightful everyone else in the cast were perfect they really represented the characters well and were just as i imagined them to be after reading the bookbr br this is a must see for any film buff actually anyone and everyone should see this movie and read the book chances are you wont be disappointedbr br 1010 stars from me there are only four other films i have given that same rating too its very rare for me to actually enjoy a film so much that i give it 1010 this is one of those films fingersmith is truly a masterpiece
