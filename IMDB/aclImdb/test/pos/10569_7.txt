historical drama is one of the areas where the british just cant be beat so while im not a huge fan of the genre i can usually be persuaded to watch something lite this if its british and with decent actorsbr br i have never read anything by sarah waters which is of course something i should do hence i didnt really know what to expect from this i had heard that there would be a lesbian love story but not much more while watching it i found it to be a lot more interesting than i had anticipated without saying too much the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected as well as wellcrafted although there were almost a twist too many somewhere it took me a minute to get everything straightbr br production values are good the actors are very solid and the pace is decent although i found it to be a bit slow in the last halfhour that might just be me though i usually have a problem with movies dragging on after the plot is more or less finished all in all though this is a fairly enjoyable three hours i recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas
