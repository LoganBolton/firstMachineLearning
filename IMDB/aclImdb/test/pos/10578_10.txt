having read the book prior to watching this adaptation you would think that it would have lost some of its thrill however the story is so clever i could never tire of it br br sally and elaine really put their hearts into their roles and brought out so much of the characters i fell in love with the story and the women all over againbr br beautiful to watch thanks to direction settings and costumery despite the plot speed of television i dont feel that anything important was lost in transit it had me on the edge of my seat throughout with lots of wonderful stomachtrembling moments enjoyed it thoroughly this is the kind of television i have been waiting for
