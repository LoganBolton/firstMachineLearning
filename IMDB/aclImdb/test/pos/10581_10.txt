haggard the movie is the real life story of ryan dunn and his girlfriend who cheated on him also with the help from his two friend 1 a skate boarder who lives for nothing and 2 a tryingtobe funny scientist which doesnt really work played by bam margera and brandom dicamillobr br the film haggard the movie also has a lot of the characters from jackass etc but to say it was written by bam margera and co this is a very weak attempt seems to me like it was written when he was bored or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention tobr br the films also stars bams girlfriend jennifer rivell who plays glauren ryans girlfriend who basically cheated on him again very bad acting by jennifer another actor that some people may be interested in is steve aka hellboy played by rakeyohn which his character does not seem to be with the story again bad acting also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring but worst of all is raabs character the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer also i think he could have been improved overall i think the characters in this film arent with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different characterbr br to say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary its not played by the characters as a documentary the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare timebr br towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character ryan dunn although a lot of the attention is on bam and brandonbr br in conclusion this film is ok if you laugh at things that arent very funny stupid stunts terrible acting and the occasional nude scene also i think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music 710
