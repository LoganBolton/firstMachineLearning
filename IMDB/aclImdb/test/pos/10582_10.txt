alright let me break it down for ya haggard is probably one of the funniest pointless movies youll ever see its got a mixture of a unique storyline about a guy having girl troubles and everything going backwards for him mixed in with countless humorous scenes that will keep you laughing throughout the whole movie basically if youve seen jackass or the cky series youd know what to expect for humor considering it has most of the people from those movies overall i just had to give it a 1010 because its one of my favorite movies of all timebr br f0rs4k3nbr br ps haggard rules
