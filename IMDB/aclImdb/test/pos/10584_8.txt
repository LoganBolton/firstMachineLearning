i bought this movie just to see bam because i was really loving him but after seeing this i dont like him much i mean his acting was good and everything i guess but whenever it showed the totally unnecessary skate scenes i was just saying to myself alright we know youre a professional skateboarder now can we get back to ryan dunn dunn rake and brandon really made the movie in my perspectivebr br i noticed that jenn rivell obviously and missy rothstein were both in haggard but who bam was dating at the time anyways i actually enjoyed haggard and i think its really like no other movie ive ever seen its sort of in its own category
