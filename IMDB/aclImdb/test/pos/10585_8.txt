while some of the things in haggard are dumb and unnecessary the overall package is good br br haggard follows ryan dunn and his friends valo bam margera and falcone brandon dicamillo trying to win back glauren jenn rivell ryans ex br br the story is followed and developed surprisingly well it doesnt wonder off and become an episode of jackass or viva la bam although it does have a side story which doesnt hurt the main storybr br and for all the bam fan boys and girls there are multiple sequences of bam skateboarding perhaps the weakest aspect of the film phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances even don vito got a bigger but pointless rollbr br if you are hoping to see a comedy and escape bams craziness then stay away from this movie otherwise enjoy the time you spend with it if you can find it there are some truly funny scenes in this film
