set in bam margeras hometown of westchester pa haggard is a semitrue story about the life of ryan dunn and his buddies falcone and vallobr br dunn has been dumped by his girlfriend of 2 years glauren who is now seeing a beer swilling long haired metal head named hellboy and this is driving dunn insane with jealousybr br in a desperate attempt to find out the truth about what is going on between glauren and hellboy dunn pays his friends vallo and falcone to break into her house and produce evidence of the affair with somewhat disastrous results for all concerned i found this movie very funny maybe partly because i am a total jackass and cky fan and it has to be said that a lot of the humour will probably be lost on those that do not have prior knowledge of margera insane brand of comedybr br the movie contains much that will be of interest to skaters not least the cameo appearance of skateboarding legend tony hawk as a police officer there are also cameos from bucky lasek brandon novak jason ellis and bams long suffering parents april and philbr br the dvd extras include music videos from cky featuring bams brother jess on drums and bams favourite band him bams character in the movie takes his name from him frontman ville vallo there is also a documentary and a too hot for jackass skitbr br in summary as i said before this movie will mainly be of interest to skaters and jackasscky fans but i do feel that margera and co have made a great effort with haggard and i for one thoroughly enjoyed it
