i loved this movie and i watch it everyday i think that although the acting isnt all that great its really just a bunch of guys having fun with a script i had been looking all over for this movie for almost a year and when i found it for thirty dollars i just had to get it it is now by far my favorite movie of all time it deals with relationship failure and at the same time making a joke of it i loved all the parts with don vito especially the one where valo asks him for a grape when theyre sitting on the porch and he tells him to eat the one rolling down the porch it really portrays him as he really is the part in the making of really touched me when they adressed brandon novaks addiction to heroin and how much his friends and family were trying to help him a new movie thats in the making called dreamseller is in production which is about the story of novaks dreams shattered by his addiction
