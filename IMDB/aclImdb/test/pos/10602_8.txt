when i first heard of this movie i was mildly interested the plot seemed like an opportunity for hilarity and bam margera as an actor and director seemed like something that might be good when i found out the movie starred ryan dunn i was even further interested i was a fan of homewrecker when it was on yeah im that lame however i didnt have much faith in it being to good when i sat down to watch it i was afraid i was wasting my timebr br but even just five minutes it it became apparent that id been wrongbr br i thought that the comedy of this film was delightfully idiotic and definitely not suited for all kinds of people the acting was rather good much better than my expectations i thought that it was rather easy to relate to ryans character which gave the movie a center that was believable this is key in a movie as outrageous as this and is probably why i was not a fan of boratbr br the movie is not suitable at all for younger people duh and will definitely create more than its fair share of awkward turtles if watched with parents but its a good one for you and your buddies on a movie night
