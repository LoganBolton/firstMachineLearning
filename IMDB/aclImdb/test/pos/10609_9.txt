i had no expectations never saw previews for marigold and enjoyed the characters contemporary music and sharp dancing in this lighthearted movie even though 98 of the dialog is english great thing for me i wish the dvd had subtitles to help with some of the quick moments when the characters accent can be difficult to understand i wouldnt judge this movie against bollywood films but just on its own merits as fun entertainment a musical people moviebr br im hooked on ali larter as an actress and her interviews in the bonus material indicate she is a nice person i have since watched this movie several times gets better each time
