marigold is by far the best outsiders take on bollywood i have ever seen i didnt grow up with bollywood but ive seen a few hundred of them now id say it leaves gurinder chadha mira nair and even merchant and ivory of bombay talkie almost in the dust willard carroll the director really loves bollywood and he has the selfconfidence to allow us to know it  theres humor but no arch ironic distancing no of course i dont really mean this stuff as jerry lee lewis would say he gets it and so he can let us have it too  the joy of a bollywood movie experience along with touches that are supplied by a westerners stepping into the storytellers rolebr br its a story about a caustic bitchy beautiful american b movie actress shes only been in movies with numbers in their titles like fatal attraction 3 who finds herself in a different bollywood movie from the one she went to india to be in kama sutra 3 has folded its tents while she was en route apparently because its producers are now in jail salman khan in real life a bollywood megamega star is the dancing master of the delightful writtenonthefly movie she has now been pulled into is this before or after i go blind and through the sweetness of his mildly psychically gifted character she learns more than how to find her inner ecstatic dancing abilitybr br the strong beginning gives you both bollywood  a superenergetic troupe of dancers in front of the taj mahal both funny an familiar to the western viewer as well as providing the highvelocity musical thrill we love in a hindi movie and salman on screen from the outset  no bollywood 20 minute wait for the hero he has on an indian costume embellished with kit carsonstyle western movie fringe all in whitebr br ali larters actress character is pleasing to the western viewer  shes blonde which is traditional for a white person in a bollywood movie and visually understandable casting  but shes a robust girl not the ethereal kind of blondie were usually presented with and shes a more or less threedimensional total bitch carrying on profane and abusive cellphone conversations with a boyfriend and agent in the usbr br we also have scenes of women who are having problems with each other going out to a bar to deal with them  the capacity for people not getting along to relate and have emotional conversations is traditional in hindi movies but we seldom see much of any such thing going on between women other than the discussion between mother and daughter about the daughters choice of groom let alone strangers  unrelated people  let alone bargoing so the spirit is the same the details are fresh and i was completely delighted by thisbr br i only saw it once at a preview showing attended by the director a fine speaker and questionanswerer  he and salman got to be brotherlike good friends over the making of it he loves india he has plans to make a wizard of oz movie in india i cant get too detailed about songs when ive seen them just once except to say i liked them all they range from a happy parody of the bollywood number in the moviewithinthemovie  the ladies costumes with leghorn hats and seashellcased bodices its a beach scene on flowy dresses  are worth the cost of a ticket alone  to a lovely reflective manyscened romantic song in a sadder and more serious part of the moviebr br mix of hindi and english in the music and it worksbr br salman khan gets a lot of credit from me for openness to unusual projects  this and jaanemann  and good judgment about which ones to be in carroll said he was full of suggestions and ideas all along the way and totally fine ie not narcissistic at all whether carroll accepted or rejected them  clearly just a pro who loves being involved and collaborating
