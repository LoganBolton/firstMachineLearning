i saw this film over 20 years ago and still remember how much i loved it it really touched me and i thoroughly enjoyed noel cowards work in it highly recommended atmospheric and touchingbr br i think of this film from time to time and am disappointed it hasnt enjoyed as much of a revival as many classic films hadnt realized til i searched for it today that it won an academy award for best original story for ben hecht and charles macarthurbr br basically it involves a nasty character who destroys anothers career and is cursed because of it he dies but is allowed redemption if he can convince someone to shed a tear over him the bulk of the movies shows him in pursuit of this goal well written and lovely i had known him for his plays so i was surprised to see him in this role on tv late one night in new york a must see if you ever have the opportunity
