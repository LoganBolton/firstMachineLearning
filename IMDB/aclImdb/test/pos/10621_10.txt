yes i felt like i had been gutted after first seeing it but not until the next day did i begin to see the true brilliance of this creation i wont repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film but there is one new area i want to touch on spoilers why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the students pocket most reviewers have noted that it only reflected her cruelty and reaction to an unsatisfactory performance i must disagree watch the scene again huppert is moved to tears as she watches her student playing on stage the student is quite an expressive girl crying  vocalizing her fears just the opposite of hupperts character there is a scene later in the film after the girl is injured when huppert discusses the accident with the girls mother the mother visibly upset states we gave up everything so she could study piano and huppert immediately snaps you mean she gave up everything dont youbr br so it was my thought that huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny she didnt want the girl to end up like her repressed  hardened condemned to a life of recitalsgradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection maybe she saw herself on the stage years ago before things grew bad maybe she wished she had escaped when she was that age is she ruining the students life or simply freeing herbr br for me that realization made all the difference in what i experienced through this film brilliant
