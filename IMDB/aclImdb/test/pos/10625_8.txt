overall i found this film good exceptional acting with disturbing scenes some essential some useless and weak second half contains spoilers the film is divided in 2 parts i thought the first half of the pianist was terrific we meet erika kohut wonderful isabelle huppert a piano teacher and get introduced to her world she is single struggling to find her space against an overprotective and borderline tyrannic mother we understand that she has lost or has seldom experienced love as a physicalemotional chemistry she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people releases her sexual tensions in sexshops as a voyeur or in sadistic selfmutilations  this first half is very clinical and builds an incredible tension in the film almost unbearablebr br then comes walter a young handsome and outgoing man played superbly by benoit magimel though he gets to feel erikas coldness in the beginning he seduces her and slowly wreaks erikas fortress he loves her deeply but she needs him to fulfil her sadistic desires then when she is about to fall for him he is disgusted by her world and in the end we discover that erika is unable to love or feel at all especially since walter is portrayed as someone impossible not to love this is the second half of the film very touching as we see erikas inabilityinexperience to love lead her to selfdestruction this second half seemed less mastered by haneke and sometimes had noncredible ie too shocking scenes which paradoxically lessened the dramabr br of course this is a crude film at least in the french version you see porn sequences from the sex shop daring mutilation and sex scenes the much talkedabout fellatio scene between magimel and huppert was quite good i thought and is central to understand erikas sick relation to love as to the actors huppert is marvelous all through the film magimel gets better and better up to perfection and girardot the mother is excellentbr br
