at the end of my review of cache i wrote that i was intrigued with haneke as a film maker this is what led me to get the dvd for la pianiste which i just finished watching about a half hour agobr br its all been expressed here at imdb and in many of the external reviews  the gruesomely twisted pathology that would create an individual like hupperts erika who is still trying after years and years to please her mother at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life beginning with her self shes repressed everything that would free her from her selfimposed bondage including of course her sexuality which has literally imploded to the point of madness to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel likebr br this is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult i think this subject relates to all of us  were all striving for autonomy but there are needs so many conflicting needs most of which are not even on the conscious level it also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what one fantasizes about sexually and the reality of those fantasies as well as the consequences of choosing to share ones sexual fantasies with another human being hupperts character gets what she asks for in the course of the film and it is hardly the emancipating experience she had imagined it to be br br regarding the muchdiscussed scene in the bathroom i really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge for the viewer i mean sucked out of it because of the prior scene where she put the glass in the girls pocket by the time shes acting out her letsseeifthisguyisworthy scenario in the bathroom weve already found out that shes dangerously disturbed and so its not a turn on her little domination session with our poor unsuspecting dupebr br i think another incredible achievement of this movie is how about halfway through it i completely forgot that it was not in english and that i was reading subtitles that has never happened before in any foreign movie and ive seen quite a few br br in this film like cache the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow but unlike cache we do at least get some sense of finality despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether hupperts character is alive or dead after experiencing la pianiste when it comes to michael haneke i am needless to say more than a trifle intrigued
