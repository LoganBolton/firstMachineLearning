as with all haneke films make your own decisiondont be swayed by what you read and if you are interested in someone using the medium of film for their own unique ends see it yourself isabelle huppert is stunning in this filmcombined with haneke these two never pull their punches haneke reels us in with the lure of golden boy benoit magimel but this is an antiromance as much as funny games was an antithriller youll have to force yourself to watch much of it and the catharsis is much more in the range of sustained anxiety than any kind of emotional release but its incredibly nervy and thought provoking haneke continues to hold up a mirror to how desensitised western civilization is or has become people may turn their noses up at this but its only taking what solondz did in happiness a few steps further while grounded in reality much of what erika huppert does can be viewed as emotional metaphor im not recommending it but i wouldnt dissuade you eitherit definitely divides people but given its largely about repressionthats no surprise
