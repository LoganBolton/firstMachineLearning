isabelle huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation la pianiste truly confirms it as if that wasnt enough annie girardot plays her mother and annie girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation so as you may well imagine those pieces of casting are worth the horror were put through isabelle and annie play characters weve never seen before on the screen a mother and daughter yes but with such virulent fearlessness that sometimes i was unable even to blink or to breath personally i dont believe in the directors intentions i dont believe they the intentions that is go beyond the shocking anecdote and the ending made me scream with frustration but i was riveted by the story written in the face of the sensational huppert and the fierceness of girardots strength i highly recommend it to cinema lovers anywhere and to the collectors of great performances like me you cant afford to miss la pianiste
