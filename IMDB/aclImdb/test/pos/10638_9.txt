if you think piano teacher erika kohut isabelle huppert in michael hanekes film la pianiste is the ultimate degree in the personification of derangement perversion and darkness ive got news for you the piano teacher in elfriede jellineks novel la pianiste on which the film was based is twice as repulsive disgusting deranged and even more fascinating  though there cant be words enough to translate the level of artistic proficiency that isabelle huppert has reached here above all other mortal actresses in activity today and who else could have played this character with such emotional power complete with the best piano playingdubbing an actor could deliverbr br in the novel as in the film there are two big antagonists to the heroine kohut her own mother wonderful wreckvoiced annie girardot in a part originally intended for jeanne moreau and austria itself the mother personifies jellineks perception of her native austria as a country that deceptively and perversely encourages racistfascist or at least authoritarian behavior sexual and emotional repression and lets say Ã¼bermensch ideals which are impossible to keep today without the danger of a mental breakdownbr br la pianiste also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue how dangerous it is to reveal your innermost fantasies to the one you think you love we tend to think our own sexual fantasies must be as exciting to others as they are to ourselves which may turn out to be a huge embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake here kohut learns  the lesson in the most painful and humiliating of waysbr br it must be mentioned that elfriede jellinek is one of the bestknown and praised authors in austria and europe well now shes got a nobel prize and that autobiographical passages can be inferred in her novel as she herself was a pianist and had a reportedly difficult relationship with her mother the novel also includes long passages about kohuts childhood and adolescence so you kind of understand how she turned into who she is now haneke chose to hide this information in the film forcing us to wonder how she got to be that way dont we all know a erika kohut out there but he very much preserves the fabric of the book in his film unbearable honesty to the point where most secretive horrendous feelings painfully emerge  envy cruelty violence jealousy hate misery sadism masochism selfishness perversion etc all of them unmistakably humanbr br i thought la pianiste was a deeply moving film very disturbing and thoughtprovoking with a handful of unforgettable scenes and thats just all i ask of movies it also made me buy and be thrilled by the book discover a fantastic author i hadnt read before and listen again and again to schubert  so my thanks to haneke jellinek and isabelle on the other hand if youre looking for light entertainment please stay away my vote 9 out of 10
