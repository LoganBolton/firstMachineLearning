some users are confused about the identity of the armed men walking down the steps in the odessa staircase sequence these men are not cossacks but regular army troopsbr br the cossacks arrive at the scene a little later and they are the men on horses slashing at the crowd with their sabersbr br to experts on russian history correct me on this if im wrongbr br but there are a couple of lines in the movie that apparently no one has commented on after the takeover of the potemkin someone in the crowd on shore says kill the jews this is on screen for only a couple of seconds but it is therebr br how cruelly typical of history not just in russia but in so many other countries to immediately unthinkingly and instinctively blame jews for any domestic troublebr br perhaps other parts of the movie are not historically factual but the outcry against the jews is all too real comments anyonebr br also why cant speakers of english learn to pronounce the name as potyomkin instead of as potemkin theres a need in russian to distinguish the two possible pronunciations of e as either ye or as yo sometimes two dots are used to distinguish these two pronunciations but usually the difference simply has to be memorized
