this is one of the best films ive seen from the silent era sad to say ive yet to see too many with the exception of chaplinkeaton stuff very visually brilliant with insanely influential style in editing and composition really unique especially for its time camera angles and extremely hectic editing definitely a must see for the film nerdbr br the downside is that it is a bit too in your face about its politics i have no problem with politics in film as long as they are subtle or at least somewhat ignorable as a backseat to the story also its not an entertainment film which is fine but its not something im going to watch a billion times this is art plain and simple like it or notbr br worth an a for influence alone but based on personal enjoyment i give it an a
