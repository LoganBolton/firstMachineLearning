have wanted to see this for a while i never thought id be watching it in a damp trafalgar square london with 15000 other people and all to a new score by the pet shop boysbr br quickly that experience specifically a new departure from psb it seemed to suffer from the same problem the miniaturist hugo wolf had when he wrote his opera der corregidor the long structure was a chain of short ones ie songs psb produced a more fluid integrated score although it was quite static on its own terms neither could they resist song a setting of the subtitled text worked in this respect a free standing meditation on the action of the odessa steps massacre during the action of that sequence itself was id go so far to say counterproductive overall it was very exciting though which is surely what eisenstein was trying to achievebr br it is a very exciting film with choppier editing taking the place of acceleration of tension or action in fact the film though beautifully shot and passionately acted it has a silent film melodrama but not in the excess of the hollywood comic style breathes through its careful editing pacing specific shots with a sense of the rate at which the audience will take them in and theres a huge range of perspective too either he had a lot of cameras or the sequences on the harbor and steps took a great deal of timebr br super film which can be assessed irrespective of sound as thats how the finished product would have been conceived 810
