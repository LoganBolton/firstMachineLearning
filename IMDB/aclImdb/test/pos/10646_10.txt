may contain spoilers but of course it does not matter  br br battleship potemkin is one stunning spectacle of haunting images the visual direction is well and has been inspiring the sheer scale of the film is impressive and the technique is certainly pioneering what is really amazing is to my mind the depth and effectiveness of a film devoid of proper literary script sound save the soundtrack decent image quality the fauxprofound selfreferentialism of today exceptional acting pretense etc what you get is a purely visual experience to be rememberedbr br btw the previous poster noted eisenstien felt after a lot of suffering to give the heroes what they wanted the problem is that you think eisenstein is building up to a big final fight and then he tricks you its a little cheap i wouldve rather seen a huge final action scenebr br i must warn you that the end is not cheap and eisenstein wasnt being generous to the heroes history however was potemkin really did go through the squadron as it was shown in the filmbr br finally id strongly recommend seeing battleship potemkin to anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema see it with a fellow movie buff it kept me talking for hours however if you tend to consider films generally accepted as great or classic to be slow or boring this film might not be for you yet not much cheap entertainment herebr br for me though it is a full 1010
