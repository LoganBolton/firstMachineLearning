it was surprising that a silent film could be so easy to watch the economy with which it has been edited and the films structure itself are the main elements that contribute to thisbr br the film really captures the spirit of the revolution that it is dealing with  you really sympathise with the sailors and citizens of course this film has its own agenda but as it is a practically redundant cause it can be viewed as a piece of entertainment in a much clearer sensebr br the tension created on the screen is excellent  starting with the battleship itself and then moving onto the mainland things escalate believably and for a film of its era it really is quite unflinching in revealing the sacrifices made by the characters in the filmbr br this really is worth sitting through that is if you can adjust your modern viewing habits for 90mins
