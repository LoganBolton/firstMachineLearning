sergei eisensteins most famous movie has truly withstood the test of time the story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 does have the feeling of soviet propaganda but does a good job showing the conditions that led to the revolt the scene on the odessa steps should remain seared into anyones mindbr br okay so the battleship potemkin wasnt actually the first movie to use montage but they did a great job with it here certainly any film history class should show this movie its a great historical drama although i will admit that i dont know how accurate it is a 1010br br oh and we should have learned by now that potemkin should be transliterated as potyomkin
