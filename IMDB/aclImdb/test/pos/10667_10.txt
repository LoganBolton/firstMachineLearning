if youre a film student or were one or are thinking of becoming one the name battleship potemkin has or will have a resonance sergei eistenstein like other silentfilm pioneers like griffith although eisensteins innovations are not as commonplace as griffiths and murnau has had such an impact on the history of cinema its of course taken for granted the reason i bring up the film student part is because at some point whether youd like it or not your film professor 9 times out of 10 will show the odessa stairs sequence of this film its hard to say if its even the best part of the films several sequences dealing with the at the time current times of the russian revolution but it does leave the most impact and it can be seen in many films showcasing suspense or just plain montage the untouchables climax comes to mindbr br montage which was not just eistensteins knack but also his lifes blood early in his career is often misused in the present cinema or if not misused then in an improper context for the story sometimes montage is used now as just another device to get from point a to point b montage was something else for eisenstein he was trying to communicate in the most direct way that he could the urgency the passions and the ultimate tragedies that were in the russian people at the time and place even if one doesnt see all of eisensteins narrative or traditional story ideas to have much grounding kubrick has said this one cant deny the power of seeing the ships arriving at the harbor the people on the stairs and the soldiers coming at them every which way with guns some may find it hard to believe this was done in the 20s it has that power like the passion of joan of arc to overpass its time and remain in importance if only in terms of technique and emotionbr br of course one could go on for books which have been written hundreds of times over not the least of which by eisenstein himself on the film in and of itself battleship potemkin is really more like a dramatized newsreel than a specific story in a movie the first segment is also one of the great sequences in film as a mutiny is plotted against the captain and other headups of a certain ship this is detailed almost in a manipulative way but somehow extremely effective montage is used here as well but in spurts of energy that capture the eye other times eisenstein is more content to just let the images speak for themselves as the soldiers grow weary without food and water he isnt one of those directors who will try to get all sides to the story he is of course very much early 20th century russian but he is nothing else but honest with how he sees his themes and style and that is what wins over in the endbr br some may want to check it outside of filmschool as the stairs sequence is like one of those landmarks of severe tragedy on film displaying the ugly side of revolution eisenstein may not be one of the more accessible silentfilm directors but if montage detail in the frame nonactors and bolshevik themes are your cup of tea its truly one of the must sees of a lifetime
