this movie is a geman undiscovered gerry anderson classicbr br the origins of both ufo and space 1999 are obvious from this movie including the cast list which includes the late ed bishop and george sewell who both went onto ufobr br it is unfortunate that anderson despite his many tv successes did not get a chance to develop his talent on the big screen just think what he could have done with the movie version of thunderbirds which he quite rightly disowned himself frombr br im sure if you give jttfsotsdoppleganger a fair chance youll appreciate its good qualities
