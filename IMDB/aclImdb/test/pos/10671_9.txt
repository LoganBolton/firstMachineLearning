im a huge space buff and at nearly 44 ive just discovered this flick for the first time i came at it in a roundabout way from space 1999 then ufo i went hunting for other anderson creations and found this was their first liveaction work what a home run i actually heard about this movie many years ago but never knew what it was called so im happy to have found it by accidentbr br these andersons were nothing short of amazing in their writing the execution of the completely believable and realisticlooking models the quality of acting etcbr br i dont think it looks dated at all let me tell you ill take good old models over the fakelooking cgi crap of today any time seriously most of the rocket scenes looked pretty real they had it down to a science if you choose to think of what you are looking at as real it isnt hard to actually believe itbr br also the amount of detail in set designs the beautiful photography the whole look man i wish i could go back to that time they knew how to make great movies in the 60s personally ive lost all interest in hollywood movies today anybody with a budget can do cgi i hate it bring back the models think of all the people that style employed anyway i am ranting  if you like good scifi thats very welldone you will do yourself a service by watching this
