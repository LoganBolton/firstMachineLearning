journey to the far side of the sun aka doppelganger is an entertaining twilight zonestyle scifi offering from gerry and sylvia anderson the team behind space 1999 ufo thunderbirds fireball xl5 and others in the film roy thinnes of the invaders tv show and ian hendry star as astronauts sent on a flight to a planet which shares an exact orbit of the earth but on the opposite side of the sun hence previously hidden from view a pushy european space flight director overacted by the late patrick wymark gets the flight fasttracked and after rigorous training  the astronauts are good to go thus begins the best sequences in the film the launch flight and landing on the other earth dazzling rocket miniature work by derek meddings and a dreamlike elegant spaceflight somewhat reminiscent of the best moments of 2001 a space odyssey are easy highlights of the movie the landing on the doppelganger earth is both exciting and eerie after this the twilight zone aspect of the film kicks in with a plot lifted almost whole from the classic tz episode the parallel that aside the film is still solid scifi with some intriguing mirrorworld stuff to chew on backwards writing and lefthanded handshakes for example less successful are the scenes depicting a mid21st century earth where all the men wear turtlenecks and nehru jackets and all the women wear miniskirts some of the relationships with women in the film are very nonpc by todays standards as well and in the most consistent failing of most 20th century scifi the computers telephones and other hardware are all big colorful and clunky right out of patrick mcgoohans the prisoner no one foresaw the digital microprocessor age if one can accept these failings in foresight the movie is very interesting with a solid lead performance by thinnes as the troubled astronaut and with a nice 1960searly 70s style nihilistic ending for fans of retro scifi like myself this is a journey worth taking
