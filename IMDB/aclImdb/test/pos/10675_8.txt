doppleganger  or journey to the far side of the sun as it is more commonly known  was written  with input by the late donald james  and produced by gerry and sylvia anderson best known for their supermarionation television shows such as thunderbirdsbr br the international space agency eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun and proposes a manned flight be sent there the committee balk at the exhorbitant cost and shelve the project but when a security leak at the agency is discovered fearing that the russians might get there first the project gets the green lightbr br american astronaut glenn ross  roy thinnes  is teamed with british scientist john kane  ian hendry  after weeks of gruelling training the phoenix blasts off heading for the unknownbr br three weeks later their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak mountainous landscape ross survives but kane is badly injured a light is seen moving towards thembr br i will leave the synopsis here until this point the film has been gripping with excellent special effects  by derek meddings  and music by andersons resident composer barry gray  why it has not been issued on cd is a mystery  but when ross and kane crash land and we discover the secret of the alien world  it is a duplicate of our own everyone on it is the same the only major difference is that things are reversed  it becomes less interesting and ends with a shattering anticlimax i think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea in fact gerry  sylvia later did something similar on their space 1999 show ross risks  and ultimately loses  his life in an effort to return to earth  his earth but why the new earth is so similar he might as well not have botheredbr br roy thinnes had recently done the invaders television series and gives a competent performance  pity there werent more scenes like the one where he rows with his wife  ian hendry is good as kane but vanishes from the story too soon several actors went on to appear in the andersons ufo such as ed bishop and george sewell blink and you will miss nicholas courtney  the brigadier from drwho in a tiny role  but the acting honours go to the late patrick wymark as jason webb head of eurosec the character is not far removed from sir john wilder the one he played in atvs the power game webb is such a devious character he is marvellous to watch herbert loms contribution  as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye  amounts to little more than a cameobr br like i said the special effects are marvellous as are the sets so the film is worth watching but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet with a stronger script this could have been another planet of the apes or  dare i say it  2001 a space odysseybr br in andersons productions he made the future seem like a great place an adventure playground where science was cool everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically sexy women and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world we are in the future now and people are still watching coronation street every other night how disappointing if a mirror earth really exists somewhere one hopes that is a better place than this one if all the women there look like lynn loring or loni von friedl i will be on the next flight
