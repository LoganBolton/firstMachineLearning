journey to the far side of the sun is about the discovery of a planet on the other side of the sun which shares the same orbit as earth and therefore has been undiscovered until a space probe on the far side of the sun photographs it of course two astronauts roy thinnes  ian hendry are sent to explore it but due to a malfunction they crash  find themselves back on earth only 3 weeks into their six week journey of course theyre berated at least thinnes is hendry is gravely injured and grilled and asked why they turned back on their mission but its claimed that they didnt until thinnes seems to notice a few very odd things about being back home this is excellent if somewhat talky at times and the sets and feel arent a far cry from thunderbirds territory but will live actors for once its no big star wars type production but more quiet science fiction that one has to think about a bit well worth seeing and its criminal that the dvd is out of print 8 out of 10
