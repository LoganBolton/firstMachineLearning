i had never seen this movie before it aired on a local cable scifi network it reminded me of the irwin allen tv series of the late 60s time tunnel etc excellent effects they beat star trek 5 done 20 years later but then that wasnt very hard to accomplishbr br i found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production they would have needed a few touch ups to tie some loose ends on the characters level but for a kid movie its surprisingly interesting especially the the glimpse at futuristic euro politics surprisingly similar to todays european unionbr br the plot is indeed reminiscent of twilight zone in general as other users have pointed but in this case its a complimentbr br great sets by the waybr br 710
