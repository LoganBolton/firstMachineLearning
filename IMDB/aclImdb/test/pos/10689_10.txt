this movie is surprisingly good the ninja fighting sequences were unbelievable i havent see all sho kosugis films but this is probably the best of those ive seen probably the most impressive fighting sequence was at the beginning when ninja killed about 20 people that was one of the most impressive ninja fighting sequences ive ever seen another good fighting sequence was at a cops funeral where the ninja provide more people to bury the last fight was also very impressive also i kinda liked the soundtrack of this movie the story was good enough for a ninjamovie actually it was kinda different from other ninjamovies so if you are a fan of ninjamovies youll probably like this one
