im surprised with the questions and issues this documentary has brought up in the reviews here specially because theyre indeed interesting questions surely the ones who could best address it would be the makers of the film themselves nevertheless i think i can shed some light upon something that i think has been overlooked which is in my opinion the purpose of the film what it is about and what its trying to convey whats its message after all at the risk of pointing out the very obvious ill start saying the filmmakers have an intention theyre trying to tell a story extract meaning out of it and get a point across with this in mind we can shoot down many of the criticized points particularly the ones involving what people expected in contrast with what the filmmakers were really trying to show causes and consequences of violence the film is not about that its not enlightening nonbrazilian audiences about the brazilian favelas issue well who wanted to do that is afroreggae this or that and supported by whom it doesnt matter in this context not enough women in the film for your tastes its not about equality or the feminist cause every little detail about andersons life mother son family and all the aspects and the workings of the afroreggae movement well dont be so picky because it doesnt matter theres just so much length a story can have before it cant become a film anymore if the authors were to show everything everyone is expecting theyd have to make a 6 months tv series instead if you are expecting all that you approach the film the wrong waybr br the film is actually about two individuals who started a movement two individuals full of ideals two individuals who thirst for change two individuals trying to do something about all the wrongdoing going around them individuals who went rock bottom and wanted to get up again its all about finding purpose in life drawing inspiration from misery changing the destiny and becoming something else than what they were destined to be  criminals and drug dealers for that matter its about achievement and hope and not about the cruel reality of violence in rio de janeiro though its an integral part of the film given thats what the characters are constantly surrounded by unexpectedly and not without a reason the film ends up centered much more on andersons course through difficulties in life this is because they were faced with andersons accident while they were shooting the film im not sure about this but they may have even seriously considered ending the filming right there leaving behind all effort spent but anderson wanted to keep going and so they did risking to lose in having a film with a bit of an identity crisis considering the sudden change of course but gaining in showing someone overcoming such a devastating happening its very evident for who watches it that the film begins about afroreggae and winds up about anderson its very unique in this sense the shift of the story line maybe their only sin is not making it evident upfront which may initially rise expectations that will go unfulfilledbr br as for the importance or ordinariness of anderson id say not everybody wants to change the whole world end all violence feed all the hungry be like mahatma ghandi be as known as mother teresa or whoever other known personalities there are its much easier to relate to and draw inspiration from someone who is such as everybody else in fact trying to transform his or her own harsh life raising problematic kids coping with permanent injuries or diseases and even managing to pay the bills by the end of the month to understand the movie you have to see thats about leaving behind a past of involvement with drugs and crime making up for it and trying to persuade others not to go down the same troublesome path though you can criticize if the way they chose to do it is effective and doubt the ideology of the method you cannot deny their intentionsbr br also the perception that anderson is special or a chosen one may have partially something to do with the fact that the filmmakers became very involved in the lives of the characters they were depicting as much as becoming friends with them theres no way it wouldnt tint the whole movie with a more favorable light over anderson if a dear friend becomes paralyzed in an accident its not just a fact you make a big deal out of it and this is not necessarily bad its not much that they treat him like a chosen one as much as they go to great lengths trying to show him as a seed for transformation and source of inspirationbr br in conclusion dont watch this documentary for the scenes of the reality of poverty and crime it contains watch it for what it is much more an inspirational storybr br nikeadlike seems just damn good and professionally made to me and doesnt affect or detract from the intentions of the film romanticized speculate on its credential as a documentary if you will but why not when its supposed to cause reaction and inspire isnt trying to better peoples lives through music and dance  the essence of what the subjects are trying to do  romanticizing the very own reality pardon me but showing just the plain facts is what reporters do and you can watch it on tv every nightbr br if i wanted to become a filmmaker i wish my first film would also be this great
