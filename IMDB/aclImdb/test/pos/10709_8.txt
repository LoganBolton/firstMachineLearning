favela rising is a documentary about the slums of rio the favelas specifically the most violent one vigário geral according to this film a lot more kids have died violently in rios favelas over the last decade or so than in israelpalestine during the same period  a fact astonishing if true which shows how underrecognized this social problem is in the rest of the world this is an important topic especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to marshal the neediest and most at risk through a vibrant cultural program this is a compelling documentary if occasionally marred by a somewhat too personalitybased version of events and by grainy digital video and film that sometimes may make you think you need to have your eyes examinedbr br drug lords rule in the favelas and guntoting teenage boys are the main drug dealers like in parts of colombia fernando meirelles movie city of godcidade de deus has been accused of celebrating violence cidade de deus is another of rios many favelas but the early section of favela rising shows that in fact favela boys do celebrate violence and want to deal drugs where the money and the action are its cool to carry a gun there cool to work as a drug trafficker its fifty times more profitable than the earnings available by other meansbr br mochary first discovered the afroreggae movement and its leaders anderson sá and josé junior while visiting rio for a conference and quickly persuaded his friend and mentor zimbalist to quit his job and come down to help make a film with his own promise to fund it sás eloquence and charisma and a startling twist in his life make him the center of the film and its chief narrator but like the favelas themselves the film teems with other people no doubt about the fact that sá is a remarkable leader organizer and artistbr br vigário geral is compared to bosnia shooting there was very dangerous anderson sás friendship and protection and caution and diplomacy in the shooting enabled the filmmakers to gain access and shoot detailed footage of their subject matters while mostly there were close calls avoiding any serious confrontations with drug lords or drugdealing cops they also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on trips home that resulted in 10 of the footage including rare shots of violent incidents including police beatings its hard for an outsider to keep track of police massacres in rio there was one in the early 1990s that looms over the story and inspired sá who ended his own early involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement the cops are all over the drug trade and if anybody doesnt like that the ill trained police paramilitaries come in often wearing black ski masks and shoot up a neighborhood killing a lot of innocentsbr br this is pretty much the picture we get in meirelles city of god except that this time sá junior and the other guys come in starting in vigário geral but spreading out eventually to a number of other favelas to give percussion classes that attract dozens of youth  girls as well as boys their afroreggae grupo cultural afroreggae or gcar program formed in 1993 is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the rio ghettos it leads them to leave behind smoking alcohol and drugs thats the rule to explode into rap song percussion and gymnastics in expressive galvanic performances eventually the best of the performers led by sá wind up appearing before big local audiences with local producers and their banda afroreggae has an international recording contractbr br other centers and groups have been created by or through the gcar over the years in vigário geral and other favelas to seek the betterment of youth by providing training and staging performances of music capoeira theater hiphop and dance at gcar centersbr br the performance arts arent everything just the focal point gcar is also a movement for broader social change gathering public awareness through such performances the centers also provide training in information newspaper radio internet email links hygiene and sex education to seek to bridge gaps between rich and poor black and white and to offer workshops in audiovisual work including production of documentaries the program is currently active in four other favelasbr br there are many scenes of favela street and home life in favela rising and they look very much like the images in city of god with the important difference that the focus and outcome are very very much more positive not that it isnt an uphill battle and the corruption of the police the inequities of the social system and the indifference of the general population of brazil are not directly addressed by any of this but theres a scene where sá talks to some young kids in another favela cynical boys not enthusiastic about afroreggae and determined to work in the drug trade as sá himself did as a boy sá doesnt seem to be convincing any of them despite pointing out that traffickers dont make it to the age of fifty but we learn that the most negative boy in this group richard morales joined the movement five months later theres also the account of a freak accident that disabled sá but with a positive outcomebr br it would be great if the images were sharper and clearer and if the story were edited down a little but this is vibrant inspiring material and represents committed risktaking documentary filmmaking and its nice that favela rising has been included in seven film festivals and won a number of awards including best new documentary filmmaker at the tribeca film festival its currently being shown at the institute of contemporary arts ica in london however a wide art house audience in the us seems somewhat unlikelybr br included in the sfiff 2006
