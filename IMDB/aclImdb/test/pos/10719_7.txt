i have seen this film on 3 different occasionson the first occasioni was bowled over by this filmit appeared as a very kind film to mei hated this film as a sentimental garbage on my second viewinghowever my third viewing reasserted my belief that it is a good filmthere is a lot of emotional power in this film especially scenes of emotional confrontation between mr kramer and madam kramerthere are some scenes in which meryl streep appears a cruel person despite the fact that she is a beauty in real lifedustin hoffman appears as a lost hero unable to grapple with the recent task of his childs custodythere was even a controversy on the sets of this filmaccording to the master cameraman nestor almendros there was a shot in which he just escaped getting hurt as the character of mrkramerin order to show the intensity of his angerdecides to break a glass hardluckily nothing happened to nestorkramer versus kramer shows the destruction of a family structureit also tells how family must be maintained if there are kids involved
