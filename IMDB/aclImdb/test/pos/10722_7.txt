ever since midnight cowboy i have been on the lookout for films with dustin hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed ever since kramer vs kramer i have been on the lookout for films with meryl streep and have mostly not been disappointed she gave a superb performance really one of her best in sophies decision and i lapped her up in out of africa that these two actors came together over 20 years ago for kramer vs kramer was definitely a very good idea the result is an excellent character drama with a theme which is still very relevant in todays societybr br on divorcing everyone has a pretty bad time though the kids seem to suffer mostbeautifully handled by robert benton in some original directing presenting some memorable scenes even the passageway takes on character and should be included in the cast and as for the breakfast scene with billy justin henry just simply magnificent just how do you get an eightyearold to act benton managed it and of course with hoffman there seemed to be good electricity the result is certainly engaging endearing and convincing justin henrys performance must rank among the best 5 or 6 kids performances of all time the best thing once again was the naturalness there was no going over the top so frequent these daysbr br this film came up again on the small screen the other night though i have had it in my video collection for years it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything around 7½ out of 10
