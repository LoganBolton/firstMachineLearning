good drama movie about a child custody case with great performances by all the actorsa good example of what an excellent script can do to propel a simple story to a much higher qualitythe screenplay was just average though and this is what kept the movie from the list of the all time best dramasstillthe great acting makes this movie a good one to see if you are a fan of court dramas or a big fan of the lead actorsthe movie really should have been a tad longer though for more excellence but that would really be nitpicking
