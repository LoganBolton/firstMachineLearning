no this has nothing to do with the sitcom seinfeld or its eccentric and hilarious character cosmo kramer in reality kramer vs kramer is a fine drama movie without a doubt one of the finest of its kind and one of the greatest movies ever im glad that it won more oscars than apocalypse now because it really deserved such glorybr br kramer vs kramer is an excellent film so well made and so perfectly balanced that i wouldnt change anything about it in any way there is nothing wrong with the film its filmmaking of the highest quality and it stands the test of time too not only it doesnt look any dated but also its cultural impact is longlasting and its realistic story remains just as significant as it was when it came out in 1979 a timeless classic they dont make movies like this todaybr br this movie is dramatic realistic simple but brilliant intense powerful sweet and even tragic and depressing sometimes yet it has fine humor as well it has no special effects but who cares this is not the movie or place to discuss such thing for a movie like this such thing would be pointless and absolutely unnecessarybr br the story is very interesting the actorss chemistry is just perfect all of the actors are great but the 3 main ones are the very best dustin hoffman a brilliant actor has his greatest performance ever here as the lovable but distant workaholic ted kramer meryl streep is great as teds wife joanna and cute little justin henry is terrific as the loving but sometimes stubborn billy son of ted and joannabr br the soundtrack is all instrumental and wonderful the opening song by the guitarist frederic hand is brilliant the rest of the soundtrack is mostly antonio vivaldis classical music and is simply dazzlingbr br this motion picture has also an incredible development of the characters see the character ted kramer a workaholic who becomes an amazing father after being left with no choice but to take care of his son trying to adjust these new responsibilities with his job after being left by his wife joanna with this ted learns about the most beautiful things in life but also realizes how though life is with the problems in his job and the return of joanna who wants the custody of their son but even joanna changes for better and the ending is an unexpected surprise when one sees this for the first timebr br this movie has also some though things such as courtroom scenes where both ted and joanna face brutal character assassinations unleashed by the lawyers another though thing to see is when poor billy falls off a jungle gym with his toy a plane and gets seriously injured on his face but then again the scene is very well made and what comes next is very intense his father runs quickly and crosses numerous blocks ignoring the traffic to take his son to the hospitalbr br overall this is a movie which is a good lesson of lifebr br this should definitely be on top 250
