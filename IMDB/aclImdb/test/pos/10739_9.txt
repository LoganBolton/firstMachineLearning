kramer vs kramer is one film to hold on too and not forget it isnt one of the most popular films ever made and is certainly one of the weakest best picture films but it does not mean it still isnt important i thought the movie was well done and made you just want to watch more and more of it the performances were the best positive for the film and dustin hoffman played one of his best roles hes ever done as the lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son as his wife separates from him billy who is hoffmans son played another great performance along with meryl streep playing the depressed mother of billy kramer vs kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10 but it succeeds in making the film worth watching and worth caring about it certainly one of hoffmans best films hes ever done i highly recommend itbr br hedeens outlook 910  a
