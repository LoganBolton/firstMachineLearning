this outstanding film has about the best acting that youll ever see and that alone makes this a mustsee the entire cast is excellent but then again it had to be in order to keep up with dustin hoffman and meryl streep it didnt take me long to get hooked on this film and aside from a courtroom scene that is merely good this is topnotch entertainment this is a rare film that actually deserved all the oscar recognition that it received see it for yourself and you will definitely not be disappointed
