i honestly dont know why so many people hate this movie i have always thought that it was one of my absolute faves the fight with tiger and his men rocked the fight with the pirates with the axes rocked the whole skit with everyone trying to avoid one another in the house is pure geniousok so it didnt have the requisite kick ass final confrontation but the manchus were pretty good i give it a 810
