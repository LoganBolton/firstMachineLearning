for those of you looking for the crazy stunts that typified a harold lloyd silent comedy this is not the film for you what the catspaw gives us is an interesting and atypical character for lloyd who was trying to establish himself in soundbr br for me the closest movie comparison to lloyds character is that of peter sellers in being there for all the education that lloyd has received in dealing with the world he might as well have been brought up in isolation as sellers wasbr br but where he was brought up was as a missionarys child in china and i dont know how much christianity he and his family were able to teach the chinese but young harold has learned the wisdom of chinese philosopher lin po whom he quotes constantly like a fortune cookie aphorism as it turns out lin po turns out to be one wise dudebr br anyway lloyds father samuel s hinds has decided his son needs some education in the modern world of 20th century america and he sends him back to be the guest of the pastor of the home church which sponsors the mission the pastor there is the perennial candidate of the reform movement of that town of stockport but no sooner does lloyd arrive and the pastor diesbr br now the reform movement is a sham and the pastor a patsy of the political bosses who need a strawman opponent in every election they decide lloyd just might be a better patsy than the guy who just diedbr br of course as it goes in these type of films the patsy proves to be not so easy a proposition in fact lloyd constantly quoting from lin po the way charlie chan used to dispense wisdom proves quite the adversary for the crooks who run stockport in addition lloyd gains the admiration of una merkel as cynical a dame as jean arthur was in mr deeds and mr smith br br the catspaw is still a nice political satire though it did not establish harold lloyd as big a comedy name as he was in silent films a nice cast of players was selected by director sam taylor topped by george barbier who plays a political boss who discovers lloyd and actually proves to have a streak of honesty in him
