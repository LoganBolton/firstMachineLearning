this movie caught me by surprise for years i have avoided many of harold lloyds sound pictures as well as those of keaton because they have a generally welldeserved reputation for being lousy compared to the silent films because the basic formula has been lost however when i saw this film i was pleasantly surprised to find i actually liked itonce i accepted it really was not a harold lloyd film despite him starring in it this is because although it is nothing like the style of his earlier films it is highly original and lloyd isnt bad playing a totally different type of characterbr br as i mentioned above the formula of the old films is almost completely missing here lloyd does not do the old familiar stunt work the romance is quite unlike his early screen romances and the plot is just plain weird instead of the usual roles he is the son of a chinese missionary who returns to america for the first time since he was a small boy because of this though he looks like an american except for his white suit and explorers helmet he thinks and acts a lot like someone who is chinese in many ways hes very naive about america and is like an innocent among wolves early on he meets a man who turns out to be a local party boss this boss always produces a losing candidate for the mayoral racebecause he is bought and paid for by the corrupt mayor to produce a token candidate who has no chance of winning well the old geezer who they traditionally run for office just died and he decides to run the naive lloydhe hasnt a prayer of winning well the unthinkable happens and lloyd wins this and lloyds decision to clean up the town greatly upsets the old political machine and they stop at nothing to destroy honest lloyd just when it appears lloyd is headed to jail on a trumped up corruption charge he creates a scheme that is 100 impossible and very illegal to get signed confessions from the crooks however despite this it is incredibly funny and a great ending so my advice is at the end just suspend disbelief and enjoybr br an important note this movie is definitely not politically correct the word chink is used repeatedly i found it offensive but considering the times i ignored it as you should too if however you are someone who cant and like being angry i suggest you never watch movies anywayas you are bound to become offended again and again
