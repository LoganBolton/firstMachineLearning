br br as a harold lloyd fan i agree with the other reviewers comments except that i feel that movie crazy was his best sound film cats paw is a close second but this is just my opinionbr br this film is a hoot from beginning to end and in many scenes george barbier the crook that gets him elected mayor almost steals the show especially at the end of the filmbr br one wishes that una merkels character would be a bit more sympathetic to harold especially as the film progresses only in the last few minutes of the film do we find out her true feelings for him and even then there is no romance  kissing etcbr br this is a mustsee film
