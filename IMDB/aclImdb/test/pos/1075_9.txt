just saw this movie 2 days ago a very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine i have no special interest in wine and yet i found this very enlightening the director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people as they are while he exposes a lot of things that are below the surface he manages not to take a stand and leave that for the viewer he shows a lot of compassion to people and dogs and sympathy and let people tell their story and in the same time exposes what they dont want to tellbr br the movie shows us where our world is going to what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay it is a movie about the love of wine and the love of making it big personal and global character and formulabr br the real stars of the people for me are the older wine makers with their disillusioned look at the world and themselvesbr br it takes some time to get use to the hectic camera moves and editing but its worth itbr br highly recommended
