i attended a screening of fierce people at the 2006 woodstock film festival i hesitate to label it a premiere of any sort since it was shot in the spring of 2004 and had its world premiere at tribeca in 2005 it played several festivals that year release seemed imminent then it disappeared poof vanished or so it appeared to the filmgoing public rumors of a theatrical or dvd release have popped up now and then but all proved unfounded then this screening was announced perhaps one can call it a repremiere it certainly felt as if i was witness to a buried treasure and what a treasure it wasbr br i suppose one could characterize fierce people as a comingofage drama but it also has elements of comedy and tragedy as well as mystery and a bit of farce thrown in in short real life that makes it hard to pigeonhole which puts it more into the category of an indie as opposed to a hollywood movie but its high production values big budget feel and star caliber cast seem at odds with the indie label so lets call it a hybrid and perhaps thats why its been lost it defies categorizationbr br meet finn earl anton yelchin 15 whose father is absent in fact finn has never known him but he sees him and hears him via the collection of home movies sent from south america dad is a renowned anthropologist and has made a name for himself by setting up shop with the yanomani the tribe of fierce people who live to kill and well procreate all their activities are built around those two tasks and finn is captivated by it mom liz diane lane is also somewhat absent although present physically she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol so finn becomes an adult in his little solitary world with his reels of filmbr br one summer mom decides to drag finn along with her into the wilds of new jersey a massage therapist mom has catered to a wealthy client ogden c osborne donald sutherland in a tour de force performance and he has invited her for an extended house call at his palatial estate osbornes tribe includes an assortment of eccentric rich kids servants and village idiots among whom finn will find himself part of his own anthropological study will his experience with dads films help him survive life as a visitor to this tribe will he be accepted or will he be seen as an outsider concurrently struggling with his own identity as an adolescent such is the stuff of fairy tales and i suppose this would be if not for the dark underbelly which director griffin dunne and writer dirk wittenborn have infused into this magnificent storybr br with anton yelchins voiceover intercutting pieces of dads home movies finn must learn to go back to being the teenager he never really had a chance to be stop being the parent to his mom allow newlysober mom to be parent to him and learn responsibility on the way to adulthood the way it should have taken place all along yet he needs to make this transformation in a dangerous dark world where playing with fire is folly to this fractured familybr br this is first and foremost a storydriven film and griffin dunne emphasized as much in the intro to the film he bought the rights to wittenborns novel even as it was being written and wittenborns own screenplay comes to life in the hands of the masterful dunne in a way thats a work of wonderbr br this is also largely a characterdriven film and sutherland has never been better his star turn as osborne stunned those around me and will likely leave you amazed as well diane lanes character ultimately exhibits so many personalities that its hard to imagine another actor pulling it off so well she is breathtaking but more than anything fierce people is anton yelchins film he has a long resume as a child actor but preciously little as a teen other than the littleknown house of d also a gem he is best known as byrd on tvs huff in january he will be seen in alpha dog also sitting on the shelf since 2004 a film i saw at sundance this year and in which he is the heart and soul his performance here goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young and is nothing short of spectacularbr br this complex quirky film has remained out of sight long enough fierce people is a treasure filled with light and shadow comedy and tragedy joy and pathos but mostly wonder
