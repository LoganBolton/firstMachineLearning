sonny chiba as everyone knows is the man in this film he portrays mas oyama 19231994 a real martial artist who fought over 50 bulls with his bare handsand won interesting guylook him up anyway chiba only kills one bull in the film but its a memorable scene and as the liner notes say right up there with the zombie vs shark scene in zombi the film also offers up loads of handtohand combat and a decent plot to boot though i dont believe all of it is true this film is the first of the oyama trilogy chiba made and is recommended for fans of martial arts action finally three neat little tidbits part of the opening theme was used in kill bill volume 1 oyama himself appears in the opening sequences and that is because he trained chiba in real life for five years
