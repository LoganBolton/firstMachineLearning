when it comes to movies i dont easily discriminate between crap pure crap and masterpieces i believe this movie is an absolute masterpiece and its hard to keep me entertained for more than 90 minutes this movie ran slower than mystic river and harry potter 3 combined and i still managed to stay riveted to my seat for me it was the passion that eric bogosian put into his performance its extremely difficult to pull off such a stunt and manage to garner any positive effect from it bogosian probably nailed one of the toughest singleman performances in modern cinema i didnt have any respect for bogosian until the end of the film the entire monologue minutes before the inexorable climax was the turning point it was the key that turned me around this man hit a point so low that he knew he could never recover from it the corporate boys congratulated him on the performance his blistering prose made even the slimiest one in the cavalcade shake his head in awe it made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy dont matter in the world of talk radio even in the corporate world for that matter stone may have been pushing some uberliberal agenda but it was the actual movie and production that got my attention oliver stone is a minor master of the moody the final third of the film had probably the best lighting and cinematography i have seen in any film stone artfully makes the dj booth feel like fivebyseven cell in a nineteenth century prison visually speaking it appears that bogosians only friend is the black foam that absorbs his routine vitriol he speaks and it doesnt speak back its a sad metaphor considering the way he treats the people who handed him his success stone and bogosian carved out a stunning film of a man who is trapped in both a prison of walls and a prison of self this man is confined to his own volition and he can never escape it the scene that made me realize his conundrum was when he was unwilling to his exwife back he preferred his own prison instead of the world on the outside every story has a conflict and it came down to the simplest of all conflicts man versus himself talk radio presents this conflict in an intelligent gripping and artful fashion there are no hidden messages in this film and the progression of events should be expected by any astute viewer i just leaned back and let my mind be grasped by this film and i loved it its unheralded unseen and it will never receive its due recognition lets hope it stays that way because gems deserve to be found and then hidden again its a gem because i found it in the discount dvd bin at my local walmart store for 550 it was worth the halfhour i spent digging trying to find it i did and i got more than my moneys worth this is one of the best movies ever made and that is worth ten reasons alone ten reasons give a score of tenbr br here ends my rant
