oliver stone hits the bulls eye with this film aided chiefly by bogosians electrifying screen presence and biting brilliant screenplay every moment crackles with a steadilygrowing tension climaxing in a truly memorable moviegoing experience if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of famebr br an ultimate indictment of our societys increasing morbidity and selfsickening hunger for the next big thrillbr br a film not easily forgotten i highly recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of human nature
