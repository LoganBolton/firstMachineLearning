i was expecting a lot from this movie and i can say i havent been disappointed first of all this movie as a world tour of wine making let the spectator enjoy beautiful places the people interviewed are really interesting and funny too in particular hubert de montille the shooting may be confusing the camera always being unsteady and often focusing on secondary elements in the backgrounds you may not like it but i dont consider it as a defectbr br the themes raised in the movie may be kind of confusing as well since globalization isnt the only issue discussed but nossiter managed to give his movie a consistency all along a great achievement of this movie is revealing all the characters involved in the wine industry as they really are avoiding a clich√© good against evil this could be the main difference between mondovino and michael moores documentaries nossiters point of view appears in a subtle way through opinions expressed by his favorite characters the richness of this documentary relies mainly upon the characters the history of longtime winemaking families such as the de montilles the mondavis the antinori and the frescobaldi nossiter lets the spectator discover that wine is somehow related to families rather than just being a business and an industry this movie doesnt make you want to drink wine but certainly make you want to discover vineyards and winemakersbr br i watched this movie as a student in enology and lets just there are many ways to learn i give this documentary 10 out of 10 despite his technical particularities
