wow a masterpiece of a movie not to be missed br br i had no idea what this movie was when i started watching it late night i didnt find out it was a stone film until after the film when i went on imdb watching it i was mesmerized the cast especially eric bogosian is just superb one of the best scripts and camera work everthe movie drew me in and kept me entranced until the very endi did not dare blink for fear of missing somethingamazing how a smallbudget film can be so engrossing and well made while hugebudget films that feature tons of action and computer generated special effects can be so incredibly boring dont miss this film
