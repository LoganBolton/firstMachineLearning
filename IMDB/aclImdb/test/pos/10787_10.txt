alright the first time i seen talk radio was in a video store for only 200 on vhs believe it or not and i looked at it and i thought it might be about howard stern because i just looked at it for about thirty seconds then just didnt see it again then i went to another store about a month later and i found talk radio on dvd for only 500 so i see it was directed by oliver stone and i picked it up so after the film was over i was speechless i have never seen such a film like this heres the main plot then ill tell ya what i thought of itbr br it is about a dallas talk radio host barry champlain a jewish radio host who talks about whatever other people bring up and he interupts and is taking everything seriously now a network wants to put his show live everywhere in the us so barrys show gets a lot of interesting phone callers like chet a neonatzi kent a rock n roll drugged kid john rapist and others now some of the callers sound like the same actoractresses but still i think it fits okaybr br now what i love a lot about this film is the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station the dark music in the background fits very nicely too it has a flashback scene in the film also how he started with radio which i think they did good on br br but the great thing about the film is ending i was surprised by it and it kind of makes you feel paranoid a little about the phone callers off the air and everything about it is wonderful it also tells you how to say the right things to people over a big city like dallas one of oliver stones underratedweakest films mentioned but i think its his best in my opinionbr br but definitely get this film if you like films with paranoiafeel like films with a dark atmosphere with sinister music in the background i still watch this film a lot of the times now when im bored as matter fact i watched it tonight yeah if ya wanna really get the sinister feel to the film watch it at nightime with the lights off i may sound crazy but it makes the film betterbr br another thing i forgot to mention is that the reason i dont think the film did so well was maybe in my point of view because of the title talk radio it doesnt sound very tricky or anything its kind of plain a better title like the book talked to death or maybe the abusive radio host or something catchy and not plain talk radio or maybe because of universal pictures oliver stone usually didnt do universal i dont think paramount might have been a good company i dont know something about this film didnt do so well but i love itbr br sticks and stones can break your bones but words can cause permanent damage
