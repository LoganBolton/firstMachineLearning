talk radio is of course probably not the most well known of stones films but dont let that put you off this film is ripe for discovery i defy anyone not to be entranced by it along with the best performance of 80s cinema by eric bogosian for me along with jfkthis remains stones finest moment stone doesnt seem to comment much on it these days and didnt do a directors commentary on dvd like all his other films stone has nothing to be ashamed of most directors would kill to get a shot  a film like thisbr br the claustrophobia of the studio is intense and the opinions of champlain are still very crucial arguments for today the legalise all drugs speech is powerful and you might find yourself agreeing with himin my opinion the film is about freedom of speech and how sometimes people dont like hearing things they dont agree withthe speeches and conversations with the listeners are very compelling even disturbing a chill ran down my spine when a crazed man calls champlain saying he has to rape again because the city drives him crazy is totally shockingthe tension is sometimes unbearable with a scene when heavy metaller kent becomes unhinged of course champlain does himself no favours by ridiculing him champlainor should i say bogosian is fearless in film and performance totally mesmerising a shame th bogosians other big role was the villain in under siege 2dear godone scene th didnt ring true was when barrys boss danalec baldwin gets him to calm down barry doesnt seem to be the kind of person who shuts up and does as hes told it seemed a bit contrived and clich√©dthe scenes outside the studio are criticised for being too formulaic its true because stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and allow the viewer to see champlains beginnings but it doesnt entirely work br br it is a brilliantly cinematic film with extreme closeups deep focus extremely fast cuts a fantastic 360 set which is used for the final breathtaking monologue must see cinema it makes it rare because it was ignored the time but is now receiving attention again which it so richly deserves a classic th should be studied by generations of film students br br 10 out of 10 for inventive use of bad to the bone before t2 brilliant supporting cast including john c mcginleydr cox from scrubs as the sleazy stu leslie hope24as champlains girlfriend john pankow and alec baldwin as the suits and micheal wincott who plays three roles a very underrated actor the tension between the listeners and champlain which is very heartracing  times and of course kudos to the stars bogosian and stone for such a fantastic piece of cinema enjoy
