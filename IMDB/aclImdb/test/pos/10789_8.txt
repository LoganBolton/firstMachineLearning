probably one of his lesser known films it suffers from the same lack of exposure as salvador in that its actually one of his bestbr br written by and starring eric bogosian talk radio tells the story of an opinionated radio phonein host who upsets the wrong kind of listener the film is important and has much to say on the issues of free speech and just how free it should be and you can easily tell that it started life as a stage play know what youre getting into before you sit down to watch it and youll be finebr br there isnt much to the acting really as bogosian pretty much steals the film he wrote and is given licence to rant i couldnt take my eyes off him and that was part of the fascination many of the listeners had the people who hated him wouldnt turn off incase they missed somethingbr br not for everyone but a very good drama and overall a very good film
