never having seen an oliver stone film before nor any films starring eric bogosian i didnt know what to expect from this film having toyed with the idea of buying it for a while i finally got it for free as a supplement with a sunday newspaper and i was hugely impressedbr br it tells the story of barry champlain a talk radio host who can be incredibly rude towards his callers often putting them in their place before they realise whats going on though this is what has made him a popular radio show host it has also earned him numerous enemiesbr br the acting in this film was hugely impressive with not one dud actor in it eric bogosian is brilliant as barry champlain the troubled talk radio host with alec baldwin turning in a strong performance as barrys boss dan it also features the voice of and cameo appearance by michael wincott my reason for wanting to see thisbr br the story was really well written as despite his arrogance you feel for barry as more about his troubled life is revealed and you see how vulnerable he really isbr br id recommend this film to anyone as it is captivating and more importantly real on numerous levels two of which being that is was inspired by the life of an actual talk radio host and the fact that you do actually get radio show hosts and callers like the ones featured in the film in realitybr br high recommendation and 1010br br aye yours cat squire
