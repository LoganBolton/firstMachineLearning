i have seen it a few times and get completely glued to it every time it is very suspenseful and intense to describe it sounds boring but it is amazing it is the kind of movie where you need cant miss a thing but if you soak it in it sticks with you long after it ends now thinking about it i dont even know what stone was trying to make us see just the story of alan green i dont think so it was a look at ignorance stupidity selfabsorption and a guy just loosing his grip maybe he had more grip than the listeners though i didnt like barry but still seemed worried about him for some reason i was perplexed at why i couldnt get him out of my mind when the movie ended i wish i could see inside olive stones mind for this one
