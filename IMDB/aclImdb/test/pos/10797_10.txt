in one of the more underseen films of the late 1980s at a time when oliver stone was riding high with platoon and wall street and before his opus born on the fourth of july he coscripted and directed this look at the world of radio specifically one radio host in the middle of texas this man is barry champlain in a onceinacareer turn from eric bogosian who wrote the original play and also cowrote the script barry is like a mix of howard stern and one of those pundits you hear on the radio stations many of us might turn off hes got ideas on his mind opinions and hes not only unafraid to speak them but also to stand up against the phone callers the callers indeed are the driving force in the film as barry has to combat against the mindless the obscene the racist and the purely absentminded as this goes on he also has to contend with his boss alec baldwin and a hit or miss deal to go nationwide outside the confines of the southern way station hes inbr br while after seeing the film i felt curious as to see how it wouldve been done on stage id imagine it was a oneman show as bogosian has had several on the side the direction of the film is phenomenal stone has been known almost typecast as a director who loves quick cuts the limitless effects of montage and effects with the styles of camerawork and other little tricks that give his films in the 90s a distinctive almost auteur look but in the 80s he had this energy and feverish quality to the look of the film and wasnt as frenzied as the other films in order to add the proper intensity that is within the studio and headspace of barry champlain he and dp robert richardson make the space seem claustrophobic at times gritty unsure and definitely on edge the scenes in the middle of the film when barry isnt in the studio are fairly standard but the style along with the substance in the radio scenes is among the best ive seen from the stonerichardson combinationbr br and one cannot miscalculate the performance of bogosian who can be obnoxious offensive angered passive and everything that we love and hate in radio show hosts there is also a funny near distracting supporting role for michael wincott as kentmichaeljoe who prank calls him one night and the next gets invited to the studio these scenes are a little uncomfortable for a viewer but it does get very much into the subculture headspace of the 80s that barry is as intrigued as he is critical of the stoner may not get it but as he says to him its your show indeed its hard to cover everything that goes on within the talk and there is a lot of it but its never boring and like champlain himself its not easy to ignore and when bogosian goes into his climactic tirade on air with the background panning around in a continuous 360 spin it becomes intoxicating and a reason why freedom of speech is so powerfulbr br stone has been synonymous as a filmmaker of hotbutton issues who takes on subjects that were or still are controversial and gives them a lifeforce that isnt always great but is all his own here his skills and ambitions dont get in the way of bogosians its boosted if anything making an extremely skilled vision of what is essentially a near oneman show which in and of itself is already wellwritten
