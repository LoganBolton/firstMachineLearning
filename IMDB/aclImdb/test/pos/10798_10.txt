when you think oliver stone the movies that come to mind would be his biggest and most controversial ones like platoon jfk born on the fourth of july or natural born killers talk radio usually doesnt its a pretty small movie actually more than half the movie takes place with barry champlain at his radio station talking into his mike but believe me this is one of oliver stones greatest movies and should not be missedbr br above all things its a character study barry champlain is a rude selfdestructive risktaking talk radio show host who says one too many things and starts to get in trouble with his boss his lovers his fans and even some nazis he doesnt like his audience and callers and a lot of them dont like him eithor that or do like him but have no idea why but at the end he says on his show i guess were stuck with each otherbr br see talk radio even if you dont like oliver stone movies you might be surprised i sure wasbr br my rating 1010
