from the offset i knew this was going to be a terrific movie the pace the cinematography personalities indigenous to the dallas area the diversification of characters not to mention the director oliver stone and of course eric bogasianthe film starts out on a friday suggestively occult in the first place and begins with a radio station in dallas that is hosting their number one talk show the barry champlain show based on the talk radio host alan bergbarry eric bogasian is the abrasive radio talk show host and his job is such whereby it is compulsory to pontificate all of the sensationalistic nuances of the radio audience feeding into his showhe attempts to commiserate with a bunch of societal deviates turned lonely vulnerable obscene phone callers who have the masochistic craving to be publicly vilified barry champlain is effective in coping with this precarious ilk by socially debasing them rather than simply subjugating them to mere admonishmentnew technologies serve a stigmatic purpose for the dallas radio audience and paramount concepts take a backseat to perversion talk about baseball scores orgasms and peoples petsbr br the whole thing is a cacophony of druginduced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia this high profile cannon fodder is something that barry champlain thrives on the convoluted pathos the deranged proclivities deeriving from inaneities and puveyors of pornography and the overall pop culture afflictions serve as volatile ammunition for barry champlains stilted battlegroundbr br the setting for this movie is perfect in that there is a two thousand foot drop in terms of ideology in the the center of dallas there is an overbearing sense of cosmopolitan awareness whereby 20 miles away resides a significant chapter of the ku klux klanthe play is based in denverthat is where the actual story takes place other small theater plays depict the cities of louisville atlanta and cleveland dallas is the city where the film takes place i thought it was an excellent choicethis movie illustrates how people have a horrid and erroneous and deadly misconceptualization of the jewish people in america whereby they control the banks their agenda is different than everybody elses and their intellectual literature leads to perversion these preconceived notions compound barry champlains overall dilemma barry champlains personal undoing is whereby he is irascible and nonresponsive to his alcoholism and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate undoing this is what makes the film so believablebr br the characters in the movie were well portrayed dan the tailor made for middle management hatchet man played by alec baldwin who was constantly monitoring barry champlains every movelaura his girlfriend also his producer will constantly feel barry is someone who is always misunderstood ellen his exwife is a recipient of barrys anguish and selfishness but cannot quite relinquish her feelings for barry regardless of the path of personal destruction he winds up resorting to the dallas radio audience is a melting pot of socially misplaced retrobates who are dementedly amused by their own real shortcomingsin part everybodys hangups including barry champlains own hangups are what do barry champlain in his audience ogles depravity solicits amelioration and ultimately becomes barry champlains pet project for prescribed sinners social culture conflicts become barry champlains downfall br br this movie is superb in my opinion oliver stones best picture including platoon and natural born killersthat statement in of itself tells you how magnificent a film talk radio isthe story consulting and acting and coproducing of eric bogosian is simply compelling the camera angles the dialogue the haunting character portrayals all top notchthe cinematography of the dallas skyline at the end of the movie is terrific dallas has the dubious distinction of being deemed a mega metropolisso now just like los angeles and new york there are crack baby cases too numerous to count low cost housing neighborhoods from hell and budgets cuts that will mean there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this time next yeardallas asserts its status as a major metropolitan area in the precarious manner by which human debauchery prevails the city has its lynching radio listeners who have given a pejorative spin to the marvel of nationwide air wave communication these are the culprits in the movie the ghoulish tabloid derelicts who want to meet the big bad wolf and their decadent curiosity has morally obliterated the last neighborhood in america
