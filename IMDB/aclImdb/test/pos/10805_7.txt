i was very curious to see this wajdadepardieu outing plus the time period is definitely fascinating being a wajda fan i was disappointed and that may be an understatement the film never really took cinematic flight  theres no foundation for the animosity between danton and robespierre etcbr br basically the script was weak adapted from the danton affair and yet the direction was masterfulits wajda afterall also there were some amazing actors but they never really grab the audiences attention like they should depardieu comes off as a quasigoofy nonchalant dantonnot exactly the image we have in mind woijech pzsoniak is incredible as usual but again the script puts up limits even actors of great talent cant break down andrzej seweryn and bogoslaw linda pop up  as bourdon and saintjustand if youre familiar with wajda then youd know thembr br overall i was disappointed with this muchlauded film great cast great director but no quality foundation bad undynamic script we need to get in danton walesa and robespierres general j mindsets what are their motivations ehwho knows one likes women the other powders himself riiight ok so if youre looking for a great french revolution movie i highly recommend la revolution francaiseits in two parts and ohsogreat excellent performances indepth script juicy tid bitsdefinitely a satisfying experience klausmaria brandauer is a much better danton than depardieuthe wonderful andrzej seweryn apparently took some notes from danton and is brilliant as robespierre see it now as for wajda fans  youre better off with man of ironmarble promised land and the like cheers
