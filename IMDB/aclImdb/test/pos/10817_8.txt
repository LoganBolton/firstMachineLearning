i found this dvd in the library and based on the jacket notes it looked like it might possibly be interesting a black comedy set in 1940 france just as the germans are marching in boy that should have them rolling in the aisles but it does this is a clever original suspenseful and funny film i dont recall seeing anything like it before  foreign or us that the writerdirector can find humor when we know part of the outcome the germans will occupy france for four years is remarkable that he does it with such charm is part of the delight what starts off as black comedy and fluff even ends up having a couple of serious moments  including a race to spirit out a cache of heavy water which was part of the preliminary research for the abomb and a quick history 101 intro to the beginnings of the collaborationist vichy government that would govern southern france for much of the german occupation but dont let any of that that scare you off the movie itself is funny charming and romantic and races ahead at steady clipbr br one of the best things about it is the combination of actors weve seen many times adjani and depardieu and others weve never heard of before along the way there are two starmaking turns virginie leydoyen and grégori derangère both are impressive but mr derangère is especially so according to imdb he was in ten films before this one  but he also won the cesar as most promising actor for this role so apparently he was not all that well known even in france he is a combination of romantic lead and comic actor  and he makes it all seem so effortless you may be reminded of cary grant in bringing up baby and arsenic and old lace  its hard to do comedy on film because the risks are enormous that the actor can come off looking inept but grant pulled it off charmingly and this guy does also i should think were going to hear more about him in the futurebr br to be sure this film wont please everyone  theres a little bit of violence although nothing you dont see on tv every day but if youre up for something original you may feel after youve seen this that youve unearthed a cinematic gembr br  the socalled spoiler in this comment
