one comment said it wasnt a comedymistake it was a delightful comedy of a period of history that doesnt lend itself easily to that genre very busyand active film from beginning to end often the shots out the window of the train or car were just beautiful an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours in a theater all the french historical figures like charles de gaulle and petain and the some of the people involved in the french resistance were included in the script which might send those who are unfamiliar with the collapse of france under the german invasion might want to research the characters were engaging and the actors portraying them were excellent recommend it 9 out of 10
