more and more french cinema demonstrates thats the only one able to confront hollywoods and to spend high amounts on money in their movies if bon voyage had been made in the usa no one would be surprised perfectly set in france in the 40s when the nazi invasion technically irreproachable and with some of the most international french actors depardieu adjani ledoyen bon voyage centerers on two parallel stories an scientific and his disciple ledoyen who tries to hide one of his discoveries a kind of water that may work as an atomic bomb from the nazis and a poor guy in love with a well known actress adjani which ends up in prison accused of a crime hes not committed in order to protect her br br bon voyage seems to have been made in the old style without unnecessary camera movements and effects without big turns in the plot as i said before regarding to the production itself theyve made a great job but the main problem with this movie is about the script is it a spymovie a romantic comedy a spy comedy a comedy of intrigue its not clear that makes bon voyage a little unbalanced when you think youre watching a comedy suddenly changes to another storyline a more dramatic one more slow i think they shouldve focused in one of the lines of argument the one about the spy plot and left the romantic parts in the backgroundbr br my rate 6510
