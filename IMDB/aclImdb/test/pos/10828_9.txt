bon voyage has the fast pace that in some ways reminds me of the indiana jonesstar wars films  its as if youre on a fast train or roller coasterbr br its billed as a romance mystery thriller and farce its all of that and more including candid observations on the reactions of french society during the nazi invasion at the start of wwii and its also an exhibition of juggling that involves 7 main characters the scenes all seemed historically accurate to my eyes and gave an excellent feeling for the periodbr br all of the actors were well cast and gave great performances but imo the most superb was that by isabelle adjani who played the role of an opportunistic selfcentered french movie star not only did she quite convincingly play the role of a young actress perhaps half her age but she also played her amorous wiles convincingly yet in such a way that the audience sees shes only half serious and more complex as a person than just a gold digger her character and energy propel the film through from beginning to end it wasnt until i read roger eberts review that i discovered she was 48 years old at the time of the film what beautybr br i appreciated the ending  its satisfying but lets you write your own conclusion as to what happens to the main characters br br as another user commenter observed  do not arrive late you need to be there from the opening scene good advicebr br i gave it 9 of 10
