i have noticed that people have asked if anyone has this show i have all 26 episodes that aired in the us and will be willing to share these with anyone interested all i require is that you supply the vhs tapes or blank dvds i have them on both formats and pay for shipping my email is creator67pipinternetnet just send me an email and your request and i will notify you and we can make the arrangements the quality is very good and they are very enjoyable to watch especially if you have not been able to see them since they aired in the 60s it was one of my favorite shows as a child and hold a very special place in my heart because it brings back a lot of memories of my childhood as well as other shows like ultraman and astroboybr br peter
