this was recommended to me by a friend that said it was cute and cuddly for a lesbian sexuality flick boy was he wrong i guess he just didnt get it growing up not understanding and then discovering yourself thru trial and tribulation is more like itbr br the characters are full and vibrant and the story has enough fun thrown in thru the theater performances to keep anyone interestedbr br rachael stirling as nan goes thru so many tries at finding the love she desires only to find it was the one person she was scared to reveal all too and ran out on johdi may as flo was remarkable spent a couple hours trying to recall where ive seen her before only to discover she was the quiet sister alice in last of the mohicans luckilyi was raised in a liberal family and had no issues with trying a movie like this so many people are missing out on flicks like this im glad i took my friends advise and tried it but im sure i enjoyed it more the he
