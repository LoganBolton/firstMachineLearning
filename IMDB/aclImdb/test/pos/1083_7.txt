once again i must play something of the contrarian most of the reviews for ab tak chappan have been extremely positive mine is positive but only slightly a 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a c letter grade from mebr br it seems that a lot of the praise is rooted in two factors one that ab tak chappan is more realistic than the typical bollywood film and two that it is trying to do things differentlybr br the first point i couldnt care less about im not looking for realism in films and so i do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how i believe the real world to beim a big fan of surrealism fantasy absurdism and so on although i do not dislike realist films merely for the fact that theyre realistbr br for the second point i agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently however i dont think originality versus formulaicism makes for a better or worse film in itself a film can be original and poor just like a film can be formulaic and excellent what matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding that is to the viewerbr br ab tak chappan is based on the true story of a mumbai cop named daya naik naik was an encounter specialist encounter specialists who could be said to be early instantiations of real world judge dredds are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue and theyre basically given a license to killeffectively acting as policeman judge jury and executioner in a matter of moments ab tak chappan follows the story of sadhu agashe nana patekar the encounter specialist based on naik we see him at work interacting with his fellow encounter specialists and engaging in violence we see him at home trying to live a normal life in his lessthanluxurious surroundings we see him trying to adjust to a new commissioner halfway through the film and we see his odd relationship with a notorious indian gangster don zameer zafar prasad purandharebr br all of this has the potential to make a fabulous gritty film i agree that its nice to forgo the typical bollywood musical numbers and romancesnot every film needs that stuff ab tak chappan producer ram gopal varma is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the wayside in many films that hes directed or produced additionally ab tak chappan has some good performancespatekar almost gives off a death wish 1974era charles bronson vibe it also has admirable cinematographythe handheld stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective for example it has a great score that mixes more of a moody hollywoodsounding actioncrime score with traditional indian instruments and modalities the violence is well done and grittybr br there is also decent exploration of subtexts including the morality of having encounter specialists the idea of following orders and so on the encounter specialists are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong more poignantly the film questions the merit of blindly following orders parallels are drawn between the encounter specialists following orders and say members of a countrys military and were shown what a corrupt situation this can lead tobr br but you just knew there was a but coming didnt you director shimit amin and his scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters far too much sprawl and that moves a bit too slow all of these problems may be due to amin and crew looking at the godfather films which ab tak chappan has some at least superficial resemblances to although from a policemans perspectivebr br most of the encounter specialists we do not get to know very wellthese are shallowly drawn characters to say the least except for agashe and jatin shukla nakul vaid for one narayan i didnt know who he was until at least halfway through the film his name is mentioned a number of times but id only get glimpses of him until the scene would change then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and id have to start all over figuring out who narayan wasbr br the same thing happened with agashes first commissioner the film was already far into the new commissioner before i could figure out the relationships it seems like there are new characters in every scene we never learn the stories of most of them while that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about because theyre mostly doing so on orders since we do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists either its difficult to find characters to care about and that doesnt exactly make for a gripping filmbr br the primary villain is zameer but until about halfway through the film theres no indication of this he doesnt get much more screen time than the other villains parading through the film and hes literally phoning his performance inhes in another location dubai communicating only by telephone for the majority of the film we dont actually see zameer doing much to an extent the film depends on a couple twists that necessitate not showing zameer doing a number of things but we could see him do other things and a lot of the other villains could have been left outbr br that would have tightened up the film a bit making it more focused and about a halfhour shorter both of which would have benefited its impact this is not an actionpacked film by any means for at least the first 45 minutes or so i found myself admiring ab tak chappans considerable style but saying okay get on with the story already
