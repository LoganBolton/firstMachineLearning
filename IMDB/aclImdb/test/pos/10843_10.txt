the bbc surpassed themselves with the boundaries they crossed with tipping the velvet in the past theyve been daring with dennis potters works but this miniseries as it was screened in the uk is superb andrew davies work is top notch  ive not read the sarah waters novel but i can imagine hes done it real justice i comment on the bawdiness  most men have watched it for that  proved to be a main talking and selling point when originally advertised the fact is it portays the lesbian side of society in the 1800s  a time when most thought it was old men and rent boys  well it was  lesbianism took place mainly behind closed and often respectable doorsbr br you can also look at tipping the velvet as a love story  it actually is  as well as self discovery that many gaybi and straight people go through and comments on this occur and repeat all the timebr br if youve not seen it yet  either repeated on tv or on dvd  get it  youll be in for a treat  and even the production and filming of it is perfect just try to hide your blushes in parts  like i said  bawdy is the order of the day  and beware a phallus or twobr br enjoy
