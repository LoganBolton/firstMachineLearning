i love this movie i watched it over and over when i rented it from netflixit had a lot of substance and meaning for me i think many people will enjoy iti have read and seen quite a few lesbian stories over the years and am happy to say they are getting better and better in how they are presentedthey tend to have a more positive feel for the life style and feelings of gay womenits nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this societyi think it is apparent that more and more movies with this theme will grace our theaters and tv screensmany producers and directors are realizing that lesbians live very full and wholesome lives and that we have wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals as well as families without hesitation
