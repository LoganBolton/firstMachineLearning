as a lesbian i am sick and tired of being portrayed in movies and on tv as a sad person forever vacillating between suicide and homicide but never destined to find happiness br br if like me you are fed up with hollywoods antilesbian propaganda youll breathe a sigh of relief at this delightful offering from the bbc nan astley is the daughter of an oysterhouse restaurateur who wonders why she cant feel the way she should about freddy one of the local lads who has his eye set on her she falls  and falls hard  for kitty butler a male impersonator with a visiting theatre troupe nan accompanies kitty to london as her dresser br br not everything that happens to nan is pleasant in this story and some of the things she does are not squeakyclean either  but she will win your heart and her story of love triumphant will leave you with a beautiful lump in your throat at the endbr br if you are a lesbohating macho man or a homophobic housewife or some brand of religious fundamentalist who believes that homosexuals should die and go to hell this series is not for you but if you have a heart and you believe in love you will cry at the end as much as i did
