this wonderful 3 part bbc production is one of the sweetest love stories that i have seen in a while the actresses display a very high level of talent especially rachael stirling as nan astley she is funny seductive and cute the love making scenes and the close up kisses are very erotic regardless of ones sexual preference br br the characters are well defined and very believable i guess this is a byproduct of a good adaptation from a well written novelbr br a truly remarkable well paced drama that picks up speed quickly after a couple of boring but necessary scenes in the beginningbr br my vote 910
