labeling this film a lesbian love story is about as accurate as calling pride  prejudice a straight love story theres just so much more to it than thatbr br yes the main character is a lesbian but her story is classic bildungsroman a journey from childhood to adulthood from sexual innocence into maturity from personal blindness to self discovery there is a stylistic element of camp to the films direction but it is not a hindrance rather it serves to underscore the staged and dramatic parts of the main characters lifebr br those who know anna chancellor from the bbc version of pride and prejudice will certainly be amazed with her here rachael stirling is stellar as the main character nan and keeley hawes is all wideeyed goodness as her lover kitty butler chancellor might have the stand out role that is aside from sally hawkins who plays zena butler this film is not for the faint of heart but its not a piece of progay advertising either its a real story with real comedy and drama an engaging story with compelling characters and well worth watching
