this movie gives daniel wu his chance to do a great action movie but i really find emil chows character really great gutsy but determined to righting wrongs plus the main terrorist it gets me wondering his revolution makes me wonder if he is doing this for good or badbr br a movie that tells us about todd an amnesiac terrorist being tricked as an undercover until he learns who he really is the consequences that he makes from his terrorist family gives him a the choice of redemptionbr br purple storm was one of the best ones that i have seen this year the movie really stands out when it is filled with tremendous action scenes setup by stephen tung wai which won the best action sequences in the hong kong awards 910
