i found it charming nobody else but kiarostami can do so little and yet get so much you might think im weird but i was so charmed that i couldnt speak during the movie while during other movies i comment a lot the short movie made by him for lumiere et companie the one with the eggs that one is unbeatable in my heart but this is wonderful too i liked it better than ten kiarostami is maybe the best director in my opinion because he can see things he doesnt need to use a lot of stuff brought from home to illustrate his images he simply grabs a camera not many can do that maybe i dont know to much about movies but i dont care about complicate stuff all someone has to do is touch my soul kiarostami does
