movie about two australian girlsdebbie nell schofield and sue sue knightand what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer guysbr br i caught this at an art cinema here in america in 1981 technically i was still a teenager i was 19 so i was interested in seeing how australian teens acted script wise theres nothing new here it shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating sex suicide etc etc i always knew what was going to happen before it did but i was never bored what i found interesting was despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair these teenagers arent much different than american teens they had many of the same difficulties and hangups also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and i heard it was a faithful adaptation of it the acting was just ok but the actors were attractive and this was wellmade and pretty interesting so this is no unsung masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what its like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids i give it a 7
