satya was excellent company was just as good but more polished probably owing to the money earned from previous movies ab tak chappan however is even more entertaining the dialogue is gritty crude and at times hilarious nana pataker shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax as a depiction of reality it may be overdramatised but at the end of the day its a movie so the balance is spoton ive ordered my dvd and cant wait to see it again at home as a lover of these type of gangster flicks this is very gratifying and comes highly recommended for the refreshingly nonyash raj bollywood gangster flick lovers out there
