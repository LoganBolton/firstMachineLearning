this is my favorite game for the nintendo 64 platform ive played many different firstperson shooters and ive never really liked any of them much but this game has a certain something that i cant put my finger on that makes it an amazing amount of fun maybe its the extraordinary detail put into the game maybe its the fluid movement of the characters maybe its the gadgets and weapons maybe its the suave character of james bond whatever it is this game never seems to get old no matter how many times ive played it
