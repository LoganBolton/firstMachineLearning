this game is not exactly the best n64 game ever sure its good but only when theres 4 players without 4 players the only fun thing to do is take remote mines and see how many people you can kill but half of this game are levels where you have to save natalya so youll have to limit your use of remote mines in those levels and that gets quite boring the graphics dont exactly reach the level of super mario 64 or even mario kart 64 and if youre talking a great multiplayer in a 1stperson shooter youll have to go with perfect dark at least you can play multiplayer by yourself
