ever since i first played it in 1998 goldeneye has been one of my favourite video games in fact i recently bought an n64 purely so that i could own it and play it more often the game is pretty much nearperfect the singleplayer mode does a fantastic job of immersing yourself in bonds shoes with varied mission objectives convincing weapons and great level design even though the enemies artificial intelligence is pretty basic by todays standards that only adds to goldeneyes appeal the method of obtaining cheats completing levels within a strict time limit was also innovative when the title was released and even now i still havent cracked some of thembr br the game comes with a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players and while this isnt as advanced as the combat simulator in the games sequel perfect dark it is still incredibly satisfying to blast your opponents to smithereens with a barrage of rcp90 fire
