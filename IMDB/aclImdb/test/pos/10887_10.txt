in my personal opinion i think this is the greatest video game ever created i first played this game at my friends house years ago the very next day i went out and got my own since that day close to seven years ago i have not stopped playing it i cant help it i just cant get bored of it ive been addicted to other games on other much newer systems but i keep coming back for more goldeneye every mission is amazingly fun and challenging the multiplayer mode was like none other i hope you can be as fortunate as i was to have played four player multiplayer mode because i had brothers and friends who would get together and play this game all the time
