after reading the comment made about this movie and currently watching it i can understand how the person felt about it the decisions made were after listening to common sense when the movie came out i had heard the information as to how it came about the storyline was made from an actual event during an award show an actor thanking the lil people attributed the award to a former school teacher unexpectedly outing the personbr br of course many people come out of the closet most every day each outing is different for each person in real life the outcome of any individual is gonna be different as well and a willingness to accept who they are is the most important thing in life to reach personal happiness for those around them the joy and honest acceptance can make life much more fuller for the movie the outcome of how howard is outed is a lot more comical than real life and the acceptance of the community showed the others that howard was himself and nothing elsebr br overall the performances were crazy the memorable quotes and use of music add to the stereotypes out there in the world but taken with tongue and cheek humour its a movie sit down watch with an open mind and laugh your head off
