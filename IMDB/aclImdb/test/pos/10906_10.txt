joan cusack steals the show the premise is good the plot line interesting and the screenplay was ok a tad too simplistic in that a comingout story of a gay man was so positive when it is usually not quitesopositive then again it is fiction  all in all an entertaining rompbr br one thing i noticed was the insidejoke aspect since the targetaudience probably was straight they may not get the gay stuff in context with the story br br kevin kline showed a facet of his acting prowess that screenwriters sometimes dont take in consideration when suggesting kline for a partbr br this one hit the mark
