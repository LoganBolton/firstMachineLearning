the first and far better of kevin klines two gay roles the second is the dreary delovely in which he played cole porter inspired by tom hanks emotional acceptance speech for philadelphia in which he outed his high school drama teacher the nominated film in this version was obviously more forrest gump than philadelphia here the hanks character is played by matt dillonbr br the reaction scenes in most of the film are very funny and as has been often pointed out are especially effective as done by kevin himself debbie reynolds tom selleck a brave move since he was himself the target of such rumors which he denied bob newhart and joan cusack as the eventually jilted bridetobebr br tom hanks actual teacher criticized the graduation scene saying people dont act that way in real life but this is a farce and not real life that being said it is not as effective as it might be and the misdirection of the final wedding scene which makes it look like tom and kevin are about to get hitched i found rather pointless annoying and a cop outbr br the highlight of the film for me is of course kevins scene with the howtobearealman audio tape and it is hilarious but certainly not at all realistic when the tape reacts to kevins actionsbr br on the whole a hoot
