hollywood movies since the 1930s have treated gays as lepers in condemning homosexuality the film industry has reflected only what the repressive society of its day espoused as an ideology for example in the 1962 otto preminger melodrama advise and consent straight actor don murray was cast as a queer congressman who commits suicide rather than confess his alternative lifestyle gay movie characters have covered a lot of ground since advise and consent in the 1997 movie in  out 12 out of  heterosexual actor kevin kline is cast as a homosexual teacher who comes out of the closet on his wedding day while the conservative hollywood of yesteryear stipulated that the congressional queer in advise and consent had to commit suicide the liberal hollywood of today dictates that the gay english teacher should be embraced rather than macedbr br basically in  out preaches good citizenship in the garb of a politically correct comedy director frank oz and scenarist scott rudnick endorse honesty as the best policy because honesty always ensures happiness high school teacher howard brackett kevin kline of the big chill will be happy only after he comes out of the closet just as his oncefatbutnowthin fiancée emily joan cusack will only feel happy when she can ditch her diet ultimately the movie contends that straight society will accept gays when homosexuals can act with greater honesty and candor about themselves the happily outed gay tabloid reporter played by straight actor tom selleck here effectively dramatizes this openminded commentarybr br rudnicks lightweight script embellishes the true life incident that occurred at the oscars when tom hanks paid tribute to a high school teacher in in  out cameron drake matt dillon a blond brad pitt style bimbo type actor wins the oscar for impersonating a fruity foot soldier drake honors his mentor howard brackett during his acceptance speech not contend to stop there the candid cameron reveals to a live television audience that howard is gay suspicion paranoia and horror set in as the media descend upon the sleepy town of green leaf indiana when would a noname high school english teachers sexual deviance spark such massive media concern among those reporters lurks peter malloy tom selleck of high road to china and he wants to do a weeklong exclusive one on howard howard however wants nothing to do with the witchhunting media especially the pesky peter malloy howard denies drakes gay charges to everybody including his fiancée and his mom malloy lingers because he smells a scoop the revelation has turned green leaf upside down high school principal tom halliwell bob newhart squirms nervously with all the media coverage halliwell warns howard that were his marriage not imminent hed have to give him a pink slip meanwhile peter bets howard that his marriage to emily will fall through at the last moment and hell be there to record the result on camerabr br howard resorts to audio tapes about macho men he struggles to reform himself but howards efforts are futile guilt swells up inside him and then there is peter malloy who rags him to come clean about his homosexuality finally at the altar in the sight of god howard bursts of course bridetobe emily montgomery is floored by howards gay confession predictably the school fires howard but he shows up for graduation drake shows up too and rushes to bracketts defense not only has the school stripped howard of his job but theyve also given his teacheroftheyear award to somebody else drake appeals to the principal and wins howard the unanimous support of the communitybr br the biggest defect in rudnicks contrived script is howard himself rudnick has created a character too chaste to be true either by gray or straight standards howard brackett looms as more of a saint than a sinner he helps one student gain admission to college and he coaches the track team how often do you hear of an english teacher doubling as a coach too everybody at his high school adores howard he doesnt have a mean bone in his body further rudnick and oz ask us to believe that nobody else in green leaf is gay where are howards gay friends are they too scared to come to his defense no in  out is not targeted strictly at homosexual audiences oz whose screen credits include cute comedies like dirty rotten scoundrels and house sitter as well as rudnick teeter on a politically correct tightrope in  out is not a gay recruiting movie the filmmakers show no interest in what prompted either howard or peter malloy to prefer the gay lifestyle instead oz and rudnick are only interested in shoring up a thin premise is he or isnt he gay they flesh it out to involve the community response to the answer finally when howard admits that he is gay the filmmakers devote the rest of the movies to showing how a conservative norman rockwelllike town can accept him despite his differencebr br the most shocking scenes in in  out is probably when tabloid reporter malloy does a lip lock on howard straight guys kissing each other in a movie about a gay identity crisis are as hilarious as they are phony kline and selleck grind their faces together in what appears as more of a headon collision than a closedmouth kiss nothing at all like the controversial 1994 british movie priest in  out emerges as an engaging but labored piece of social propaganda with its okaytobeact message if ellen werent the tv equivalent in  out would probably be heading toward tv as a new sitcom watching in  out is not so much about dealing with the issue of gay or straight but how to be a decent person in the last days of the 20th century what makes in  out a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is its equal opportunity cheers and jeers about queers and steers
