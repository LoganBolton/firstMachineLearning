i watched this again after having not seen it since it first came out in 97 and it still made me laugh out loud its skillfully written kevin kline and joan cusack are both perfect in their roles and if you can look at bob newhart in this movie and not chuckle youre more of a man than ibr br for that matter i think the scenes where tom selleck kisses kevin kline where kevin kline listens to the how to be a man cassette and the postalmostwedding scenes w joan cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any moviebr br sure the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending butfew movies are perfect
