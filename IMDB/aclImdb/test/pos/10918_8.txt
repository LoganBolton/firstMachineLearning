i saw this because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes i read somewhere that oz and rudnick wanted to poke fun at liberal message movies but the climax ends up being right out of one of those movies also some of the humor is a bit on the cloying side joan cusack was too overthetop for me and someone has a strange timeline re the oscars still there were more than enough funny moments like the kiss scene the wedding that isnt and the scene with the principal to enjoy this kline as always is good but for me the real surprise was selleck whom im not a big fan of but pokes fun at himself nicely here
