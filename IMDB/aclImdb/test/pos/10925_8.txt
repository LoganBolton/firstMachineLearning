ive just seen this movie and it made me cry its a beautiful drama about two brothers falling in love and i think its a good idea especially for the closedminded to watch this one i have come to love the shortfilm genre after just having seen a couple because they have to make an impression on you so fast and i have to say that this one definitely sat its mark it described some things that i havent ever really thought about that way incest for onebr br i have to admit that i did not care too much for the ending just once i would like to watch a gaythemed movie without wanting to kill myself after wards they seem to pretty much always end in tragedy it was cute though how that they had to be together even if it was in deathbr br i gave it eight stars and i recommend it too everyone cause i think it gives an insidelook in the world that this movie make you enterbr br thanks for listening enjoy
