the mere presence of sam waterston as an indian is enough to put this movie in the mustsee category he is both beautiful and very subtle with no lines whatsoever he is tender with his kidnappee and yet we can see he is among the proudest of all young indian men martin sheen is just a dumb cluck who decides to challenge waterston white bull for a gorgeous white horse other subplots are really unnecessary i dont understand the part played by caroline langrishe as the poor girl who white bull kidnapsi dont know how she keeps her hands off this beautiful indian man its a lot of fun though especially if youre a waterston fan man he looks good in this one harvey keitels role isnt even worth mentioning to tell the truth but rent it and enjoy actually i do believe that if the music score was better it wouldve been a more dramatic filmthe music is so bad its distracting still  theres mr waterston
