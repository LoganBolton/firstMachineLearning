the twins effect  chinese actioncomedy  charlene choi gillian chungbr br this vampire action comedy is one of my favorites for the very fact that i was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie first of all the characters are memorable contributing a myriad of classic scenes charlene and gillian are naturally cute charismatic and humorous this movie was my first exposure to them and all i wanted to do was reach through my television screen and give them a really big hug the remaining cast did well in their supporting roles including jackie chan karen mok the duke josie ho edison chen anthony wong and the vampire bad guys one of which looks eerily familiar to will ferrell even the abominably horrible ekin cheng was good in this one good characters are important of course because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequencesbr br and speaking of action this film has plenty of it more importantly there is an emphasis of quality in the fight choreography one aspect that helped in this regard is the featured weapon of the protagonists  a sword with a retractable spearended rope this weapon in and of itself opened up a variety of moves that would have been otherwise impossible josie ho and gillian chung in particular perform some wicked aerial maneuvers using these devices br br in addition the swordplay is superb and is highlighted by two great sword fights  one taking place during the opening train station sequence and the other occurring in the church finale in fact the bladewielding maneuvers showcased in this film put some other highly overrated fan favorites to great shame and i truly feel sorry for those who would cite the horribly choreographed garbage seen in ashes of time storm riders or a man called hero with the wellplanned precisely executed sequences seen in the twins effect its not even close br br i cant understand why this film gets so much criticism im sure diehard apologists for the hong kong golden age will hate this because it doesnt fit into their narrowminded view of what hong kong action should be we should learn from the downfall of john woo  a one trick pony who never learned how to reinvent himself we dont need another clone we need something different the twins effect is one good examplebr br this film was so good that it actually set me up for being disappointed at other chinese movies with the same actors and actresses this especially applies to ekin cheng whose other films almost always suck  and yes this includes the obscenely overrated and exploitative wuxia crap mentioned in the previous paragraph even the twins have never been able to match the value of this movie when both were lead actresses in a film although they have managed to hit some good films when either one or the other takes the leading role eg beyond our ken good times bed times house of fury or when one or both are in supporting roles eg colour of the truth new police story just one look the twins effect 2 should have been a direct sequel instead of a family fantasy i am still yearning to see charlene and gillian team up and kick some butt in another movie but the fact remains that the twins effect hits on all cylinders optimizing their charisma while avoiding a descent into annoyance as in protégé de la rose noirebr br all in all this film has everything one needs to be entertained and may i remind the reader that it is precisely this  entertainment  that judges the greatness of a movie more so than artsy dramatic elements or meaningless awards from established academies of critics who usually have no idea what they are talking aboutbr br in the end the twins effect is a classic not to be missedbr br rating  55 stars br br ps  the hollywood execs decided to slaughter this film when it was released in the us by renaming it the vampire effect and cutting out 20 minutes of footage which includes parts of the action scenes however the final fight of the us version does have a better soundtrack than the original version therefore i purchased both versions which allows me to first watch the original until about the 120 mark and then swap discs to watch the final fight on the us version
