with a film starring the twins ekin cheng and edison chen nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema what you do get however is a fun film which is easy on the eye and the brain there are loads of hollywoodstyle vampires no hopping chinese bloodsuckers here cute girls handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny moment and jackie chanbr br sure the kungfu relies heavily on wire work and cgi sure the script reminds you of blade and sure the whole affair is instantly forgettablebr br but for a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff you would be hard pushed to find better
