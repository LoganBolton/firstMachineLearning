this movie as my chinese girlfriend informed me features two wellknown hong kong pop stars while this may make the movie a mere marketing stunt i found the acting acceptable and theyre both cutebr br the story is pretty poor overall the vampiric traits and weaknesses are however used in humorous ways and created some uniquely entertaining bits the quarreling between the two girls made me chuckle and this gave a fine balance together with the wellexecuted action scenes to create an entertaining movie
