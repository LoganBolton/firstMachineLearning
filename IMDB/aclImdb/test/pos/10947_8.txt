if you go into the twins effect looking for a pure hong kong movie experience you will be disappointed this is not to say it is bad but it is not a traditional hong kong action movie running in a similar vein to shaolin soccer and kung fu hustle its resolutely silly and juvenile so if you want a good bit of serious hong kong action look to a john woo or yuen woo ping movie this movies got a lot of flak for its silliness and i thought the first thing i should do would be to explain what youre getting into as its disappointed a lot of puristsbr br for the nonpurists and those with more forgiving tastes though twins effect is a delightfully silly kungfu comedy i liked it a lot for a variety of reasons not least its wonderful female leads who spark off each other in a thoroughly entertaining comedy double act i believe this is the first movie of its type theyve been in but they hop kick and fly about like seasoned prosbr br the patently ridiculous plot is handled with a great deal of care and attention and the movie is quite knowingly written making a lot of the movie laugh out loud the comedy really is the most prominent thing here and its a subtle gentle comedy as reliant on words as inanimate objects going flying a la stephen chow it has to be said the slapstick is immense fun too the sequence with the discodancing vampires is a total classicbr br the action is a blend of two genres really it falls between the period drama wireandsword fighting which comes in more toward the end and the comedy fighting style of jackie chan coming out with a blend that though a little derivative at times is always exciting to watch and occasionally throws up some genuinely innovative encountersbr br all this is great and the movie is tremendous fun all the way through despite this it does have a few sticking points for instance twins effect is in many ways much more westernised than kungfu fans are perhaps used to the inevitable comparison to the blade series is definitely sound as an example though twins effect is honestly much better than blade ever managed especially for fighting action personally it was also a bit of a shame to see the excellent anthony wong the hissable villain from john woos classic hard boiled so underused but the younger audience this is aimed at are unlikely to notice this or indeed know about hard boiled or his other movies so this is only really a personal gripebr br if you watch this with an open mind youll probably enjoy it greatly like i did but you must be firmly aware it is a comedy not a balls to the wall kungfu movie keep that in mind and youll be fine
