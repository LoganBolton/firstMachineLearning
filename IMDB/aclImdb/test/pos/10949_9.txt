im not sure what version of the film i saw but it was very entertainingbr br i did not know who the twins were gillian chung and charlene choi before seeing this movie and i think the english translation of the title is somewhat misleadingbr br the martial arts are very nicely done i especially liked them because there was a lot of judograppling that was filmed very nicely donnie yen see him in hero great performance as a director is great as he knows how to shoot these scenesbr br everything seemed to flow for me except there is one scene where the girls are on the rooftop fighting with bamboo poles it has really nothing to do with the plot but its still entertainingbr br overall this is one of the better modern hk action flicks ive seen in a while although cheesy in some respects it still pulls it offbr br definitely a 910
