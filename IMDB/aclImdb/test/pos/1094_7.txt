one should not be too critical about the directors second featurebr br i really like the camera work of madiba as mr shawn pointed out he had a unique way of looking at thingsbr br however howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images remember he has not got any education of any sort i dont think english is the common tongue in cape town ghettos worse still madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14br br any way if you overcome abovementioned peculiarities you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work
