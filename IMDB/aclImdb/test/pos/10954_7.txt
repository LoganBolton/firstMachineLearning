121701 all i can do with this film is improvise on my impressions i wasnt given the changes dont know the score and am not schooled in the genre i always had problems following chord changes anyway trumpet player yknow so i was pretty well limited to doing the basic keep the tune in mind and ad lib around that what jammed me up about this incredibly moody black and white blues piece was the knot it gave me in my head and heart in trying to figure out whether to go with the ensemble or pick out a path along the tune story i guess i went with the tune as usual i kept getting lost on the changestoo deep extensive over my head probably still it was a gas to try to keep pace i admired the actors playing to the theme and story line i didnt see some things or heare things others seem to i didnt feel the light skin gal was trying to pass as much as she was either oblivious to the color issue or was trying to ignore itat first later she came back fighting the brooding light skin young man his trumpet noodling mas ludicrous was ambiguous ambivalent and perhaps his best featureremote what i thought after the shadowcurtain closed on this provocative pieceis the foundation of a thing like this is it a way of finding reality by setting up a stage peopling it with expressive characters and giving them a melody and theme is it any more real or truthful than a wellcrafted scriptwithout the benefit of editing and revising is improvisation heroic artiermoreso than crafted work where is there greater or clearer truth in retrospective artcraft or in fabrication and reformation well i am still lost in this question i loved the film it got me lost in a cool blue foggy evening where i just had to go home and get out my horn guess what i broke out in a twelvebar blues riff tried and truecouldnt make myself stray from the tune reality is just too scary jaime says give them a 7 and more im on break
