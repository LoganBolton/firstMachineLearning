shadows breathes the smell of new yorks streets like no film before it this kick off of cassavetes directorial work is as atmospheric as political and the initial spark for a renewal in american cinemabr br maybe it solicits for watching cassavetes first work in a double feature with another debut godards à bout de soufflé both films shaped the cinematic production of their countries beyond decades and both breathe a peculiar lightness and jauntiness which was later rarely achieved by those filmmakers in their careerbr br shadows tells from three afroamerican siblings ben ben carruthers lelia lelia goldoni and hugh hugh hurd the story is set in the new york jazz milieu and the driving rhythms on the soundtrack play a main part for the feverish sometimes almost dreamlike atmosphere which draws through the entire film theres not much happening in the plot the everyday life of the three siblings is defined by problems in love relationship or in their jobs but on both levels normality deceives without moralizing gestus cassavetes simply describes the mechanism of racial exclusion in public and in private life it was regarding to the cinematic depiction of racism a breakthrough film in the us br br this film owes also a lot to the performances of the three leading actors which were all almost completely unknown before especially ben carruthers established with his energetic portrayal the image of a new selfconception of young urban blacks in america an image which characterizes spike lees films of the 80s and 90s revealingly none of those three doubtlessly extremely talented actors was able to start a big career afterwards hollywood wasnt and isnt ready to ethnically expand its star system and that is why goldoni hurd and carruthers only found small artistic niches in tv and independent films later onbr br perhaps shadows is one of the less beautiful films ever shot and one of the most beautiful ones at the same time a film of shades and spaces with a camera that merely watches the stream of life in the crowded street corners bars hotel lobbies apartments inducing an intriguing ramble through new yorks vibrant streets
