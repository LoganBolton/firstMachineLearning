watching john cassavetes debut film is a strange experience even if youve seen improvisational films beforebr br the first thing you notice is its roughness right off its obvious some of the characters are screwing up their lines but then you step back from the situation as you sink deeper into these peoples intimate exchanges and you ask yourself do i ever stumble over my words the answer of course is sure we all do its unfortunate that most of the gaffes in this respect come early in the picture because by about twenty minutes youve sunk so deep in you wouldnt know it if a bomb went off behind youbr br the next thing you noticeor maybe you notice it hours or days after the film ends is that you never saw any substantial plot yet the themes and the poetry of the dialog and characters never leave you in fact the treatment of the role race plays in the everyday lives of these characters is always there but its so ephemeral that even they arent aware of how its informing their opinions of themselves their selfconsciousness their perceived status or the fate of their relationshipsbr br the title is appropriate because you get a full spectrum of blacks whites and graysand not just in the skin pigmentation of the characters leila goldoni truly remarkable here is an afroamericancaucasian her two brothers are white and dark afroamerican the irony is that they exist in what is undoubtedly the hippest most tolerant atmosphere of the timebeatdriven upper eastwest manhattenand there are still conflicts within and around themselvesbr br i dont think ive ever seen a movie with such a subtle delivery or technique its a lot like absorbing a really great piece of gallery art and then just nodding off in bliss as you think back to the images it evoked days laterbr br great mastering and extras on the criterion disc arguably the first truly experimental independent film ever made
