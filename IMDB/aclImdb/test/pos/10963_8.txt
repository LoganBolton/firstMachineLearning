in the end credits of shadows after we read directed by john cassavetes some white letters on the screen can be seen the film you have just seen is improvised they say i am always pursuing the fact that words are so important in movies since filmmakers started using them because basically theres no film without a screenplay and many other reasonsbr br cassavetes pursued the same goal and he believed in the freedom of words shadows is the perfect example its a film with no real main characters with no real main plot lines its mostly people in different situations talking yes some of the situations are connected but cassavetes apparently always in a rush to get to the talking uses a fast forward technique when the characters are going somewhere or escaping from someone and are not speakingbr br appearances are everything in this movie for example theres a brilliant score full of jazz influences and a lot of fantastic solos and theres one character that says hes a jazz musician and plays the trumpet ben all the characters names are the same names the actors however we never see him play the trumpet or jam with a band he doesnt even talk about music and just wanders with his friends around the city they do talk a lot and about anything thats in their minds going from how intelligent each of them are to the hilarious analysis of a sculpturebr br shadows is funny in its intellectual references in parts like the one above because these friends are not cultured the only important female character in the film lelia though wants to be an intellectual but again she has one very interesting conversation with an older man at a party about a book shes trying to write and about how to confront reality but nothing to do with being intellectual at that same party a woman is actually making an intellectual statement full of complexity and asks a guy beside her do you agree yes he says but you can tell he doesnt know what shes talking aboutbr br another character a singer hugh talks about his glory days in occasions and we see him perform only once but no references to the musical industry there the focus of cassavetes is the singers relationship with his manager rupert which most of the time involves chats about trivial stuff and not real musical talks so the trumpet players important deal in shadows is the time he spends with his friends the intellectual wannabe girls is her way of handling romantic relationships one of the movies strong points and the singers is the bond with his managerappearancesbr br the reason why performances are not important in this movie is simple cassavetes needed people who could master improvisation without mattering if they were actually good i believe some of them arent but they surely know how to improvise in a scene and you can notice how well they do it shadows is not about performers its about a way of making cinema based on the magic of conversation and there you could say that performances mean somethingbr br thats why in every conversation the camera is like a stalker constantly on the eyes of every character constantly looking for the expressions that come with natural speech theres a scene where the trumpet player and his friends are trying to pick up some girls they are three so each of them sits beside one girl the girls are three two in three different tables they all talk at the same time and the camera shoots through the table and sometimes the friends look at each other while they say whatever they are sayingits natural
