in many ways the filmic career of independent filmmaking legend john cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like alfred hitchcock the consummate studio director where hitchcock infamously treated his actors as cattle cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally where every element in a hitchcock shot is composed immaculately cassavetes cared less for the way a scene was figuratively composed than in how it felt or what it conveyed emotionally hitchcocks tales were always plotfirst narratives with the human element put in the background cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films if some things did not make much sense logically so be itbr br one can see this even from his very first film 1959s shadows filmed with a 16mm handheld camera on a shoe string budget of about 40000 in manhattan with cassavetes acting workshop repertory company and touted as an improvisatory film the story is rather simple as it follows the lives of three black sibling manhattanites benny ben carruthers a trumpeter and no account hugh hugh hurd a washed up singer and lelia lelia goldoni the younger sister of both the films three main arcs deal with hughs failures as a nightclub crooner and his friendship with his manager rupert rupert crosse bennys perambulations in an about manhattan with his two no account pals and lelias lovelife first with a white boy tony anthony ray who does not realize lightskinned lelias race even after bedding her then with stiff and proper davey davey jones who may be a misogynistbr br in the first arc nothing much happens except darkskinned hugh gets to pontificate on how degraded he feels to be singing in low class nightclubs and opening shows for girly acts he dreams of making it big in new york or even paris but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue deluding himself of his meager skill for the one time we actually get to hear him sing he shows hes a marginal talent at best that rupert keeps encouraging him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work but this is the least important of the three arcsÂ… while this film is better overall than say martin scorseses first film a decade later whos that knocking at my door another tale of failed romance and frustrated new yorkers it has none of the brilliant moments actingwise nor cinematographically that that film has it also is not naturalistic for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve especially in film although the 1950s era manhattan exteriors at ground level is a gem to relive while shadows may indeed be an important film in regards to the history of the independent film circuit it certainly is nowhere near a great film parts of it are preachy poorly acted scenes end willynilly almost like blackout sketches and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle all in all its a very sloppy job especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of synch with the rest of the film as cassavetes proved that as a director at least in his first film he was a good actor the only reason for anyone to see shadows is because cassavetes ultimately got better with later films and this gives a clue as to his later working stylebr br the national film registry has rightly declared this film worthy of preservation as culturally significant this is all in keeping with the credo of art cassavetes long championed as typified by this quote ive never seen an exploding helicopter ive never seen anybody go and blow somebodys head off so why should i make films about them but i have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way ive seen people withdraw ive seen people hide behind political ideas behind dope behind the sexual revolution behind fascism behind hypocrisy and ive myself done all these things so i can understand them what we are saying is so gentle its gentleness we have problems terrible problems but our problems are human problems that this film is culturally significant is true but that truth is not synonymous with its being artistically significant it is in the difference between these two definitions where great art truly thrives
