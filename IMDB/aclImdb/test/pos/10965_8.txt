1st watched 8262001  8 out of 10 dirjohn cassavetes welldone early independent film by cassavetes introduced a style that was much different than what hollywood shows its audience this movie also introduced some very taboo subjects especially the actual racism that probably was prevalent all over the country but was not displayed by the mostly white controlled filmmakers of the time about the only black actors that had much respect at this time were the ones that acted and displayed personality like whitesaka sidney poitier besides this the idea of ending a film without truly concluding the relationships that began leaves many moviegoers dumbfounded but actually makes the viewers realize that life is like thisit goes on i prefer this kind of an ending because it makes you think more about the characters and what may happen next and the conclusions are not just laid out for you the movie follows the lives of peopleparticulary a couple of people who have a brief relationship and happen to be opposite skin colors then we watch what happens when the white man realizes what hes done this is done very well and makes the movie very special the acting is supposedly done improvisationally which makes the movie even more amazing i guess you can say i liked this movie if you cant tell if you can find it check out this classic early independent film
