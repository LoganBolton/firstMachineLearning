it ends with the declaration that the film you have just seen was an improvisationat once making you feel like an idiot for thinking an improvisation was an good movie and astounded at cassavetes geniusonce again of course cassavetes told some guy it wasnt really an improvisation per se on his deathbed soits the story about a lightskinned black woman lelia who passes for white and her family another passingforwhite brother named ben and a blackblack brother named hughie when she falls in love with a white jerk named tony he is unpleasantly surprised when he finds out shes black and from there it goes on about the three main characters individual aspirations and shortcomings hughie is a jazz singer in the process of becoming a failure lelias still hopelessly depressed over tony and ben is angsty and violent in general in desperate need of something to shock him out of his stale patterns of existence overall i suppose its really about stasis vs change in human life i suspect that cassavetes had the plot organized enough and it was just the dialogue that was improvised the dialogue itself is very uneven  sometimes somebody will say something very memorable other times its memorably awkward whats amazing is the extent of the amateur actors embodiment of their characters cassavetes went through the acting class he was teaching at the time he decided to do shadows whispered in the ears of the ten best students and this was the resultthe guys playing ben and hughie are very good at first i didnt like lelia but as the film progressed you see more and more shes one of those actors who gets better as the tension and drama builds  not necessarily the best with small talk shadows is hailed by many as the forerunner of the indie film movement made in 1959 and its definitely recommended
