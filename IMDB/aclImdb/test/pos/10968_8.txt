i had never seen a film by john cassavetes up until two years ago when i first saw the killing of a chinese bookie in a berlin cinema which i found interesting to put it diplomatically but not so special i instantly wanted to see more of his work since then i tried  with an emphasis on tried  watching his other work shadows in particular i must admit it took me a a while before i actually enjoyed the film at first the unpolished raw and improvised way cassavetes it was shot put me off somewhat and i thought of it as an original  absolutely  but flawed and dated experiment but now upon reviewing these little imperfections make it look so fresh even todaybr br shot on a minimal budget of 40000 with a skeleton six person crew shadows offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an africanamerican family in which two of the three siblings ben ben carruthers and lelia lelia goldoni are lightskinned and able to pass for white cassavetes demanded that the actors retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group but saw the film as being concerned with human problems as opposed imply to racial ones cassavetes shot the film in ten minute takes and jagged editing a reaction against seamless hollywood production values cassavetes main inspiration  at least in the cinematic style the film was shot  were the italian neorealists whilst also professing admiration for welles pioneering spirit the use of amateurs and improvisation might resemble some of the italian neorealist directors but with his bebop score by charles mingus ans shafi hadi the film feels very different very american unlike anything made before really br br the song with the feathered girls i feel like a lollypop or something feels like light years back to me ancient history but no matter how dated it might look it still makes a delightful time capsule of late fifties new york today i think its this is one of the first films made aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film without hollywood improvised and without a real budget seymour cassel who acted and was involved in shadows claims it was jules dassins the naked city 1948 that was the first and inspired them all but i think this was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent american filmmakersbr br camera obscura  810
