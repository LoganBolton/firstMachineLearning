this was really a pleasure to see the dialogue was  for the most part  absolutely outstanding i thought the womens roles were a little better written which is a nice surprise the performances were uniformly very good too frank gorshin overdoes it a little when he goes into his various cons but this might be his overcompensating for what i see as weaknesses in how the character is written hes very good otherwise harry groener does similarly well with a slightly underwritten character tony overdoing some of the characters angrier scenes slightly ursula burton is excellent as sister theresa really carrying the film through some of its weaknesses seymour cassel and louise fletcher are a little underused here though i liked their work as always shirley jones wendie malick jill eikenberry and faye grant are very good also i couldnt help thinking grant reminded me a little of catherine ohara here cloris leachman rather tears into her role with reasonably good resultsbr br i wish there had been more of a sure hand behind the camera though sometimes the framing or staging seemed a bit off or awkward the closeups seemed overused or erratically used to me and we dont always go from scene to scene as smoothly as wed like some of the tough guy approach to the federal agent music costuming was too over the top for me as well and the few fantasy sequences didnt really work but there are things that were very well done the opening sequence set in buffalo around 1970 for example and frankly all of the scenes regarding theresas church work i suspect the writer and actress liked the character a lot which helps the scenes between malick and eikenberry are very goodbr br the plot is probably a bit overcontrived  there seem to be a few too many schemes going on at once to keep them all straight at times and the coincidences got to be a little too much and i was a little bothered by the ending should we really be rooting for their biggest con yet to succeed but the ride along the way is very enjoyable it would be nice to see more independent movies like this one madebr br 7 of 10
