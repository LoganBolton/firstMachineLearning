yes maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that doesnt take anything away from the films charm and wonder it was shown as part of our towns youth film festival and was the organising committees favourite which is not surprising the subject matter  coming together in a racetorn though postapartheid south africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspirational of course as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject matter belies these shortcomings i saw this with my wife and we returned the same evening with the children a film to watch meditate discuss and act upon
