manna from heaven is heavenly this is a movie for the family  teens and grandparents can enjoy it together but it isnt syrupy sweet or silly the characters really are characters the plot is somewhat complex and you have to pay attention but its like putting a puzzle together as it all falls into place bit by bit the period beginning is like watching an old photo album or remembering back when its extremely well done with very accurate hairstyles and costumes the story moves along quickly with twists turns and lots of funbr br a special treat is to watch the large cast of familiar faces many of whom we havent seen in much too long a time part of the fun is to recognize and name them mentally as they appear though this can be distracting cloris leachman by the end of the film looks as if shes had a makeover on oprah i had never seen faye grant in a movie  only knew her as graces mother in the tv series saving grace she was great even minus the southern accent and i didnt even recognize shelly duvall the five sisters who created this very lovely film are a very talented quintet and sister theresa is a heavenly treasure
