i would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing funfilled thoughtprovoking movie the absence of sex vulgarities and violence made for a most pleasant evening i especially enjoyed the buffalo scene but thats probably because i live a short distance from there even so this film could have been produced in any city its the theme thats so important here im just grateful that manna from heaven dropped down on us try ityoull like it
