when i first saw the movie i thought it was sweet  a family movie for the rest of the night and over the next couple of days though clever moments and funny lines kept creeping back into my thoughts and our conversation theres a lot going on classic elements of farce good character acting and wendie malicks story line is just hysterical labelling it a feelgood movie belies the wit and fun  its smarter than it seems just like its a wonderful life is
