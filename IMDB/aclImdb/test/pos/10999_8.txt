the squire of gothos is one of the sillier episodes of star trek and therefore one of the most entertaining ones the entertainment factor is generally speaking fueled by the standoff between william shatner and the episodes hilarious guest star william campbellbr br during an unspecified routine mission sulu suddenly vanishes into thin air and kirk follows soon afterwards spock immediately begins looking for his missing colleagues and though hed hate to admit it friends while the two stranded crewmen must deal with the mysterious allpowerful flamboyant trelane campbell the selfproclaimed squire of gothos a being capable of creating or destroying anything he wants through the sheer power of his mindbr br at first sight the plot may seem recycled from previous episodes honestly are there any scifi shows that didnt feature at least one godlike character but that feeling vanishes pretty quickly thanks to the scripts winning use of exaggerated humor all conveyed through campbells deliberately camp performance his trelane is essentially the trek version of a spoiled child in the body of an adult while his ignorancefueled curiosity for the human race his knowledge is quite limited probably served as inspiration for gene roddenberry when he came up with the character of q for the next generation pilot some two decades after this episode airedbr br in short the key to appreciating the squire of gothos is this silly doesnt necessarily equal bad
