i did enjoy watching squire trelane jerk around the crew in this episode though after a while the whole thing just seemed a little too long sure the histrionics were kind of funny for a while and the ending was a pretty good way to wrap the whole thing together i think the problem was that i enjoyed seeing trelane when he was full of bravado and fun the fun seemed to vanish when trelane became vindictive and nasty talk about a mood killergoing from the obnoxious but affable host to the guy sentencing kirk to death but despite this the episode was enjoyable and worth my time for diehard trekkies this is a mustsee for others its just a pretty run of the mill one
