in the squire of gothos kirk and his crew encounter a powerful superbeing who keeps the captain bones and a few crewmembers captive for no apparent reason i could be wrong but i think this is the first star trek episode i ever saw and the program that made me hungry for more it is not one of the best episodes but the rocksolid premise of an alien being who putting the enterprises crew in a corner is the kind of situation that makes the show so much fun to watch in a way the superhumanoid anticipates one of star treks most famous characters next generations enigmatic q this episode is also memorable for creating a unique situation it is the first time uhura is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see what an endearing character uhuara can be when the story allows her too bad the show never fully explored this iconic figure
