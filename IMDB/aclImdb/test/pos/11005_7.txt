i think gerards comments on the doc hit the nail on the head interesting film but very long its definitely the antithesis to the new school of flashy sexy moorestyle docs there is no narrator no facts or side info interlaced and no other gimmicks what you see is what you get  a glimpse into the vanishing world of the saltmen of tibet as a huge doc fan i was surprised how much i lost attention with this film namely due to the length and lack of dialogue in the end though i would recommend it if the subject matter sounds interesting to you its beautifully shot informative and presents a valuable and closing window into the way of life of the tibetan saltmen and women   all important attributes of a good doc but do put on a big pot of coffee itll help
