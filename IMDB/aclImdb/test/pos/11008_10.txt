yes fassbinder and ballhaus are at the top of their game back in 1973 its about the same subject but in my opinion its a much better movie than the matrix 1999 at least it was 200 times cheaper very nice camera work by michael ballhaus and the wonderful albatross by fleetwood mac at the end fassbinder is creating a very moody tone for the whole film its a shame this movie was never released on dvd but now after 37 years they finally came to the conclusion that this tvmovie is not only one of the best fassbinder films altough there are quiet a lot best fassbinder films its a brilliant example for a sciencefiction movie done without much money buy it watch it
