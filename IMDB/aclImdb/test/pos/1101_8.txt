okso by minute 15 in the film theres still no dialoguebr br this film arrived to me in a padded sack from down under with sharpie encrypted info on the front i am a programmer from a north american fest and mod love was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential starter having preemd at the faraway moscowkarlovy vary interfacebr br straight away i thought this film is not for us no dialogue by minute 15 but kept watching anyway well well well it built and built and built and half way in i was involved in this film because like when you go to the zoo at first youre reticent but by the time you get to the dangerous snakes bit youre totally therebr br this film has a dangerousness not at all like the much hyped wolf creek but because it is so totally other in every way shape and form and seems to weave a web made up of all the fantasies of most independent firsttime helmers ie  gloomy weather redneck intrigue odd splicing eerie music and a plot which though imperfect and basic has a bit in common with one of the great aussie movies ie the cars that ate paris by wier but modern love is actually not really a very aussie movie in the sense of ockerishness and playful selfdeprecation that pervades many of that countrys films it works on a more nightmarish realm from the start no cellphones no brand names no ipods no gritty urban middleclass angst  just a dude married to a goodlooker an old volvo and a little boy son who has weird teeth and chucks stuff around oh and its set in weird seaside village where people all look slightly wrong photographed by nick matthews 237 and music by tom huzenroeder ten canoes mod luv succeeds where many aust movies fail  ie it stands up without regard to the godforsaken country that it comes out of instead it revels in a warped but entertaining riddle which the film itself cannot solve  and herein lies the weak linkwhat on earth does this film have to do with modern love the final minutes of the film seem to give an answer or at least hints at oneand as i sat and drank a coffee and ate my hersheys afterwards all that i could surmise was that this films helmer alex frayne will prob have a lot of fun with this one
