i like movies about quirky people one flew over the cuckoos nest is maybe my all time favorite so one can imagine i had a blast with this one its definitely not one to watch if you want to walk off smiling this movie is unpredictable and intense some scenes are downright frightening even after multiple viewings because this kind of stuff really can happen it will most definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride and after you see the ending if youre not deeply disturbed you really should check yourself for a pulsebr br the acting was phenomenal marcy with her rather extreme case of tourettes shifts from quirkycute to utterly terrifying sometimes appearing so outofcontrol that she looks like the undead seth was great too the focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on marcy though he happens to be the one that gains the most momentum as a blossoming characterbr br its a classic love story with some unconventional twists and its also my favorite love story next to true romance there are two bad reviews for it up here but one of the people who gave such a review didnt have his facts straight and admitted to not seeing the whole film while the other was just looking for some hollywood thrills without the deep characters and perhaps was a little thrown off by the apparent shallowness of the plot seeing as the end goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store the point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something normal or lighthearted this one is messed up and indie as can be and wont let you go until the heavy climax
