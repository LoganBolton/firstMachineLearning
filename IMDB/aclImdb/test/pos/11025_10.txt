henry thomas and robin tunny are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business its beyond me as to why they havent received more recognition than they have this movie is a perfect example of how boundless their abilities arebr br acting out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their speciality and if these characters aint odd im at a loss to find anyone who isbr br the story is funny romantic dramatic complicated and tragic i hated the ending but if i hadnt i wouldnt have loved the story as a whole so there ya go
