if it were possible to award a 10  this would be the one film i would choosebr br i remember catching this film on tv many many years ago  and fortunately being prepared enough to video it now my video copy is getting old video technology is outdated and im starting to worry that i may not be able to enjoy the delights of this movie for much longerbr br as a wildlife film it is superb as a film about the relationship between man and nature it surpasses anything screened before or since how can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten if such a thing as a lobbypressure group exists to push for the rerelease of this film count me in and send me the details prontobr br my guess is theres a mint to be made by anyone able to rerelease this in todays market
