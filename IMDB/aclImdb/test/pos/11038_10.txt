this world war ii popeye cartoon had some very good sight gags in it and its decidedly aboveaverage for its genre it was nicely drawn too with some great angles good detail andwell lots of interesting sightsbr br what it amounts to is popeye out at sea in his little boat and accidentally running into a small japanese boat with two guys on it incidentally why were the japs always pictured with big round glasses and bucked teeth br br anyway these harmlesslooking japanese sailors want popeye to sign a peace treaty oh boy thinks the gullible popeye wait until the admiral sees this in one of those great artwork scenes i was alluding to above we slowly see how that little japanese ship is really a big destroyerand popeye is in deepum water why you doublecrossing japansies yells our sailor manbr br how he gets out of the situation is fun to watch
