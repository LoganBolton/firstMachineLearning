id read all the negative reviews for anna christie you know the gripes about the static camera outdated acting and wordiness of the screenplay but when i viewed it yesterday i found it remarkably affecting and enjoyable yep clarence browns camera remains stationary for the most part and im pretty sure one of the microphones was concealed in the ships light yep theres a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences its an early talkie with primitive technical aspects but then theres garbo marie dressler george f marion and charles bickford all proving that great acting is timelessbr br i believe anna christie is still one of garbos most iconic performances and its a wonderful performance from the divine one in a role that is really quite atypical for her yes weve seen garbo weary and almost beaten yet never with bags under her eyes or her knocking back shots of whiskey garbo played so many delightful costume roles that to see her play a contemporary woman is fascinating shes not weighed down by heavy dresses or makeup this performance seems quite raw from garbobr br the plot from the oneill play follows weary swedish exprostitute anna and her reunion with her boozy seaman father annas had enough trouble for any girl of twenty as she tells drunken slovenly marthy dresslerin a bar she finds solace in a life at sea and romance with a roughhewn but goodhearted fisherman charles bickford but her past threatens to ruin it allbr br charles bickford is overlooked in garbos long line of largely inferior leading men hes one actor who can actually share the screen with her and not get swallowed up by her magical presence the pair have great chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with one another dressler can never be accused of underplaying and once again the grand dame is up to her old tricks but shes terrific and convincing in her role never annoying as in the dreadful dinner at eight ive never really heard of george f marion before but he was wonderful as garbos fatherbr br this is precode and rather gritty and dark by mgms standards i really enjoyed it and while it may creak in some places its still wonderful
