for greta garbos first talking picture mgm wisely chose eugene oneills pultizer prize winning 1921 play anna christie br br also wisely the producers backed garbo up with not one but two members of the original broadway cast george marion as annas father chris and james t mack as johnny the priest  transmuted to johnny the harp for films so as not to offend br br this little change is interesting like too many films accused by those who want movies to be movies and ignore their origins of being little more than filmed stage plays the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldnt be more faithful to the property by diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldnt offend anyone or opening it up because they could too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place br br fortunately the respect the studio had for both oneill and garbo allowed anna christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in frances marions generally sensitive screen adaptation wonder of wonders marion even allows the point of the scene where garbos anna reveals her past on the farm to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact what the league of decency must have thought of that br br the source plays greatest problem has always been that chriss friend marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that anna can take stage  the two sides of the genuinely good woman men dont always recognize br br the perfectly cast marie dressler who had cut her teeth on the broadway stage as well before going to hollywood is the perfect balance for garbos anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only 90 minutes doesnt allow us too much time to miss her  one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original  and screenwriter marion is wise enough to stray from oneill to bring dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of julie lavernes second act appearance in show boat br br anna and marthys early scene together on screen 16 minutes into the film taking each others measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece not to be missed br br anna christie is great tragic play and a good film drama its hard to imagine that a latter day remake which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake it was first filmed without sound in 1923  also with george marions original broadway chris could improve on this excellent filming br br the internal scenes hew closest to the play but the exteriors shouldnt be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere while the background screen work is not to modern technical standards the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set especially in the new york harborbr br nearly all garbos naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly only the too often parodied death scene from camille 7 years later will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies but this anna christie together with the variety of her 1932 films mata hari and grand hotel and the sublime lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy ninotchka garbo laughs surely stand as her bestbr br oneill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded sea plays should track down the fine world war ii shaped film released in the year before the us entered the conflict the long voyage home 1940 it is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from anna christie and features a youngish john wayne in one of his rare nonwesterns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way
