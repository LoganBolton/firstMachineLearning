this is an amazingly wellfilmed early talkie adaptation of the eugene oneill play its major drawback is a static camera and as a result it comes off much of the time as the filmed play it is which is a pity for its a good piece of primitive moviemaking made at a time when sound was posing all kinds of technical problems and as a result most films were experimental whether or not this was their makers intention garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as she was in her silent films and her entrance is still classic her voice is strangely deep almost boyish which only enhances her already seductively eccentric persona as her boyfriend charles bickford is appropriately virilehe was apparently born craggyand a perfect counterpart to the divine garbo his irish brogue is not bad at all and he seems always a natural man of the sea very oneilllike in his independent brooding nature as garbos very confused father george marion seems truly from another time he has the sort of face and voiceopen unmannered totally without guilethat has vanished from the earth marie dressler is also in the oneill swing of things her blank expression and intensity around the eyes speaks volumes as she plays her boozy character as a woman at times bordering on psychosis poetic license perhaps as this is not in the script but we can forgive miss dresslers excesses she is too good at it not to the story ends with a movement to the next thing as distinct from resolution which isnt the authors cup of tea and those who like their films neatly worked out in the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise in anna christie we are in oneill country a place of sea storms and fog a feeling of allpervading and damnable uncertainty which we would now call ambivilance or anxiety neurosis rather than analyze this mood the author simply and wisely presents it as weather land ocean and people intertwine and address one another in a unique language we feel priveleged to have heard
