received this dvd from the accent range which is a label which specializes in arthouse flics they released irreversible and a range of bergmans opusbr br the thing that struck me about alex fraynes strangely titled film modern love is that it is an impeccable film that breathes with perfection and vision a film that takes us into the mind of mr joe average replete with voices in the head visions and madness its set in rural redneck australia the film doesnt trivialise or praise the folks like so many australian movies ie our films are full of loveable rogues or people with hearts of gold etc etc etcbr br not in this film the spirit of stanley kubrick looms large here its not flawless but has a mesmerising attention to details a romantic streak and a mood that is bracing if not embraceablebr br minor quibblesthe transfer looks faulty  front credits were sliced they dont fit in framebr br also one of the short films is corrupted it stops half way
