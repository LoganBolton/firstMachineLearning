i thought nick gomezs look at the gritty streets of new jersey where carjackings are at an alltime high was both thoughtprovoking and entertaining this is just as good as movies like boyz n the hood or menace ii society or above the rim i thought the actors and the scenarios were suitable it had a gritty realistic feel to it and was very atmospheric whether on purpose or by raw coincidence i liked this movie a lot an underrated gem i found on tv and glad i caught it go watch this movie if you get a shot if they dont have a dvd they should release one well done nick gomez imdb rating 59 my rating 910
