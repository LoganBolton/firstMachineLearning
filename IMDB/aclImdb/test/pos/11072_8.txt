i lived in that area hoboken and jersey cityfor about ten years this film certainly captures the feel of that time and place the dialogue is very good the music is right and scenarios realistic as another poster said it looks almost like a documentarybr br i like the way it humanizes these kids who probably would have rather have been born in westchester but fall into what kids fall into it just so happens that area is pretty roughbr br they overdemonize the cops quite a bit but thats to be expected id say the acting is good allaround toobr br it gives the viewer some sense of how this idiocy is caused and gets blown outofproportion hopefully the new mayor of newark is making progress
