this movie brings to mind boys n the hood menace to society south central and others of its ilk and even shares actors with some of them the films us vs the law mentality is underscored by the allblack neighborhood vs the nearly allwhite police force here the cops are so bad they seem like caricatures and in one scene they even ambush the boys as they drive by in a car theyve just liberated from its owner its like a bushwhacking from an old western but the contemporary setting makes it look all too realbr br the story centers on young jason petty and his buddies to whom school is just an inconvenience that takes time away from their real occupation of boosting cars this happens to be newark nj a rustbelt city low on jobs but notoriously high on crime in fact the problem is so severe that the cops all have car theft written on their backs to show that an entire unit must be devoted to this particular crimebr br the boys use a slim jim to gleefully break into cars and go joyriding as if its no big deal they only run into real trouble when the police ambush them the vicious nazilike lt has a vendetta against the boys seeing them not as human beings who might be worthy of redemption but as human targets in fact hes a little reminiscent of that sadistic nazi officer of the warsaw ghetto who shot down jews for pleasure in the film schindlers list when the boys steal a police car in retribution for the ambush things predictably go downhill fast they are severely beaten by the cops and jason finally ends up in prison clearly these are bad boys whod steal your car in a minute but the film wants us to see them as antiheroes showing jason protecting his sister and his friend taking care of his own grandmother the film left us wondering whose side to take and who to feel sadder for the boys whose lives are going down the drain the honest citizens whose cars are being stolen left and right and who could be caught in the crossfire of a shootout at any moment or the city of newark itself the spirit of whose law is being betrayed by brutal souldead copsbr br in spite of the overthetop portrayal of the latter the film offers a realisticlooking rendering of the ghetto of the protagonists and their families and of the culture of car theft in a city where there appears to be only 2 career paths  law enforcement and crime strangely the entire subject of drugs is never mentionedbr br the filmmakers including producer spike lee are obviously biased against the newark police who we hope are not as bad they are portrayed here nevertheless theyve given us yet another a strong affecting story about the inner city and black youth gone awry and sharron corley is fine as jason
