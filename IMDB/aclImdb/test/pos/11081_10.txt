 sings david bovie in this movie but it is its all about america so dont be ashamed to watch it just think if you can to prevent more damage you know youre just the same regular guy next door so be careful one of the best critics of common mind and friendship still dont care go for it for the music  its worth a try just close your eyes and pat metheny and david bowie will touch you so deep youll start to scream and while watching if youll dare to open your eyes please dont do the popcornstuff youre gonna miss quite a lot you may think that its not worth but think twice  and dont look at your neighbours lawn  you never know what to find there is it worth try it just dont die or gloat over it
