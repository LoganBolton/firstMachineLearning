true stories make the best stories dont they theres always something enjoyable about a story be it novel or movie or whatever simply by the fact that its real makes the story all the more fascinating this movie is based on a true story of two young american men one a government employee and falcon enthusiastchris boyce timothy huttonand the otherandrew daulton lee sean pennis a drug dealer these two begin selling government mostly cia secrets in 1975 to the soviet unionbr br the film focuses on the human aspect of the two men as well as their growing personal problems especially penns character with everworsening drug addictions rather than glorifying their status as traitors to america which would no doubt hurt the films credibility in the us boyce gradually becomes more cautious and eventually frustrated and paranoid as their dealings drag on and they dig ever deeper into treacherous territory daulton becomes more dependent and addicted to cocaine and heroin as he becomes more frightened and more desperate to maintain control over a situation he has no control overon top of which he already has problems with the law the torment of boyce and daultons families because of the way they lead their lives is also well portrayed and adds well to the idea that espionage against ones country even if thought to be done justly leads only to major problems and the ruination of livesincluding the degradation of the friendship and trust between the two main charactersbr br heres the breakdownbr br the goodbr br hutton and penn each did extensive research on the characters to capture their individual look and feel so theyre portrayed with extensive depth and realismbr br the acting is excellentbr br the atmosphere of paranoia builds quite wellbr br the story is fascinating and of course as one based on actual events it has some added kickbr br nice setsbr br the soviets working with the boyce and daulton are portrayed very well and not stereotyped or given evil consciences just for the sake of making them look badbr br didnt hurt it didnt helpbr br the music is alright nothing perfect thoughbr br sound effects are occasionally a little iffysuch was the case with a lot of films from the seventies through the eightiesbr br the badbr br chris boyce timothy hutton has a relationship with a woman that we hardly know because of boyces trouble brewing with the us and soviet governments her life can be put in jeopardybut this isnt as expanded upon as it feels it shouldve been minor problem thoughbr br the uglybr br the apparent simplicity required to sell government secrets is a little unnerving nothing like a constant state of unreadiness to keep the masses feeling as unsafe as possiblebr br memorable scenebr br seeing the first cia report accidentally sent to the wrong place with the reason being rough nightbr br this was another film that suffered massive delays due to the controversial content of the story studios and producers didnt see how a movie about two american traitors could ever be accepted by american audiences luckily its filmed and portrayed with a high degree of class and quality of course it helps that the traitorous antiheroes arent portrayed heroicallymore like a couple young men whove made gross errors in judgment in their lives as such it becomes a very human drama and one portrayed very well and very believablybr br acting 910 story 1010 atmosphere 810 cinematography 810 character development 910 special effectsmakeup 810 little quantity high quality nuditysexuality 210 one scene in a strip club violencegore 710 no gore just some violence music 710 direction 910br br cheesiness 010 crappiness 010br br overall 810br br if you like films about espionage and spies then you cant go wrong here if you like dramatic films with a strong focus on the humanity of the characters then this may also work for you highly recommendedbr br wwwresidenthazardcom
