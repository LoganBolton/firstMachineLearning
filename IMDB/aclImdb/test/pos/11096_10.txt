the falcon and the snowman is a superb example of an anti80s film while many other films of the decade in general lacked substance this film is pure substance theres nothing stylish or fake or superfluous about it it boasts two superb performances timothy hutton and sean penn as lifelong friends christopher boyce and daulton lee respectively hutton penn and tom cruise were a triumvirate of early 80s actors who all looked headed to much bigger and better things all 3 starred in taps while penn and cruises popularity soared hutton has been largely forgotten about and thats a shame actually hutton is the first of the 3 to win an oscar for supporting role in ordinary people in 1980 but i think his performance in this movie is even more outstandingbr br hutton really captures the postvietnam war rebelliousness in his character chris boyce a failed seminary school student chris has a lovehate relationship with his father well played by the great character actor pat hingle the scene where chris quotes the poem his father thought hed long forgotten is a particularly powerful onebr br chris gets job at dept of defense and uses his hatred of us govt and its foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the soviets he gets his buddy daulton a hyper drugdealing selfserver in on it to be the courier of the project plans on microfilm while chris is doing it based on his beliefs daulton is doing it strictly for the money the soviet liaison is excellently played by david suchet penn and suchet have a real quirky chemistry and its a kind of funny set of exchanges between them but make no mistake this film is anything but that it is a serious character study about pessimism malaise paranoia and mistrustbr br again the leads make this film hutton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as chris a rather smart young man who had so much potential penn as usual does a tremendous characterization as daulton a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks and most of the time doesnt think at all the ending of this factbased film is very saddening on several levels a truly powerful character study
