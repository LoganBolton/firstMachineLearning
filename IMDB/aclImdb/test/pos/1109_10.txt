i caught this movie at the glenwood cinemas at the weekend as part of the kansas international film festival which as usual has provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema br br i have been keen on australian film for a number of years so was pleased to learn that this film was included and i was certainly not disappointed br br superbly shot firmly directed its an eerie tale of one man and his journey to the heart of darkness as it were it reminded me a tad of lynchs wild at heart it has that strange madness in it but i was glued to the movie for other reasons  namely that it presents a portrait of australia which iswell very believablebr br i have vacationed to the land down under a number of times once in the 1980s and again about 7 years ago with my wife br br i dont wish to go to great lengths explaining my vacations but the director frayne appears to have a grasp on much that i find so odd and eccentric about australia a country that is responsible for the extremities of say nick cave on one hand and steve irwin the crocodile hunter on the otherbr br one incy wincy whinge   i would have preferred even more of the unknown australia much more in fact but i also realise that theres only 1 and a half hours to do it all in sighbr br overall though this movie is very very accomplished
