john schelesingers career as a film director was extraordinary we had watched this film when it first came out but wanted to see it again when it showed on cable recently the film has a faded look as one watches it today but still it is interesting because of the intense performances of the two principalsbr br if you havent seen it please dont read any furtherbr br chris and daulton were two childhood friends that came from upper middle class backgrounds chris went to enter a seminary to be a priest but gives up daulton became a small time drug user and trafficker the two lives seem to run parallel as the pair become involved in an illegal activity that will prove their short sightedness in fact it shows how both young men miscalculate in their attempt to fool the cia and the soviet union these two in a way were so naive in thinking they could pull something that bigger and better equipped people couldnt even imagine could be donebr br chris motivation is legitimate as he feels outraged in discovering the underhanded role of the agency for which he works in dealing with other nations in this case australia something he finds by sheer coincidence when he involves daulton we know the whole thing is doomed because no one into drugs as he is will ever amount to anything in fact chris and daulton had no conception of the scope of what they are trying to do or its consequencesbr br timothy hutton was at this period of his career an actor that was going places he had proved he had talent with his work in other films so it was a natural choice for mr schlesinger to select him a choice that pays off well sean penn also was a young actor who showed an intensity like one hadnt seen before in fact at times mr penn reminded us of a young robert mitchum in the making both actors contribution to the film is incredible one cant think who could have played this duo but thembr br the falcon and the snowman while not up to the par with other great john schlesingers movies is an interesting look to our not too distant past
