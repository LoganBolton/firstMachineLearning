for the 1980s this is a very dark movie at this point filmmakers were beginning to operate under the assumption that all films require smarmy comic relief which of course is taken to the extreme today flashy action scenes even more overdone today or steamy sex scenesbr br hutton and penn are stupendous in their roles as childhood friends turned soviet spies penn in particular is brilliant as hapless drug dealer daulton leebr br what you have here is a true thrillerdrama there is no eye candy to speak of but the story is so compelling and the acting so superb that hopefully most people wouldnt miss it there are a couple amusing scenes in particular the one where penn tries to get his soviet benefactors involved in a major drugrunning dealbr br well worth watching
