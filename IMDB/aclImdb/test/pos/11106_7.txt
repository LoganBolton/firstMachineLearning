late night on bbc1 was on my way to bed but curiosity piqued at a contemporaryset irish film so i stayed to watch for a few minutes and then stayed to the end i have to admit that the main attraction was the only english actress kelly reilly who is stunning to look atbr br this is billed as a black comedy which is one of the hardest things to pull off it should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughs so that in the end you dont know why youre laughing  for me martin scorseses after hours 1985 is the best example dead bodies is more black than comedy but the plot rattles along and spirals down towards further blackness i didnt spot the final twists in the tale as some other posters here did so i was suitably surprisedbr br as a snapshot of the irish film industry in 2003 it all seems rather worthy it doesnt look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make its money back the script couldve been a whole lot sharper but the acting was on the whole pretty good im glad i watched it flaws and all tho i dont think i learnt much about ireland today especially their policing methods
