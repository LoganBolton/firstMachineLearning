although at first glance this movie looks like the story of your parents high school life and many people will try to tell you that this movie is way outdated and i admit that that was my first impression but honestlythe lessons that are learned by the heroesheroines are def not outdated who doesnt want to be famous and who doesnt want do be accepted my their peers and the homosexual guyisnt there a whole controversy today about gay marriage blah blah this movie though released in the 80s still addresses some of the biggest issues in todays world this movie does have a little too much profanity and nudity for my taste though thus the 810 rating
