this movie was well done but it also made me feel very down at times as well for anyone that is considering show business this is a must see as it shows the raw deal in what goes on for these struggling workers the soundtrack was definitely cool and the acting and dancing complimented it nicely some of the students attitudes might have been a little farfetched like leroys especially because im sure someone like that wouldve been kicked out immediately for refusing to read and such if this was the real high school for performing arts the coco screen test is hard to watch for any people out there with weak stomachs please heed my warning while its very gritty i know its the truth on what happens so in this respect the movie is right on overall its entertaining and even though some parts drag on the majority goes by really quicklybr br final groupingbr br movies probably wouldve skipped this onebr br dvd purchase not something id need to see again and againbr br rental worth renting at least once in your life
