if your looking for a movie with fantastic music nice cast and a storyline that is not to difficult to understand fame is for youbr br i have several scenes that i love in this movie some make you laugh others make you contemplative the editing i think is wonderful really fast and often funny shure maybe there would have been some more potential in the whole thing all the storys stay somehow on the surface maybe a bit too many characters are involvedbut i dont care because the real stars arebr br the musical scenes one of my favorites the hotlunchjam sequence that piece is just so raw funky and filmed in a special way handcamerastyle in musichellbreakingloose its just electrifying i miss this raw energy in todays musicclips the only similar energy i found perhaps in bette midlers the rose all of the concert footageits about capturing something wild that is realy happening and not doing it just perfect take by takebr br so fame is a wonderful nostalgiatrip to when synthesizers where heavy and walkmans not availablei recommend it once a year sure not for everyone
