i truly hate musicals because music numbers just start out of the sudden and usually spoil scenes but this one is completely different  its simply brilliant plot perhaps isnt any challenge for the viewers but the simplicity of people life stories makes this movie greatbr br ive seen it at least dozen times and still im not tired with the plot characters or music i just love the soundtrack  its the only soundtrack that ive really wanted to have and most probably will remain the only one that i owebr br for me its a mustseen kind of movie great characters compiled with entertaining songs and a lot of things to think about after the movie end
