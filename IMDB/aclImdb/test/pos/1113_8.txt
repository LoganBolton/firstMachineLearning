the most vivid portrait of smalltown oddity ive seen in a long time and im not just talking about australian films this piece of work seems to have been made under the radar and really its an entirely fascinating piece of work that has a worldliness mostly unseen in recent aust film makingbr br at times it is rather slow and strange  it seems to meander hither and thither not really sure if its a thriller or a headmovie but the stunning aspect of the film by alex frayne is its iron fisted ruthless direction it never wavers it is highly controlled precise and absolutely selfassured the cinematography is some of the most artful beautiful and lyrical ive seen the sound is all psychological the music builds the tensionbr br by the third act the story is ramped up and episodes collide and converge  dont attempt to piece together the puzzle of the last 20 minutes its a bit of an impost  but by that time the film has you a bit of a trance a sort of hypnosis and youve been sold a riddle  that has no real answer
