those reviewers who have complained that this movie lacks plausibility or has problems of construction are missing the point this is a wonderfully camp romance with plenty of play gypsies dance gypsies music that both sends up exotic love stories and celebrates them buttonedup ray milland makes an amusing foil for a dietrich with black hair tattered scarves and tons of jewelry the characters eagerness to feed milland and look after him more closely resembles the good german hausfrau dietrich was off the set than her mannered vamp roles censorship being in force its made clear that they share a caravan on platonic terms only with milland fighting off dietrichs advances with a determination remarkable for a heterosexual bachelor who might be killed any day his only excuse is that she smells so perhaps a stuffy fastidious englishman might indeed be put offbr br in the small role of millands young companion on his secret mission bruce lester adds a note of camp of a different kind we are told at the beginning that he heroworships milland and indeed he rather fawns on him when after they are separated he meets milland now transformed into a brownskinned gypsy with a shirt open to the waist his glowing appreciation of the disguise even further suggests that not only dietrich is romantically infatuated with millandbr br despite the wonderfully improbable characters and sequence of events the growing love of milland for dietrich and his acceptance of the nonrational aspects of life is rather touching and when on their last night alone before he escapes he says that each of them now contain half of the other the two have become one and then darkness falls i think we can assume that the censor decided to give them a break one goofat the beginning milland who is supposed to be english refers to a lieutenant using the american pronunciation the english say leftenant since milland was british he must have been saying it that way because the american moviemakers feared that american audiences would be distracted and confused by the british style
