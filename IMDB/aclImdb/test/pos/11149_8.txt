having recently purchased universals marlene dietrich dvd collection i was somewhat reluctant to watch golden earrings the idea of a 40something marlene dietrich as a gypsy in a wartime romance seemed unusual and implausible i should not have worried with all the professional talent that went into these old movies its hard to miss really the movie was a joy to watch its a classicbr br the most interesting thing about the film was dietrich who pulls off the gypsy role perfectly the makeup lighting photography and her performance all add up to make a really startling and memorable character i had never seen dietrich play a good woman convincingly beforebut she does here she played a lot of heartless vamps in those great sternberg films so it is refreshing to see her in a more down to earth relaxed role playing an exotic but very human characterbr br overall a very nice romance the love story is believable optimistic and the happy ending is extremely satisfying
