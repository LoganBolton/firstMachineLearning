i am really surprised that this film only has a rating of 64 as of the time i did this review while not exactly a great film i do think its one of the best films dietrich did and its a shame it isnt more highly regarded i think a lot of the reason i liked the film so much is that the usual silly dietrich persona as the übervamp isnt present and her role required her to actually act i just hate seeing film after film after film in the early days of her career where she seemed more like a caricature or cliché than a real woman i dont necessarily blame dietrich for the silly vampish films she made in the 1930saudiences loved them and they did make her famous but here she showed she really could act after all just looking at her in films like morocco blonde venus and the blue angel who would have guessed that she was wellcast to play a gypsy i was quite prepared to hate the film because of this casting decision but it workedshe was pretty believable and a lot of fun to watch as well the film is essentially a vehicle just for ray milland and marlene dietrichthe other supporting characters are very much secondary to the movie milland is a wanted spy in prewwii germany and in his efforts to escape he stumbles upon a rather frisky lone gypsy dietrich who instantly takes him to be a fulfillment of prophecyin other words her new lover milland is quite stuffy but reluctantly agrees to travel in her wagoneven putting on body paint and piercing his ears to make him look like a gypsy hence the title to the movie over time he slowly starts to realize that underneath her very uncouth exterior is quite a woman and romance slowly blossomsbr br the film in a word is charming a nice romance with a good dose of comedy and funjust the sort of picture you wish hollywood still made also please note the performance of murvyn vye as zoltan he was very magnetic in the short time he was on film and i just loved his deep and beautiful voicebr br finally a sad note to consider while the film is set in germany no mention is made of the upcoming gypsy holocaust during the war throughout german territory the nazis exterminated a huge percentage of gypsies and so the final nice ending to the film is a tad farfetched
