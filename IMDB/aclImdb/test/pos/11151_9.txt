from a bare description of the toll gates major plot elements one might think its a revisionist western of the 60s or 70s br br  our hero is a robber killer and arsonist br br  the love interest is a single mother whose shiftless husband abandoned her and their child br br  twice our criminal hero is unofficially released by authorities in return for some good deed and this is presented as a praiseworthy actbr br  the only acts which are presented as truly evil are the betrayal of ones family and the betrayal of a criminal associatebr br  the hero tries to go straight but turns back to a life of crime after he cant get a jobbr br  the hero is on the run from both a sheriffs posse and a criminal gangbr br  the heros final redemption is accomplished by strangling a man with his bare hands and tossing his body over a cliffbr br  and the good bad man ends the film by sending the young mother and her child back to civilization and riding off alone into the mexican desert never presumably to pay for his life of crimebr br just goes to show you that there is nothing new under the sunbr br of course the toll gate doesnt display quite the cynicism or moral nihilism of its successors the heros redemption is set up when he surrenders to the posse after reading a passage from the bible cant quite imagine clint eastwood doing thatbr br the toll gate an excellent movie by any standard and hart was a very fine actor not given to the broad histrionics often used to convey emotion in the days before soundbr br 910
