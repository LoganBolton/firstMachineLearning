while i agree this was a 1950s sitcom i dont feel it was typical firstly donna reed was a strong woman unlike the regular 50s sitcom moms she made a stand for womens worth and equality remember the episode where the tv announcer says just a housewife and donna stands up for all women do and represent especially those that dont work outside the home and when the women rebelled against something in the series it was not something trivialit was always something to show that women have the right to be treated with the same respect as men remember donna reed was married to the shows producer so she had much more input into making hers a more powerful characterbr br the children were intelligent but not precocious they were normal kids and they could actbr br something else that made donna reed show stand out was not only did the children look like their parents but you could feel the chemistry between all the actors in the real life situation which then came out in the characters shelly fabares and paul peterson have often written and remarked that they were treated like the children of donna reed and carl betz and that the adults were fiercely protective of the child actors and treated them accordingly donna and alex also had somewhat of a sexual chemistry that wasnt seen on the other family shows and the characters could be flawed and in major ways and yet accepted for the flaws and mistakes these were not super parents that did no wrong and had no emotional highs and lows they were normal people acting as normal peoplebr br womens rights drug abuse child abuse single fathers poverty children who need good health care but cant afford itit was all shown on this show pretty groundbreaking for the erabr br donna reed show didnt last for eight years without a reason and it could have possibly endured had it not been for tony owens and donna reed divorcingbr br this show is highly underrated and should be shown so that other generations can appreciate qualitybr br in summary i agree with the original poster who obviously cares for the show but i think that the donna reed show has so much more to offer than casual entertainment
