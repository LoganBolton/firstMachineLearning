i saw this on the accent underground release with the short films i found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour  i was a little drunk and tiredbr br i went to bed and no kidding i had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep i couldnt stop thinking about why so i got up switched the tv back on loaded the dvd and saw the rest of the moviebr br well done alex frayne sir youve managed to implant your film into this old cynical movie goers head and that takes doing so 10 out of 10 to youbr br i cant say i love this film of yours but it has made a lasting impact despite its flaws and low budget etc
