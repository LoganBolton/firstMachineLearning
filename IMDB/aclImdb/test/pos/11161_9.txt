in complete contrast to the previous correspondent here i thought shoppen munich as it was billed when shown with english subtitles here in london at the german film festival in november 2007 was very funny very well acted and excellently scriptedbr br its quite audacious to design a 100minute film that consists exclusively and relentlessly of talking heads but i think ralf westhoff succeeded with wit and élan no standard filmic devices of say following a characters soulbaring pronouncement with some meditative minorseventhchord music and longshot nature cutaways but when someone said something that revealed their souls  well we were hustled on by the man with the timer for yet another superficial introduction which is of course the point the hurtling tickbox superficiality of thirtysomething urbanites where everything is down to a quick question and answerbr br maybe most films are so clichéd and stupid that we english are ready to laugh at any vaguely intelligent and uncontrived cinema but i can promise you that at the screening tonight curzon cinema sun 25 nov 2007 the full audience bellowed with laughter most of the way through so i wasnt the only one guffawingbr br my girlfriend who speaks german and has lived in munich thought it was hilarious i who dont speak german and have not been to munich i think thought it was hilarious id recommend shoppen munich to anyone especially couples looking for a smart witty original wise film about the superficiality of modern relationships and the bewilderment of the generation who feel theyve missed out on the happyeverafter stuff first time roundbr br nb in the english subtitled showing in london the subtitles which were very good were shown completely underneath the slightly reduced picture not inside it i thought this was a good thing
