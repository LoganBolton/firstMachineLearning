abcs version of the life of the late pope they put it just slightly ahead of cbss version and it may have suffered from that but the program itself was excellent it moved fast since it only had two hours with commercials also taking up time to cover this great mans long life but thomas kretschmann admirably was up to the challengehe did a remarkable job in conveying the emotions and strife that johnpaul enduredheunlike the cbs biopic played the role from youth to old age and managed to seem realistic at both ends of the scalehis credibility never waveredhe has an amazing range and depth it is a shame that the program could not have been longer and more detailed but working within the time frame they did havei think they did an excellent job bringing it to the small screen
