i read the comments about this movie before watching it and wasnt expecting much but as a b movie its a curiosity i guess you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy this kind of thing but i seriously thought it was awesome people should watch it just for the experience because its totally one of a kind dont expect much of it the acting is poor transitions were obviously done on a pc etc definitely a b movie but nonetheless really worth checking out very funny mild gore and some questionable themes so probably not something to show your gran but for the more adventurous viewer id say its a must see
