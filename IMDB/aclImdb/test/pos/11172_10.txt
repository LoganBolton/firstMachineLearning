michael kehoe has accomplished quite a feat especially considering it is only his second start as writer producer and director generally first timers lack vision and direction when helming a major production but dominion proves mr kehoe is going places in hollywood set with beautiful scenery dominion boasts experienced cast members especially thomerson  james who communicate kehoes vast vision with exceptional clarity few films can mix the slasherhorror genre with a genuine actionadventure feel but dominion accomplished this completely this film certainly qualifies as one of the topnotch films in both of these categories if you are looking for fastpaced action with more than a modicum of suspense look no further i look forward to kehoes future projects with great enthusiasm well done
