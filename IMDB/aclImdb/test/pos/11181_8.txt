on account of my unfortunately not being able to find them anywhere i have not gotten to try any of the other entries in the series although i certainly would not mind and trust me i have looked for anyone who does not know this is a pointandclick adventure title that means that the mouse is what you use to interface with everything that you can do so with in this though there is one particular case in this where that is inaccurate i wont spoil it here for anyone who havent yet tried it nevertheless regardless of how little experience you have with computers you can sit right down and try this there isnt even terribly many bits of this where you need to be fast or have swift reflexes heck you can adjust the speed of the textif you have it have subtitles on and thus of the talking in it and its not enormously awkward or forced when slow accessing your inventory is easy as well as combining or using items clicking and holding down the button at anything you can affect gives three options for what to use with itbe it a person a specific part of the surroundings or an object handpush pick up open etc eyesexamine look through etc and moutheat converse etc this all adds up to a welcoming friendly environment where you can approach the plentiful puzzlesthe amount of them is varied based on which of the two difficulty settings you try this on at your own pace and explore and take in the dozens of individual creatively done characters and areas in this to your hearts content the length of this will be determined by how much time you take to do suchyoull hear no blame from me theyre worth it and your skill at figuring out the solutions there are a few points in this where you get to decide if you want the harder way of completing that or not this can be enjoyed by anyone from any age theres no material that isnt acceptable for children this is one of the products that help prove that that very fact does not have to mean that it is intolerable for older audiences the animation is quality work smooth everything moves as it should and the 3rd dimension honestly isnt that sorely missed when trying this the storytelling is welldone and youre never unclear as to what is going on there are numerous welldirected cutscenes kept in the same colorful mostly bright 2d world as the rest with welldone camera motion cartoony is an appropriate word to describe this and not only the visual style it can be applied to all of this the entire world of this is very similar to but not quite the same as ours with a mix of past and present inhabited by people and filled with things that we can sort of recognize or understand at least portions of but the absurdity makes them funny that would have to be one of the greatest strengths of this right there its hilarious a lot of that comes from the lines spokenwhat is said as well as how it is and those who dig british efforts with focus on verbal the likes of allo allo or the blackadder franchise will want to check this sucker out however there are several different types of jokes including but not limited to the following satire cleverness dark spoofs irony grossout comedynot exactly my favorite aspect of this and more theres selfawareness with the lead addressing you personally and for example explaining why he isnt going to do what you just asked him to there are references to pop culture through a couple of decades almost all of it works hardly any gags fall flat and if you arent in stitches during this my best guess as to the reason would be that its simply not compatible with your sense of humor a situation that warrants no judgment and if one suspects that could be the case and wishes to find out i suggest the demo version where you for free can see if you care for the brand of play andor laughter the plot is wellwrittennearly all of this is really develops nicely throughout and keeps your interest well the audio is all excellent crisp and welldone the sound effects are spoton the music is wellcomposed with no exceptions the voice acting is impeccable with a celebrity or two armato is fantastic as guybrush threepwoodgotta love that name whom you control boen is incredible as lechuck the deceasedand still threatening zombie villain the designs are immensely welldone highly imaginative and all fit in spite of the relatively limited disposition of our hero when it comes to pirate deeds you do get to engage in some steer a ship board that of others and match blades in a rather unique and marvelously thought up way the replayability lies mainly in the choices during dialog etc this is linear with a tad freedom as far as the order goes so the buccaneer sitting down with this for at least the second time has not got that large an amount of possibilities as far as being challenged by this goes unless he or she has forgotten what to do in the meantime ah nothing is perfect anyone who would care to delve into a thoroughly wellcrafted and fascinating fictional universe and crack up countless times should get a real kick out of this the good kind not the ones that hurt and potentially leave bruises dont forget kids do not eat books that is just begging for a papercut i would wager a guess that those who like the others would appreciate this one too and theyre not the only ones who may get into this i recommend this to apart from members of aforementioned group any fan of this genre of vgs as well as anyone to whom this review appeals 810
