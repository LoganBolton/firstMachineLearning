the curse of monkey island released excactly 6 years after the success of monkey island 2 you would think with monkey island 2s wierd ending that it would finish monkey island once and for all but it all turned out to be a trick to lure guybrush into captivity but enough about that the whole jist of this is that monkey island has returned and the voices are just phenominal if lucasarts were to make a moviecartoon of monkey island this would probably be what it would look like and sound like its plot is real good and everything about it is just awesome if you havent heard about the monkey island series buy the monkey island archives or the monkey island booty pack and play through all the games starting with the secret of monkey island then monkey island 2 and the curse of monkey island monkey island 4 was real good but this one tops them all
