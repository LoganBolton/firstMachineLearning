one of the classic low budget 70s movies this film was found in a bargain video shop in london for only 50p interestingly the package lists the star of the film as charles bone who sounds like a porn star but once the credits role its obvious that the picture is aligned to far the right of the tv screen so that all the cast members have the last letter missing from their namesbr br from the moment the narrator lamely introduces us to the situation that the desperate tenants of a grimy new york city apartment block you know youre in for a rollercoaster ride of fromage the direction is from the ed wood onetake school  if one or two extras were looking at the camera crew then what the hellbr br the films finishes with a plot twist that puts the usual suspects to shame buy it now
