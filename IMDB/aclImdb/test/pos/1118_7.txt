walter matthau can always improve a mediocre film and this movie proves it he turns in a very realistic performance as a smalltime horse trainer and single father not sugarcoating either rolebr br he can be by turns softhearted and doting then ironhanded to his boys and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to horse training we see that he doesnt want his young prospect racing horse overworked and hurt in smalltime races but he seems to be willing to risk the horses life when he gets into the big timebr br this is just one of matthaus wonderful performances and one that i highly recommend
