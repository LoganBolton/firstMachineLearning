perhaps many viewers who got frustrated by this film live their lives without ever thinking deeply about life itself what i want to point out here is that distant is not only an arthouse film but one of the best arthouse films from all the arthouse films i have seen distant is the one that really stands out as a glittering piece of gold it is even fair to say that this films cinematography and depiction of human emotion surpass tarkovskys nostalgia one commentator got it right that sex a jaded common feature among foreign films is surprisingly lacking in distant and in a good way what is most remarkable about distant is that it captures the details of life we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence that often gets buried under the din and visual extravaganza of our commercialized world fortunately distant doesnt have that much to spare the audiences and what we see on the screen is a bare portrait of human beings
