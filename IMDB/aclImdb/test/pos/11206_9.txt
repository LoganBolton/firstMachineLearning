when youre watching distant you know youre not watching a french movie theres little sex and its mostly elliptical and people dont talk that much here there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations just to let you make sense of whats going on it doesnt look american either there arent any car chases or shootouts or violence unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of getting by a subdued catastrophe at times the relatively longheld mediumdistance shots may remind you of contemplative asian cinema but just reminds you the director doesnt push things to the radical minimalism of some taiwanese filmmakers but then again this is not a taiwanese movie its a turkish movie i dont know what that means i dont even know if thats supposed to mean somethingbr br the movie doesnt have a plot proper and yet those few lines those somewhat longheld shots and that often mitigated tension gradually build a sense of something happening a sense of plot for lack of a better word that grows on you by the end of the movie you may get the feeling youre going to miss those two cousins who have many things in common but are worlds apart
