hysterically painful perhaps the kind of movie chekhov would have made had he made movies whats really funny is that the two cousins have so very much in common many descriptions of their relationship on this site are dead wrongbr br whats really funny and uncomfortable about these characters is that they just cant bring themselves to talk to each other  or anyone else its horrible if youve ever been too shy worried selfinvolved or just plain scared to talk to someone and who hasnt youll definitely see yourself in this film and it wont be prettybr br it holds a mirror up to the audience and says if you dont like what you see change it
