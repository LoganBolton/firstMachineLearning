its probably a year since i saw uzak but it has left strong memories of the two main characters jaded photographer mahmut and his naive cousin from the village yusufbr br its a long film with very little dialogue and a quite limited plot this has evidently annoyed a fair few viewers but the film constructs such a painfully believable portrait of mahmut and yusuf that theres just as much emotional tension as in the paciest thrillerbr br just to be clear theres no padding in this film  in the long pauses where no one speaks there as much happening in the characters emotions and in yours watching them as you could bear go to see it awake and alert and youll be gripped rather than anaesthetisedbr br uzak rings true in so many ways and that sincerity is probably its greatest accomplishment people dont grapple with events and problems so much as with each other in fact in the whole film theres probably not one point where the main characters mahmut yusuf and mahmuts exwife nazan are not opposedbr br much of it is true the world over country cousin yusufs perhaps wilfully naive expectation that a job on a ship will drop into his lap mahmuts urbanised cynicism and unwillingness to sympathise with yusufbr br other truths are morespecific to turkey yusufs incomprehension that mahmut might be tolerating his stay with gritted teeth yusuf veering between macho ambition and wideeyed awkwardness when he tries to get to know a womanbr br uzak is undoubtedly a pretty bleak film and one ceylans strengths is not to beat us over the head with the themes he explores for me at least i believed entirely in the behaviour of his characters all the little failed attempts to connect and petty cruelties ring so true and yet i didnt leave with a message that the world is like that but instead i got this is how we sometimes treat each other
