another of the endless amount of cookiecutter kickboxers fight to the death for the amusement of wealthy scumbags films that there were so many of in the 90s yknow the ones created by taking the words death blood and steel and the words ring fight match and cage and putting them in a random generator saying that though death match is a pretty good entry in the overused genre thanks to its exciting fight scenes and the surprisingly good acting of its kickboxer castbr br the story concerns two buddies  exkickboxing world champion john larson played by pugfaced middleweight kickboxing champ ian jacklin probably previously best known for his awful performance as the main villain in ring of fire 2 and nick wallace nick hill a likable guy probably best known for the role of streetfighter sergio in bloodsport 2 who work the la docks loading crates onto ships one discovery of a boxful of guns and a brief fight later our two heroes are jobless and propping up an la bar sensible john larson decides to head north and look for a job headstrong nick wallace has heard of a guy paying good money for fighters to fight in private kickboxing matches why should things change says john  if you need me ill be there predictably enough it isnt long before nick has gone missing and his good friend is fighting in the deadly ring of death trying to find a lead to his missing buddybr br sure enough there are no prizes for originality here but like i said before this films strength lies in its action its cast of reallife fighters and the fairly good performances it manages to wring from them ian jacklin in particular surprised me previously id just seen him as the bad guy in ring of fire 2 and in bitparts in tripe like the steel ring and ive always been quite amused at how bad an actor he is good fighter though but in death match hes pretty good given a decent script and a haircut he proves himself to be quite the charismatic leading man and his friendship with nick is very well portrayed jacklin and hill have a nice chemistry and you really believe these two characters care for each other enough for one of them to lose a job travel halfway across the country and risk death to save the other  i wish i had a friend like that br br it was also nice to see matthias hues as a villainous henchman with a little more depth than were used to seeing from his many villainous henchman roles however dont be fooled into thinking hes the star just because hes on the video cover with it seems his head stuck on the body of michael bernardo from the cover of shootfighter  he is good while hes on screen but he isnt on muchbr br on the negative side the film is pretty slow when theres no fighting going on with lots of unnecessary scenes whats with gangster jimmie fiorellos pointless story about his grandfather and the end fight is disappointingly short but on the whole i enjoyed it plenty of fights most of them good isnt that all we martial arts really need and of course eyecandy here in the lovely form of the very pretty renee ammann all in all a pretty entertaining kickboxing movie
