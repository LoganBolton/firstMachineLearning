after some further thought about this film i find its far too easy to dismiss this as the boys dream i have actually received some spiritual strength from northforkangels do existwe definitely are entertained by angelsmost of the time we arent even aware of it at a point of spiritual and emotional turbidity in my life i personally really needed this film yes as i wrote before it speaks to so manycant wait to get to heavenbr br being so sick of all of the fx and formula stuff i found this film to be genuine cinema all i can say is it touched me in so many ways that i still am sorting it all out north fork is a wonderful film one that brings the viewers mind out of the gutter and into the heart the spiritual aspect is so very intriguing to me pay attention as youll need to use the brain and heart god gave you to follow the story i think its possibly a bit over the heads of some but i feel those are the individuals it speaks to most importantly i want to view it several more times just so i can take it all inbr br the industry needs to study this film to realize we do existbr br my thanks to all involved in the making of this film
