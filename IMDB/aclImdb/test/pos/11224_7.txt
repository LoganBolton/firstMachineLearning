imagery controls this film the characters although interesting ultimately take a back seat the first scene i remember is a framed black and white shot of the ocean that then opens to full screen and color the bubbling of the water gives way to a small coffin that breaks the surface the theme of the movie here being that death can be accepted and brought into the realm of the livingbr br water as an ultimate consciousness as a tool of god is used to here to force people to get their houses in order judgment day the dead have to be accounted for and lifted to a better place whatever one has left unresolved or unsettled will be washed away theres no clinging on to the past to a buried memory of what wasbr br this movie has been compared to o brother where art thou and the threat of water and its use as a cleansing force is similar to that film whats different in this movie is that the coming of the water is knowable and so again the emphasis is on what needs to be done with the here and nowbr br i agree that the some of the scenes are reminiscent of a david lynch work take for example the dinner segment with the deepvoiced and androgynous waitress one gets the same surreal feel from the setting and odd character as one does with the backwards talker in the scene from fire starter the difference is that lynch attacks us with the image to express the psychological processes of a troubled character whereas this film seems to use surreal elements to create a moral message the men in black suits cant have anything they wantthey must be patient and accept what is available
