its a shame this movie is rated pg 13it is really quite suitable for anyonethough young kids might not follow it too wellbr br it belongs to that wonderful genre of seriocomic ghostangel stories that would have to include everything from capras its a wonderful life to wenderss wings of desire br br the photography is stunning the acting first rate andwonder of wondersthe tone is upliftingbr br my only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film the two interwoven stories seem intriguingly mysterious at first but they resolve themselves a little too nicely for my taste as the director points out in his commentary on the dvd all the ingredients of irwins story are on his bedside table the symbolism is just a trifle too pat for mebr br but what a lark my favorite scene has to be when the relocation team tries to get breakfast at a diner this is practically theatrical in its magica tour de force of witty actingsubtle playful and positively rhythmiccoupled with striking cinematography and an acute eye for the grotesquebr br northfork is funny touching gorgeous to look at magical with the above reservations and has not one single carchasebr br an easy nine stars
