when northfork debuted at the cannes film festival many people didnt like it because they felt it was boring and too slow while i agree that it was slow one of the slowest movies of the year in no way was it boring as roger ebert said there has never been a movie like northfork i usually dont agree with ebert but for once he speaks the truth although john sayles sunshine state may have some of the same immediate themes nothing that i have ever seen or known of can even compare to the striking originality of the polish brothers northforkbr br northfork is a perfect example of how many times its better to trek an extra few minutes to go to an arthouse film instead of the latest jack black movie the plot isnt some hackneyed cookiecutter plot its just so strikingly original a small town in montana named northfork has a dam nearby that is about to be taken down therefore the entire town must be evacuated some people however just dont want to leave in a side plot a young orphan duel farnes is very sick and bedridden hes being taken care of by father harlan nick nolte the boy imagines himself as a fallen angel so to speak who help him out through his time of sicknessbr br although much of the movie is straightforward some of it could give david lynch a run for his money theres odd weather patterns a weird wooden huge dog thing and symbolism that would make fellini proud its not as overall confusing as a lynch film but its still quite odd thats what makes northfork so great its so out of the ordinary and yet so simple and plausiblebr br northfork has a magical feel to it its almost like youre watching something youre not quite sure what it is but you feel entranced by it as i said earlier i agreed with ebert on how this movie is unlike any other however i disagree when he says that it is not entertaining he goes on to say its just enthralling perhaps he just thought he should give it good reviews because everyone else is but in lieu of how slow it was i still thought it was very entertaining something many dramas now cant dobr br northfork may not be the quickest movie or the most popular movie but if you can get to and through it youll be extremely surprised as i wasbr br my rating 810br br rated pg13 for brief sexuality
