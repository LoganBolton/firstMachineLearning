this show is absolutely fantastic it provides all the great drama and romance of teen shows like the oc and dawsons but its a whole lot funnier its a show with morals and values without everything being sugar coated and sanitised ala 7th heaven we dont have sororities or fraternities in australia and our university system is completely different so i have no idea how accurately greek life is portrayed but i dont care because this show is my new favourite any writer that can make me love a racist homophobe confederate flagwaving bible basher must be geniusbr br and cappie is my new pacey sorry josh jackson youve been dethroned
