there are too many people on this board who have obviously missed the subtle wit of this series br br this show is great because its a hilarious parody of itself guys who are selfproclaimed studs are given a fair chance to convince us of their seduction abilities until they hit the field just to expose their complete lack of game on national tv Â– its absolutely hilarious and the guys who are actually skilled are extremely compelling to watch as they effortlessly seduce the pretentious women that frequent these trendy nightclubs br br it celebrates unique charisma when deserved and mocks delusional douchebags when deserved either way its always entertaining because unlike other dating shows it perfectly captures the authentic awkwardness and excitement of a pickup i highly recommend this show to anyone with a sense of humor
