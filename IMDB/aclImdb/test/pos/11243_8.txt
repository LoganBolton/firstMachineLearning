sure it seems like there is only about 17 minutes of actual content in each episode but it is certainly fun to watch you might find yourself cringing in your chair as buddy sticks his foot in his mouth and gets shot down or chuckling and shaking your head when some ridiculous line actually works the panel of hosts have more of a goodnatured friendly dare i say canadian style of commentary compared with cutthroat us reality programming i think the people who complain about this show dont get the joke they are taking the show more seriously than the show takes itself keys to the vip is a great caricature of reality shows sports tv culture and the club scene i hope they do another season and id be interested to see if a us version appears its certainly a fun original premise
