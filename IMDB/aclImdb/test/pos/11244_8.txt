this is a great show despite many negative user reviews the aim of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh two guys compete against each other to get a girls phone number simple the fun in this show is watching the two males try to accomplish their goal br br some appear to hate the show for various reasons but i think they misunderstood this as an educational show on how to pick up chicks well it is not it is a comedy show and the whole point of it is to make you laugh not teach you anything if you didnt like the show because it doesnt teach you anything dont watch it if you dont like the whole clubbing thing dont watch it if you dont like socializing dont watch it this show is a comical show if you down by watching others pick up girls well its not making you laugh so dont watch it if you are so disappointed in yourself after watching this show and realizing that you dont have the ability to pickup girls there is no reason to hate the show simply dont watch it
