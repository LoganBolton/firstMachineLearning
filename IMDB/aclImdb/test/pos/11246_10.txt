the fact that reviewers feel very intensely negative towards the show is an interesting fact all its own if you dislike it so much dont watch itbr br certain reviewers assert that you have to be dumb dimwitted or plain old primitive to enjoy this show au contraire my friends i am not claiming that all the contestants are smart there are smart ones and there are dumb ones but i would argue that they probably have a higher average iq than the average reviewer on this website thats right i said it there is a lot to be said for the science of seducing girls im sorry but please withdraw all sticks out of your asses and realize the reason you hate these guys is that they threaten youbr br those oblivious to social sciences and more specifically the science behind mating are clearly going to miss the boat completelybr br one thing is clear the clubs arent the only places to meet girls i personally think that the worthwhile women dont even go to clubs so that they wont fall prey to men like the ones we see on the show but what are men like these apart from the ones whose games stink they are the epitome of men they are men who meet women in the most difficult situations these are men who take ownership of their own sexuality these men dont beg for their girlfriends to not break up with them and these men dont say ok to the phrase lets just be friends br br sound familiar in fact these are the very guys youre afraid of when you take your special long term girlfriend to the club we all are these guys know what women like again only the ones who have gamebr br and even the ones who are badthey are worth a laugh br br if you have gone out to a club and actually interacted with the people around you you should find this show entertaining br br look i am at a loss for why there is so much hate for this show my best guess is that it aggravates the insecurity in men who have had bad experiences in clubs or threatens men who believe women are beautiful selfless creatures who just want a nice guy to buy their attentionbr br i personally love this show it is pure entertainment and best of all its real it is a very perceptive take on the most recent state of sexual psychology sex roles have never been so different from before and this show provides a very real view of thatbr br i think it actually takes some intelligence to take away something positive from this show br br this show appeals to a certain target market and if youre outside of that then i guess you shouldnt tune in to the show we could say this about any other shows though couldnt webr br grow upbr br apollohelios
