as someone who was in a panhellenic sorority i wasnt sure what to expect when i tuned into this show after seeing so many over dramatizations in made for tv movies and the craziness of the reality shows i was curious to see if greek would be able to show the true college and greek life experiencebr br i was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the everfamiliar characters of this genre but it was also able to add depth to the characters greek life isnt just about parties and petty conflict although those things happen within greek life they also happen in any other social or professional circle throughout a persons life to characterize it as some exclusive experience to those in a greek organization would be false most of the story lines and situations taking place in greek can and do take place everywhere in every circle of friends on sports teams in real life but ive watched both episodes and my little sister whom im still very close to and i have spent both episodes laughing and being reminded of how theyve truly captured the spirit of our college years and experiencesbr br i liked how the second episode showed how the characters struggle with the other facets of their lives school relationships goals etc cappie telling rusty that school comes first and going to your brothers for help that was very true to life you cant stay in an organization if you have bad grades the way rusty got his assignment to his professor was far fetched but it was entertaining even the dynamic between casey and rusty it happens you grow up and whatever your relationship with your siblings was it changes so you must adjustbr br the bottom line greek is a great show great entertainment value and enough real life in there to be believable and definitely worth the viewers time
