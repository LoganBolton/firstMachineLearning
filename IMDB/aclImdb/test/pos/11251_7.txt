i am from texas and live very close to plano where the actual deaths occurred so i might be a bit biased in saying that wasted is a film that you just cant get out of your headbr br stahl phoenix and paul all play their characters very realistically you truly believe that they are everyday high school students who just happen to be heroin addicts the drug content is handled very graphically as well  although everything that happens in the film serves a purpose and each moment the characters spiral further downward is heartbreaking i definitely recommend this film to anyone once you watch it it sticks with you
