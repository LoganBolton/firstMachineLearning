i just saw this movie tonight5th nov 2005for the first time i wanted to watch it cause i saw the basketball diariesleonardo di caprio and loved that but this was far more heavy going i think it had a good depiction of drugs to an extent i empathize mostly with nick stahls character probably because if i someone i was crazy about was on that stuff id want to help them get off it a promising student and athlete who spends all his time training and studyingwell its understandable that hed want to try teenage lifethe crazy side of it and in his efforts as what begins is helping his friend he ends up addicted because he wanted to see what it is all about and because of his horrendous family situation which results in his most tragic death a truly sad film but one flaw i noticed is that you dont get a good enough insight into the damage it does to families but apart from that excellent performances on a truly heartbreaking movie
