what can i say i couldnt sleep and i came across this movie on mtv i started watching it with every intention of changing the channel if it started to get lame as so many antidrug movies do but i got sucked into this movie and i couldnt stop watching nick stahl did an amazing job with his character and in my opinion he really made the movie something worth watching i was interested in purchasing the soundtrack to the movie or even the movie itself and mtvcom was no help at all but believe it or not amazoncom is taking preorders for the august 5th release of the movie on dvd i know i had a hard time tracking it down and im sure other people might have had the same problem im buying my own copy so i can drool over nick stahl while bawling my eyes out at the same time thanks to the emotional storyline
