what this movie is not cool entertainingbr br what this movie is visually interesting difficult to get through intentionalbr br i feel that this movie puts the viewer if he or she is willing through a clip of time where they experience a world without language much like how animals must experience the world you dont really watch this movie as much as you witness an awful series of events in what feels like real timebr br consistently it goes on much longer than is comfortable this movie could be edited down to a 20 minute short and it would be a totally different movie it would be cool and entertaining but the experience would be lost i have seen a lot of cool movies but i have never experienced one like this if you can get your head in the right place for this one you should be able to really appreciate but likely not enjoy what they accomplished here 10 out of 10
