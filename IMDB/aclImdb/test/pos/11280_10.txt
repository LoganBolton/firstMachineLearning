sui generis folks im not going to lie to you merhige is a one or two hit wonder but what a film it almost excuses suspect zero im also not going to pretend to understand it completely half of what makes it what it is is trying to second guess what the hell they are doing on the screen because of the chiaroscurobr br richard corliss says it is as if a druidical cult had reenacted for real three bible stories  creation the nativity and jesus torture and death on golgotha thats not a bad description but there seems to be more to it than the seemingly onetoone religious correspondencesbr br theres an environmental theme right up near the surface  note that toward the end after the barrenness of the landscape there are large pipes not unlike those on a construction site oh no hes going to say look at how people are raping mother nature one rarely sees a dead metaphor in action and with this much hyperbole but to see it acted out is way grislier than language impliesbr br and yeah if you just want something to sync with a death metal soundtrack it does have the requisite atrocities but as for myself and others like me its an important art film that should merit a criterion collection release ranks right up there with murnaus faustbr br  ray
