heard about this film a long while ago and finally found it on ebay for five bucks i wasnt expecting much but wow was i ever surprised its a story of a boy and girl in love trying to escape an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle reminds me of ico for ps2 because some shots gave you a sense of vertigosounds pretty standard but this movie is insane its hard to believe such an original animated feature was made in 1952 also the king was probably one of the creepiest characters ive seen in a long time with a feminine walk weird eyes usually crossed and a soft but scary voice the only problem i had with the film was that the boy and girl had no personality and hardly even any lines except for calling for mr wonderbird a large talking green birdto save them the animation was fantastic in most areas but some cells were missing from some scenes which sucked its incredibly original with flying police and giant mechs and even laugh out loud funny at times its a real shame this is such an obscure title because its really a good film check it out sometime
