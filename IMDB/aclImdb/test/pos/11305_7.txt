my 5 year old daughter is very into the barbie series of movies ive had mixed feelings about that  not wanting her to buy into the whole barbiedoll image of things and recognizing that the movies are a marketing ploy to convince young girls to buy more dolls and make more money for mattel this morning though she asked me to watch this movie with her and  it being a lazy saturday morning and with not much else to do  i agreed i dont know if the movies have been made to help market the dolls which seem to be losing their appeal a bit from what ive heard or if the dolls are there to market the movies or more likely a bit of both but whichever is the case i have to admit  somewhat to my surprise this wasnt half badbr br its a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and people and memorable characters both good and evil essentially annika played by barbie has to find a way to build a wand of light to reverse the evil spells of the wizard wenlock who among other things has turned her sister into a flying horse and her parents into stone the animation here was pretty good  not disneycalibre if one thinks of disney as the standard to aspire to but generally pretty good and while the movie is obviously tailored to young girls rather than middleaged men i still found there were enough twists and turns to make me wonder how it was all going to turn out its true that there were some holes in the story or at least some logical inconsistencies but again one must remember the target audience who wouldnt really think of such things this is an all around decent family movie 710
