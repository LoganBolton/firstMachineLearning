before seeing this picture i was quite skeptic i dont like movies with an agenda nor do i appreciate being scared into thinking like the writer i was also afraid this would be like the 2part miniseries 104 which had a farfetched concept little relation to the real world and very poor execution at the beginning is says this film is fiction but the events portrayed and the information about uk emergency planning are based on extensive research and the general feeling is that youre not being sold on an idea but that youre being taught a lesson in civil awareness the message that is being conveyed is obvious from the start it is coming and were not prepared the use of real places and a scenario which not only could happen  there are plans for when it does  all add to the disturbing effect the movie will have on even the most cynical of viewers the movies perspective is that of the society and it stays away from heartbreaking personal moments which wont convey the message so none of the romeojuliet drama were used to
