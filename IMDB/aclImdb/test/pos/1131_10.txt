i must say i thought the show greek would be really ridiculous and stupid since i am part of a sorority i didnt want them to make greek organizations look badbr br but i think greek is hilarious yes they do have the stereotypical sorority and fraternity but its not mocking but just cute humorbr br all the characters are pretty likable minus rebecca logan i just cant stand her casey and rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister then there is cappie who doesnt love a guy like cappie haha his character brings so much to the show rustys room mate dale played by clark duke is hilarious as wellbr br its definitely fun to watch so tune in for season 2 i cant wait till it is back on
