well this movie certainly was in keeping with the current times no happy endings superheroes or miracles here just downtoearth fiction to stimulate our minds along the lines of terrorism and whatifs kudos to percival and mickery for an excellent screenplay and superb direction by percival films like this are needed to keep us aware of what is out there if every peaceloving man and woman on earth reported obviously suspicious activities i believe terrorism could not thrive this movie showed just how hard it really is to subvert these terrorists even with good intelligence even though the film is a bit propagandist against islam the use of a muslim police officer as a main character i believe it was entirely realistic there was meant to be shockvalue in the bombing incident as a very clever tool to relay the humility and indignity of people caught up in an attack such as this they showed full nudity of women being decontaminated postattack it didnt take me long to realize that this was meant to even further instill into the viewer that thought ie we are not in control of everything in a situation like this although this took place in london with the usual highlevel british acting it makes a statement for any part of the world great movies dont have to be blockbuster epic productions and this movie is very very worthy of viewing
