this lasted several years despite the late hour it was onbr br like a lot of 80s crime dramas it looked cold both physically and figuratively this isnt a bad thing though and the obviously low budget actually worked in its favor gritty during a time when slick was inbr br allan royals wraparound segments as the news writer gave it a slight edgebr br the only actors i remembered were scott nylands earthquake and tony rosato sctv the cast of barely knowns was a good thing because one could see the group as a whole and not as a bunch of people supporting a star and yes thats a young clark johnson homicide in a recurring spotbr br i hope a dvd release is in the future someone out there wanna get on that
