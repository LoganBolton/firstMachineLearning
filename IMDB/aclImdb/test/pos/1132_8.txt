im not a big tv person but when i saw the premier episode of greek i couldnt wait until next week i dont miss the show for nothingbr br thank god for dvr lol im in love with cappie he acts like a bad boy but he is so sweet everybody has their own character so we have pretty much all types of people you could still throw in a hispanic and a chubby personsbr br i didnt go to school in usa so i never liked the idea of frat houses and stuff like that so when my husband told me about the show i didnt pay attention until he asked me to watch it and since i didnt have noting better to do i agreed i laughed so hard the first night that i just needed to keep watching itbr br so im with the other people that voted for this show to continue on i will hope for a second third and who knows how many more episodes its a really good show very funny and entertaining
