in the mood for love a teasing allegory of loneliness and longing here is a film without sex or even kissing  and it is no doubt one of the sexiest and definetly the most thoughtprovoking and psychological romance i have ever seenbr br telling the story of two people who coincidentally live in the same apartment and are a door away from each other the film like and unlike random hearts is about how two people come together via the affair of their two lovers only once they receive this news they take the time to think about the consequences of an affair and each others feelings towards having just brokenup  and whether or not the two people are willing enough to fall back in lovebr br whats terrific about the film is the way director wong karwai presents each characters way of dealing with loneliness with maggie cheungs character hell show her in a repeated montage leaving work going home watching her neighbors gamble head to the noodle shop leave the noodle shop and bump into her attractive ageequal played by tony leung this is a clever if not subtle and knowing technique to present loneliness for it is when you are alone when you find yourself falling into a loop this movie worked for me because i can identify with that feeling
