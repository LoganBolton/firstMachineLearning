beautiful film set in 1962 hong kong about a man mr chow and woman mrs chan who become close friends when they suspect their spouses are having an affair stylistically the film is also beautiful wong karwai uses a lot of slow motion and closeups on parts of the body feet hands waist the film itself has a reticence and properness that suggests its time period its sexy without showing everything wong karwai also doesnt allow the audience to see what the spouses look like suggesting that mr chow and mrs chan should be together smoking is even made to look elegant with closeups of the curls of smoke a really lovely film just prepare yourself for the endingbr br
