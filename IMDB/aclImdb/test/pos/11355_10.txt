its easy to see why many people consider in the mood for love to be wong karwais best film the toned down appeal of the film centering on the studied view of a relationship put through an emotional ringer is a retread into happy together territory but without the hyperkinetic patchwork of jarring film stocks and hypersaturated sequences that have become a trademark of karwais films since chungking express like soderberghs the limey this is a different kind of curio for karwai where dialogue and plot are forsaken by mood and composition in order to create a tale of two delicate lives in a seemingly confining emotional stasisbr br its a testament to the genius of karwai that he is capable to making such a simple tale so resonating chow mowan tony leung and su lizhen maggie cheung move in nextdoor to each other within the same apartment building hes a journalist who dreams of publishing martialarts novels and she is a secretary at a shipping company their eventual coupling is obvious from the beginning but the pleasure here is the way that karwai ambiguously paints such a journey with his grand masterstrokesbr br the key to the success of the film is karwais use of the interior space playing with foreground and background planes in ways that are similar to the works of polanski during the wooingly sensuous first half of the film karwai isolates leung and cheung within shots in such a way that the second person in a conversation is never visible karwai is concerned with environment and space here creating a cramped emotional dynamic between his characters its also telling that karwai never chooses to focus on the physicality of mowan and lizhens spouses their faceless partners are noticeably absent from the film as they are tending to their own love affairs with each otherbr br this is not to suggest that in the mood for love is a confining experience because karwai manages to inundate his film with broad splashes of hypnotic camera movement and sound there is one shot where cheungs slow sensual rise up a metaphorical stairway turns into leungs descent down the very same stairwell their movements perfectly compliment each other bookending the shot and creating a sense of erotic duality between the two figures their souls have connected but they have yet to physically unite the erotic displacement of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating as two starcrossed lovers reject physical consummation due to their humble fidelitybr br other scenes in the film are punctuated with brief slowmotion shots of cheung erotically moving through her interior surroundings set to mike galassos hauntingly beautiful score cheungs dresses beautifully compliment her exterior space as she moves slowly through her surroundings her movements slowly build up to what seems to be an inevitable fusion between liszhen and her dream lover even though the seduction process seems to be entirely subconsciousbr br if i make it seem that these two characters are more like two birds unleashing pheromones on each other it probably isnt that farfetched of a statement the tight bond these two characters have with their internal spaces is almost as intense as their relationship to the exteriors the film rarely moves into an exterior space and when the camera does it is usually to peak through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals karwai continues to tease us even when the lovers get close enough to touch shattering the couples proximity to each other by shooting them through mirrors or through gaps within articles of clothing located inside of a closet mother nature even seems to respond to their love lust often unleashing a soft crest of rain over the characters after their bodies have glided near each otherbr br karwais hauntingly atmospheric shots of a waterfall allowed leungs lai yufai to experience a cathartic release in happy together even if leslie cheungs ho powing was not there to enjoy it with him by that films end love was so inextricably bound to the act of war that a third mans muted declarations of love signaled yufais realization that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace even if it would not bring him back his lover mowans journey terminates within the confines of a crumbling temple his own emotional depletion is paralleled nicely with the political climate of his country and the absence of liszhen is only made tolerable by the fact that karwai allows mowan to experience a release of sorts mowan caters to an ancient myth and his secretive release into a crack in the temple leaves him capable of living his days with the hope that all his loss and heartache somehow served a higher purpose
