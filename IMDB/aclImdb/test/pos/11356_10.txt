i think that new york times film critic elvis mitchell wrote the best one line review of in the mood for love when he said that it is dizzy with a romantic spirit thats been missing from the cinema forever how true those words are truly romantic films are so rare these days while films that include plenty of sex and nudity which are often portrayed in a smutty and gratuitous manner abound so given this cinematic climate wong karwais latest film feels like a much needed breath of fresh air in the mood for love is about the doomed romance between two neighbors mr chow played by tony leung and mrs chan played by maggie cheung whose spouses are having an illicit affair as they try not to be like them but after hanging out with each other on lonely nights while their spouses are away on businesstaking care of a sick mother they fall madly in love and must resist the temptation of going too farbr br several factors are responsible for making in the mood for love a new classic among romantic melodramas in the best sense of that term first the specific period of the film ie 1960s hong kong is faithfully recreated to an astonishing degree of detail the clothes including maggie cheungs lovely dresses the music eg nat king cole and the overall atmosphere of this film evokes a nostalgia for that specific period second christopher doyles awardwinning breathtakingly beautiful cinematography creates an environment which not only envelopes its two main characters but seems to ooze with romantic longing in every one of its sumptuous meticulously composed frame make no mistake about it in the mood for love was the most gorgeous film of 2001 it should also be mentioned that wong karwais usual hyperkinetic visual style is understandably toned down for this film although his pallet remain just as colorful third there is the haunting score by michael galasso which is accompanied by slow motion sequences of eg chan walking in her elegant dresses chan and chow glancing at each other as they pass one another on the stairs and other beautiful scenes which etch themselves into ones memory the main scorewhich makes its instruments sound as though theyre literally cryingis heard eight times throughout various points in the film and it serves to highlight the sadness and the longing which the two main characters feel fourth tony leung and maggie cheung both deliver wonderful performances leung won the prize for best actor at cannes and they manage to generate real chemistry on screenbr br the above elements coalesce and work so nicely together to create a film that feels timeless dizzyingly romantic and in a word magical in the mood for love perhaps more than any other film of 2001 reminded me why it is that i love going to the movies and i guess that is about the highest compliment that i can pay to a filmbr br
