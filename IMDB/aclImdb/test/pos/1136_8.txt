when i first heard about greek i figured i would watch it because it sounded ridiculous another of abc familys sobadtheyrealmostgood shows but tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expectedbr br as a member of a greek society i can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus and are also very fun to play with just on are own let alone to watch on a tv screen the opening scene harkened to an onlyslightlydramatized version of preparing for an actual formal rush in some sororities and it continued on from therebr br this isnt a show for oversensitive greeks if you get offended even at jokes about things that arentsogreat about greek life then youll spend the entire first episode and probably many other cringing and yelling but everyone else should have a ton of fun watching it its nothing new but when it comes to college nothing ever is
