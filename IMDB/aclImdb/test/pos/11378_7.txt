an interesting companion piece to true documentaries of john c holmes unfortunately it doesnt deal with what ultimately killed holmes and it certainly could have benefited from doing so burt reynolds and mark wahlberg got the most praise for this but i felt the true stars were julianne moore as the cocainesniffing mother wannabe don cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as pornstarstereosalesman in some wild getups and william h macy whos wife is the ultimate slut not to mention a nearly unrecognizable alfred molina macys new years eve bash and cheadles chance for a better life after a donut shop robbery gone wildly wrong are probably the two best scenes in the movie or at least the two best shot what this movie does best is show how power can easily corrupt in its various forms however none of the characters apparently learn anything from their dark downward spiral as they all rebound and return to their normal lives
