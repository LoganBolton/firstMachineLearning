this is a classic that will be able to hold up with dramas to come simply because of the fact that it is shot with a 70s style and its a story about the 70s it is funny actionfilled entertaining and sad at the same time it has the effect to pull you into the lives of these poor folks and the consequences for their actions 4 stars
