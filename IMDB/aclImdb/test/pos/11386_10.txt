some time ago i saw this when hbo was showing it and from what i saw of it it seemed like a good movie so im in blockbuster today and i see it there with the dvds and i decide what the hell so i rent it after i finished watching it i was in shock of how good it wasbr br this movie just touched my heart everything in it was so amazing the stories the actors the dark humor the music oh dont get me started on the music in this film pt andderson is one of the greats definitely the best thing to come out since quentin tarantinoa godbr br after i finished the first viewing i watched it again with andersons commentary i was suprised on how such a cool guy he isbr br anybody who is interested in movies at all should watch this movie if they havent already anderson is obviously a film lover in the movie he rips off so many other directors tecniques such as the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water obviously ripped off from i am cuba but i have no beef what so ever with that the film is very respectable with its ripoffsbr br i recomend this film to anybody who can deal with some of the content of the filmpornbr br 1010
