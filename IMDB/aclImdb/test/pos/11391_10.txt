boogie nights was without a doubt the best film of 1997 i could watch this movie over and over and over and still love it im in no rush to watch that overblown romancedisaster epic titanic again the fact that boogie nights did not even receive a best picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and narrowminded the academy is only atom egoyans the sweet hereafter and robert zemeckiss contact came close to being as great as boogie nights no other filmmaker in recent years has come even remotely close to making a film as good as tarantinos pulp fiction  until now paul thomas anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded just as tarantino gave john travoltas career a kick pt anderson has given burt reynolds the kick that his career needs boogie nights will also undoubtedly make stars of don cheadle heather graham and john reilly overall a wonderful film the best since pulp fiction maybe even better
