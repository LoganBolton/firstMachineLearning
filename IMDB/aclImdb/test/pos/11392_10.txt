boogie nights uses its protagonist dirk diggler as a metaphor for accumulated celebrities from a decade in americas shameful past which was comprised of an unexpected rise in pornography therefore resulting in an abundance of corrupted youth its lead character borrows traits from a various assortment of genuine actors involving himself in many illegal affairs that have been dabbled in by celebrities in hollywood and alltoooften exploited by the press it seems like the sort of tall tale that might appear on an e true hollywood story special drugs sex and violence  the american dream but what goes up must come down and the bigger it is the harder it fallsbr br dirk digglers dreams are huge as is another valuable asset on his body dirks real name is eddie adams a californian who dreams of becoming a star he believes that god gives one great talent to every individual on the planet and his gift is a rather unusual one after falling out with his mother eddie leaves home and meets the sleazy jack horner burt reynolds an adult film director who offers him work eddie eventually becomes a major porn star representing the leading actor in most of horners films with newfound success eddie is told that he needs to invent a new alias for himself and so dirk diggler is bornbr br eddiedirk himself is primarily based on infamous porn star john holmes whose life story was adapted in 2003 with wonderland which starred val kilmer boogie nights is unarguably the better of the two proving that movies about pornography can be made without disgusting its target audience regular cinemagoersbr br the film takes place in 1977 an era of artistic pornography  filmmakers truly believed that they could compensate for the low points of xrated features by adding deep stories and mesmerizing atmosphere in a way the films director  paul thomas anderson  implements a very artistic approach to the project resulting in a gratuitous and artistic movie about a period in american history when smut was indeed both gratuitous and artistic andersons style is so deep and so distinct that we soon feel as if we are reliving the era firsthand not a moment goes by where we are unconvinced of the time range dealt with in the filmbr br all was not happy on the set of boogie nights prior to filming anderson approached reynolds repeatedly asking him many separate times to play the role of horner eventually reynolds agreed but claimed that the film was horrible and the worst role of his career publicly disowning it before being nominated for a best supporting actor academy award and suddenly shutting up a year before anderson had suffered title disputes over sydneyhard eight he preferred the latter title for his film and new line cinema thought the former was more marketable he essentially lost the battle and anderson wisely avoided title disputes this time around by inserting the words boogie nights into his movie through the mouth of a characterbr br the casting of the film is one of its finest aspects the paul thomas anderson regulars are here as well as a whole topnotch cast of firsttimers to name some of the more wellknown stars john c reilly phillip seymour hoffman luis guzman william h macy heather graham and julianne moore but the entire movie essentially borders down to mark wahlberg as eddie who is surprisingly convincing in his role wahlberg previously known for his singing career and disappointing hollywood pursuits has all the necessary traits to portray such a character this is his best role to datebr br anderson knows how to captivate his audience and take complete control of every scene when jack horner first meets eddie anderson slyly uses stars in the backdrop a sign of things to come and hidden symbolism as finely acute as it can be the opening scene is three minutes a long tracking shot that follows jack and amber into a night club where most of the characters are first introduced it reminds me of the discussions regarding tracking shots in robert altmans the player  it works so brilliantly in boogie nights and is the first indication that anderson knows what he is doing behind the camera his style is fastpaced in the vein of martin scorsese where shots zip around quite quickly but never seem rushed incidentally anderson references two classic scorsese shots  the closing de niro mirror speech from raging bull and the tracking nightclub scene from goodfellas anderson is a young growing director who is remarkably mature in story and direction despite his age whereas his first feature film hard eight was noticeably wise and poignant boogie nights is even more sobr br boogie nights began as an effort of love on paul thomas andersons account having filmed the extraordinary hard eight in 1996 andersons film is pragmatic to such an extreme that it almost seems genuine boogie nights invigorates us with its gratuitous content occasionally bordering on the verge of pornography only it is far more sophisticated than such trash it is a blazing wonderful modernday masterpiece that is as mindnumbingly explicit as it is wild and stylish arguably andersons best film and among the greatest  and most important  projects of the last decade
