boogie nights is one of the best films to come out of the 90s and id go so far as to say it should be in the imdb top 250 i can actually understand why many would dislike it due to the subject matter i personally feel however as many do judging from the aclaim this films received by viewers and critics that its topnotch film makingbr br the direction and acting in this film surpass good and reach the level of brilliancethere is not one scene in this movie that isnt amazing the individual characters reach out and touch you given that this is a movie about the porn industry one wouldnt imagine the sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity but they are the direction is among the best ive ever seenand ive seen a lot of filmsbr br the film isnt about one particular personal individuals story its about manyits a character study about people who have many layers to them and who maybe in an industry most would find alien but who still dream the same dreams and have both bad and good to them boogie nights draws you into their story from the beginning and though the film is longi believe almost 3 hours you honestly dont even notice and when it ends you kind of dont want it tobr br im not easy to impress meaning there arent many movies id give a 10 of 10 rating to but this is one beyond the multiple character study is the use of music in the film i have never in all my years of seeing movies seen music tell a story as well as in this moviethere was such flawlessness to it you know its not something your gonna see everydaybr br burt reynolds performance was perhaps the best ive ever seen him do and mark wahlberg is incredibleim astounded there are still people saying he doesnt act well i dont know how anyone viewing this could possibly think thatbut the person who really surprised me was heather grahemrollergirl who is absolutely fantastic in her role in particular the one memorable scene with burt reynolds in the limo towards the endbr br again ill echo other imdb reviewers in saying this movie is not for everybody but i still think this was topnotch10 of 10
