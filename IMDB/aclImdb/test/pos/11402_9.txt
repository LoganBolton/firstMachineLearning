boogie nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any wouldbe filmmaker should take a long hard look at sure you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the clasics from hitchcock to scorsese but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study halfheartedlybr br where to begin i suppose one could look at the film as simply a story perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970s porn industryand what an industry it was the other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and ahem rubber but honestly boogie nights brings back the pure nobulshi in your face kind of cinema i havent experienced since the film greats of the 1970sironicor stroke of genius the story is full of richly detailed characters all of which you either can relate too love or hate but the impact is clearyou are feeling something for them among the characters the two performances which stand out are burt reynolds as director jack horner and mark wahlberg as eddie adamsdirk diggler julianne moore is also brillant as is heather grahambut if i focus on any one actor it would have to be john c reilly johns performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotionim a sucker for the line ever see the movie star warspeople say i look like han solo anyway the look of the film is incredible the director of photography and directorwriterproducer have come up with a vibrant colour and flashy style that compares to martin scorsese and stanley kubrickin terms of his perfection of his craft but with creating his own unique look and pushing the edge with the longest single shot iver ever seenthat being the new years party sequencebr br the music like in any great film is a character of its own at times it consumes oneself with sorrow or griefbut mainly its all about fun dancing and having a good time the spirit of the 1970s ok back to the performancesbr br burt reynolds plays the character of jack horner a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of film means to his genre the awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape the lose of his art as it wereand the changes in mentality to the people he works with walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character for all those individuals who have seen burtons planet of the apes pay no attention to the performance of wahlberg in that filmrent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can makebr br julianne moore plays the wouldbe mother to all and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels as life imitates art and she loses all those close to her heather graham is the eyecandy but later holds her own and steals some of the scenes from even the great mr reynolds himself each character is multidimensional rich with life and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the partbr br the film itself is often funny tragic exciting and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fastpace 1970s it makes no excuses and tells no lies and offers the audience a trip back but even more importantly the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film
