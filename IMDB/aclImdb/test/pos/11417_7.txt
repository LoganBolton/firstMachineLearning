i liked this movie im not a big horror movie buff so i couldnt comment on similarities between this and other movies of this genre but i found this movie quite captivating the story line albeit a little obvious had some genuinely scarytense moments and the acting particually of the lead female role wasnt bad in anywaybr br overall im a little surprised at the low rating this movie has gotten i watch a lot of movies working in a video store tends to help and this really isnt as bad as people seem to think i do have some criticism though the final call from the cop was terrible almost overacted the dead girl in the bathroom looked liked she was having a little sleep probably from the amount of tequila she mentioned she drank and the childrens reaction to what was happening instilled in me the hope that they were ultimately killed br br hope this helps some people
