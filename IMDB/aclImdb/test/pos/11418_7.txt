having seen the original when i was 13 and yes i was stupid enough to watch it while babysitting i was excited to see this remakebr br camilla bell did a great job as jill johnson and the fact that a teen horror flick could be made in the year 2006 without tremendous vulgarity and gore made it even that much stronger of a film i had a great time trying not to chew my fingernails offbr br this film wont win anyone an oscar but it is entertaining and worth the matin√©e price ticket i bought to see it i think girls around the world should watch the original and the remakeand then determine to never babysit again br br all i can say is im glad im too old to babysit theres just something about being in a dark creepy house with sleeping kids that makes this movie classic no blood no gorejust good psychological fun winner
