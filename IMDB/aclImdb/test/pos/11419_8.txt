with all the shoot em up blood horror movies that have come our way in the last little while saw hostal saw 2 the hills have eyes yes they have their place dont get me wrong i went to see when a stranger calls with my buddy the other night why because its a remake of the 1979 classic which at the time was excellent and scared the you know what out of everyone i didnt know what to expect however i was pleasantly surprised it was a film made of mood atmosphere suspense because remember people what you cant see what you think you see what you cant hear or what you think you hear is far more scarier then what you do if you love films with mood creepiness suspense and atmosphere youll love it it brought it back to the roots of the original halloween thumbs up a solid 85 out of 10 remember folks its well done not perfect its spooky not bloody its creepy not gory it was nice to see a film come a long like this our minds have been conditioned and warped by the glitz and shock value of modern day horror movies we forget whats really scary
