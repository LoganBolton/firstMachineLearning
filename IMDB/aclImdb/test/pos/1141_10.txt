i went to this film having no idea what to expect i actually took a date to it in the theaters when it first came out we both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped to have someone to discuss it with after seeing itbr br i only recommend seeing this film if you appreciate nonmainstream movies its not as disjointed as liquid sky or as fanciful as forbidden zone the original plot is very easy to follow theres a lot of subtle humorbr br heres a quick summary of the plot if you are completely lost a bigbrother type government keeps tabs on everyone in society suddenly a new person appears and theres no data on him he appears insane he may or may not be the secondcoming of christ the overcautious government goes into a frenzy to find him and discover his true motives the ruler is also obsessed with immortalitybr br some scenes are frantic while others are completely lowkey we follow the lead character as he encounters all different kinds of people in societybr br i didnt need my consciousness altered to enjoy the film but i know that some of my friends felt that helpedbr br split was also filmed around santa cruz and san francisco
