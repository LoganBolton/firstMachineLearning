critics and audiences both pretty much panned this movie but i actually didnt think it was too bad even the critics i normally agree with thought it was crap and i normally despise pg13 horror films so this means one of two things either 1 im too easily pleased and my taste in movies has dwindled over the years or 2 when a stranger calls isnt nearly as horrible as its made out to be now to be fair some of the criticisms of the movie are truetheres not much character development and not much happens in the story but man alive folks how much were you expecting from a movie about a babysitter being stalked cut them some slack as a former babysitter who was watching this flick late at night with the lights out i can safely say the stalker dude was one creepy mofo who knows i guess stuff like this just gives me the williesbr br yes i admit i had fun watching this and i dont care how big of a minority that puts me in
