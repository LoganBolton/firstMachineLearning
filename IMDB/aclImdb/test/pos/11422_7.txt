this stan laurel comedy short is a cute little parody of the valentino film blood and sand if youve seen blood and sand then youll probably appreciate this film and laugh at a few of the scenes that mock the valentino film however if you have not see that movie and just watch this film youll probably not be very impressedthough i really liked the title cards us the word bull was used repeatedly in very funny waysbr br stanly plays vaselino a bullfighter who seems pretty dimwitted and wins only because the bulls seem to lazy and nonaggressive even the bull at the end of the film who has supposedly killed ten men is obviously just a domesticated bullbr br not a great film by any stretch of the imagination but still a cute and harmless film
