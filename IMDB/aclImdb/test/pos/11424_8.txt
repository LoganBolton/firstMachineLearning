stan laurel its been noted first made a real name for himself by appearing in short parodies of popular feature films in the 1920s he certainly demonstrates himself to be an excellent comic actor and performer here in mud and sand a parody of rudolph valntinos blood and sand but i think a film like this really works not because laurel was a great satirist but because it allows the audience to jump into the comedy already familiar with the situation and scenes laurel can then let loose with his inspired gags without either having to create context or to do without it i watched this the day after watching blood and sand itself it certainly enhanced the experience to know what was being parodied and wherebr br the scene where laurels character rhubarb vaseline if you believe the title cards or rhubarb vaselino if you believe how his name gets written on the chalk board bilks his mother out of money with a twoforyou twoforme trick is funny on its own because its a great gag but its extra funny if the viewer is aware how it is taking the air out of valentinos extravagant and melodramatic promises to give his mother any luxuries she desiresbr br this is the best stan laurel solo work ive seen its just plain funny  even more so if you have had a chance to see the source material
