seeing laurel without hardy in a film seems strange yet its entertaining all the same its a well done parody of what became a classic silent film and it showcases stans talents very well while his pictures with oliver hardy were great these early solo efforts give you an idea of how skilled he was at his craft and how great he might have been had he continued in the tradition of keaton and chaplin as an individual star on his own the dance sequence with his reallife wife in the caf√© scene is the best part of the picture and has some pretty funny bits to go with laurels excellent dance steps and the bullfight climax is a gem as even the bull takes a pratfall and i like the irony in the scene where hes buried in hats and comes up wearing his familiar laurel and hardy bowler hat as much as i love the laurel and hardy team and feel that there was never a funnier comedy duo on screen during their prime its nice to see them on their own once in a while check out the fighting kentuckian that hardy made with the duke as another fine example dale roloff
