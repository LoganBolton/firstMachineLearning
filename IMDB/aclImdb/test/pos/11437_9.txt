this is an enjoyable movie its very realistic to the wonderful world of music ive been there and done that it shows a human element in each character and the realism that nobody is perfect these amateur musicians werent all that bad players cleavon littles character marshall tucker was played very well marshall was no saint himself here he was getting paid to do a job and hes giving these guys a hard time about everything in the van on the way up there you dont bite the hands that feed you i do find it hard to believe that a player with the jazz experience he has claims he does not know any of the dixieland tunes he has a tremendous sense of predicting chord changes to tunes he does not know not common but not unheard of either he delivers a true and harsh message at the end of the movie when he tells the clarinet player its not a religion devotion is not enough on that level he is correct although i think the clarinet player could have handled the job he was practicing his butt off and vocal accompaniment music is not that hard to read very enjoyable movie
