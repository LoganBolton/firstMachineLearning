this film gave me probably the most pleasant surprise of any ive ever seen it was not a bigbudget production and its premise middleage amateur jazz musicians get an unexpected professional engagement at a catskillslike resort seems rather modest whats not modest is the films success this is a little sliceoflife movie that is most entertaining throughout director frank d gilroy also wrote the script and its full of interesting subplots and unexpected twistsbr br the actors are journeymen who do a solid job the biggest revelation to me was cleavon little he plays a professional musician who is hired to fill in for an ailing band member his attitude immediately clashes with the others while they see it as an opportunity for big fun and a once in a lifetime thing he sees it as his job and not a particularly interesting one this leads to conflict but when the group gets in trouble he steers them through little who died too young really showed me he was a fine actor with this filmbr br this movie is a true sleeper the kind that a film fan always hopes to discover i recommend it wholeheartedly
