night of the demons is definitely one the definitive cheesy 80s demons horror flick in the same vein as the brilliant evil dead and demons movies this movie combines boozy sexually active teens and demons into one hell of a fun movie a definite welcome addition after the 80s were overrun by slasher flicks it was nice to see something a little differentbr br the plot follows a group of teens who all meet up for a halloween party at hull house which used to be funeral parlour hosted by angela about 40minutes of boozing and sexing eventually leads to a demon or demons finding their way out of the furnace and possessing each and every one of the teens add some snazzy makeup effects lots of gore and coollooking demons and youve got yourself a sweet 80s cheesefest that would be ranked as one of the best demonrelated films in many horror fans listsbr br firstly i loved the setting for this movie hull house is really creepy and scary and the perfect setting for a horror movie and plus when the demons emerge thats when the action really kicks in and it becomes a night of terror and fear this movie spawned 2 sequels the first one in 1994 which was okay but nothing come pared to this and the third one titled demon house was absolutely horrendous this is one of those horrors that has definitely stood the test of time and remains a true gem of mine for many years to comebr br all in all a fun cheesy flick with demons thats definitely worth checking out
