night of the demons 1988 was another in a long line of teen horror films that were released on video and paytv during that mecca of film making the eighties but unlike most of the crap that was being peddled around this one was actually a decent watch a group of bored teenagers decide to party halloween night away with a pair of bizarre sisters mimi kinkade and linnea quigley at the infamous hull house your usual cast of stereotypical teenagers are invited to the party but an average teenage bash turns into a night of terror as they try to survive halloween night when they undead residents of hull house decide to crash the party wholl survive this night of bloodshed and horrorbr br a nice horror film that is best seen in the unrated version if you watch the rrated cut then youll miss all of the splatter effects and nudity stay tune for the amusing epilogue a gory film that was followed by an equally entertaining sequel for horror fans onlybr br highly recommended
