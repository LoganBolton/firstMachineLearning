its the old old story  kids have a party in an old house demons are unleashed death and gratuitous nudity ensues you all know it its still a lot of funbr br many people okay many horror fans to be specific have fond memories of this movie and its always with slight trepidation that you revisit an old movie to see if its still as good as you used to think it was luckily this isbr br it has something for everyone well everyone who happens to be male i suppose from a fun title sequence to a shoplifting scam involving cunning use of linnea quigleys ass to the mirror scene to the full on demonic fun this is a blast from start to finishbr br the girls are cute the guys are     male the death scenes are well done with some good gore effects and unlike some horrors from the era this actually keeps a good sense of atmosphere and even tension throughout dont get me wrong its still fun first and foremost but it offers some nice freaky moments that should please most genre fans
