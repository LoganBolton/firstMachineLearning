this movie took me by surprise the opening credit sequence features nicely done animation after that were plunged into a semicheesy production betraying its low budget the characters typical american teens are introduced slowly with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this by the time the shlitz hits the fan we know each one of the characters and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities its a slow uphill setup kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster thankfully once the action kicks in its full blown old school horror steve johnsons makeup effects are awesome equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films and the scares are jolting kevin tenney delivers his best movie ever with heartstopping surprises and creepy suspenseful setups the tongueincheek sometimes cheesy humor marks this film as pure 80s horror as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like night of the living dead or hills have eyes but for true horror fans this one is worth checking out play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of house on the haunted hill the setup and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking
