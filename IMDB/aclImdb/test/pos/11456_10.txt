i love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie not just because im a huge linnea quigleyjill terashita fan but because it is a lot of fun and actually scary at timesbr br the special effects are awesome especially linneas scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessedbr br plenty of nudity provided by linnea and jill plenty of humor cool soundtrack high body count etcby the way if you have never seen this one try and buywatch the unrated version which has more gore and some scenes the rated version is missing
