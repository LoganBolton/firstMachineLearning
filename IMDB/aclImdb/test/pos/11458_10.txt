this movie was great dont understand the disrespect it gets i first scene this in like 8788 and it was actually scary if you are an 80s horror fan you should have no problem with this film it has everything that makes 80s horror great i got to meet a few of the actors and they were cool what is not great about a creepy old housedemonscrazy party  horny good looking young people the dialog and the special fx made this movie a classic this film also took care of one of those classic rumors about horror the black guy does not always have to die in the endeven though this movie was great there is one thing that remains undiscovered to me what really happened to the old couple at the end was it on purpose or not that little side story thing always had me puzzled
