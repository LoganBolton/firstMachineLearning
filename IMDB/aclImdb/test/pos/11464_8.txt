night of the demons is a great movie and an excellent example of how good lowbudget can be sure much of it is fairly predictable but somehow its still much more enjoyable than the crap we see these days being passed off as horror i give the gore a solid 9 and the demons oneliners are actually funny im still creeped out by stop looking at me the soundtrack is well done i was surprised to hear stigmata martyr from bauhaus there is also some very nice ta on display as well as some hella good makeup effects the second film in the series is pretty good too but avoid the inferior third one night of the demons may be dated dark and lowrent but it still has a lot of potential its definitely worth a rental at least give it a chance tonight just stay away from any old makeup youll understand when you see it
