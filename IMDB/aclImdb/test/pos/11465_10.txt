this is a great horror film for people who dont want all that vomitretching gore and sensationalism this movie has equal amounts of horror suspense humor and even a little light nudity but nothing big linnea quigley isnt over the top as she was in return of the living dead where she danced naked on a crypt but she is still essentially the same slutty character cathy podewell is a virginal and chaste character before going on to dallas and we are also introduced to amelia soon mimi kinkadethe sexy and sinister wouldbe dark matron of the house as she and linnea are possessed and take over the house they reanimate the bodies of their dead friends to scare the limits out of the survivors ive heard a lot of people compare this movie to the evil dead but if anything this movie is a rival to that one the same way freddie rivaled jasonthis movie series though is far superior to that one
