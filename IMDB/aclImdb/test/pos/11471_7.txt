i was given a dvd of public enemies and was expecting it to be the 2009 version but it wasnt  it was this sure it wasnt the greatest movie i have ever seen  not by any means  but heck folks it was worth more that 28 out of 10 when i saw that abysmal rating on imdb i wondered what i was going to get but since the disc was in the player i settled down to watch it as other commentators have pointed out public enemies is not a historical movie perse  and i noted that unlike the 2009 version which i havent seen yet imdb doesnt categorise it as suchbr br come on people its a story based on some real people  thats all if i wanted a history lesson id sit at this computer and read wikipedia or something ma barker actual name arizona  or arrie  barker was never even charged with any crime and as other commentators have already pointed out she probably never even took part in her sons activities they sent her to the movies when they were working i hope she wasnt as critical as some of those who watched this movie br br theresa russell had the nevertooeasy task of portraying a woman from the age of 17 right through to her death at the age of 52  from a young girl running from home to the hardened mother of four hoodlum sons i think she did it pretty well the cheeky little smile she used in more than one scene was classical ok i will agree with some of the critics that the direction of this film was below par and i sympathise with the actors over that theresa should have told the director to forget the topless shots  they didnt contribute to the story maybe some biggername stars would have managed to inject some of their own expertise into overriding the poor direction whereas the secondgraders werent quite that brave who knows br br but whilst this was certainly no blockbuster it was worth more than 28 i have all my dvds on a personal database where i score them before looking at the imdb score although that sometimes influences slight changes later i take what i get on its own merits rather than holding one movie up against others of the same genre and this one i felt was entertaining enough to get 68 yep ill accept that such a practice does tend to depend on my mood at the time but then isnt that also true of those who vote on imdb however you may imagine my surprise when i looked at imdb and saw the pitiful score it got herebr br given the surprise i decided to read a few of the other comments in the hopes of understanding the low rating and i noticed that they are quite polarised i agreed with those who said the movie was worth watching and came to the conclusion that some people are just hard to please well since some were absolutely scathing why dont they get out there and make some better movies i will look forward to the gems they must be able to turn out on the other hand if they cant do that then why dont they just shut up
