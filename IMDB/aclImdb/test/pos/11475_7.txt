since frame number 1 you know the good guy in the suit and necktie is doomed he has no luck sorte nula or so he believes with that music on the car radio and the dubious talk by his best friend and company associate who is taking him to parts unknown through a desert road alberto wished simply to be left alone to take a flight abroad next day with well someone were left guessing br br the film goes a long way  thatll find short  to a closing scene with the man hearing the same music on a cab to the airport in between a number of lucky people have found different ways out of the story some dying some being born others falling into harrowing distress this time hes really doomed or is he the film is a sort of oneman show by director fernando fragata who only left the sound recording and the special effects to other competent people those who typically reject portuguese films due to sound problems and unclear speech recording must go searching for other topics to criticize this time the car crash this isnt spoilers the film is too clever for that makes for a great scene and apparently was done with cheap equipment us studios take notice you may spare a dollar or two by hiding competent portuguese directors br br the rest was done by fragata from the script to the dialogue from camera work to editing if part of the dialogue were adlibbed then he again must be congratulated for the acting direction and the casting with mostly inexperienced actors a large number of nonspeaking parts are credited but most of those people were used for the music video clip and the making of used extensively in the films promotional trailer the cast has a dozen actors and actresses of whom ten relevant persons and a huge number of relationships  that are revealed stepbystep in a thrilling suspenseful way reminiscent of the best genre authors alfred hitchcock qv and claude chabrol qv do come to mind by the catandmouse play between the director and his public and the nature of his charactersbr br i recommend this thriller and comedy to portuguese language speakers and if the film gets to have a decent translation of its colloquial dialogue to anyone abroad who enjoys those genres
