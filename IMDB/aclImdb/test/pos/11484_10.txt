i have watched this movie at least ten times i do not agree with the previous comments this is a tongue in cheek movie and some of the acting is meant to be stilted men like paul cowley are few and far between women like linda unfortunately are a dime a dozen the sad thing here is that although similiar relationships like this rarely lead to murder and frame ups it is an all to familiar scenario boy worships girl girl doesnt know he exists they grow up man sees woman he fantasized about down and out and rescues her bottom line she never did love himhe came along at the right time and she used him thomas is excellent as the nerdy but adequate paul his portrayal is sensitive and touching madsen is perfect as the femmefatale what really moved me was the final scene paul says he eventually cried but not for linda his wife but for the unknown girl he had watched from a distance so many years agoand longed forand loved and i loved the closeup of thomas at the end
