it is the best film i have seen in the last 5 years surely it will be in the same row with such masterpieces as the platoon apocalypse now the doors the dogs heart russian film really the play of the boy and his parents is so good that you cant even say that they play no they live as if it was happening to them notice the smile on there faces when the main hero agrees to go for a walk with them the hate and love in one piece and the final scenebr br really im still under impression of that film its very hard even impossible to combine the humor and the tragedy but if you succeed and frederikson did the impact would be twice strongbr br i compared it with one flew over the cuckoos nest i like this film either and the novel itself is good too but after frederiksons movie it seems simple the same difference i noticed after i watched the film american history x and romper stomper  the latter is deeper i mean milos forman only showed the material point of view of the problem you watch it then you say yes its a good film i like him i dont like her and thats it but angels leave you a wide base to think there are no bad and good boys in the film cause each of them have the right to behave in the way they do like the girlfriend of one of the patient of course shes young and is pregnant and that is a problem for her that his husband is in the clinic but the feelings and emotional experience of her exfriend are even stronger the result is his suicide why ask him what have he done arent you insane yourself to ask why do not support him help him understand him finally it is even funny when those people talk to each other they say genius things there are a lot of things i would like to say about this film but im not so good in english but im sure those of you who have watched the movie understand mebr br good luckbr br
