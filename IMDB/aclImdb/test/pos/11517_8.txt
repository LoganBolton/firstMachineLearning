lights of new york was the first alltalking feature film there had been of course the jazz singer released in oct 1927 as the first feature film incorporating synchronized dialog however this film released in july 1928 is virtually unremembered for its place in film history it had started out as a short but gradually more was tacked on until  clocking in at 58 minutes  it accidentally became the first alltalking feature film it opened to a grind house run and to warner bros surprise made over a million dollars that was good money back in 1928br br the plot is quite simple two country barbers naively buy into a barber shop on broadway that fronts as a speakeasy for the hawk a gangster when they learn the truth they cant afford to get out because the younger barber eddie has all of his mothers money tied up in the place kitty is the younger barbers girlfriend and gangster hawk wheeler oakman has an eye for turning in his older girlfriend gladys brockwell for a newer model  chorus girl kittyhelene costello a cop is killed while trying to stop the hawks men from unloading a shipment of bootleg liquor and the hawk sees it as an opportunity to frame eddie thus getting kitty for himselfbr br this early talkie is loads of fun for the enthusiast of these pioneering works sure the plot is elementary and the dialog stilted but there is something you dont see much of in early talkies  background musical scoring vitaphone had originally been used for this very purpose and here they are still using it for musical accompaniment along with the dialog and there are singing and dancing numbers the scenes in hawks nightclub are used as an opportunity to show off what films could never do before  musical numbers there is even a wildeyed emcee with some heavy makeup left over from the silent era that is a hoot to watchbr br vitaphone could not go outdoors at this point due to the static camera booths so the scene in the park between the two lovers eddie and kitty is simulated  and cheaply the greenery looks like something out of an ed wood movie or perhaps a high school production of our town br br gladys brockwell as the hawks castoff girlfriend delivers her lines with punch shes a real trooper considering what lines she has to deliver to the hawk  so you think you can have any chicken you want and throw me back in the deck huh mixed metaphors anyone and then there are her final lines ive lived and ive loved and ive lost did someone get paid to write this dialog brockwell was making a good success of her talkie career after scoring some triumphs in silent films the evil sister in seventh heaven when a fatal car accident cut her career shortbr br then there is eugene palette  the older of the two barbers in our story his frog voice natural delivery of lines and cuddly appearance gave him a long career as a character actor usually appearing as a putupon family manbusinessman with a gruff exterior and heart of gold in fact mr palette is the only member of this cast who still has a notable career in films just three years after this movie is releasedbr br finally there is the question of where is that microphone hidden microphones were still stationary at this point and its fun to figure out where theyve hidden it there is one famous scene though where everybody can pretty much figure it out hawk is in his office talking to his two henchman  who seem to comprehend as slowly as they talk  about taking eddie for a ride if you watch this scene youd swear the phone on the desk is a character in this film its front and center during the whole conversation the microphone is likely planted in the phonebr br there is something heroic about these pioneers flying blind in the face of the new technology of sound you have silent actors who are accustomed to using pantomime for expression vaudevillians who know how to play to a live audience but dont know how to make the same impression on a vitaphone camera booth and you have dialog writers either trying to write conversation as compactly as they did title cards or filling up films with endless chatter br br check this one out it is not boring moves fast and is loads of fun if you know what to look for and no i dont expect this one to ever be out on bluray but i hope that the folks at warner brothers add it to the warner archive soon so everyone can see it
