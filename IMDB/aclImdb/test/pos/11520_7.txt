take away all parts of the movie that were present day and stick to the flashbacks then you would have had a great story faith and wolfs story and their relationship was the best part diaz and eccleston were wonderful brewster was ponderous to sit through surprised to see blythe danner as mom she was great also look for patrick bergen as the father always like him sleeping with the enemy this is a very hippy save the world kind of film dont care for it much but i recommend seeing it for diazs performance alone she has excellent range and it should be used more eccleston is as always compelling hes wonderful
