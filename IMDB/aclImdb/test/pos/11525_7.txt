as a father of four in his forties i thought this film made compelling viewing  if not edgeoftheseat stuff i deserves a far higher rating than the 43 that it had when i wrote this i gave it 7br br i agree with some of the comments about the characters but cameron diaz was again sparkling in yet another very different role the plot was a little silly but the point of the film for me was beautifully summed up in the final quite surreal sequence a moving ending for any parentbr br i could imagine that a young single bloke might find the film quite boring but for other people not fixed on high doses of testosterone would find something sweet in this
