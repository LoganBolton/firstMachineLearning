i must admit this is one of cameron diazs unheard of films and i was also surprised that she had an important role but she was not the lead i was very touched by it as i really can identify the pain of the loss of a loved one as i have experienced it from close quartersbr br both camilla belle and jordana brewster were really good in their portrayal of the protagonist phoebe and i must also hand it to the casting people for finding two actresses who look so alike that i really thought they were sistersin real life this is one of those movies cameron did for the sake of acting and not for star billingshe looked the part of the gorgeous rebellious hippie who wants to change the world though sometimes she comes off as a rebel without a causebr br coming from a dysfunctional family where her only source of strength being her big sister faith little girl phoebe is understandably very upset when faith leaves for europe as she grows up she goes off in search of her sister and gradually gets disillusioned by the truth about her sister and falls for her sisters boyfriendbr br great story and equally great location shooting around europeani will watch it again
