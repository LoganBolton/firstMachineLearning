i caught this on late late mexican cable and i have to rant about it the title was translated as secretos secrets well theres a secret that has an important part in the movie but come on  we are not stupid we know theres a novel behind thisbr br anyways the movie is pretty interesting and its carried by its solid ramatic performances the always beautiful and stunning jordana brewster and christopher eccleston deliver great performances and have such great chemistry between them cameron d√¨az is also good although she has minimal onscreen time blythe danner is perfect and his last appearance in the movie is touching sad great performances br br jordanas character and her sisters exboyfriend travel to europe in order for her to deal with his demons and understand why her sister died through flashbacks we learn the sad truth and we cant help but feel sorry for the whole family the ending is truly moving br br so theres nudity but its minimal in fact the sex scenes are artsy and do not intend to be steamy or sexybr br to be honest i kept watching it for joranda brewsters on screen charming and beauty and i ended up liking the story and the dramatic presentations br br give this movie a try if you like solid dramatic features great movie the last last scene was very sad the two little sisters through flashbacks
