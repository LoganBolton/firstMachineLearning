the plot of this film is not complicated a very attractive young girl goes to europe in search of the reasons for her older sisters suicide ten years earlier there she meets up with her sisters former boyfriend and together they travel to all the places her sister went and gradually the reasons become clearbr br but what makes this film so special and soar above the limited plot are the beautiful portrayals of the characters although the older sisters boyfriend is a dropout hippie he has noble ideals moral standards and incredible strengths and although the older sister who we see in flashbacks shares these ideals she doesnt have a sense of limitation or balance of how much is too much and although the younger girl is fiercely loyal to her sisters memory she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was only a normal girl after allbr br the most special moment in the film is when the young girl and the sisters boyfriend finally stop fighting their attraction to each other i cant recall ever seeing more beautiful touching romantic tenderness in lovemaking in a filmbr br in all these ways this is a truly beautiful film a film to be treasured and to be seen again and again 9 out of 10
