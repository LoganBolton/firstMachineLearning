one of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romanceadventure holywood movies as if those werent reason enough to love it anyone who after seeing this movie complains about connerys accent or the lack of historical verisimilitude or the realism of the political motivations or any other extramovie concerns simply doesnt love movies see it and be awed by the starpower of the two leads the exotic romantic photography and music and the bold adventure of a truly escapist film this is proof that hollywood can make em like they used to when it really wants to a solid 810
