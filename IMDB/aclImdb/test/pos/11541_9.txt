ill put this as plainly as possible for those of you unaware of bill hicks legacy he was quite simply the greatest standup comedian in the world almost certainly in my opinion the greatest that ever lived his standup idol being the great richard pryor whose battles with addiction he paralleled his death in 1994 went barely noticed in the popular media coming just weeks after kurt cobain had committed suicide his tragic death at such a young age eclipses any sense of the injustice that he was criminally ignored during his life of course but the harsh truth is clear as day nobody has stepped up to claim his mantle there is not a standup comedian alive with nearly the skill and inventionbr br the observation is made in the affectionate tribute its just a ride that standup comedians often view the job as a stepping stone to richer pursuits  lame movies and morallydriven sitcoms made to occupy  but never enrich  the lives of an unimaginative audience its everything that bill hicks spoke against his sermon was always a rallying cry for people think for themselves to scrutinise authority to come together as one racebr br his appeal continues to grow with every passing year since his death his star will continue to shine long after so many lesser lights have blew out once youve been exposed to his brilliant intelligent but ultimately compassionate output you will be enriched and rewardedbr br the man himself was fond to quote dylan to live outside the law you must be honest he said bill hicks was honest beyond that he was the funniest of them all
