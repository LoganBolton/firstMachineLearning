when i first watched this movie i thought it was a very strange movie but i know that the director almost always has a purpose when he makes a movie so i decided to watch it one more time the second time i watched it i realised that albert puyn is a very talented and a very original film maker in the beginning the viewer was told that the movie took place a decade after the fall of the communism in the eastern europe but they had clothes and cars with a design typical for the 1950s they had plutonium which i think is a symbol for the futuristic trade i think that it means that the movies real time is not specified the music in the movie is creating a long music video which tells some parts of the actual story in the lyrics specially for the intro and the outrobr br albert puyn is using red and blue backcolor when hes showing the symbols for communism red and the capitalism and western world blue one can notice that icet has the name mao communism and that when hes in focus the backcolor is red the american cop starring burt reynolds is always filmed with blue backcolor the club where mao and his gang hang out is also with red backcolor crazy six is pendling between the red and the blue colorbr br the white little dog that mao had in the beginning symbolize i think the controlling force mao had the dog in the beginning but the cop took it in the end that symbolize i guess the fall of communism and the replacement of the capitalistic way of thinking from the western world in eastern europebr br i think crazy six is a very wellmade movie albert puyn creates an scifiaction movie with a politicial depth its a different but a very special movie about the communism fall in the eastern europebr br im looking forward to watch another spectacular movie of albert puyn
