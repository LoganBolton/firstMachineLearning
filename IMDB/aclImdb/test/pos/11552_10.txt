i watched pola x because scott walker composed the film score and i admire his music a lot frankly i expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent french movie i was wrong the vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest  starting with the opening sequence which shows black and white footage of military airplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and scott walkers beautiful wailing voice the film explores the identity crisis of pierre guillaume depardieu  a brilliant choice for the role and his consequential selfdestruction the story is divided into two parts  the first depicts pierres carefree life in a beautiful house in the french countryside and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after he abandons everything and moves to paris to live in squalor with his supposed halfsister both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography  the first very colorful and bright the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic  adding up to a true aesthetic feast pola x is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience
