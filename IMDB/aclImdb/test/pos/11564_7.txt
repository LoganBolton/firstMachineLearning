dakota incident is a curiosity for several reasons it will be obvious from the start that it was made long before anyone ever thought of political correctness although the ward bond character softens the edge with maybe we can communicate with them after all theyre humans too type of dialogue his part stands sidebyside with the preacher attemtping to communicate with the martians in war of the worlds in fact its uncanny the title is curious too use of the word incident contributes an importance and sophistication to the film that probably didnt hurt boxoffice the contrived assortment of characters and linda darnells fancy dress and hat are wonderful dated touches that make dakota incident a cool western artifact from the midfifties
