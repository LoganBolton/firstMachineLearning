i used to watch this show when i was growing up when i think about it i remember it very well if you ask me it was a good show two things i remember very well are the opening sequence and theme song in addition to that everyone was ideally cast the writing was also very strong the performances were topgrade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up id like to say that ill always remember this show in my memory forever even though i havent seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
