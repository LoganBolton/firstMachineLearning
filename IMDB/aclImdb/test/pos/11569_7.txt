ok the show was a little uneven but i still loved it i found the main two bunnies annoying but hamton  plucky were always amusingbr br i really want the baby plucky episodes on dvd or even vhs please release thosebr br specifically the potty years episode aired on 112291 the going up episode aired on 91792 and the minister golf episode in 1192br br they are the funniest bits of the whole series and even over a decade later we still reference these bitsbr br i have nothing more to say please reduce the minimum to something like 5 lines and rewards us for brevity
