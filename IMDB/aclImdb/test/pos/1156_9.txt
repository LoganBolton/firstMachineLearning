1904 the north african nation of morocco is hanging onto a tenuous independence as the various european powers  france germany britain russia spain and now the united states  are vying for influence in the region the sultan marc zuber is a weak puppet his uncle the bashaw vladek sheybal who is being manipulated by the french and germans is the real power behind the throne enter berber chieftan raisuli sean connery the leader of the rif tribe and the last of the barbary pirates who kidnaps an american missionary eden pedecaris candice bergen and her two children and takes them hostage back in the us president theodore roosevelt brian keith threatens to go to war over the issue pedecaris alive or raisuli dead  seeing the issue as the perfect way to exercise his big stick diplomacy though secretary of state john hay john huston is not so confident however the raisuli has less sinister plans for the pedecarises who are more than capable of handling themselves in any eventbr br john miliuss great historical film based very loosely off of a true story ie pedecaris was a middleaged man is a wonderful bit of escapism it has some amazing action scenes a witty wellwritten script a fine cast enjoying themselves with the material and does not overstay its welcome like say pirates of the caribbean or the lord of the rings movies its not really an epic film in the strictest sense but its one of the best pure action movies ever madebr br while the historical context is shaky the storyline is interesting and as some reviewers point out it is even more pertinent today than it was when made as president roosevelt says america is like a grizzly bear  fierce strong but a little blind and reckless at times at the time of the films setting america has just been propelled onto the world stage as superpower following their resounding victory in the spanishamerican war  and roosevelt seizes this incident as a way to prove americas worth in real life it didnt quite work out that way but allegorically it works well while written from a rightwing perspective miliuss screenplay is pretty accurate in assessing america and its place in the world he admires roosevelt and his method of big stick diplomacy and correctly recognizes in the words of roosevelt that while america may be feared and respected theyll never be truly loved by the world no matter what they do and there are some scenes  like roosevelts target shooting of european leaders and the almostcomic surprise attack by marines on the bashaws palace  which show americas reckless and violent side while others  the climactic showdown with the germans  show their heroismbr br the historicalpolitical context of the film is of course merely meat on the bones of what is essentially a rousing actionadventure film there are some brilliantly done action scenes such as raisulis rescue of the pedecariss from doublecrossing tribesmen which features some of the best swordplay in any film the opening entrance of the raisuli and the aforementioned march and attack of the us marines are brilliantly done bravura set pieces and the final battle which combines elements of lawrence of arabia and the wild bunch while a major historical fantasy a threeway battle between germans americans and the rifs is a superbly staged adrenalinepumping sequencebr br the excellent cast gives some wonderful performances everyone seems to be having a fun time with the film and it shows sean connery is surprisingly convincing as a berber with a scottish accent but manages to pull off his interesting welldrawn and chivalrous character who comes to respect his hostage and abhors modern uncivil warfare candice bergen an actress whom ive never been fond of gives a fine performance as the feisty eden pedecaris who is every bit as tough as her captor brian keith is an amazingly convincing tr  you really feel he must have been like this an athletic blustering yet practical and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self the scenes of roosevelt boxing and targetshooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest bad ass moments in movie history  and who can forget lines like why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality john huston provides solid support as the weary cautious hay acting as a perfect foil to the much more impetuous roosevelt br br among the fine supporting cast the best are geoffrey lewis as samuel gummere the cynical ambassador caught in the middle of the political intrigue and steve kanaly as the gungho marine captain who cheerfully advocates and carries out military intervention as the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation other familiar faces such as vladek sheybal nadim sawalha roy jenson larry cross marc zuber and darrell fetty also do fine work no matter how small their role spaghetti western fans will recognize antoine saintjohn a fistful of dynamite as the german general and aldo sambrell as one of raisulis tribesmenbr br the wind and the lion is all around a wonderfully done adventure film it has something for everyone wonderful gun and swordplay a lot of humor a tough feisty heroine and her two cute children a nice if unconsummated romance and an interesting if fanciful politicalhistorical context its not a masterpiece but hey it wasnt trying to be i give the wind and the lion a stirring nine stars and my highest recommendation
