tesis open your eyes and the others were proof of amenabars talent and skill as a filmmaker but in my humble opinion were also flawed films in their attempt to outsmart the audience always offering one turn of the screw too many favoring cheap thrills twists and turns over depth and resonance lucky for everyone amenabar chose a subject for his new film that would not allow a surprise ending focusing on characters and the emotional ties that bind them br br the result is a little miracle of a film beautifully written photographed scored acted and directed everyone involved in this film delivers a carrerhigh performancebehind and in front of the cameras from the wonderful cast bardem shines but mabel rivera celso bugallo clara segura and lola due√±as give the film an amazing authenticity to aguirresarobes exquisite lensing br br the film taps on many relevant issues and emotions effectively  it addresses heart and mind with equal power and delivers a final punch that stays with you long after the credits roll this is a brilliantly executed film that not only will stand as a landmark in spanish cinema but will surely become a pleasant surprise when it opens in the abroad sony classics has paid a record 6 million dollars to distribute it dont be surprised it it manages to get in the oscar race theres no stopping amenabarbr br buen trabajo alejandro
