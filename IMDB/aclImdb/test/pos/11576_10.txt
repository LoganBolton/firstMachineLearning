once again almenábar has provided us with a top quality film this director is amazing and hes proven that hes equally talented and effective when crossing genres br br the excellent character development of the movie through dialogue and personality quirks but with more subtle details as well ramons fathers gaze allows the audience to identify with the protagonists very closely making the importance and emotional impact of the events which take place all the more profound the visuals are at times simple at times stunning the dream to the beach and i think almenábars films really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music  it matched the films varying moods flawlesslybr br more than just a film about euthanasia which in itself is an important issue this film tackles the duality of a man who at times genuinely seems to enjoy life albeit in a quite limited way and yet one who is unswerving in his desire to die the overwhelming sadness of the film is punctuated by welltimed quips of humor which seem all the funnier because they provide a welcome respite from the melancholy you will certainly feelbr br although clearly in favor of euthanasia this film does an excellent job representing the myriad points of view of ramons friends and family most poignant was ramons father when he said despondent theres only one thing worse than losing a child that the child wants to diebr br excellent writing acting directing cinematography music  1010
