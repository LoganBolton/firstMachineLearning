since many other users have already explained and commented the storyline i wont do itbr br however id like to restate that bardems interpretation is terrific as also are those of the other actors and actresses in this film br br reading the previous comments ive noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film doesnt show points of view opposed to euthanasia and that those little present are ridiculed in my honest opinion this is far from truebr br there are many characters that move in a gray zone between loving ramón sampedro and wanting him to stay and understanding his desire to die most obvious of those are the family for instance ramóns sisterinlaw never talks for or against euthanasia another such character is gené the social rights activist who in the last moment tells ramón to rethink it all the scene clearly shows that she doesnt want him to diebr br then there are characters who are clearly against euthanasia ramóns brother is clearly against it as is his father theres only one thing worse than the death of son and its having a son that wants to die other users have commented that the discussion between ramón and the priest is ridiculed and filmed to make us think that ramón is good and the priest is bad well no doubt the scene is comic but that doesnt mean the priest is caricatured or ridiculed from my point of view the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince ramón to keep on living using arguments totally alien to ramóns thinking the priests speech goes on the line of god gives and god takes we arent the owners of our own lives they belong to god and so on the comedy arises from the fact that ramón is atheist and all the priest is saying to him is therefore nonsensebr br this film is the antithesis of manicheism it leaves the spectator the chance to think on the subject and make up hisher own opinion and above anything else is a chant of freedom
