i have seen the sea within today and i loved it the actors of the movie are wonderful specially javier bardem of course but i thought that belén rueda would have a better role lola dueñas clara segura and specially mabel rivera perform excellent interpretations and i cannot forget celso bugallo and joan dalmau brother and father of the protagonistbr br there are two technical aspects i loved very much aguirresarobes photography and the score by amenábar himself i liked the song negra sombra dark shadow by luz casal with music of carlos núñezbr br in short i think that the spanish academy should choose the sea within in order to compete in the oscar awards i liked other spanish productions such as almodóvars bad education but amenábars film is much better than them the sea within deserves all the awards
