why couldnt the end of the movie have been sean connerys men fighting the french instead of the germans ever since the french had occupied algeria in 1830 the tribes from morocco and those of algeria were making raids on the french military and civilian settlements this movie could have been a continuous of that historical aspect where the french had seize the rasuadli so his followers would not be raiding algeria and then his followers would have attacked the french to free himbr br the movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the germans and the americans when the americans shoot the germans their guns even the pistols make loud noises create large bloody bullet wounds and their enemies are screaming after being shot when germans shoot at the americans their guns dont make large sounds do not create bloody wounds and their enemies make little or no sound after being shotbr br in real life the american krag rifle was the worst rifle america had ever produce until the early version of the m16 came along the krag was hard to maintain not reliable and the rifle bolt was always jamming the german mauser was one of the worlds finest rifles we were so impress by it during spanish american war that we made a copy of it and call it the springfield riflebr br finally the people of morocco must had a word for artillery since the french were using them in their raids against morocco i didnt like it when they made the rasuldai feel stupid that there was no word for artillery in the moorican vocabulary instead the rasuadli stated that the europeans had guns on wheels that make the ground shake
