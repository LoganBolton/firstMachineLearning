its a soapopera drawing upon an applied ethics idea a movie about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie i didnt get any emotion from it the ideas are not at all new the tension lacks it becomes tedious towards the second half but towards the end i think it becomes quite interesting in a burlesque way i mean you have this middleaged paralyzed bald guy who gets more women than don juan he doesnt seem to suffer as much as you would expect from someone completely paralyzed for over 28 years he has no issues with god and one would probably expect that too the people around him seem to be the perfect slaves i cant get out of my mind bergmans cries and whispers similar to this one in many respects which simply bursts with emotions and not all of them humane etc this movie is the perfect recipe for housewives who look for some emotional thrill but dont expect to be blown away the movie is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical issue without any desire to arouse the viewer amenabar doesnt rub your face in it and he doesnt take sides he doesnt want to make us fanatics for a particular idea still i have no clue as to why this movie was so highly regarded
