i just saw mar ardentro and felt that i had to comment on this film euthanasia is a difficult topic in any field and unfortunately is can sometimes distort the true value of a movie many people have raved about the excellent cast and its beautiful imagerycamerawork certainly javier bardem is an actor that brings something extra to each film he makes to say that he encompasses the real sampredo is a little silly since i dont think that any of the reviewers have known sampredo personally to lie still and use a certain charm is a acting skill that although well performed doesnt constitute a perfect performance bardem just does what he does welland thats it the camerawork is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the movie itself lacks to deliver sampredo here is shown as a man that is bend on dying so much that he leaves his loving family behind and marries a woman that he only seeks out when the other will not help him in his quest for a dignified death now im not here to say anything about the right for or against euthanasia the problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it the movies subject is so strong that youre almost compelled to discuss the movie in that strong subject matter i find it a weakness for the movie unintentionally portrays sampredo as a unsymphatetic character someone who is much smarter then his family as portrayed in the simple cousin that doesnt get the double layered poem directed towards him someone who will leave a loving and caring family because he thinks his life is undignified a scene that is juxtaposed to the female lawyer who according to the movie makes the wrong choice ending up in a far state of dementia thus indicating that sampredos choice was the right one the woman that constantly seeks him out is almost disregarded for the beautiful lawyer but suddenly is married by sampredo when she agrees to help him die these choices make sampredo into a calculated figure no matter how charming bardem portrays him argumentive i would say it doesnt convince fully and i kinda think that amenabar didnt intend on adding this unbalanced element in his film for a young director its still an impressive film and it certainly has its strong moments the discussion between the priest and sampredo for instance the camerawork is impressive and the film is well acted but 10 out of 10no the movie doesnt reach that excellence
