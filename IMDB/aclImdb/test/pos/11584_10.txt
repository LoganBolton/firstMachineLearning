as i expected would happen too many reviews of this film from professionals and amateurs alike have focused as much if not more on the films ideology thats because the sea inside aka mar adentro is a film about euthanasia specifically its a true story about an infamous galician named ramón sampedro who fought for many years for the right to assisted suicide who was denied that right by the spanish constitutional court and whowell i dont want to ruin the ending of the film for youbr br the real life sampedro catalyzed a national debate on euthanasia in spain now with producerdirectorwritercomposereditor alejandro amenábars abre los ojos 1997 and the others 2001 biopic the sea inside another rhetorical aid has been provided in the international debate on this hot button issuebr br but as i keep saying to deaf ears your opinion pro or con on the films ideology shouldnt affect your rating of the film youre not supposed to be rating the philosophical or political messages that amenábar wants to make youre supposed to be rating the film as a film maybe thats a bit too idealistic as none of us can likely completely divorce our evaluations from our ideological biases but idealistic or not thats the goalbr br so forget about the philosophical and political issues for a moment as a film amenábar has turned in one of his most elegant and mature works to date he does not focus on societal debates he does not focus on sampedros legalpolitical struggles he focuses on sampedro as a man living out his days confined to a bed in his brothers homebr br sampedro played here in an amazing performance by javier bardem was a quadriplegic as the film begins he has been a quadriplegic for 26 years that condition was brought about as amenábar shows us through marvelously shot flashbacks by a diving accidentsampedro was distracted by a beautiful woman miscalculated the water dove in snapped his neck and almost drowned as a quadriplegic he eventually began writing poetry some of which was published in a book entitled cartas desde el infierno letters from hell in real life sampedros book became a best seller in spain perhaps taking sampedros artistic work as a cue amenábar has created an elegantly poetic filmbr br most of the sea inside is set inside sampedros bedroom the focus in these scenes is bardems complex and sublime performance as a quadriplegic bardem is limited to moving his head and talking he has mastered subtle changes of expression and inflection to convey a deep character with a multifaceted intellectual approach to life bardem and amenábar have sampedro often waxing philosophical in understated speech but theres always a combination of a wicked sense of humor passion for the aestheticincluding music and women and a sadness and even occasionally bitterness not far below the surface different underlying emotions occasionally break through like waves on the skin of the oceanbr br the people sampedro interacts with most frequently facilitate this in complex ways these others include his sisterinlaw manuela mabel rivera who has been his chief caretaker since sampedros accident his brother josé celso bugallo who is one of the vocal objectors to sampedros wish to die and with whom there is an underlying unresolved issue it seems like maybe josé was the one to save sampedro from drowning his nephew javier tamar novas who is perhaps the most understanding towards him a righttodie advocate gené clara segura a pro bono lawyer julia belén rueda whom he wanted because she had a degenerative disease cadasil cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy and would thus by more empathic and who he falls in love with and rosa lola dueñas a local woman who works at a cannery and moonlights as a dj who heard about him from the media who wants to convince him to desire to live and who falls in love with himbr br the bulk of the film consists of these characters interacting with sampedro in his room there are also a few other ancillary characters including sampedros father who remains oddly distant and a notorious and mediaconscious priest padre francisco josé maría pou who does his best to change sampedros mind via philosophytheology in a scene often mistakenly characterized as comicit has an attendant comic element but the scene is primarily very seriousbr br that most of the film takes place in sampedros room ingeniously gives the couple significant changes in setting greater impact sampedros room has a nice big window which he says he is satisfied with as an observation point on the world maybe even more importantly he regularly imagines the window as a launching pad through which he flies across the hillsides to the ocean which he always loved and which has been the most influential force in his lifeit provided his living when he was younger and took his mobility away amenábar gives us a fantastical sequence of sampedro imagining one of his flights to the sea it is beautifully shot with low angles presumably from a helicopter of the hills rushing by until we follow a stream to the wideopen ocean which in this film represents freedom the infinite and natural forcesbr br the other significant change of setting arrives with sampedro finally taking to a wheelchair he otherwise refused them saying they mocked his immobility to make an appearance in court to help plead his case amenábar gives us a poignant melancholy travelogue shot subjectively of sampedro viewing life and the world in action from the car windowbr br whether you agree with legalizing euthanasia or not its difficult to deny that this is a wellacted wellscripted and wellconstructed film you may not believe that its a ten and thats even more unlikely if you disagree with legalizing euthanasia but its still worth watching as a fine example of artistic sophisticated filmmaking
