the true story of a spanish paraplegic ramón sampedro who fought for decades for the right to be euthenized this film along with the best picture winner of the same year million dollar baby caused a stir that year with their depictions of disabled persons desiring death both advocates for the disabled and unfortunately for the disability advocates conservative prolife groups protested both films and their oscar nominations the nominations also came during the entire terry schiavo debacle just to put it all in some historical perspective the protests especially from the disability groups against million dollar baby make some sense  the film clearly depicted without wavering the life of a paraplegic as worthless the films central character maggie fitzgerald becomes a paraplegic doesnt seem to get any counseling whatsoever no help whatsoever and immediately wants to die the film is honestly pretty dumb and uncomplex the sea inside based on the true story is certainly a lot more thoughtful on the subject it most likely got railroaded into the same category as million dollar baby without its protesters having even seen it an incredibly common phenomenon the film does give time to many different sides of the argument and it immediately declares that the wish to die is that of the protagonist and the protagonist alone it is guilty of a couple of crimes though and id still understand why disability groups could have a problem with it first and foremost theres the protagonists meeting with a paraplegic bishop i dont look kindly on the way hes depicted his orally operated wheelchair is depicted as absurd and theres almost a comic sequence where his effeminate boytoy servants are dragging him in his chair up the stairs he cant even reach the room in which ramón is located and one of the boytoys is forced to carry the conversation between them i had to think gee maybe if ramón lived in a slightly more wheelchairaccessible household he wouldnt spend his entire life in bed and might find life more fulfilling who knows how closely the film depicts the reality director amenábar the others also includes some laughable scenes that try to make this film about suicide more lifeaffirming like a crosscut sequence where ramón looks thoughtful and his lawyers baby is born but besides a few ugly moments the film is very good it hurts that someone may want to die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others however in the end our lives do belong to us shouldnt we have the right to choose the films strongest asset is its supporting characters and the actors who play them it depicts how ramóns fight and decisions affect those around him with a beautiful precision the family members in particular are great and ramóns final departure from them is absolutely heartbreaking and had me in tears my favorite performance in the film comes from lola dueñas whom i also felt gave the best or at least certainly most undervalued performance in almodóvars volver last year
