many more eloquent reviews than this have described the quite spectacular acting casting and styling of this film it appears that the only negative reviews focus on a perceived imbalance in the films handling of the core moral question euthanasiabr br this film is bar the final scenes meticulous in stressing ramons belief that hes not making some grand point but merely that for him a life devoid of dignity is a life not worth living we as viewers see an enormous amount of dignity in his life  we see family and friends and culture and but for its physical limitations a life fully lived central to the tragedy of this film is that there is really only one person who thinks that ramons life is not worth living  and that is himbr br to watch this film and say that the only counter argument comes from the visit of a bumbling priest is a nonsense the priests visit is pure farce a direct assault on the simplicity of the spanish catholic churchs response to the issue of euthanasia however the sisters parting words to the priest momentarily expose the powerful prolife sentiments quietly underpinning the entire film we are constantly encouraged to see the hope and the beauty of a life lived with love as the film progresses we may gradually be encouraged to understand ramons reasoning but we are never reconciled to his decision br br i do not remember a film which moved me and provoked me as much as this
