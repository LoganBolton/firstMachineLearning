i saw this movie at the locarno film festival in italianspeaking part of switzerlandbr br aishwarya rai is goodlookingbr br i rate this movie 710 because of its nice momentsbr br  spoilers ahead br br it has some really nice cinematic moments in it specially at the endbr br though my general feeling is this is too long over 2 hours and 40 minutes and containing too much dialogs and nearly no dancing at allbr br clearly a bollywood movie like lagaan or devdas is quite a different kind of movie compared with chokher bali
