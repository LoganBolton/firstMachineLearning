its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires what does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms one husband finds outlet with the immigrant  since immigrants dont belong or arent accepted they dont need to conform and dam their desires the other husband looks for solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness it fails  of course  and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires the mother in her still couldnt find the strength to destroy his myth she sees him as a child who is glorifying himself in his lustcontrol but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow up both the wives find courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband br br but the final act of rejection was by the grandmother  she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept sitas desire a decade and more of receiving care was not enough to break the shackles of her culturebr br seems like it was easiest for the househelp to let his desires flow  since hes anyway damned by his culture  being at the bottom of the hierarchy since there is anyway no respect and expectations might as well taste sin
