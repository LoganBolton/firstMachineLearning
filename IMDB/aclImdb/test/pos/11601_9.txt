its very tough to portray a tagore novel along cinematographic linesand if you forget an obscure production of 1967 then its the first time that chokher bali has been done on a grand scale overall the sets looked fantastic with the right touches for making a successful period dramaprasenjitso used to doing crass commercial stuff made a good efforti saw the bengali version and found that aishwariyas voice was dubbedwhich made her dialog delivery a bit poor while the director did a good job portraying each of the characters with finesseyet there was very little in the way of meaningful plotprobably a lack of the story itselfhowever the development of the characters including those with minor roles seem to be the strongest pointits tough to make some tagore stories into filmsas only the visual parts seem to get realized
