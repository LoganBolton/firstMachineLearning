the hindi version of the film is 121 minutes set in bengal in the early 1900s the film based on tagores novel draws an analogy between the british colonization of india and the subjugation of women an educated and beautiful woman binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage but she does not accept the constraints imposed on her as a widow by her society the film has a beautiful look to it but perhaps aishwarya rai is out of her depth in portraying binodinis strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and deviousness binodinis idealism does not come across and as a result the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried
