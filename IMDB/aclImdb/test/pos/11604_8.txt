i bought the dvd a long time ago and finally got around to watching iti really enjoyed watching this film as you dont get the chance to see many of the more serious better quality bollywood films like this very well done and but i would say you need to pay attention to what is going on as it is easy to get lost when you start watching the movie dont do anything else i would actually advise people to read all the reviews hereincluding the ones with spoilers before watching the movie raima sen gave her first great performance that i have seen aishwarya was easily at her best all performances were strong directing and cinematographygo watch it
