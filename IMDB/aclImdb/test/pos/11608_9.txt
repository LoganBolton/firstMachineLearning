chokher bali was shown at the washington dc filmfest april 15 2005 the director rituparno ghosh was there to give a short introduction and answer questions afterwardsbr br as always i think aishwarya did a fantastic job i can understand those who think she should be been more aggressive or more bitchy but would that really be realistic in 1904 possible maybe realistic im not so sure i think her interpretation was valid although there could certainly be other ways to do itbr br i hate to use the word but this was the most inaccessible of the indian movies i have seen so far i know a fair amount of indian history hindu religion etc but the level of detail here was far beyond me clearly you would have a much better understanding of the movie if you were intimately familiar with hinduism and its customs esp as they were c 1904 i missed a lot of thingsone of them being the fact that the motherinlaw would want binodini in the house as sort of a counterweight to her daughterinlaw ashalatabr br spoilers ghosh had several things to say that explained the movie much better for me first the original bengali version was 20 minutes longer so what was left out apparently three main things a beginning segment where binodini aishwarya leaves e bengal for calcutta according to the director different characters are speaking w bengali vs e bengalisetting up some of the political comments later of course all of this is lost in the hindi version and certainly to a nonindian like me it wouldnt have mattered anywaybut a setup of the bengali situation sure would have next there was a segment where binodini was writing a poema sign of her independence etc finally some more business about the jewellery so although some people think it was too long i think the original longer version would have been clearerbr br the womens hair was apparently another sign ghosh againthe motherinlaw had short hair short hair for hindu widows her sisteralso a widowhad longer hair more modern and of course binodiniaishwarya had extremely long waistlength hair rejection of status of widowhoodbr br the ending really threw meall of a sudden binodini who had never had a political thought is writing a political manifesto whoa ghosh explained that he was in locarno at a film festival when the subtitles were done the subtitles use the word country throughout binodinis letter gosh said a more appropriate word would have been i forget his exact word something like self or independenceshe was talking about her own liberation and finding herselfnot about bengal india and the british so why does binodini just disappear the day after finding behari again apparently because during her stay on the ganges she realizes that she doesnt need a manany manto definecomplete her she can just be herself so she rejects behari who she threw herself at a few months  before and just goes off of course im not sure how she buys her next meal but thats another questionbr br the red shawl ghosh againshe buys represents revolution as well as passion im not 100 sure why she puts the shawl on the dying woman but perhaps she is rejecting passionrevolution the binoculars which binodini uses throughout the movie to watch mahendra and ashalata the boat on the ganges etc she is being a voyeur to see a life she yearns for but cant have at the end i missed this she leaves the binoculars on the table with the letter showing that she doesnt need them any moreshes going off to lead her own lifebr br finally the tagore quote at the beginning saying how he apologized for the ending apparently tagore wrote this as a serial hooking his readers with the sexy widow bits but at the end he sold out to conservatism and had binodini kneel down at the feet of mahendra and behari begging their forgiveness one of his students  wrote to tagore taking him to task for his sellout endingand tagore replied with his apology for the ending in the movie of course ghosh goes in the other direction
