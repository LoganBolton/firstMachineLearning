i´ve seen this piece of perfection  during the fantasy filmfest in berlin and when i went out of the cinema i felt like being drugged down i´ve seen a lot of films but there are just a few that i´d call perfect like koyaanisqatsi or fight clubsubconscious cruelty is definitely one of them half of the people went out of the screening in berlin and i can understand them absolutely this is not a movie for normal people with dreams and illusions a person that is living in hisher dreams day by day not wanting to see all the horror in our life and on our planet will be very shocked by this film if someone reads this now who has seen sc and also thinks it´s great just contact meso far i haven´t met anyone who shares my opinionit´d be cool this film earns 10 points out of 10 finally i´m really sorry for my bad englishi´m not a studied person und das ist auch gut so g
