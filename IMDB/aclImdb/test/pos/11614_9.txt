karim hussains masterpiece of artgorethis cat is definitely a talent to look out for we have in this several longer vignettes interspliced with some shorter segues this is all in all a very powerful film that relies on its intense graphic imagery and symbolism and it is not for all viewersbr br the film kicks off with a short called ovarian eyeball very short segment that has a nude woman placed on a table naked an unseen womans hand covers the supine womans face with a red cloth and makes an incision in her abdomen out of which an eyeball stalk is extracted ive got nothing too much to comment on this one due to its brevitybr br human larvae is one of the films lynchpins and it is a totally unflinching portrayal of a perverse act committed by a disturbed man who has an incestuous love for his pregnant sister this is one of those must be seen to be believed type things i will say that this film has some of the best effects ive seen in an indie horror film but the subject matter will make this an undeniably unpleasant experience for most not me thoughi live for thisbr br rebirth could have been cut out of this film all together this is the films weakest segment and it has a bunch of nude people fcking bloody holes in a field and whatnot very short but this one kind of blows the films momentumbr br right brainmartyrdom is one of the most profane representations of religious imagery that i have ever seen and it totally kicks ass think p iss christ or menstrual blood paintings of the virgin mary very hard sexualsexually violentgory imagery is presented in this piece and it is definitely not for anyone who will be offended by sacrilegebr br subconscious cruelty is one of the best films ive seen under the banner of extreme horror it will be a very divisive film amongst horror fans and the filmgoing public in general some will call it trash some will call it brilliant i dont see much middle ground i thought this film was pretty damn original and i will recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to try it 910
