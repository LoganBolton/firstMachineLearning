going into this movie i knew two things about it i knew that it was a real extreme flick and i knew that it was somewhat artsy both appeal to me in their own right but when placed together it can be something truly unique and this was damn right without a doubt unique like i said above it is an artsy film the way they used some intense sound it reminded me a lot of an aronofsky film visually i havent seen anything like it the cinematography and lighting were done very well the movie seriously uses visuals and sounds better than anything ive seen in a while especially when you consider the experience these young filmmakers had couple 20 year olds you really have to take your hat off to thembr br the movie isnt easy to describe or even discuss there isnt an actual storyyou could say it revolves around the right and left side of the brain and how they control your lifei think its four segments or four ideas brought alive through visual and auditory extremes there is some talking hear and there but its mostly a nonspeaking filmbr br the first segment is the shortest and it revolves a naked body and an eyeball try and guess what happenswrong the second segment is my favorite it involves a brother and a sister who looks a little like sarah silverman but with bigger boobs the brother is crazy and the sister is somewhat of a whore i would say this is the most extreme of all the segments and the most well made the gore effects in this one were great the third segment revolves around a bunch of naked people sexing it up with mother earth its probably considered the weakest of the bunch but still is smart and well made the fourth segment is probably the strongest of the film and id also say the deepest for myself ill have to view this a couple times to understand whats truly being said i know that it tackles christianity in a way that would most likely make your mother feint or throw upgive it a trybr br subconscious cruelty was recommended to me and im proud to say this is now in my movie collection its extreme violent gory very sexual and surprisingly pretty damn thought provoking the next line im about to say has been used in almost every review ive read for this film this movie is not for everyone now aint that the truth if youre into extreme films andor youre just a lover of film that wants to see something differentcheck this out 8 12 outta 10
