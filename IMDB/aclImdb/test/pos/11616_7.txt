well its safe to say that subconscious cruelty is one weird film supposedly an insight into the human mind subconscious cruelty is comprises four macabre and bizarre tales of the extreme the first segment entitled ovarian eyeball is really just a warm up but its good in that it gives the viewer an idea of what to expect from the next three segments it simply sees a naked woman laid out on a table while another woman cuts into her abdomen and pulls out a human eyeball ive got no idea what the point is but it certainly makes for visceral viewing the following story is the best of the bunch and takes in the old favourite sick movie theme of incest the segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister hes repulsed by her pregnancy  yet he wants to have sex with her anyway and naturally he gets his way this story stands out because of the monotonous and matter of fact narration as well as the ending  which doesnt fail to deliver the shocks this segment is well acted well filmed and easily the highlight of subconscious crueltybr br naturally the next two sections arent as good as the second one so the only way from there is down but director karim hussain still manages to pull something out of the bag before the film ends he doesnt do it right away however as the third segment is the weakest of the film and simply sees a lot of people have sex with the ground its very surreal and therefore memorable for that same reason but there doesnt seem to be a lot of point to it and i was in the mood for something a bit more morbid after the second section the film ends on a high however as while im not entirely sure what the point was  the final segment features the films best imagery this segment focuses on religion and certainly isnt for anyone that values it director karim hussain has achieved something here  as while this collection of four extreme stories doesnt come together as a complete whole the film almost feels tasteful as its shot in such an eloquent and eye catching manner the director would seem to have been imitating the highly respected surreal director luis bu√±uel albeit with gore rape and incest and if you ask me he hasnt done a bad job at all not for everyone but certainly worth a look for extreme fanatics
