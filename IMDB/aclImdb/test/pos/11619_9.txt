first off  this film will not be for everybody there are scenes of extreme graphic violence and disturbing images that by their nature alone will turn off many possible potential viewers obviously from the reviews on this board  subconscious cruelty has divided those that have seen it im among the ones who liked it very much for several different reasons i feel this was a very ambitious and quite competently pulled off undertaking for a bunch of 1819 year olds with no budget and little experience i think that each aspect of the film  the direction the acting though the characters performances are more likened to stage or freeform performance because of the nature of the film the production the fx the scoresound design  all are far superior to many films ive seen that exceed these kids budget and experience tenfold i honestly havent been this impressed with an arthouse style horror film since nacho cerdas genesisbr br first off  im not going to pretend to understand andor grasp all of the graphical content in this film  but knowing that this wasnt a straightnarrative type of film when i went into it i wasnt disappointed with how it played out subconscious cruelty is 4 relatively short vignettes that all sort of revolve around the theory of right brainleft brain lustangerpsychosis vs restraintcompassionnormalcy to very briefly give a synopsis of each chapterbr br ovarian eyeball basically just has a naked girl who has an eyeball cut out of her abdomen im sure its symbolic of something  i dont think i was paying that much attention at that point and this one blows by pretty quick br br the next episode  human larvae  is a nihilistic horrific genuinely creepy story of a guy whos both in love with and repulsed by his pregnant sister who gives into his growing psychosis which leads up to the shocking conclusion of that particular chapter human larvae is the best of the bunch in my book and will probably get under your skin the deadpan narrative dialog accentuates the growing tension as you know something horrible is going to happen  but youre not quite sure what it is do yourself a favor and if you are interested in seeing this film  dont do too much research on it come into it with an open mind and an iron stomach and i think you be pleasantly surprised especially with this particular episodebr br rebirth has a bunch of people in a field screwing the ground and blowing trees and stuff apparently an arty interpretation of the rape of the earth or something to that effect not bad but this one is pretty short too and i sorta missed the point on itbr br and right brainmartyrdom seems to be about religion and religious hypocrisy and also along with human larvae has some of the hardest imagesmessages of the whole featurebr br ovarian eyeball isnt anything to write home about mainly because of its very short running time but does make a decent segue into the insanity to comeand rebirth is also kind of short and not quite as thought provoking but human larvae especially and right brainmartyrdom are so offthewall and well done that they more than make up for the other parts i think the main reason that i liked this one so much is that as shocking repulsive violent and excessive as it is it is also done very beautifully and you can tell this was a real laboroflove from those involved nothing about the film feels cheap or rushed and even if the content isnt completely decipherable its undeniably original  and that alone ups the points some in my book not that every weird arthouse film that has an unintelligible plot should be praised for its originality but subconscious cruelty is the type of film that i do think ill watch a few more times in the near future to see what other interpretations i may gain from it again this film is absolutely not for everyone  with some very extreme scenes of gore murder rape incest sacrilegious imagery etcthat is definitely there to shock the viewer into taking a harder look at this film i have to say it worked for me and im anxiously awaiting the hussaincerda collaboration that is rumored to come next check this one out if you have the stomach for it  9510
