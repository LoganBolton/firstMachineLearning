recently finally available in dvd 111108 severo pérez filmand the earth did not swallow him 1994 is based on one of the most highly regarded and discussed novels in chicano literature tomás riveras y no se lo tragó la tierra and the earth did not devour him 1972 is still generally acknowledged by many critics and serious readers as the classic chicano novel originally written in the spanish characteristic of south texas and also translated into english riveras novel continues as an indispensable presence within the chicano literary landscape br br perez film originally made as a highlyrated american playhouse pbs production has taken some time to be released in dvd one can only wonder about this matter because its high quality is not an issue the film and now dvd however remains so far as i know the only cinematic adaptation of any chicano novel and clearly is a tribute to earths incredible staying power this cinematic version also strikes an exceptionally deeprooted nerve that is i maintain both specifically ethnic yet also generally universal doubts about earth perhaps might have arisen because it is too ethnic too alien from a basic american mainstream too much a foreign art indie too limited in economic resources yet perez in his version of art in my opinion connects very effectively artistically and creates a sharplyetched portrayal of a chicano migrant collectivity that focuses on daily family life as far as a production done with relatively limited economic resources its lovely cinematographic work and haunting music go much beyond its available funding simply viewing the film makes manifest this films or dvd artistic valuebr br briefly and the earth did not swallow him portrays in a neonaturalistic way the plight the suffering and the despair of chicano migrant laborers as they follow the crops northward from south texas to minnesota in 1952 the local priests bless the beatup overstuffed vehicles of these chicano laborers who can no longer find work in the area and must follow the agricultural trail of the migrant worker northward this chicano collectivity like the depressionera joads in steinbecks the grapes of wrath forms an epic tide driven by economic need a survival instinct and anguished despair and ultimately a barely flickering faith a tribute to these people of the earth a collective hero the dvd is centered on a focal family and most especially emblematic is a young protagonist within the family a boy perhaps twelve or so this work then also functions as a bildungsroman ultimately the viewers sense of identification is generated through the experiences subjectivity and the struggles of the protagonist poverty alienation child labor illness sunstroke and a pregnancy death discrimination school absenteeism the boys escapism from the bullies of discrimination is spent lying down in a lovely peaceful cemetery are laid bare as matter of factyet also symbolically worse still the problematic conflict between the youngster and his mother goes beyond socioeconomics and political conflict into deeper realms of psychology and metaphysics in a desperate but artistically rendered struggle the youth battles his mother an archetypical mexicanamerican traditionalist a representative of gods will content with prayer resignation consolation and acceptance the rebellious youth cannot believe in a god that would permit such evil and suffering to be visited upon them how can god be so cruel he asks since his little sister is certainly purely innocent as to come down with serious illness in the fields at this point the boy must overcome obstacles even more daunting than poverty and discrimination the issues now include death doubt and despair and lack of meaning and he has few resources available to himstrength of character his own will power his intelligence and a powerful survival instinct in this desperate but artistically rendered struggle the unnamed youngster the central figure feels the necessity of his enduring of his achieving a heightened sense of meaning and the viewer hopes a renewed and strengthened life force that can serve as an inspiration to chicanos and othersbr br this stark battle makes use of a plot device just touched on by the original work to tie the episodic work together missing immigrant laborers from mexico who leave no trace upon their death although this dvd deals not with mexican but mexicanamerican migrant laborers a highly existential work anguish and despair a quest a focus on a project and redemptionall under the auspices of free will in spite of the deterministic socioeconomic and religious circumstancesbr br perez has a long list of credits basically as a documentary filmmaker his many awards are confirmatory the producer paul espinosa is also wellknown and has been likewise honored for his work the 1994 film in fact won and deserved a number of awards first place audience favorite at the santa barbara film festival in 1995 first place at the cairo film festival and a number of other welldeserved awardsbr br in my opinion this film and dvd earth by perez is the best chicano film that has been made
