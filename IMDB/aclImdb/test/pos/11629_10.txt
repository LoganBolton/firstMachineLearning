i can understand how barney can be annoying to some but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous barney was made simply right from the beginning and simplicity isnt bad especially for the young ones he entertains i personally find this show to be very underrated period barney  friends is a very educational show in my opinion and even 17 years after its debut and nearly 21 years after the characters debut on home video he proves time and time again that he still appeals to young children maybe less so than in the early 90s where barney was the hannah montana of the time but hes still a classic as a fan of barney myself i feel that i should defend him in a way that doesnt seem like spam the way the purple guy teaches things may be very simplistic and unrealistic but would you rather have them hearing about war be thankful some one a costumed dinosaur but still is there to comfort kids and let them be kids simply in this day and age i feel that we rush our kids to grow up and barney is there to say you can still be a child at heart in addition many of barneys lessons on current episodes about plagiarism being honest and yes even death could appeal to everyone not just his target audience besides our children need to learn to be kind and respect others for who they are and he helps them do that in short barney may be annoying to some people and i completely understand why but cut him some slack all he and his friends along with hit entertainment his production company are trying to do is help kids not only learn necessary skills but to have fun and to also look at the positive parts of life if more people listened to their childrens favorite character and viewed him through their eyes maybe we wouldnt be so negative about him and possibly life itself
