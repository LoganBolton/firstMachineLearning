i was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here sure its not the best kids show but dont people stop despising barney this much after the fifth gradebr br okay everyone hates barney okay i think his voice and songs are annoying okay hes kinda creepy and strange im fourteen years old so i know well enough but heres the thing kids they love this showbr br when i was a little kiddie of two or three my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes face it thats how toddlers are even the most patient ones cant sit still long enough to give their parents a break theres too much to do and see and explore too much trouble to get intobr br and then came barney i dont know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur thats so amusing to children but they sure do love it i know i did i was hooked on the show and wanted to watch it over and over yes the songs kind of drove my parents nuts but to be able to watch their kids learning and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span its worth it i learned my abcs and 123s the magic words and brushing your teeth id grown out of it by five or six of course but by that point at least i was a little more patient and gave my parents a breakbr br my nieces and nephew all went through the barney stage growing up much to their mothers delight i know what keeps barney on the air he entertains of course theres big bird ernie and oscar and theyre great too but at the toddler stage it seems that more kids prefer the big singing dinosaur and thats enough for me
