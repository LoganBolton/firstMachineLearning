minor spoilersbr br if theres something in the world of silent clowns that puzzles me it is that charley chase never got his well deserved break through in the movies oh well maybe it isnt that strange really inasmuch as he never starred in any fulllength features but when i think of it such an explanation makes it all only more mysterious  because why the heck didnt chase get any offers to play the leading lead in features one explanation is that his character no matter how amusing was simply too realistic to suit a longer story without the burlesque elements that chaplin keaton lloyd langdon and other comedians possessed it can be assumed that the comedy he made and which worked so well for twenty minutes would get repetitive after a few more reels i dont quite buy this though as chases gag construction is magnificent and could i believe at its best maintain the interest of viewers alone for a longer period at least i am tempted to think so when mighty like a moose runs the showbr br mr moose isnt extraordinary handsome and mrs moose is hardly a classic beauty he possesses the truly biggest front teeth of any human being on the planet and she has a remarkably large nose both of them takes plastic surgery without the others knowledge and when they meet by accident just a little later he doesnt recognize his wife and she doesnt recognize her husband a number of hilarious misunderstandings begin with many clever gags all the way through i dont think ill reveal anything further to make the viewing more enjoyable for you because if youre a fan of silent comedies or even if you arent mighty like a moose offers so many memorable moments within such a short time that i would look upon it as a downright shame not to see it silly indeed but no less extremely funny
