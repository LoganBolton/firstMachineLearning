when i reviewed the video for a local magazine i called it the greatest achievement in the history of the american cinema that was not wholly tongue in cheek twtl remains milius best work and its sad that he has so little opportunity to work anymore however twtl remains a striking exposition of what once was known as the american character largely on the strength of brian keiths superb portrayal of teddy r obviously miliusand keithadmired tr tremendously to make two films about him including the rough riders its hard to fault this film at any level a splendid balance of action levity relationships and the serious topic of america coming of age in the world furthermore twtl has exceptional appeal across the board note the stats showing it rates best with under18 males females 1829 and over 45 clearly candy bergen struck a responsive chord with women as well as men
