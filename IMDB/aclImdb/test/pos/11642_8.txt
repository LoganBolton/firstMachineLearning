i have just seen this broadcast on channel 4 having seen some of the earlier comments here i think i would like to state firstly that i am not in favour of the death penalty with that out of the way i was expecting great things of this film but it just didnt quite deliver dead man walking is very cleanly done with good performances all round and a good script in fact its hard to fault it artistically however i felt that although it attempted to confront the issues surrounding capital punishment it seemed to become sidetracked by the religiousmoral stance hardly surprising given that the main character is a nun although im not a heartless individual i didnt really empathise with any of the characters in the story if you dont take religion seriously then you probably wont see much in this film i think that peter medaks let him have it was a much more powerful and moving film and i would strongly recommend anyone considering watching this to go and see that
