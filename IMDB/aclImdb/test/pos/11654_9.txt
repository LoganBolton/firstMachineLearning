dead man walking is a film not about the death penalty but about the people involved in a death penalty case  the killer the families whose kids were killed the nun who becomes his spiritual advisor and what happens it tells the story with little fanfare but a lot of compassion and sensitivity i have it on dvd and every time i watch it not often its never an easy film to watch im more impressed by what tim robbins and the entire cast did here so revealing that it could be a documentary so compelling you cant take your eyes away so subtle and yet so powerful dead man walking is nothing short of a masterpiece it doesnt matter whether youre for or against the death penalty or even have no opinion this movie will have you thinking about the issues for sure it takes a courageous screenwriter and director to look this material in the face without flinching even once and everyone involved in the film pulls it off  there isnt a single scene that rings false a masterful film but dont expect light viewing to some the final scenes could be more graphic than anything imaginable even though no blood or violence is shown you get drawn into this film and become a participant and theres a character for just about everyone to identify with 1010
