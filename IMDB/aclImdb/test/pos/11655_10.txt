susan sarandon is for lack of a better word incredible in my opinion and yes i do understand that not everyone will agree with me here she is one of the greatest actresses ever and should have at least 2 oscars to her credit i mean that was an amazing performance in lorenzos oil but then i think every performance of hers is amazing and they gave it to emma thompsonwhat was that about and by the time she got this oscar shed been in the industry for some 25 years i couldnt think of anyone who deserved it more especially for a performance as brilliant as her portrayal of sister helen prejean but then again she is over and above all the artificiality of hollywood and doesnt need an oscar  people know shes good anywaybr br this film carries some very deep thoughtprovocing messages so needless to say it is not to be taken lightly tim robbins of course cant escape credit here you would think that because of his person feelings against the death penalty the portrayals made in this movie wouldnt be accurate however both sides of the deathpenalty debate are given even weight on one side you see the interesting side of matthew the human side which makes witnessing his death rather heartwrenching at the same time you see the way he savaged his victims and the constant torment of the understandably griefstricken parents one word for tim  bravobr br a brilliant movie and like i said a welldeserved and long awaited oscar for susan
