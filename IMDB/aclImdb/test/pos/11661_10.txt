i must have seen this movie about four or five times already and it gets better with each viewing suffice it to say this is the best film ive ever seen and i think ive seen a lotbr br but ive always wondered why this film got so shunned in some reviews or ratings for example take the imdb top 250 why does it rank only at 216 as of today surely the answers not in the film itself because that is nothing but flawless but in its reception the film caused controversy in its portrayal of compassion for a convicted murderer and its antideath penalty attitude and so obviously the more conservativeminded user probably didnt like the film as you can see from some of the other comments so dead man walking gets a ranking thats nothing but ridiculous in relation to its quality those people didnt understand what the film wanted to say and maybe they didnt want to understand being pro death penalty so now i get it its all political youre pro death penalty you dont like and therefore dont want to hear what the film has to saybr br im truly sorry there are still so many people out there who simply tune out when a new perspective questions their beliefsbr br mr robbins your movies issue split peoples opinions some reconsidered their pointofview some simply didnt listen but you made a very important point your movie will probably never show up on any top 100 movies of all timelist but itll be remembered long after films like braveheart or babe or apollo 13 all of which were unjustly preferred over your film at the oscars 1996 are forgotten congratulations mr robbins and thank you for this important piece of filmmaking
