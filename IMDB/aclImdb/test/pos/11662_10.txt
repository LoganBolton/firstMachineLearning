how do you know if a movie is good or not it is the impact it has on you that makes the difference dead man walking upset me a great deal i watched it twice i dont know if i will be strong enough to watch it again no i did not feel good at all after watching it but the film was as successful as it can bebr br robbins did a great job in incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic he avoided making an argument that could easily be seen as biased or subjective i hope that many people get to see dead man walking i believe that anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty so enthusiastically should see the moviebr br i dont know what else it could take to finally convince everyone that this relic from ancient times does not have a place in modern society anymorebr br the movie itself does not make an argument for or against death penalty it describes reality the reality is the best argument against the death penaltybr br a 1010 for great performances good filmmaking and for the most important film made in yearsbr br thank you tim robbinsbr br
