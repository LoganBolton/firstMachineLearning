tim robbins did a masterful job directing this film i say this because he avoided convention and clich√© he also oversaw superb performances from susan sarandon who won an oscar for her role and sean penn even more amazing robbins doesnt patronize he just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewers mind this is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinions on the death penalty one of the most controversial subjects of our time without being unfairly manipulated in either direction i cant recommend this film enough 910
