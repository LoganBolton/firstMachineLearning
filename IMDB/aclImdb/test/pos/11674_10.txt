spheeris debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time and as far as i know its also the only one that focuses on the la punk explosion of the early eighties its all there not just great great bands like black flag fear x the germs whose names may not mean much to you today but whose influence on todays alternative rock music can not be overestimated but also the promoters the media and first of all the audiences  the punks  all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy the anger and the fury these youths put into their music where is that today the eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music but the underground was rocking if you need a proof for that watch fears performance in decline unmatched great film how come this is not available on vid ld or dvd ps the followup decline pt ii is hilarious too
