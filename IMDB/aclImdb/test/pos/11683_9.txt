if i assume that you know what this film is about i am also forced to assume that youve come to this review knowing that you will probably watch it regardless of what i say if all this rings true  read on  you are likely to find some consonance with at least part of this review if youre undecided or not really entirely certain what happened in the late 70s and early 80s in the urban and suburban youth music culture you should probably read one of the reviews which pretends to be objective insteadbr br although i didnt grow up in california the american punk scene was the first music scene i ever truly lived in at the height of the hardcore i was immersed in from about 19791981 everybody had a band and the only common denominators between bands and indeed members of their audiences werebr br  the rejection of conformitybr br  tolerance and enjoyment of differencebr br  a desire to have fun  hard and fastbr br hairstyles politics dislike of authority figures and violent slamdancing were not integral to what i experienced though there were certainly cliques or factions who tended to be intolerant of those who did not dress speak or act punk enough and there was often a certain amount of unearned credit extended from some of these cliques to those who tried really hard to live down to the fascistic paradigm of anarchic self mutilating angry young cophaters br br although the interviews with audience punks in penelope spheeris excellent calpunk documentary decline of western civilization present a very narrow view of the subculture some of us enjoyed the interviews with the bands club owners promoters and even the security people are much more representative of at least my own perspective and memories of the scene nevertheless it is possible for those who approach this with prejudices about what punk is to experience this film without having their preconceptions challenged unfortunate as this is the blame for it rests solely with those who promote believe in or feel comfortable with stereotypes  not the filmmakers dont blame the messenger br br the music presented here is not going to be for everybody  nor even most its not the most crude stuff out there but its loud obnoxious fast and less concerned with technique than with raw energy br br for me seeing early black flag with ron reyes singing x fear and the circle jerks was worth far more than the cost of this hard to obtain film as much as i like the germs seeing darby crash for the mess  and the nice guy  that he was left me a bit cold nevertheless the scenes of darby playing with his pet tarantula while shut down droned on and on in the background were precious the x interview is also great br br spheeris straightforward documentary style is supplemented by wild pans and zooms during the musical segments during the interviews framing is used very nicely to provide context for whatever is being said considering her experience and the budget spheeris did as well as anybody could have with this filmbr br recommended for those who appreciate what this film is actually about and for those who have forgotten those few years of fun honest directionless rebellion before amaerican punk was coopted into yet another flow within the musical mainstream and the stereotypes became more important than the basic philosophy
