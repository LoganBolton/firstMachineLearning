kind of a guilty indulgence nowadays this used to be required watching when i was in high school it really is a great illumination of the burgeoning punk scene in la in 1980 as the bands play spheeris prints the lyrics in subtitles which is of course necessary if one really wants to know what the guy is screaming into the microphone but also it turns the cameras pov into that of tourist passing through this alien world the band interviews reveal an honest approach to the music that really doesnt exist anymore then again its not as easy to come by 16month formerchurch closets like chavez of black flag does how many unheard of bands do you know that arent trying like the dickens to get a record deal these guys just didnt care and who cant love the commentary of the little french dude who used to be the singer for catholic discipline of which phranc was a member his gritty voice delivers one of the best soliloquies ever captured on film i have excellent news for the world  theres no such thing as new wave whew what a relief
