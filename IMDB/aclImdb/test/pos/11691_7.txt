this film by the wellknown czech director and writer collaborator petr jarchovský is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its details taking its theme and title from a robert graves poem it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life whos trying to survive and protect her two children 15yearold lucina michaela mrvikova and little blond asthmatic kuba adam misikthe poem is much in evidence but the themeit gets a little lostbr br marcela anna geislerová the beauty and jarda roman luknár have lost everything in the prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left it seems but good sex which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that lucina and kuba in front of the telly must hold their ears against the noise hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock theres no good explanation precisely why but financial desperation has led jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet his carthief cohort drives off a posh volvo the easygoing benes josef abrham has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns benes is a supernice guy but no fool his volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to jardas garage and he and his cohort are off to jailbr br beauty in trouble flees to the good angelon whom she can rely begins the graves poem but actually this fracas leads benes to marcela when he meets her at the police station he introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about tuscany where he though pragueborn owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life hes here to reclaim the house in prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother whom he allows to remain benes every gesture is benevolent even though he doesnt prevent jarda from going off to jailbr br in the circumstances marcela must retreat with lucina and kuba to depend on the charity of her mother zdena jana brejchova and the far less tender mercies of zdenas present husband the scrawny diabetic richard hrstka jiri schmitzerwho for the kids starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies proves to be the uncle from hell jiri schmitzer hijacks the film at this point and never quite lets it go even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace it is surprising that the obnoxious richard doesnt sexually abuse one or both of the children he is insistent that marcela needs to get out on her own and when benes offers to take her under his wing he and richard become improbable allies improbableperhaps implausible why should benes like him but then what is beness whole story about some things the film gives too much information and about others not enough br br clearly the good angel benes is infallibly kindand a polished goodlooking older man whose manners befit his italian upbringing its only at the end when hes pushed to the limits over his prague property by the devious occupants he proves that he is not one to wont lie down and be walked over br br also to be dealt with is jardas religious fanatic mother sdena jana brejchova and her interactions with zdena and richard are something to watch but she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck br br the poem has been set to music in a czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionistvocalist raduza first in a tiny scene then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by jarda and the car thief pal if you revere hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous also included are a number of songs by glen hansardmarketa irglova of the oscarawardwinning irish musical film once including the latters theme song falling they feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from oncethough this film came firstbr br hrebejks people are arresting even little koba has his shakespeareanchild moments and a wealth of charm but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to overexpand the property hassle benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side but such an elaborate demonstration wasnt necessary the acting is fine and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity but the basic themes of love sex and money get lost in the shuffle and marcelas conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear its fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to gravess poem that marcela still has hot sex with jarda during a revisit to prague after moving to tuscany with benes and her kids but there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious richard or of jardas annoyingly pious mother emília vásáryová how come all of a sudden we learn koba is getting letters from india purported to be from his dad whos in prison when did that come about interesting details hastily pasted in this seems a world in which you cant see the forest for the trees
