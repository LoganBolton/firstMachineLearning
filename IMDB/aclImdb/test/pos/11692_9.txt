beauty in trouble kráska v nesnázích is not a great title all the descriptions of this film fail to capture what it really is  an adult fairy tale a poor girl is wooed by a prince the girl marcela played by the stunning anna geislerová has an isabelle huppert beauty with a red hair face and figure that are beguiling sexual and endlessly fascinating she has a louse of a husband but they have great sex the kids listen to the lovemaking through walls its rough and passionate as the sex of the working class seems to often be portrayed in film but its also for us to recognize that this is the thing that binds them together in an otherwise incompatible marriage the husband a professional car thief is eventually caught and thrown in jail how she got into this marriage we dont know but she is not exactly a highclass herself but shes beautiful intelligent we assume and loves her gorgeous and resilient kids she deserves more and she may get the life she deserves  eventually no spoiler she is forced to move back with mom after her husband is sent to jail mom has a hideous second husband read ugly stepfather he is a real horror show he borders on being a child abuser to the kids hes obsessive about cleanliness but ungraciously farts at the table all the while demanding manners and decorum from the kids hes real low class socially handicapped wretch mom puts up with him like marcellas husband at least hes lusty  hideous but horny the ambivalent confusing layered characterizations are what make the film so powerful and interesting these characters have flaws some seemed driven by class some by innate character these flaws and details of character are charming one minute and contemptible the next the audience really has to negotiate conflicting feeling of class sexuality ambition commitment and the role of a woman as mother and wife through the quickly changing terrain of the story at the bottom line as with many films like the wonderful icelandic movie thicker than water blóðbönd the children can be the victims whats right in the end may be whats best for the children  who are our salvation and our future its a theme played out these days in films ranging from pans labyrinth to children of men foreign cinema is recognizing in intricate morality tales that life is confusing brutal unfair and as adults we must get our act together in order to pass something worthwhile to the next generation if we give in to our baser instincts we may lose ourselves and the world in the process the extraordinary and complex and colorful characters in kráska v nesnázích speak to the qualities of what makes a man what drives a women what embodies hope what is class  is it economic status of the fabric of ones character the film is richly human as embodied by the very last 2 shots which moved me incredibly and unexpectedly the directors choices are so subtle and intelligent that to compare this to an american film seems unfair americans sometimes seem to lack the desire to consider that paradoxes in human nature dont offer set resolutions but here perilously couched in ostensible fairy tale for adults are interesting moral questions dont be fooled by the simple story this is a great movie
