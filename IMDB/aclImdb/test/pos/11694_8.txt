i recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival the films title and in fact much of the outline of the film is from the robert graves poem beauty in trouble jan hrebejk directs a screenplay by petr jrchovský from a story by hrebejk and jrchovský the story begins in 2002 when prague is hit by one of those devastating 100 year floods that destroys the household of marcela ana ceislerová and jarda roman luknár and their two children kuba adam misik and lucina michaela mrvikova because of the moldy conditions where they now live kubas asthma is life threatening marcela works and jarda runs a chop shop out of the garage they live next to jardas shady occupation runs him afoul of the law and one of his theft victims becomes infatuated with marcela evzen benes josef abrhám is a wealthy businessman who divides his time between italy and the czech republic and offers to care marcela and her two kids jana brejchová is marcellas mother who lives with her commonlaw husband called uncle richie played by jirí schmitzer in probably the films best role rounding out this excellent cast is emília vasaryova as jardas mentally fragile mother who gives any money she gets to the local religious charlatan there is a lot going on here for a small film and its good story with a great script and a lot of comic relief ales brezina provides the music score with additional music from czech singer raduza and irish singer glen hansard there is a lot to like about this film and i would give it an 80 out of 10 and recommend it
