i was reticent to see this flick before reading the external reviews and user comments posted here why firstly because mick malloys humour can in my humble opinion be pretty crass and over the top evidenced by his ill fated shemozzle of a television show some years back and secondly because good aussie comedy films are sadly as rare as the tassie tiger br br sensibly mick has restrained his natural comedic exuberance in this surprisingly watchable movie who would have thought that a bowls club would provide the setting for one of the funniest australian films in years the cast is excellent with familiar local old timers all putting in believable performances br br interesting to see john clarke playing the villain in this piece its a one dimensional part but jc still adds a touch of class as always good to see judith lucy also getting a guernsey or should i saw bowls uniform on the big screen shes a real talent pity a number of her retorts were expletives her own material is a lot wittier interesting character though bowls reporter on a local rag how low on the journalist food chain can one getbr br crackerjack may not be the funniest film ive seen this year but its certainly an enjoyable diversion well worth a look lots of other people obviously agree with me as its headed to be the biggest grossing australian film this year good to see someone finally make a quirky gentle comedy without trying to sledgehammer the laughs like so many australian comedies before it br br finally a bit of trivia if youre wondering which aussie rules team mick supports check out the flag on his workstation also look out for his old partner in crime tony martin doing the announcing in the final bowls scene br br  br br
