worth it for if not for mick molloys work then for judith lucy she brings her usual classy style of unbridled foulmouthery to the role and steals the show in partsbr br imho im not much of an autograph hunter but i have collected 3 the first is samuel l jacksons the other 2 are in this movie tony martin and mick molloy altho martin only makes a cameo appearance molloy not only stars but cowrote and coproduced this flick ive been a fan of their for years now apparently i was the only one laughing during the onset urination in the first episode of the short lived the mick molloy show so i went in to this with high expectations im happy to say i wasnt disappointed with mick doing a lot of the work on this thing theres plenty of his usual trademarks phrases like blow it out your arse and these bowls are shouse are all over the place aswell as plenty of winnie blues being sucked down its also the sort of stupid original story youd expect from someone like him this is like one of those cliqued american sporting comedies where they make a baseball team out of prisoners or something but rather than trying to make a dull american sport like baseball or gridiron interesting this movie focuses on a sport usually left to grey army lawn bowls but the main difference between this and other sporting type comedies is that this is actually very very funny whats even better is that even tho the subject of this movie is a young lout joining an old folks game its never insulting to the elderly and it never gets sickeningly soppy or anything its just good laughs at genuine 1972 prices mick is great in the first real acting role ive ever seen him in as is judith lucy and the rest of the cast but then most of them have had a lot of practice this is the best australian comedy ive seen in a long time go see it and learn the joys of lawn bowlsbr br its a bit like major leaguebr br score 8  10
