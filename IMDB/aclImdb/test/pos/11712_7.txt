burt reynolds directed this action movie and surprise he is actually a pretty good director this movie starts off well as burts attempted bust of a drug dealer is botched and he is demoted down to the vice squad the ensemble cast has some pretty funny scenes as brian kieth is always eating something bernie casey has more class than all of his coworkers combined and charles durning loses control of his squadbr br the vice cops stumble on a highpriced callgirl ring that may have something to do with a series of murders sharkey spends days staking out dominoes rachel ward apartment and starts to really adore her from afarbr br just when they are getting close to the crime leader dominoe is murdered i wont give away any of the surprises in the plot but the first hour of this film is greatbr br unfortunately the screenplay gets very clich√©d and unbelievable after thatbr br why would burt reynolds confront the crime boss with his big secret sure it makes the guy sweat but it causes many more cops to be killed and it is not believable that dominoe and sharkey would make love after they have know each other for one day much less while their lives are in danger and at the end what happened to all the police that run into the building with our heroes isnt there a swat team also the film never actually tells you how all of the bad guys are connected and why they have to kill so many peoplebr br there is a very effective torture scene on a boat near the end of the film which is probably the only really nailbiting scene of the film it is a shame that the climax is a typical shootemup still this film is certainly entertaining if you like crime and action movies dont think about the plot holes and you will have a good time
