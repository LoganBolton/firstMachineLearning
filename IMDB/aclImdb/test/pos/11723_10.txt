while he was great in boogie nights i think that this was burt reynolds best performance hes also a great director and has made a tough violent movie that doesnt hold back a hookers death by 12 gauge and is an excellent detective story with some great actors brian keith bernie casey etc and an outstanding jazz soundtrack 10 out of 10
