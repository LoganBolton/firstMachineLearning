im a fan of b grade 80s films in which the hero is a bit of a bad guy a strong male who finds love  and this film deliversbr br towards the finish you do not know how sharky will not be killed and doesnt he take a beating realistically portrayed i believe however he does and its not via some overdone die hard stunt the past it team he works with comes together hence the title his team are all characters  people on the sideline at work because they dont quite conform these portrayals are funny and sympathetic  they have a real feeling to them theyre up against an iceman of an assassin with a good team of his own the result is a great film noir
