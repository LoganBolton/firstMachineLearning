this was one of those films i would always come across be it on tv or cheap dvd but never struck me to give it a shot as i thought i wasnt missing out on much it was on one night and i thought oh wellÂ… why not a good decision too as i would kick myself for taking so long to get around to it for me it left me impressed as its up there with burt reynolds best features deliverance white lightning and boogie nights and streams back to those 70s80s gritty hardboiled urban crime thrillers that werent afraid to be forebodingly obscure and go out of their way to setup characters packit with realistically brutal force and effectively incorporate the local locations atlanta being the case here to the fold with grounded photography in certain shades it kind of reminded me of dirty harry but thats loosely however its saucily honed blues score with its simmering kicks funky shifts and unhinged sounds very much had me thinking of lalo schifrins pulsating score he orchestrated for dirty harry the music soundtrack on the other hand is hit or missbr br sgt tom sharky was an atlantic narcotic agent before a slipout during a bust saw him demoted to vice work along with his new squad they come across a prostitution ring which catches their interest due to fact its owned by one hardtotrack and to convict crime lord what they dig up involves a prominent government figure and a callgirl which can give them some important names but they must get to her before shes made a targetbr br burt reynolds acts but also directs in an unyieldingly firm and muscular fashion which would suit his laconically hardnosed performance and gerald di pegos thematically hardbitten and taut screenplay that was adapted from william diehls novel well he does show some sort of heartinsightful thoughts amongst that armor within the scenes involving the fetchingly able british actress rachel ward be it the stakeout scenes when hes watching her from another building and slowly becoming infatuated by her to when they finally come together but these latter interactions midway through do slow up the momentum but give it noir like strokes the performances are fairly spot on with reynolds formulating a great rapport with exceptional actors charles durning earl holliman brian keith richard libertini and bernie casey the scathing profanity and witty dialogues between these guys were a blast as for the corrupt villains vittorio gassman builds imposing strength and power but its henry silva who seems born for these roles icily cunning and unstoppable turn that makes the show where his appearance seems to outline things to come and help them fall into place plus his adrenalinefilled and violent cat and mouse climax with sharky and his team is brilliantly donebr br the exciting action passages might be quick and dry but remain lethally violent like an immensely teethgrinding interrogation sequence some handy old fashion filming techniques add to the suspense the intriguing material keeps it quite tactical being character derived but when we think its smooth sailing it offers up a blunt surprise or two along with some intensely brunt confrontations
