i always loved that scratchy voiced guy in all those westerns he was the sidekick jingles in the wild bill hickock show back in the fifties in this he has the perfect vehicle for his wonderful bragging character he is harmless and no one believes him but he is nonflustered and goes on anyway when you have a guy like this theres no challenging because the details arent there to quibble with of course in this episode he is taken on board a space ship by a group of aliens who have no sense of humor and believe everything they hear they dont have the word lie in their vocabularies as it turns out he is so insufferable that they cant handle him and then of course there is the secret weapon see this just to watch andy
