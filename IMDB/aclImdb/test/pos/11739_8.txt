on a second viewing this is still a wonderful romance that is in my opinion much better than the film it came paired with on my 2dvd set the leo mccarey weepie classic an affair to remember yet it seems to have fallen out of favour slightly only a 66 rating here on imdb and dismissed by many critics as gooey slush how sad because this is an intelligent romantic drama with very good work by the two leads jennifer jones and william holden if anything the film should be wellremembered for the gorgeous colour cinematography and the unforgettable musical score i dont much like valentines day but it gave me an excuse to watch this movie again and im glad of it while i still think holdens character death is too heavily foreshadowed taking suspense out of the final scenes this film is very moving and i really enjoy it
