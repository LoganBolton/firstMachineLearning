i have just sat through this film again and can only wonder if we will see the likes of films like this anymore the timeless music the tender voices of william holden and jennifer jones leave this grown man weeping through joyous romantic scenes and im not one who cries very often in life where have our william holdens gone and will they make these moving wonderful movies any more its sad to have to realize that they probably wont but dont think about it just try to block that out of your mind even so they wont have holden in it and he wont appear on that hill just once more either you can only enjoy this film and watch it again
