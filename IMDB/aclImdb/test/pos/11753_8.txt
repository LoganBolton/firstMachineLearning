holden and jones sizzle in this movie but not in the way we think of sizzling today  its very subtle and under the surface  yet palpable jennifer jones in particular is so sexually hot in this film much more than a caricature like monroe ever was because she creates a real woman  with all facets of womanhood shes intelligent intuitive graceful shes desiring and desirable br br theres a scene on that famous hill where shes lying down in the grass looking up at holden and the expression in her eyes is xrated yet in the context of the scene and character in makes complete sense you dont need to have it all said in the dialogue  spelledout like the crude obviousness in most modern films its all there in her eyes  sexy yet elegant what a stunning underrated actress she was i saw her madame bovary for the first time recently and was equally blown away ill take her over bergman davis or the two hepburns any day
