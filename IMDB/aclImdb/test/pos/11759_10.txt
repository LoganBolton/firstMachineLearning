homegrown is one of those movies which sort of fell through the cracks but deserves better when i first saw it i had a lukewarm reaction but over time its really grown on meno pun intended  the more i see it the more i appreciate it the writing is topnotch as is the acting throw in a few surprising cameos and good direction and you end up with a great little filmbr br its also good to finally see hank azaria get a chance to shine in a starring role and thornton delivers his usual quality performance even relative newcomer ryan phillippe delivers playing a friendly innocent with wit and subtletybr br on a side note homegrown is simply a must see if youre a billy bob thornton fan it appears stephen gyllenhaal was influenced by earlier thornton projects like one false move and sling blade though homegrown is certainly a lot more tongueincheek than either and thorntons role as a character who is both sophisticated and downtoearth is a perfect match for the actor
