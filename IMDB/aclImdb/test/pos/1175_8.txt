82008 when i originally wrote my comments shortly after first seeing this film i took a critical view feeling that lemmon and matthau had basically phonedin their performances which paired them in a manner theyd done several times previouslybr br but upon seeing it again it seemed different especially in view that neither of the two main megastars lived a great deal longer after its releasebr br with the exception of spiner all of the eight principals are performers with considerable experience and likewise unavoidably a lot longer in tooth than weve seen in many of their other film and tv work but isnt almost everyonebr br seeing it again while it certainly wont be regarded as a classis in any of their careers it is a fun film with a lot of interesting scenery as wellbr br from my viewpoint it reminds me that many films plays etc can often be looked at either from a very critical viewpoint or looking instead to the lighter side without expecting a film to be another citizen kane casablance or in terms of the two leads another original odd couple it also will provide a continuing piece of nostalgia for lemmon and matthau as well as the others in the cast
