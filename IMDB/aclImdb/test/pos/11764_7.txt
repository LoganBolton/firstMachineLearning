after seeing the trailer it was an easy decision not to see this film i mean i dont care for stupid stoner comedies im sure it was also an easy choice for a lot of people to get together smoke a bowl and go check out this flick with the guy from the simpsons and some guy named billy bob should have been a good time but the films just not that funnytoo bad somebody had to go and bum their highbr br unfortunately i found out that the trailer was misleading after it had already left the theaters so i had to wait for the video i really enjoyed it nice locations quality production and excellent performances from the entire cast looking back at it the plot twists werent totally unexpected but i didnt find it cumbersome because the premise was so engagingbr br so why was this absorbing drama marketed as a comedy did something happen to the producer leaving the associate producers to do the marketing by themselves
