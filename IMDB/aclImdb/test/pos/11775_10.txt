talk about your classics ernie fossilus the foss from here on out came up with a cute and creative trailer totally spoofing star wars this gem is so jammed packed with tributes and gags i laugh every time not only that when star wars did a reissue with new special effects hardware wars did the same talk about a spoof that just wont die theres a reason george lucas calls this his favorite parody he was so impressed he even hired the foss to work on return of the jedi dont believe me check his entry in imdbbr br this has to be the first and in my opinion the best parody ever done i think the special edition was a bit overdone but on reflection i think its perfect for the modern day rerelease of star wars and goes to prove that sometimes its wrong to mess with perfectionbr br yes its only 10 minutes but its well worth your timebr br youll laugh youll cry youll kiss 3 goodbye well maybe 15 for the dvd but youll be real happy you did
