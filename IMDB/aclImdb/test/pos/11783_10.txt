i havent seen hardware wars in years but i remember it as one of the most hilarious events of human experience and it was over far too soon every aspect of this movie was hilarious and it was even better than star wars i laughed i cried after watching it i asked a family member for a moment with three dollars just so i could kiss it goodbye im kidding about the last one i love it when ham salads sidekickcopilot tries to eat princess anne droids cinnamon hair buns and the darph nader character is just hilarious this film would be great to watch backtoback with thumb wars and i sincerely wish there could have been a hardware wars episode ii the umpire strikes out was there
