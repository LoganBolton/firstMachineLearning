i really liked this movie if other people want to give it an average around 5010 thats their choice i would give it 1010 sutherlands performance as a private eye is totally awesome the story is amazing human exciting intelligent the dialogue is good the story might not be perfect but anyway  the mood of the movie is good enough to compensate for that moreover the ending is incredibly cool and their the jigsaw puzzle really comes back to together so anyway i liked it i also thought the female lead actress performed very well im not a big fan of detective movies but this one was really good also because it doesnt give a damn about conventions of the supernatural
