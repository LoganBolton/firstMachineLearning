people watch movies for a variety of different reasons this movie didnt have the big budget theres no special effects no car chases and theres no explosions actually reality doesnt have much of these either at least not in my life br br this is a very real movie about very real people none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos i am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology since im neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brainbr br so watch this movie for the characters it is brimfull of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk br br within the first three minutes kiefer sutherland enacts detective michael haydens life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie excellent acting very believable br br henry czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his harvey and kiefers mickey enhances the oppositeness of their charactersbr br i thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady mrs ramsay im sure she and my motherinlaw are good friendsbr br theres a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them
