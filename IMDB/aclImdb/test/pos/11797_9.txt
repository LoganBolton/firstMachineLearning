on more than one level i can relate to what happens in this movie in a very personal way and all i can say about it is that its true what dexters mom tells eric at the end of the story he actually did cure her son by taking away his sad feelings and his lonelinessbr br this movie emphasis a philosophy i can very well agree with we are all going to die one day sooner or later in the end it is not the amount of time we live but the fungood timeshappiness we have during that time it is not the quantity but the quality that countsbr br i guess all other words used here would only keep you any longer from getting to see this movie if you havent already i really would like to see it released on dvd definitely it would be added to my all time classics right away
