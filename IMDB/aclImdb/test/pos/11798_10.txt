i had never heard about this movie when it was given to me to translate so i didnt know what to expect i checked it out on imdb and got curious it didnt take long to realize that this was a gem outstanding performances great story and its both well directed and well written its hard to compare it to other movies but stand by me comes to mind although it has as many differences from the cure as similarities the tale of an extraordinary friendship between young boys plus the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this movie and stand by me other than that the cure is a fine movie in its own right well worth a wider recognition its dramatic but also adventurous sad but also humorous i cant think of a single thing that bothers me about it having said that i dont want to give the impression that it is a perfect movie whatever that means but rather that i enjoyed it immensely was very moved by it and wouldnt change a thing in it i wont go into a detailed description of the storyplot partly because it would be either too general or too revealing and partly because you can find that information elsewhere on the site in closing i can only say wonderful movie see it if you get the chance
