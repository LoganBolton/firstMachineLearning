so glad i have hbo right now i didnt plan on watching a movie today but when i got home and saw that the next movie on hbo was this one i decided based on the description to at least give it a shot im so glad i decided to watch this movie maybe this movie just caught me at a vulnerable moment im a little stressed out got a huge test to be studying for but it definitely gave me quite the perspective on friendship not to mention taught me a valuable lesson on empathy im currently one year away from graduating from pharmacy school and the whole scene involving the doctor and the nurse was definitely a learning point for mebr br anyhow i just wanted to post up letting the world know this is an amazing movie and not to be missed there is definitely something for everyone in this movie
