the cure is one of the few movies i rated 10 out of 10 i mean everything is flawless for me in this motion picture i saw it almost a year ago and yet i remember many of the scenes especially the final touching scene that comes with the creditsbr br the two boy actors clearly gave everything they could and this greatly contributes the excellent storyline making the film perfectbr br the message is clear  friendship and its displayed throughout the whole thingbr br i have nothing more to say here simplicity is one of the things i love so much about this film and of course its fun and moving at the same time suiting people of any agebr br 1010 nicely done
