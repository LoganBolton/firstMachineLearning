a tale of a young boy dexter joseph mazzello with aids who befriends a rough and tumble boy played by brad renfro his exact opposite the cure is sad if a bit too soapy pull at your emotions message movie with its heart in the right place for that fact alone its a recommended view the highlight might be just watching them finding friendship and hanging out with each other when no one else accepts them br br however since the real story centers on the boys aids  things take off when one day at the local supermarket dexters eye catches a checkout tabloid magazine that states a new orleans doctor has discovered the cure both of them obviously a tad naive make it a plan to set out for new orleans in whichever means possible which kinda pulled me two ways its a mite heart warming and i hate to nitpick but i found the plot wanders in a melodramatic predictable sense and the proceedings have a coat of gloss over them like only movies can do i couldnt escape the tugging notion i was watching a road trip movie about self discovery sickness and growing up for instance i know theyre young but i found it a real task to belief in the things these boys do like boiling tree leaves and drinking the hot tea or eating an experimental diet of chocolate bars because they believe it will combat the ravaging disease to say nothing of them making a crosscountry voyage as they do with no legal or downright scary repercussions still misgivings aside those movie conventions you come to expect its a story worth seeing particularly with family
