while this movie is not the most entertaining in the world i think it is better than most over all i mean it had its little laughs and just all around a good feeling its not too often we get to see two old geezers just having fun with their age and honestly having a good time with the jokes walter and jack had such a great chemistry together as friendsbrother inlaws just watching them romancing these women was fun and you rooted for them all the way because wither we have to admit it or not for their age they still had game d i loved just the whole plot of being able to move on and having fun no matter how old you are id recommend this movie for a nice laugh if you want onebr br 710
