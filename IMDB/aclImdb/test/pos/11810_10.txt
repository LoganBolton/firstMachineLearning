for all the viewers who have seen the cure would agree with me on this comment that it is a superb movie and is very heartwarming joseph mazzello and brad renfro prove their star quality in this movie along with dexters mazzello mother annabella sciorrabr br when i first watched the cure on tv i didnt know what to expect but as i watched this masterpiece it soon became clear what it was about dexter an 11 year old boy who is plagued with aids sits around his backyard playing with his toys when one day he meets his next door neighbour eric which at first is a little awkward for the 2 boys but they soon became good friendsbr br during the film i kept wondering what would happen to the two boys as they kept me wondering i wondered how the heck they would get to new orleans sitting a door with a sea biscuit under it pulling an inflatable crocodile behind it there were other great scenes throughout the moviebr br but the part that reached out to me was the part when dexters health started to deteriorate you just couldnt help but wonder if he was going to make it but towards the end you find out i thought at the first prank they played that dexter was really dead he obviously wasnt silly me but when they play the third something is very wrong dexter doesnt get up to laugh nor does he show any kind of laughter at that point the victim of their prank soon announces that poor dexter had died at that part i lost it i balled my eyes out and from that scene onwards i was crying you just have to as the end nears you start to understand erics loss and then the movie ends on a nice note with dexters shoe floating ever so slowly down the riverbr br overall this movie was excellent it has laughter adventure emotion and sadness etc when you put that in a blender you get an excellent must watch film peter horton has done a great job directing this film and i believe its certainly one of his best but for now i will try to search for this movie on dvd if it exists that is once again a superb movie that will take you on an emotional rollercaoster
