the cure is a fantastic film about a boy with aids ive cried about 4 times watching this film and its just so sad i cant promise everyone will cry watching this but it will make you want to very emotional and very sad the cure is a mustsee movie it shows you the meaning of friendship and love and is an extremely great moviebr br at first i didnt think it would be as great and wondered why my mum always cried watching it but now i know its a stunning film that is so original and is so close to real life situations unlike most of the other films that doesnt make sense words cannot describe the greatness of the cure you just have to see it
