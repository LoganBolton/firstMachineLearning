even though this film is 11 years old i just rented it yesterday and i found it to be a really touching film the story of true friendship in the face of a very real monster is an inspiration and quite touchingbr br while i did not care much for the amount of language used by some of the young actorsespecially from renfroi understand that art is imitating life renfro once again does a magnificent job of the roughandtough very and i mean very disturbed wannabe bully his role in the client comes to mind and mazzello does a wonderful job of the witty somewhat quirky dextera child who realizes that his life must end too soonbr br while there are so many touching and funny moments in the movie i have to say that my favorite was when the boys were cornered by pony in the abandoned church and dexter mazzello cut himself saying his blood was poison while very resourceful and somewhat amusing seeing a grown man running away from two little kids its one of the hardest scenes in the filmbr br definitely check this one out but prepared with your kleenexyoull need it
