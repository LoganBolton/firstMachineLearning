the subject of children being terminally ill is difficult and saddening but the cure successfully portrays the idea that it doesnt have to be all doom and gloom and if anything children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are to find peace before the end it is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhoodbr br the film sees erik a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother moving into a new area where their nextdoor neighbour is elevenyearold dexter who contracted aids through a blood transfusion after his initial fears and ignorance over aids are allayed erik befriends dexter and their almost fraternal friendship sees them embark on a journey down the mississippi to where they have heard about a new orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the diseasebr br the talent from the two young leads of brad renfro and joseph mazzello who play erik and dexter respectively is exceptional brad was able to portray eriks harder edge without comprising the subtle childish innocence inherent to the character while joseph depicts the sense of vulnerability to dexters character but injects the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and zeal to highlight that his illness doesnt mean he still isnt a child who wants to run and play like any other elevenyearold boy the pairs interactions create a feel in the audience that these are two boys who are genuinely close and they carry the film well annabella sciorra also delivers a touching performance as dexters mother linda who adores her son and delights in seeing him thrive with this new friendship to erik and eventually becomes a surrogate motherfigure to the other boybr br set against an excellent soundtrack the cure is a very bittersweet film that manages to flawlessly weave the story of boyhood friendship that survives unflinchingly in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to sappiness or unnecessary saccharine sweet scenes a very interesting reflection in the film is that is it the adults who have the problem with dexters aids status whereas the children even the bullies come to accept him as they would any other what is also very touching is how despite eriks streetwise nature he is the more naive one in his determination to cure dexter while the younger boy has this haunting sense that he knows his fate but is swept away by his best friends enthusiasm for a curebr br i highly recommend the cure for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting
