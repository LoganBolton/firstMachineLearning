way back in 1996 one of the airliner pilots where i used to work gave me a copy of this film he told me that itll make me cry i never believed him and we even made bets after seeing the filmi cried a bucket even after the seeing the film i found myself in the bathroom crying it was actually the most touching film i have ever seen i like the part where dexters mom confronted erics mother the line went something like your sons best friend just died todayand its not gonna be easyif you ever lay your hands on him againi will kill you the last part where dexter took erics shoe was a scene that never left my mind until today honestly just thinking about it makes my eyes teary a story of what true friendship is all about my girlfriend loved it too she hated me for letting her see the film i cried a bucket she cried a river
