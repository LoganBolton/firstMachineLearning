i had seen the cure when i was a kid and i loved it then now years later i got a hold of a copy almost by accident and watched it again being a kid you dont really have the ability to procure things for yourself that you want that is usually a prerogative of your parents  but when i watched it again now i felt sorry that i did not do more to get a copy of this movie back then and consequently almost forgot about it until todaybr br this really is a beautiful movie it tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a hardedged misfit kid  who takes his cues from his horrible abusive mother  and his neighbor a slightly younger boy who has aidsbr br right you say another one of those a tear jerker a bucket movie a morality tail yeah i know i hate those too only this one isnt it is one of the very few movies among those many i have seen that pulls off a very rare trick it conveys a truly sad story and yes a morality tale but without a single moment where it feels cheesy forced or in any other way hollywoody it shows a real relationship between two real boys who interact as real kids do and through that interaction the goodnatured loving character of the older boy eric starts to shine through his toughguy persona as he takes on a kind of bigbrotherly care for dexter his hivpositive younger neighbor together they embark on an adventure to find a cure  which to erik seems to be just around the corner  so that all this silly aids thing will go away and they can be friends foreverbr br the production is top notch but of course what really carries this movie is the performances of the two leads  brad renfro and joseph mazzello especially mazzello who is simply stunning  he does convey a sense of frailty needed for an ailing boy but at the same time he manages to make dexter a truly energetic and determined character he shines at the scene where the boys confront pony his impulse to protect his older friend lunges him forth drives him to say what he says  and only afterwards the horror is depicted on his face as he realizes that what he himself said is true his blood is poison renfro also has his moments in particular the scenes with his mother he depicts perfectly how this macho streetwise kid is left completely frozen and numb when faced with his abusive storming mother and cant get a word in to contradict her as she forbids his relationship with the ailing boy out of her fear and ignorance annabella sciorra also gives a memorable performance as dexters mother who ultimately becomes in a sense a mother figure to erik as wellbr br ive first seen this film when i was at school back in america and loved it  not at all a given concerning movies of this sort but the behavior of the kids in this movie was so real i could easily relate to them ironically enough the teacher who had shown us this movie a wonderful woman im still in touch with her got in trouble for it as some uptight parent complained about it having the scene when the two boys are looking at a playboy pathetic seriously will americans ever get over this ridiculous phobia i do not know there was a hardlydistinguishable shot of a playboy cover in the movie and thus it is not shown in schools how sad kids need to see this movie it is more inspiring and educational than all the official afterschool specials put togetherbr br oh and one more thing i know im rambling but nevertheless the score its great i am a musician and as such i know dave grusin from his records he is a well known jazz pianist and record producer up until this movie i really did not know that he did movie scores as well even though when i later checked i found out that i had unknowingly watched several movies he worked on really a wonderful job therebr br all in all a solid ten id recommend this movie to anyone and im definitely going to see it with my younger siblings  they can use watching a film like this among all the standard specialeffect hysteria they usually see
