a competent comedy that delivers the laughs for fans of jack lemmon and walter matthau i suppose this film was made for those who enjoyed the two grumpy old men films as there seemed to be a bunch of these buddy teamups spotlighting the comical duo in their twilight years the idea is a surefire one matthau a bumbling gambler whos thousands of dollars in debt connives his unsuspecting friend lemmon into taking a free cruise with him where they can meet rich old ladies the catch is theyve been signed on as dance hosts and matthau cant dancebr br out to sea is a funny film and not all of the chuckles are to be found courtesy of lemmon and matthau i found brent spiner best known as data from star trek the next generation to be very humorous as the snobby ballbusting dance coordinator as the prissy boss of the two aging actors he manages to match them in the laughs department though the film doesnt really need any theres also a a love story or two to be found here as well involving dyan cannon who looks pretty fine for her years
