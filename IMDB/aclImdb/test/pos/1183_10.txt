for people like me who were born long after the 60s ended we can only learn about the era through cultural artifacts of which hair is one this is certainly a well done tour de force one can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture probably the most impressive scene  for me at least  is when the group crashes the rich peoples party as for the movies final scene one might interpret it as the symbolic end of everything that the 60s representedbr br but no matter how one interprets this movie its important to understand that even though the 60s themselves may have ended the movements that typified them still exist in small enclaves its a time that people wont soon forgetbr br anyway this movie is one that i definitely recommend milos forman scored another great one here right between his two masterpieces one flew over the cuckoos nest and ragtime so why did he later make a piece of crap like man on the moon starring john savage treat williams and beverly dangelo
