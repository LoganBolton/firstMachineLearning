i hope robert redford continues to make more films like this hillermans books are wonderful and as a young child raised in the southwest his stories hit home adam beach is a highly under rated and under used actor wake up hollywood not everyone thinks that your mel gibsons are cool many movie goers today want to see films that make you think i have seen all of the redfordhillerman series they are thoughtful scenic and have great plots im hoping that if enough people write to robert redford he may decide to make a few more thank you adam beach and tony hillerman for great entertainment if anyone gets a chance to read tony hillermans latest book do so its great i also recommend traveling through arizona new mexico utah and colorado stop at every view site and feel the setting of hillermans books amazing experience
