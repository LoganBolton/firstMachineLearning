i caught this movie the other night on one of the movie channels and i havent laughed that hard in a long time this movie was so funny i went out and bought the very next day i love this type of comedy it just seemed so real in the way the actors react to the different situations here i was rollin i had never even heard of it and just started watching because of the title seeing other people the title caused me to give it a shot and im glad i did i laughed so hard that it hurt now its part of my collection i definitely recommend it to all those that enjoy smartass type of comedy i will be watching this one over and over
