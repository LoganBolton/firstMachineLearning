i loved this movie its a lot of laughs the acting is good and the writing is really sharp id rather see a hundred movies like this than three lord of the rings repeating and repeating themselvesbr br its a low budget affair and seems to be shot on dv but looks good and jay mohr and julianne nicholson are great together why do you have a ten line minimum im not a critic just a patronbr br i doubt very much that quentin tarantino could write a picture this funny without filling it with masturbatory gratuitous violence this movie should be seen on more screens than just one i laughed from beginning to end
