i was hugely impressed with this movie if for nothing else than for the comedy it might not be the edgiest wittiest humor at all times but i found it appropriate to every scenebr br the flow of the film is certainly a bit jumbled almost confusing sometimes but that is how the characters feel sometimes were watching a bit of slapstick and other scenes revolve around a decisive discourse on relationships this might be a bit frustrating to certain viewers but it brought me closer to the characters dilemmas of irregular chaosbr br the acting is great from everyone im a huge andy richter fan but i wasnt head over heels for his part like everyone else seems to be he did very well but julianne nicholson and lauren graham stole the show for me both in their respective ways jay mohr performs as expected if youve seen him in other films ive always liked himbr br overall the movie is very funny and offers some nice foundations for a few types of relationships when it comes to relationship questions and problems some films try to surprise theres nothing surprising about the conclusions offered here but its entertaining to watch them be revealed throughout the film
