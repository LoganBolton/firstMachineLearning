well the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected its not boring and its not unoriginal its really not a silly romantic comedy the situations the characters put themselves in are very unusual of course were still talking about a movie but the main characters are indeed plausible donald is of course an exaggeration but hes just a pawn in the movie a means to prove something the ending isnt one of those ridiculously happy always the same moral containing pieces of crap you can usually see in movies of the genre i genuinely liked it and im hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies its worth a watch besides its better directed than other movies the story line always stands up the characters themselves stand up and they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them like a holly god given artifact yada yada at the end of it all you actually see yourself going through it all the movie makes you feel something you may even learn a thing or two its not the usual hopeproducing tissue moistening idiocy its a good movie not a consolation prize for teary women around the world
