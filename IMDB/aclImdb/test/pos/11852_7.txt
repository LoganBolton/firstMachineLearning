warning contains spoilersbr br written by husband and wife wally wolodarsky who also directed and maya forbes this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memorybr br jay mohr takes a break from playing smarmy weasels to be the nice guy faced with the fact his fiancée wants to bed other people and hes allowed to do so too julianne nicholson who was so good in tully plays spunky and vulnerable with great gusto too bad she doesnt get the recognition she deserves br br good supporting performances help immensely too lauren graham who made last years bad santa memorable plays the jaded cynical sister to perfection bryan cranston the dad on tvs malcolm in the middle gets a few funny raunchy moments and andy richter plays a genial guy who falls for a single mother  helen slater in a credible albeit familiar role as a mousy womanbr br what surprised me most about seeing other people was how funny it is there are some genuine laughs here eds first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great lines and theres a ménage a trois that elicits one of the most truthful reactions from a man as the male fantasy gets tweakedbr br the films premise isnt unusual but i liked that it was alice nicholson who thought of it much to the chagrin of ed mohr given the genre you know that no matter how good her intentions are alices plan is doomed we see how the couple works through this strange situation initially alice and ed are turned on by the idea but then the human element sets itbr br i appreciated forbes and wolodarsky not turning this into a cheap sex romp yes theres sex and nudity but there also are real emotions at work here the other people alice and ed befriend dont want to be the objects of casual sex they have feelings too in one case too many feelingsbr br granted some scenes run one joke too many the richterslater subplot isnt necessary and alice does something truly uncharacteristic but thats forgivable because mohr and nicholson generate such tremendous intimacy and honesty  check out the scenes where ed rummages through alices underwear drawer or his reaction to her announcement about ending the experiment  that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game we root for this couple to succeedbr br unfortunately this film got little if any publicity and a limited release hollywood studios whose romantic comedies often veer on the unfunny turgid and unsurprising would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film
