i rented this movie without having heard or read anything about it what a shame this movie is intelligent witty hilarious fastpaced and realistically ridiculous the characters manage to get developed without relying too heavily on clich√©d tired stereotypes it was refreshing to watch i couldnt help thinking that marketing would have helped lob this notsomainstream movie into the starvedforintelligentcomedy mainstream the quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors execute a huge range of awkwardness heartbreak and comedy is so rare these daysi felt that the actors must have really enjoyed participating in something this rich how is it that national treasure was number one at the box office for three weeks in a rowit is so weak in too many ways to mention i guess im just happy that movies like seeing are still being made somewhere out there
