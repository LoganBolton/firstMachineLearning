okay heres the thing ive read through the comments of other viewers  some trashing the film and some saying its the funniest darkest blackest comedy ever made whiffs of tarantino etc well not exactly but guess what its still an enjoyable and ultimately funny film not brilliant not trash liv tyler gives a great performance and you absolutely cannot take your eyes off her shes a woman with very strong decorating ideasmatt dillon a greatly underrated and underused actor is wonderful as ever he always manages to stride that delicate line between scruff and soul and he pulls off the comedy beautifully ditto john goodman though the religious overtones probably funny in the script really dont work paul reiser is very good  definitely better than he was on tvbr br the usually unbearable michael douglas is actually great in this role as for his coif well see the film between this and wonder boys youre actually reminded of the fact that douglas can act the movie will make you laugh in parts okay not exactly bellylaughing but definitely in the imamusedimveryamused category if youre renting this expecting to see another pulp fiction forget it but if want something kinda hip and kinda fun this is a damned good choice
