liv tayler in her sexiest movie br br she incorporates the femme fatale role in an astonishing way while in the same time she manages to appear a super sexy woman while keeping the sweet girl stand and not being overwicked like other similar movies eg femme fatale with rebecca romijnbr br until this movie lord of the rings was the only movie i ever saw her im hooked on with lotrbr br point by lotr i had shaped an opinion that the role of the puresweet woman was the only role that liv tayler could interpret but when i saw one night at mc cool i absolutely changed my mind she is the sexiest woman everbr br therefore as a film is a mediocre common comedy with a confusing plot
