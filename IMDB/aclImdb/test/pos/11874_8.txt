one night at mccools is a very funny movie that is more intelligent than what it should be its form is more sophisticated than what i expected and its randomness was superb the thoughts behind the movie mysogeny sadism stupid men are are infantile thats what i have to say about this movie is that not only does it hate women but it loathes men it doesnt have any sympathy for any of the men really it seems that way because of the form but the ending says it all nobody caresbr br the form has the first 23 of the movie told in flashback by three characters dillon the stupid bartender reiser the mysogenistic stupid lawyer and goodman the stupid holierthanthou cop the story is therefore always perverted by their own self images and altered realities reisers bbq fantasy is a great touch in the end we never really know the truth and nothing is what it seems dillon was never that innocent etc br br actually the rest of the movie is funny too from the randomness of the last 5 seconds of the movie to the overlyobviousness of tylers manipulations the movie seems to have an energy all its own everything is just out of the blue and nothing seems to make sense do we really care if it does no br br it is also a very dark comedy but has a shallow presentation think nurse betty or jawbreaker very candy coated outside dark chewy inside if you like your movies random dark or just purely mean see this movie this one will satisfy your urges for the strangeness that is one night at mccoolsbr br 810
