some martialarts purists think that comedy was the worst thing that could have happened to the oldschool kungfu flick and it is true that the introduction of comedy into the genre signaled the end of the chopsocky period in hong kong film but the fact is one can only carryon a primarily physical exhibition of prowess for just so long then everyone gets bored with it and thats really why the chopsocky died and how the hong kong new wave action film was born the producers the actors the directors all just got bored with hitting people for ninetyminutes straightbr br given that and given the fact that liu chia liang is a professional director with a considerable list of films in his resume this film has to be seen as something other than just another kungfu comedy rather it is a comic film within the martialarts genre and in fact one of the best ever madebr br what liu has done with this film is really a pleasant surprise he has taken a martialarts plot and reconstructed it along the lines of a hollywoodstyle musical complete with episodes of singing and dancing it was around the time of the making of this film that some filmmakers and film fans began to recognize that the cinematic performance of martialarts really derived from the acrobatics of the chinese opera has more in common with dance than with fighting i will continue to point out this connection until most americans realize what they are actually supposed to look for when watching a martial arts film  wellchoreographed body movements using the plot of an action film as an excuse for their performance at any rate quite clearly liu chia liang made this connection and decided he would explore it close to its limitsbr br the result is an incredibly charming entertainment filled with marvelously human characters attempting miraculous kungfu and tripping over their own shoelaces as often as not when they do so and the film being set at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries allows liu the opportunity to explore the nature of the westernization and modernization of china that contributed so greatly to the making of the china we know today so the film has considerable historical import as wellbr br also fans of stephen chows recent kung fu hustle should really watch this movie carefully as chow clearly learned from it before the making of his own filmbr br a very amusing wellmade film oh yes and the kung fu in it is really really goodbr br purists wont admit it but this is probably director lius best film
