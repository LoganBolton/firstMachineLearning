thank god for this movie its a document of talent that three decades later seems even more unique and rare in retrospectbr br the music is just extraordinary packed with so much talent in writing performance arrangement and production that its absolutely infectious the lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible the performances by underappreciated talents like nell carter and ren woods uplift my spirit every time i hear them while the film may be different from the stage version i prefer the soundtrack to the cast album which i find truly grating and underdeveloped here the arrangements are filled out and expanded into dynamic pieces that couldnt have been produced in a stage settingbr br but the music isnt the only thing extraordinary about this movie the juxtaposition of almost hyperrealist dialog scenes reminds me of altman films intercut with exuberant musical and dance numbers really works all the talent in this moviedirecting writing photography editing music choreography casting acting costuming art directionmerge perfectly into one of the best musical films ive seenbr br i think its amazing how much we know about the characters in hair based on very little information or plot theyre not drawn as caricatures but as realistic and very human people we see little glimpses of where they come from but the portrait is completed by vignettes that draw the characters to the surface through accomplished acting directing and editing theres an undercurrent theme of the misogyny of berger and hud which colors their characters by exposing their reckless machohippie ideology the scene of bergers home life reveals important details about his psychology and the brief glimpse of claudes home tells us volumes about his background through the simple realistic and genuine interaction between claude and presumably his fatherbr br i love the fashion in this movie it defiantly mixes sixties ideas with very seventies looks one does have to overlook treat williams hair extensions its a document of how chic much of the lateseventies was contrary to the conventional wisdom that the era was all about bad taste claudes beige knitted tie was a hot trend of 1979 and the hair and clothing of the singers and dancers particularly those in white during the central park scene mixes up the decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of the musicals themes these elements merge with twyla tharpes extraordinary stateoftheart choreography in a way that enhances the artistry of bothbr br hairisnt a film that rewards cynicism if you come to it with expectations then youre most likely going to be held captive by artists who arent bound by your rules for me it opened my eyes and ears and spirit to an insightful and passionate musical dialog about war friendship and family that transcends its time and is still meaningful and relevant to me to this day
