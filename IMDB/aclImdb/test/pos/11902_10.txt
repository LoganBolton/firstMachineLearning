i was lucky enough to see a test screening of el padrino a couple months ago in santa monica i was blown away you dont see films like this anymore in the vein of scosese chapa deftly tells the tragic story of kilo as he maneuvers the tough streets of la to rise above the ranks to become a drug lord of escobarian proportions the characters are complex and conflicted the emotions are real the action is fast and furious the stunts are expansive and tilly is hot she hasnt looked this good since her bound days id recommend this to anyone its a fantastic homage to the epic action films of the late 80s and early 90s and to all the naysayers out thereÂ… watch it again you obviously had your eyes closed the first time congrats to all involved in the film im counting the days until the sequel is released anyone have a date on that
