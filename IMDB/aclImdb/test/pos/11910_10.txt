i dont understand how people could not like this movie you have gossit jr the kid who played the main character in stand by me sean astin and many other great actors lots of action and fun that you dont see in todays movies anymore its really a shame br br this is an underrated movie that is among other great movies like lets get harry the 80s and early 90s created such great movies that will never again be topped by todays standards br br they tried to somehow recreate this movie in masterminds but came up short with some really bad acting the only thing that movie had going was patrick stewart but obviously that wasnt enough
