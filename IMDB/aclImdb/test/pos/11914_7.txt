toy soldiers is an okay action movie but what really stands out is the amount of effort that the scriptwriters and director put into portraying american counterterrorist forces accurately just check out the end creditsthere are more than a dozen us military officers and officials listed the movie accurately portrays the fbi as having control of the hostage situation but turning it over the us armys delta force who are unnamed in the movie as the pentagon was still denying their existence at this time once the president waived the posse commitatus act of us code the us army forces at the end are accurately dressed and armed for the time and even the use of an ah64 apache for air supportwhich might seem a bit over the top is not terribly unrealistic far more expensive and frankly better movies have portrayed american counterterrorist forces with far less accuracy
