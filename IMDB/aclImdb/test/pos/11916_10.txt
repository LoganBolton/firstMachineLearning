this film is a perfect example of great escapism i loved this film and was sucked in from the very beginning sure its just an action flick but isnt having fun what watching movies is all about br br the cast of this film are very strong with likable characters the friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing its heart warming and hilarious to see a group of teenage boys interact  especially this group of boys sean astin makes a great rebel successfully avoiding being a precocious teenagerbr br if you want fun watch this film i thoroughly enjoyed it even though i was watching it on a very dirty and old vhs that was terrible quality go dvds
