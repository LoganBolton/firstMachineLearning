ive avoided seeing this film for some time but finally picked up a copy having been born too late to see hair in its contemporary setting i have just been familiar with the uk and broadway cast recordings for many years and saw it on stage in the late 1980s where it looked a little creaky but still great funbr br the film it drops some of the songs the bed my conviction frank mills and cuts others walking in space however what is left is presented very well indeed all the singers and dancers are excellent and the key performers especially treat williams as berger beverley dangelo as sheila john savage as claude are memorablebr br as a hippy celebration and anthem hair manages to be remain potent even in a film made ten years too late it was no longer the era of peace love and biba but the time of punk rock  although watching this film now in the time of iraqi problems gives a new resonance to the vietnam issues of the 1960sbr br milos forman who also made amadeus did a good job on directing in its scope and feel it reminds me of norman jewisons jesus christ superstar especially with the joy of the aquarius scene and the intimacy of easy to be hardbr br i really enjoyed this film and consider it a good representation of a musical born out of the first truly hedonistic era
