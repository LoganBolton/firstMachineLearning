im seldom partial to movies about smartassed teenagers who have problems with authority but toy soldiers has grown on me with repeated viewings this is as much a movie about billy tepper growing up and becoming an adult as anything else and i give credit to sean astin and writerdirector daniel petrie jr that they dont make a big deal of that but let it just unfold and sneak up on you the camaraderie of teppers friends their grief over joeys death and their joy at their survival all are genuinely moving and i have to admit i take a certain patriotic and perhaps slightly reptilian glee when the us army guys finally move in and righteously kick some narcoterrorist butt oohrah general kramer and the heroic robert folk score is the cherry on top im sure i could find a hundred reasons not to like toy soldiers but as long as we dont take it too seriously i dont see the need this is one of the most entertaining bad movies in my pantheon
