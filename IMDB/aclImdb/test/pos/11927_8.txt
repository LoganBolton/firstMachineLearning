this came as a huge surprise for me i had never heard of this movie when i first saw it and the title really pointed towards something else than a great terroristhostage situation at a high school toy soldiers has the best from its time period of the early 90s where action movies were lighthearted and very enjoyable the action is good the plot is interesting and way over the top the bad guy is a onedimensional hateful douchebag which is great louis gossett jr is in it its simply a feelgood movie which i thoroughly enjoyedbr br you cant go wrong with this one if you like action i give it a solid rating of 810
