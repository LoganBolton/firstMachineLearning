i havent seen this in years but when i was about 6 i first saw this on vhs and i must have watched it at least 10 times now like i said its been awhile so i might screw up the plot but i remember some columbian terrorists taking a prep school hostage with demands for the head terroristthe wishmasterfather to be released from prison now i could just check the plot here on imdb but im pretty sure thats right any way a group of boys at the school decide that theyre not gonna just sit around and wait to die so they decide to fight back this film has always been stuck in my mind there are so many images that i havent forgotten like joeysi thinkdeath scene or billy spitting in the terrorists sandwiches or the one kidsno idea of his namefake asthma attack just a great film it may be films like this that have given me my tolerance for film violence because if i remember right this movie is pretty graphic guys getting mowed down by helicopter machine guns a special forces guys hand getting blown off by a grenadenot sure about that but i seem to remember something like that towards the endand the most bloody being the lead terrorist getting capped in the head in gory detail great action great humor good acting wonderful film experience ive got to watch this again after all these years
