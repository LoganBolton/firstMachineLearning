this is one of the best bloke movies from the early 90s and whilst slightly dated its one of those movies that would never get made today which makes it very special in fact a very similar movie was made in the 90s called masterminds and it was a pg variation on the same theme but it was nowhere near as fun or realistic for that matterbr br so whats so special about this film its the comradre between the main characters and the against all odds theme of the film sean astin is very likable and has starred in some of the most memorable films of the 8090s particularly the goonies he also went onto greater things with rudy and the lord of the rings trilogy but encino man is a good trip down memory lane will wheaton from stand by me lends nice support to the film and andrew divoff is a terrific villain louis gossett jr sleepwalks in his role but he does add some brevity to the film particularly his relationship with astins rebellious naturebr br so hows the action by todays standards its rather tedious and cheap looking almost like a tv movie but the production values are good and the violence is actually quite nasty for a film involving school students however the director makes up for the limited budget with some nicely suspenseful moments and well placed humorbr br so park your brain at the door and enjoy this fondly remembered action flick but dont expect oscar material
