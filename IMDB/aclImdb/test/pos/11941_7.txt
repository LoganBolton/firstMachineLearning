peter coyote was the only name that i recognised from the cast list so i wasnt too keen on watching this film the only comment on imdb was positive so i watched it on late night tv i would recommend this movie as a good late night viewing its better than a lot of this genre the plot is excellent the acting isnt brilliant but its not bad i dont usually like flashbacks but in this film they work as ive stated i didnt recognise any of the cast by name but i recognised michele lee who gave a decent hard working performance as the woman wanting to stand by her man who is lying to her was it knots landing anyhow shes wearing really well note you may enjoy it more if you miss the first few seconds of the credits i did and it helped me when you see the end credits youll get what i mean the wayne kennedy character who is really weird takes this to a 7 rather than a 6
