i gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10 it had an excellent plot and peter coyote and michele lee as well as the rest of the cast did their parts wellbr br both peter and michele were too long in the tooth for the ages their characters were supposed to be and their children in the film obviously would have been better suited being their grandchildrenbr br i missed the first ten minutes of this film so i dont know just how that body turned up after 25 years and got traced back to denny traynor peter coyotes character but i had no difficulty picking up on the storylinebr br barbara traynor michele lee is stunned when her longtime husband denny is arrested for a murder in oregon some 25 years previous a state denny claims he was never inbr br however as evidence piles up against denny his story changes then his story changes again and yet again until barbara doesnt know what to believebr br barbara makes up her mind however to get to the bottom of the mystery whirling around the fateful time denny and a young girl named sherry accepted a ride from a stranger named wayne kennedy that ended in murderbr br i found the film entertaining well paced and it kept me guessing as to what had really happened between those three peoplebr br from what i saw during the closing credits this seemed to be based on a true story
