this is a nice little lifetime movie about a guy peter coyote whos living the perfect suburban middle class life when late one night the police suddenly bust into his home and arrest him for the murder of some guy 27 years agobr br in his prison cell coyote recounts to his wife the fateful events of 27 years ago and how he came into contact with wayne kennedy the man who he supposedly killedbr br from here the story is told in flashback fashion and the more you learn about wayne and coyote and how they came to meet and what happened when they did the more interested you getbr br the acting isnt anything to crow about although the guy who plays wayne kennedy is pretty creepy enough the real strong point of the movie is that mystery of what actually happened on the mountain the wife spends the movie running around digging up clues to the mystery and each time something new comes up we are treated with another flashback revealing more of the mystery its actually pretty wellbr br so as far as lifetime tv movies go this little flick comes highly recommendedbr br enjoy
