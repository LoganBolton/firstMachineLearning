one crazy summer is the funniest craziest not necessarily the best movie i have ever seenbr br just when one crazy scene is done another emerges it never lets you rest just one thing after another the soundtrack is great the songs are the right ones for the scenesbr br it is also a clean movie little that is dirty in itbr br of course it has the story of the guys you wouldnt trust with your lunch money taking up a challenge and winning over people with more resources whod want to see it if they failed there is a serious side in that parents and children do not live up to each others dreams one should always have an open mind and weigh all the options this applies both to parents and children in one crazy summer the parents are wrong this is not always the case
