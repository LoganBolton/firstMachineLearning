absolutely amazing humor upbeat music and an antiwar message make this probably the best movie i have ever seenbr br first of all i love how clever this movie is particularly in the vietnam part of the plot its interesting how they make the army officials enforcing the draft look ridiculous follow that with the serious situation of the actual war and then the conclusion which leaves me seething with anger at the war and yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen wowbr br also the music is really cool but what is very unique in this musical as opposed to evita or wizard of oz for example is that the lyrics dont tell the story the mood does along with the visuals and betweensongsdialog donna is an upbeat song which emphasizes the happy mood whereas flesh failures has a driving intense beat in a minor keybr br also i notice the lsd scene is not very flattering now im definitely not going to do drugs not that i ever intended tobr br all things considered this is an amazing movie the only negative comment i could say is that its sometimes hard to hear the dialog but who cares 1010 stars
