i seem to notice that a lot of people have never seen this movie and those that have usually dismiss it as garbage thats pretty bad reallybr br the first time i saw this movie i admittedly was almost one of those people thank god im patient otherwise i would have never found such a classicbr br as goofy as this movie is its also a must have for anyone who is either a fan of 80s movies or just happens to have a sense of humorbr br i know that there are a lot of people out there that will tell you that this movie is sort of derivative of better off dead so what if it is they were both excellent moviesbr br i can honestly say that savage steve holland is a genius 1010
