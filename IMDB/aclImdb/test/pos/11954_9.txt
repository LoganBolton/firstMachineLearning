80s comedies especially ones with john cusak are awesome almost all are hillarious and instant classics and this film is no exception plenty of nods to other films ie godzilla and jaws through out the movie that are so hillarious youll be laughing for hours some may complain that the movie is a little corny at times but hey it was the 80s and things were always a little cheesy throw in a young demi moore and an even louder bob cat and you have a laughfest on your fans if you havent seen this you better soon
