in the eighties savage steve holland put out three movies two of which are classics of what seems to be a very small genre absurdist teen comedies the third how i got into college does not measure up to better off dead and this one mainly because of its lack of john cusack and curtis armstrong except for a tiny cameobr br one crazy summer is an underrated movie with lots of great characterizations and gags as i recall savage steves movies were vilified as being brain dead at the time and after three movies he drifted into childrens tv we could use more movies from the likes of him
