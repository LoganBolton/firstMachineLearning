when one thinks of soviet cinema the propaganda masterpieces of eisenstein or the somber meditations of tarkovsky generally come to mind theyre great films sure but generally not the most entertaining material out there however the countries within the iron curtain apparently enjoyed their escapist musicals just as much as the states had in fact from the 1930s up until the 70s forty of these songanddance extravaganzas were released to much adoration by the public however they are completely unheard of in the west so this documentary attempts to rectify that situation it does a terrific job of both showcasing these films and putting them into the proper cultural context despite the fact ive never been a fan of musicals i found this documentary to be completely compelling from beginning to end it goes to prove that no matter how many films you manage to see in your lifetime youre only skimming the surface of whats out therebr br as for the film clips themselves theyre very entertaining while some of the musicals are blatant propaganda showing workers singing of how much they love working under the regime some of the films particularly the later ones look quite accomplished from a production standpoint plus they are all extremely campy because of how alien they are to my western eyes theres a few similarities between them and the american musicals im used to but the presence of strict government enforcing of a message gives them a surreal edge they certainly dont resemble the musicals made in the west this documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining films ive seen in recent memory and its an absolute mustsee for any film buff 910
