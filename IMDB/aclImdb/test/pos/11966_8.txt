i wonder if i could take sitting through a whole musical comedy from russia or east germany or other countries that for decades put out almost always propagandistic film antifascist films antiwar films as this documentary points out that just reflected the dark grueling times under stalin and life behind the iron curtain its fascinating then to see the other side of the coin the sorts of clowns and rebels with music at their side to try and please the masses more often than not stuck in the socialist walk of life one film actually seemed rather impressive called jolly fellows by the pioneer of the very small group of musical filmmakers grigori aleksandrov from the clips i saw of that film id wager that it was one of the only works to actually step out of itself and go into just wild manic makeyoulaugh kind of mode but as this film shows if you were a filmmaker looking to entertain it better be with a messagebr br through interviews some occasional quasidramatizations of russiagermanyetcs sort of motion picture association at the censorship table and clips one gets the full picture of what it was like both behind the scenes and on the screen to just make sheer entertainment for the masses some of the films well most of them as apparently only 14 screened over 40 years in the countries mentioned made a good chunk of change but for what purpose really one also gets drawn into the culture of it all how it differs greatly from the american way of if it works make em while theyre hot attitude but at the same time perhaps out of this repression some interesting funny and from what i saw upbeat films were made they mightve been fairly typical of what was asked to be shown to the masses under stalins fond but demanding terms like life with tractors it gets to be even juicier a story though as we get shown what it was like in the 60s the last wave of musical comedies as rock and roll and pop tunes finally hit their airwavesbr br in short some good stuffbut only if interested really i was shown the film in a class on documentary films and half the class fell asleep so be warned on the one hand though on the other if looking for it it can make for a really rewarding trip into european film history
