when i went to see this documentary on communist bloc musicals i was expecting something totally demented along the lines of a communist cop rock some scenes did deliver including a rousing clip from a soviet film called tractor driversbr br youd think that moviemakers given the task of making ideologically correct musicals that sing dance and espouse the party line face insurmountable odds and yet one of the surprises of east side story is that some of the films presented actually looked promising one was a mid1950s east german effort called my wife wants to sing in which as the title implies an unhappy hausfrau seeks to launch a singing career over the objections of her traditionallyminded husbandbr br another genuinely interestinglooking movie also from east germany was called midnight revue in this filmwithinafilm the producers spoof their own creative plight with the story of a group of filmmakers under party orders to make a musical the onscreen filmmakers themselves get to do a musical number about avoiding too hot subjects very reminiscent in tone of the 1957 movie silk stockingsbr br the documentary is marred by somewhat insipid narration but its still a lot of fun to watch look for the closing dedication to the person who made it all possible
