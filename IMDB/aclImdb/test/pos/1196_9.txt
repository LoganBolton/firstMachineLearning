i watched it because my friend said we could try it when my father asked if wed watch it i didnt want to because it was such an old film how could that be good  i finally did watch with that friend and my father my friend and i loved the film the songs are great the actors were cool and we were crazy about it i guess this shows even though its from dads time that doesnt mean it cant be a good film i bought the film not so long after seeing it on tv i put it on a lot and sang along with the songs i even watched it with my classmates on my birthday party its a nice good and sometimes funny filmbr br if you dont try you cant say its bad even if you think no im not going to watch a film from dads time try the first part of the film you can always stop watching if you dont like it i really recommend it its great
