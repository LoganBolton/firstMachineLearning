bears about as much resemblance to dean koontzs novel as jessica simpson does to a rocket scientist if youve read the book i suggest you put it as far out of your mind as possible before watching the moviebr br watchers is your typical boy meets dog dog turns out to be superintelligent government lab experiment dog and boy are pursued by superintelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by same lab and oh yeah did i mention the shady government agents pursuing the monster pursuing the dog moviebr br corey haim is the boy barbara williams is his mother michael ironside is one of the evil government guys and sandy the dog is well the dog named furface here einstein in the bookbr br the monster effects are ridiculously cheesy much of the dialogue is laughable the script rarely makes sense or is believable  a good example is haims characters unquestioning acceptance of the dogs intelligence as if every fido off the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no hmm its gotta be the puppy chow right haims performance is enthusiastic but shaky as he carries off the stupid dialogue with the least amount of skill ironside has been the highlight of many a bad movie and this is no exception he easily gives the best performance of the movie although im compelled to add that the dog whos a pretty darn good actor himself comes in a close secondbr br all in all an atrociously dumb movie and yet    and yet i watched it three times within a week and yet i cant help liking it hey what can i say i have a taste for junk  and michael ironside not that ive ever actually tasted michael ironside im sure there are laws against that but any movie that can make me laugh that hard yes even unintentionally cant be all bad chalk it up to a guilty pleasure a yes i know its insultingly stupid but i like it anyway moviebr br its tough for me to rate this on a normal scale im forced to give it a d but on my own personal cheese scale it gets bumped up to an abr br yeah i know im weird like that
