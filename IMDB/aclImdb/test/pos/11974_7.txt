i would consider myself a fan of dean koontz having read a number of his novels and liked them all but unfortunately i never got around to reading watchers so im left with no choice but to rate this film on its own merits rather than comparing it to the book that i havent read i went into this expecting something awful and while i didnt exactly get a brilliant horror film i am lead to believe that its fans of the book that are rating it down because as a film in its own right watchers is an entertaining and somewhat original little horror movie the plot obviously takes some influence from predator and begins with an explosion at a research lab its not long before a rancher is killed by some strange beast and the boyfriend of the dead mans daughter has picked up an ultraintelligent runaway dog a secret government agency is soon on the case as the murders continue the boy continues to be fascinated by the dogs intelligence but it somehow ties in with the murders and the agency is soon on his tail toobr br the script for this film was originally written by paul haggis who later disowned it i dont know why Â– the writing here is nowhere near as ridiculous as his 2004 hit crash anyway the main reason this film works is undoubtedly the dog who aside from being rather cute is also the best actor in the film corey haim hot off the success of the lost boys is the human lead and actually has a rather good chemistry with the dog although it is a little bit ridiculous seeing him talk to it most of the way through the film the plot is rather convoluted and as such the film is more than a little bit messy but the ridiculousness of it all pulls it through during the more awkward moments michael ironside also appears in the film and does well as the bad cop side of the government agents the monster is of course one of the most interesting things about the film and the way it goes around killing people is always entertaining and gory although unfortunately we dont get to see a lot of it and when we finally do its rather disappointing  obviously the filmmakers had seen bigfoot and the hendersons still this is the sort of film that can be easily enjoyed despite the numerous problems and id recommend to any undiscerning viewer of eighties horror
