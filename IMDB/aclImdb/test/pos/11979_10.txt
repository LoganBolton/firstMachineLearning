this movie deserves the 10 im giving itbr br but its not the 10 that youd give to movies like the godfather or goodfellas or psycho this is the kind of 10 you give to a movie which just makes you laughover and over again its the most horribly written and directed movie yet it doesnt fail to entertain it has the most amateur effects yet you enjoy every moment i saw this movie today on tv and i didnt want to move away read the following dialogue to know whybr br whole college is standing around manishawho has just undergone a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgivenessbr br bad guy 1 please forgive us br br bad guy 2 yeswe wont do it again br br no response from manisha br br akshay come onforgive them br br manisha i dont know br br akshay you are a beautiful woman and even dead men can get aroused by you and these are living young males dont blame thembr br pancholi yeah manisha br br manishato suniel what if they tried to rape your girlfriend br br suniel id break their handslegs and kill thembut anywaysjust forgive thembr br akshay yeah if you dont forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beautybr br now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue this movie never fails to entertain mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations the bad guy munish can do basically anythinghe can blow a sandstorm from his mouth or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again br br every actor takes turns to speakone line from akshaythen from suniel then from arshad then aftab then nigam its the main rule followed by the director so that equal screen time is given to each guy and then theres the all powerful pendant which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed all these things make it an enjoyable movie and i can watch it over and over again i think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is onebr br the only problem is that it wasnt trying to be funny
