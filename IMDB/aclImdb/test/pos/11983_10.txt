i went to see this film because joaquim de almeida was in it joaquim had a fairly small part so it was good that i liked the film on its own in fact i liked it a lotbr br the film centers around two characters albert and louie albert is a shy retiring sort and louie well louie is not the story revolves around louies request to albert to let him come over to alberts place for just a little while louie has just gotten out of prisonbr br albert and louie have known each other since childhood and of course whenver they do something together there is trouble and its albert who always takes the fallbr br the action of the film is based on the adventures that ensue from louies visit on the run is a chronicle of madcap zany situations however bruno de almeida and scriptwriter joseph minion after hours dont always take you where you expect to go there are twists and turns that add depth to this film of course there is plenty of outright comedy but there is much subtle humor here as wellbr br there are some downright good performances here as well albert is played delightfully by michael imperioli hes getting fairly wellknownthese days from the hbo series the sopranosbr br louie is played by john ventimiglia who imbues his character with a lovable childlike quality no matter what he does you just gotta love louiebr br both these actors are excellent in their individual characters with imperioli youll want to hug him and bring him home to mom ventimiglia well you wont know whether you should slap him or bring him home and not to mompbr br there are other standout performances as well the character of rita is played by drena deniro yes roberts daughter the audience adored her in talking with the others who saw the film it was fun to discuss whether it was albert or louie who was their favorite of those two but everyone loved ritabr br is this film perfect no i cant say that it is there were many times i wished the director had had a bigger budget to work with there were some scenes that cried out for more budgetary freedom give this guy a decent budget to work with and i believe you are going to see a film that will make you stand up and noticebr br the ending sequence was a bit of a victim of budget yet budget or no budget the ending screen shot in my opinion brought together the talent of actor and director into a memorable emotionally effective scenebr br
