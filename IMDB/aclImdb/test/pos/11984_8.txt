this bw film reached the spartan movie house of my frisian village about 18 months after its release in those days much of our fulllength comedy fare hailed from denmark nils poppe anyone so this movie struck like a thunderbolt  it had me weeping with helpless mirth rotfl as wed now put it ok so some of the sight gags were in fact recycled vaudeville schtick but how was this barefoot boy with cheeks of brass to know that at the time in any case my favorite scenes had jerrys unique brand of frantic clowning like that hawaii boxing matchbr br seeing sailor beware again fifty years later i still guffawed loudly at the goingson granted without the nostalgia component it would probably be just another fairtomiddling comedy but then another movie that once had me in stitches even more helplessly the spike jones outing fireman save my child now seems dated and stilted apart from some tooshort orchestra bits and doodles weaver scenes must be some special ingredient that makes martin  lewis product stay fresher longer to me this one at least rates eight out of ten
