i liked this moviebr br no one i know likes it but i dobr br i didnt like it as much as the first one but it was still good the script and plot may not have changed at all but the story was better than caddyshack 1br br the only reason i didnt like caddyshack 2 isbr br no rodney dangerfieldbr br i think the movie would be better if rodney dangerfield had jackie masons part although i did like jackie mason in the movie it would be alot better if they kept rodney dangerfieldbr br another flaw in the movie that i didnt hate as much was dan akroyd the movie was done 8 years after the first one bill murray carl couldve quit his job as an assistant greenskeeper and joined the military you know if warner bros had thought of that it couldve made the movie better alsobr br this was my comment for caddyshack iibr br i give it 82 out of 10br br it couldve been better but good nonethelessbr br if youve seen caddyshack 1 and are debating on whether or not to see caddyshack 2 i say give it a try
