like richard pryor mason never got the material he deserved whatever you know of him is probably wrong get past the accent and go see his standup youll be very surprised  hes one of the best standups ive ever seen and i have seen a lot of standup comedy from lenny bruce to eddie murphy to jerry seinfeld to chris rock  jackie mason is definitely up there hes known for being a comics comic even howard stern said he is one of the top 3 funniest comedians everbr br the accussation that mason is no dangerfield is ridiculous dangerfield is known for having been a huge mason fan dangerfields career was going nowhere for a long time until he started following masons shows that is when mason provided dangerfield with inspiration for his get no respect routine while i think dangerfield is great see them both do standup and youll see mason is the better comedian
