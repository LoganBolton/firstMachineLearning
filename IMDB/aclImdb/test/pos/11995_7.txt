seriously if this had been the first shack movie it would have been passable as funny silly and goofy light satire commentary on the class system would make this an enjoyable latenight rentalbr br however everyone wants to compare it to the first film and maybe thats not fair the first film is a cult classic what could possibly follow it up nothing so take this second film as a stand alone and it certainly has its momentsbr br jackie mason is amusing doing his best rodneywannabe impersonation is he as good as rodney no are his lines as good no but he is funny the rest of the cast falls in line as being decent but not outstanding youll recognize faces amongst the cast and wonder how they got to where they are todaybr br the film is predictable but arent most in this genre again its not the best comedy youll see but if you like cannonball runtype fun youll enjoy this one
