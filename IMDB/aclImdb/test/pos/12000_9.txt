sorry to repeat myself over and over but heres another great columbo episode i guess thats why im such a fan  most episodes really are great the best episodes always have a standout feature of some sort and in this case the murderer and his accomplice are possibly the youngest ever columbo villainsbr br after watching a lot of episodes where columbo and his adversary act like close friends its good to see an episode where tempers fray and bad feelings rise to the surface it just gives an episode a bit more drama and bite columbo is rapidly onto the fact that the two students who claim to be helping him are not very secretly laughing at him and feeding him false clues he happily plays along deliberately turning up the bumbling in front of them to make them underestimate him but of course he knows instantly when they are talking baloneybr br the murder itself is another complicated one along the lines of the bye bye sky high iq episode with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that manages to kill the intended target while providing the assassins with a seemingly watertight alibi in the intervening years between 1978 and 1990 the technology has moved on from record players and firecrackers to remote control car locking systems and hidden camerasbr br stephen caffrey puts in a great performance as justin rowe the obnoxious spoilt student gary hershberger is lowkey but good as his yesman friend cooper redman and its nice to see robert culp as mr rowe justins dadbr br a very satisfying episode in all ways
