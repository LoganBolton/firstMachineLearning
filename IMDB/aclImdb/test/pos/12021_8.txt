even though i saw this film when i was very young i already knew the story of wild the thieftaker and shepherd who famously escaped from newgate prisonbr br apart from the liberty taken right at the end the film more or less faithfully follows the true story the temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many socalled historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for thatbr br of the performances there is scarcely a poor performance and tommy steele is ideally cast also good is stanley baker as the thieftaker and alan badel is good as alwaysbr br because the film sticks to the facts it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family
