note ive tried not to give away any important plot twists or the ending but if youre concerned about that please think about viewing the film before reading furtherthanksbr br this was obviously a fairly high budget production released by paramount the story follows the supposedly trueexploits of hiwayman jack shepard in 1700s london he was a locksmith who got blackmailed into a life of crime by the nefarious thieftaker to save his brothers life after being double crossed by the thieftaker we turns into a sort of robin hood type figure and gains the support of the common folk he proceeds to make escapes from several prisons including the infamous newgate as well as having time to entertain numerous noble ladiesbr br i really enjoyed the film even though the plot was a bit predictable the film was shot in glencree and wicklow ireland and the sets were very well done and seemed realistic i think clavell captured the bustling atmosphere of london in the 1700s quite well and i enjoyed his creative use of camera angles and unlike many films depicting this period clavell pulls no punches in showing us the deplorable conditions in which the poor lived in one scene several folks fight over a meat pie that has rolled through the filth in the streetbr br overall i really enjoyed this film i will admit that it lacks the wonderful scenery and underlying political commentary that clavells next film the last valley has a parable to the vietnam war but it still merits a viewing or two it is regrettable that it has not ever to my knowledge been released on video or dvd
