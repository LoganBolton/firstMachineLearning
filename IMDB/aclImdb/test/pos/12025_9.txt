this bravo special is one of the most purely entertaining things ive ever seen on tv unlike me first  the gimme gimmes the worlds foremost punksupergroupcoverband the dan band really must be seen to be appreciatedbr br on paper the dan band is just a onejoke act guy sings girly songs and inserts gratuitous profanity into the lyrics if you listen to their dan band live cd thats all youll get and itll get old quick i only bought it because it had some songs that werent on the tv special but whats made dan finnerty a hollywood cult hero is his amazing stage presence this guy owns his audience for every second hes onstage and the backup singers are a large part of the visual punchline as well as for the actual band they stay out of sight for the most part but are certainly much more energetic and enthusiastic than your typical loungeact backing band hopefully a dvd version will be released soon there were almost certainly some songs cut and although the heavy censoring adds a bit of unintentional humor it also removes the intentional humorbr br if there is any sense in the world the vegas casino owners will soon be fighting over who can build dan his own showroom fasterbr br remember my namefame
