spending an hour seeing this brilliant dan finnerty and his dan band perform their special on bravo is the most enjoyable hour ive ever spent watching tv this young man dan is such an incredible talent as a singer performer and even dancer he can go from the cheesiest of ballad pop songs all of which have only been sung by women to hiphop rock also songs written for women this guy can do anything ive seen him live at least 11 times so i was not expecting just how well that his show would adapt to a television or film format but all reservations went away instantly when the show started because of dans overwhelming star qualitydo yourself a favor and watch this or better yet buy it
