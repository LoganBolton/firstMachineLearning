okay when it comes to plots this film is far from believable and also a bit silly yet despite its many deficiencies the film manages to workprovided you turn off your brain and just let yourself enjoy the zaniness of it all if you cant then you probably wont like this film very much at allbr br in one of the oddest plots of the 1930s robert montgomery plays a guy living near the arctic circle at a wireless station how exactly he came to such a remote outpost is uncertain but into this very very lonely and isolated existence come a steady string of guestseven though it had been years since hed seen anyone but eskimosbr br first reginald owen and myrna loy arrive when their plane crashes they are supposedly on their way to montrealhow they got that far off course is beyond belief reginald is a stuffy and dull fellow who is really worried about montgomery since robert hasnt seen a woman in a very long time and owen seems in constant dread that montgomery is out to steal loy for himself as for montgomery thats exactly what his plans are for the longest time you never really understand why loy is engaged to owensince he is about as appealing as soggy breadbr br soon loy and montgomery fall in love but this is all for naught when out of the blue again montgomerys old fiancée arrives to announce shes there to marry him considering that for over two years she never wrote and refused to follow him montgomery naturally assumed the relationship was overbut the chipper and annoying fiancées sudden arrival is enough to destroy the plans loy and montgomery were makingbr br how all this is resolved is something you can just see for yourself as for the film that the plot is very silly and contrivedi cant defend this but it also is pretty funny and charming and i see this film as a kooky comedy that is just a step or two below contemporary films like bringing up baby silly slight but also very charming its worth seeing despite not being especially believable
