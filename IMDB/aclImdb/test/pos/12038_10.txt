this is a hard movie to come by in the us but if you can find it  and youre interested in the life and music of percy aldridge grainger youre in for a treat its quite historically accurate richard roxboroughs grainger looks astoundingly like grainger at this period in time emily woofs karen holten is quite a bit prettier than the real karen but that was an inaccuracy i was happy to discover  i think what really struck me though was how well roxborough captured graingers outrageous personality barbara hersheys rose was also a treasure if she looks considerably younger than rose did at that period it is more than made up for in how well she captured roses obsession with percy its an easy film to recommend i should note that when she saw passion my wife had no particular affinity for or knowledge of grainger and his music but she was totally captivated by the film
