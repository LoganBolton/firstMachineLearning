this isnt far away from the trash that bollywood normally makes but theres just something really good about itbr br the title song is one of bollywoods best and is haunting throughout this is one of the films along with baazigar  a must see bollywood film that made shah rukh khan and its for this you have to check it outbr br other reviews give away the story  it is a fairly basic idea  sharukh definitely stands out and one of his final expressions right at the end made me give this film an extra starbr br its fairly cheesy but definitely worth watching if you are new to bollywood or not 810
