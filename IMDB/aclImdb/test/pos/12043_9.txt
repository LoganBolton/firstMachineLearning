darr 1993 was an incredible movie in my opinion it is one of bollywoods finest the movie itself triggers feelings of sympathy fear confusion happiness and sadness shahrukhs role was unbelievable in fact he gave obsession a new face juhi chawlas innocent and girlie character contrasted greatly with shahrukhs fiery and passionate character sunny deols role made the good guy role seem like the bad guy one the fact that shahrukh not sunny captivated the audiences attention proves that everyone has that helpless inner drive to pursue something thats not really in their hands even though the movie is several years old it surpasses any recent one the song tu mere samne was full of passion and meaning his personality fit the role perfectly he should seriously consider restarring in a similar film
