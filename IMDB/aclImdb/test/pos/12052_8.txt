ive never seen a bollywood film before but i caught the first ten minutes of this laughed myself silly and hit the r button on sky im glad i did i hope i dont insult anybody because basically the bf and i loved it but we couldnt take it half as seriously as the actors did  especially the obsessed one who i understand is a huge bollywood star because weve seen him on the cover of lots of dvds since and i even saw a doll of him today in hamleys the bf keeps on about this bloke  i am beginning to think hes obsessed he keeps saying that its strange for the traditionally good looking one to be the antihero of a film but then we do like films that arent your stock predictable hollywood farebr br it was completely over the top but really good fun if all bollywood films are like this then were watching more i have had that bloomin song in my head all week and i cant speak a word of hindi ps any recommendations would be appreciated
