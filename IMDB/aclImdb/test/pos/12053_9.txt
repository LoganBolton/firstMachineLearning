darr is a great movie shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is juhi chawla little does juhi know in the film that shahrukh has a major crush on her and is constantly stalking her i have to admit some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy like the threatening phone calls never in my life will i forget the line i love you kkkkiranbr br its just too bad that shahrukh and juhi werent exactly together in the film but juhi and sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie though shahrukhs role was pretty psychotic i still think he did a great job of playing it and cant possibly imagine anyone else doing that role no wonder he got an award for darr in 94br br juhi what can i say she looks especially amazing in this film its not that she doesnt always look amazing in her other films but darr did give the public a wonderful image of herbr br as for the music it was excellent especially jaadu teri nazar one of my all time favorite songs i also thought tu mere samne was quite nice alsobr br a must see for everyone overall darr deserves a 910
