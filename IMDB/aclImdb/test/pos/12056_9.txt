i generally love srk as a villain how can you not and i believe that srk and juhi are a perfect match on screen as they both are actually more nice than prettybr br this movie is great to watch although it has some major flaws br br 1 the good guy sunny  not only hes so much less attractive than shahrukhwhat in my opinion is soooooo important in bollyfilms but his role lacks character  it would be much better if there was a conflict between two strong personalities instead we have a conflict between a personality and an average soldier br br 2 kirans and sunils reactions for rahuls actions are unbelievably silly and naive even for a bollywood production br br but all this is not that important in comparison with the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere great songs really truly greatand lets say it again shahrukh as a villain i just love him when hes so pagalbr br a mustsee along with anjaam baazigar and duplicate
