the war at home is so good its become my new favourite showme and my neighboors carly and april watch this together every sunday and laugh at how true to life it isi love how everyone is so sarcastic and so worried and they dwell on every little issueonce someone does something stupid they never live it down and that is soooo how family isthe father always harps on all three kids about every little thingi love how the parents have no idea how to deal with the kidsits so true to real family life and the fact that the parents are so overwhelmed and have no clue how to solve their teenagers problems just puts the show over the topthe war at home is so brutally honestand so true to the world we live in that it has become a milestone for sitcoms to comethis isnt happy days or the brady bunch this is real life
