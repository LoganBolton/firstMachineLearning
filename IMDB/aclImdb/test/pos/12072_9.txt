i blubbered like a little girl during the ending of this movie and i dare anyone else to hold it together without a sob absolutely heartwrenching stuff yet uplifting at its corebr br a great effort on the part of ann margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who knowing her arthritic steelworking husband wont be able to support the family when she is gone arranges the adoptions of her children before she shuffles off the role really deserved an oscarbr br you truly feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives her all to ensure that her kids dont end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system br br if you havent seen it  get it if you can
