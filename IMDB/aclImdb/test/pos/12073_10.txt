i have nothing but praise for this movie and cast especially ann margaret but more importantly i have praise for my inlaws who were are the adoptive parents of warren and frank in real life i met most of the children at warrens wedding in 1989 this is an amazing story and is even more incredible to me knowing the family and what everyone went through it is also enjoyable for me to see how my inlaws were portrayed in the movie it was pretty accurate my wife even enjoys seeing some little details such as a toaster that she remembered from her childhood yes it is a hard movie to watch but so amazing and heartfeltbr br the beauty of this story for me is how many of the children passed through my inlaws lives and as a result of marrying their daughterand having warren as a brotherinlaw how many i have met in mine for the past 20 years this story has been a part of my life because of what my motherinlaw has shared with me that and knowing warren for what it is worth warren lives in california with his family he married his high school sweetheart who he reconnected with at his 20 year high school reunionbr br there was a show in the 1980s called thats incredible they had a reunion of the family who also got to meet the cast of the showbr br for anyones interest the dvd is available in great britain and australia it is a tough video to come by here in the united states and i have not been able to find a dvd here yet
