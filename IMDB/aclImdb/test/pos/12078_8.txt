this has to be the ultimate chick flick ever we taped it off the tv years ago and ive watched it about 30 times over the years i hadnt seen it for about 12 years and just recently watched this movie im not lying i cried from the opening credits to the ending credits this movie truly tears your heart out even if you dont have children
