it is a very great film documentary about istanbul and their people and its music of every kind editing and the success of the director is very impressive ive been interested with faith akin since i saw the gegen die wand headon duvara kars305 and i admired his work very much but this one has been the most touching one for me so im here writing this it is not just about turks or something like that it is a very good biography of a city and how music stay alive in it we can say there are views of many people and so very variant ideas about even life and love i liked it very much and i thing anyone and everyone should see it not only but especially the ones anyhow related with turkey
