klaus kinski popped up in a sizable number of spaghetti westerns throughout the 60s and early 70s he was usually cast in secondary parts as nasty villains kooky klaus lands himself a juicy lead role as crazy johnny laster a foul twitchy and deranged sex maniac who comes up with a plan to abduct a lovely heiress in order to obtain her considerable inheritance johnny and his gang become wanted fugitives after the plan goes disastrously awry writerdirector mario costa ably crafts a sordidly compelling portrait of a severely sick and twisted piece of sniveling lowlife work the plot unfolds at a steady pace the tone is appropriately gritty and serious and the exciting action scenes are staged with real skill and brio the shootouts in rock quarries are especially gripping and thrilling ironically dressed in white oozing oily charisma from every rotten pore and jumping on beautiful women every chance he gets kinskis johnny makes for a fascinatingly creepy and monstrous brute kinski is simply spectacular as this gloriously repellent character he receives fine support from the luscious gabriella giorgelli as sweet fiery saloon girl juanita steven tedd as the cheery riccardo giovanni pallavicino as ruthless band gang leader machete giuliano raffaella as smart lawyer gary pinkerton and paolo casella as johnnys sensible parter glen kudos are also in order for stelvio ciprianis moody and spirited score well worth seeing for kinski fans
