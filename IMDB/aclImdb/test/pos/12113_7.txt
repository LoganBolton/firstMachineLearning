lloyd hamilton was one of the most imaginative and among the funniest of all the silentfilm comedians why is he utterly forgotten unfortunately the original negatives for a large percentage of his films were lost when the fox warehouse burnt in the early 1930s hamilton was not handsome or graceful like chaplin keaton and lloyd nor was he dapper like raymond griffith and unlike harry langdon and again chaplin hamilton did not try for audience sympathybr br however his films were hugely popular at the time of their original release and they remain hilarious today oscar levant once claimed that he asked chaplin if there was any other comedian whom hed ever envied and chaplin instantly named lloyd hamilton the character most frequently portrayed by hamilton on screen  a flatcapped naff with fastidious hand gestures and a ducklike walk  was later adapted by vaudeville comedian eddie garr teri garrs father and further adapted by jackie gleason as his 1950s tv character the poor soulbr br the movies directed pseudonymously by roscoe arbuckle is one of hamiltons most innovative shorts and its hilarious we first see him as a country boy bidding farewell to his family outside their homespun cottage on his way to the big city then he steps away from the cottage and we see that its in the big city with traffic booming all round himbr br eventually our hero ends up at a restaurant uncredited but its the montmartre cafe in downtown la where all the movie actors eat between takes theres an amusing gag when hamiltons bumpkin character meets three actors in costume and makeup as presidents washington lincoln and roosevelt this gag would have been funnier if the impostors looked more like the originals finally our lad seats himself at a table hoping to meet a celebrity sure enough entering the restaurant and sitting at the very next table is a big movie star  none other than lloyd hamilton theres a very wellmade doubleexposure shot  the join is nearly invisible  when lloyd hamilton as himself greets lloyd hamilton as the country boybr br sadly hamiltons peak period of creativity was very brief he began his film career in crude slapstick films as one half of a double act ham and bud opposite bud duncan and had a brief and blazing period of stardom in shorts during the late silent period sound movies were not kind to hamilton and he was quickly shoved down the cast list in some crude early talkies then he died young fortunately the movies is quite funny and a splendid introduction to this unique comedians style ill rate it 7 out of 10
