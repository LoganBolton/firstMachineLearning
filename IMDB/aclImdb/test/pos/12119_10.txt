samuel fuller knows war and is one of the only directors in american movie history who could accurately portray the horrific experiences of it in a form like the motion picture his pessimism and idealism if that sounds a little odd to mix together work for him as a storyteller and at the same time hes always out to tell the truth however brutal or put into melodramatic constructs it can get verboten however deals with the postwar experience as we only get in the opening scenes the big boom of war in bold for a point the opening shot is like one big exclamation point that seems to continue on into the rest of the scenes a dead soldier on the ground the camera pans up we see another soldier shot down in wartorn terrain simple direct language then fuller punctuates the intensity with something interesting the title song played over the opening credits as both irony and sincerity and then beethoven music over a shootout between americans and the nazis sgt david brent james best is shot the battle goes on and then it transitions to him being treated for his woundsbr br it might lead one to believe that this will be a somewhat conventional ww2 flick somewhat in that one usually wouldnt find beethoven and later on to an extent wagner put into these images but this isnt the case instead fuller makes this a coming home kind of movie though not at all in the sense that this soldier comes home injured and so on and so on instead of really going home brent stays on in germany as hes fallen head over heels for the woman helga susan cummings pretty good at pulling off the german accent and wants to work in a smaller capacity in the military so he can marry her what he doesnt realize is that a she wants him more for money so she can get food for herself and brother however this gets complex emotionally at the point of revelation to the slightly naive but heartfelt brent and b theres an underground hitler youth sect called the werewolves who want to pick right up off where hitler ended starting small despite argument within the group by attacking the very government thats now embedded in germany to give them as brent describes a blood transfusion with this plus footage from the nuremburg trials and as narrated i think by fuller himself a quick nopunchespulled history of the nazi war crimes piece by piece we get a multifaceted look at a society in the dire straits of an immediate postwar environment while rossellini handled it his own way with germany year zero fuller tackles it with layers first theres the love story or what is the tragic downfall of a man who cant see anything past what he thinks should be reasonable that its his wife and a child on the way that he cant leave until the revelation that hes partly been swindled baker and cummings along with harold daye as helgas young confused brother perform at with the utmost detail to emotions these arent very easy bmovie parts though they couldve been that then another layer is the political one the struggle of a society to come to grips with being conquered and a mentality which is made sensationalized to be sure by fuller in respect to making the nazis a total nograyarea thing theyre evil particularly when they cancel out reason to meet their endsbr br and finally theres the layer of style which is strangely absorbing this is probably one of fullers talkiest films which isnt a bad thing considering its one of his best written scripts as the characters dont talk simply or in too many platitudes with the exception of a small scene where two characters talk about the hitler youth as juvenile delinquents which is actually according to fullers autobiography probably another layer to consider in the subtext and the 50s period of movies and fuller shoots this almost in a real european style when hes not going for fight scenes or battles as the editing isnt always very fast and sometimes a cut wont happen for a full minute or longer theres an odd tension that grows out of this especially when theres something said by a character that gets another one wildeyed or suspicious fuller could easily go for a big closeup but theres a more sinister cold quality to not moving away from two people in a conversation without a simple overtheshoulder deal but when it requires it like the big brawl outside the american military office or the nuremburg footage spliced into franzs memories of the werewolves fuller can be as stunning stylist as everbr br very hard to find but extremely worth it if your either a fan of the directors or of ww2 movies set in germany or even just a historybuff verboten is an intellectual experience and a strong emotional one with a cast that is better than expected from a bmovie and an attitude towards the other that is equally damning and thought provoking
