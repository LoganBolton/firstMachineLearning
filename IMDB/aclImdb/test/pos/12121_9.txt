great film about an american gi who quits the army to marry a german girl who saved his life in the last days of the war she accepts but does she do it because she really likes him or because he can support her with easier access to food and such meanwhile her brother and an old friend form an antiamerican terrorist group called the werewolves their purpose to drive away the occupants you might remember the same group playing a major part in lars von triers film europa zentropa james best best known for his role as roscoe p coltrane in the 1980s television show the dukes of hazzard is shockingly excellent as the american he should have become a big movie star Â– at this age he reminds me very much of warren beatty the other main actors are good as well fullers direction is quite good using a lot of long takes again although they are not nearly as complex as they were in park row the long takes more often than not consist of long scenes with a lot of dialogue the only problems lie in the script as seems to be the case with all of the fuller films that ive seen its not too badly flawed but it ought to have been expanded fleshing out major characters and parts of the script helga the wife goes through a major change but completely off screen therefore the emotional center rests squarely on bests shoulders fuller also should have killed off the sick mother early in the film i hope that doesnt sound too harsh she just doesnt really do anything throughout the film except lie in bed she has so few lines but fuller keeps bringing her up as the film goes on i would have had her death solidify david and helgas relationship myself and the film ends too abruptly and it lacks payoff these arent really the biggest flaws in the world the way i described them makes them sound bigger than they are 910
