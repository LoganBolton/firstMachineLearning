a very accurate depiction of small time mob life filmed in new jersey the story characters and script are believable but the acting drops the ball still its worth watching especially for the strong images some still with me even though i first viewed this 25 years agobr br a young hood steps up and starts doing bigger things tries to but these things keep going wrong leading the local boss to suspect that his end is being skimmed off not a good place to be if you enjoy your health or lifebr br this is the film that introduced joe pesce to martin scorsese also present is that perennial screen wise guy frank vincent strong on characterizations and visuals sound muddled and much of the acting is amateurish but a great story
