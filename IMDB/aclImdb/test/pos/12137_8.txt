not a bad mow i was expecting another film based on womens issues but was pleasantly surprised at the element of suspense sure parts of the plot were pretty hokey but for the most part the movie kept me guessing was the nut bar connected with the ex husband somebody in the tavern or was it the guy person that she cut off daniel magder was excellent ive seen him in moms on strike and in guilt by association both mows and he is very creditable especially the way he challenges his mother the way a preteen would typically actbr br laura leighton also played the typical mother exwife that both men and women can relate to she was frustrated enough to seem realbr br see it if you missed it its worthwhile
