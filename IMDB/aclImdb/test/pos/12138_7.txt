pulling in 26 million viewers one has to wonder what everyones opinions on the storylineplot isbr br reading the run down over at lifetime i was led to believe that this would be an edgeofyourseat thriller about a single mother being stalked and finally confronting the stalker sadly i was mistaken while the main plot is interesting enough  single mother run off road one night then is stalked by same guy the reasoning behind the stalking left nothing but a really bad taste in my mouthbr br laura leighton plays the victim and she does it well whether it was all those years on melrose place or not she does well in this movie playing a mother who would do anything to protect her son from harm and shes looking pretty good too these daysbr br leighton is really the only good thing about this movie i think many people will identify with the main character after discovering why the stalker is stalking it will be a viewonlyonce type of movie
