i agree with all the strenghts mentioned in the other reviews but there are some beats missing here that keep it firmly inside the genre of crime drama or film noir and limit it from being a great drama beyond the limits of the elements that make up film noirnot to say that the great film noirs arentcantshouldnt be also great dramas but this one isntbr br one other note the music in the film is used sparingly but i would say is used to accentuate the action more frequently than the wife elementsbr br great set up to this film by the way with an abrupt sort of non ending ending that is either just right or a let down dependsbr br spoilers follow as to some specificsbr br the big turn in the story involves the children seeing their mother die or it should be the big moment but the children are never shown to react one way or the other neither cries neither asks their father what happened the kids are good actors and the reactions of the father are i suppose what matters but this is a big misstep this is the heart of the story and the kids are kept mostly blank in their reaction they really just have none in the next scene they look as if nothing happenedbr br in like fashion there is a bond that forms between belmondo and venturas characters belmondo says he knew the partner who was killedbut this is never explained and has no impact dramatically on belmondo or anyone else the belmondo romantic subplot also strains credibility though its convincingly acted venturas character just lets belmondo involve a total stranger in their escape plan for no reason he doesnt even comment or seem to notice another gapbr br the ending to the movie and i wont spoil it the ending happens off screen with a perfunctory voice over to tell you what happened i guess this tries to make it feel more true to life but again like these other missteps leaves drama off screenbr br whats the point of not dealing with these issues i dont know other than maybe the goals of the film were limited to giving the audience what it wants from a crime melodramasuggest some deeper elements then move on to ignore thembr br too bad there is much to recommend this film ventura is very very good but too bad it could have been a great drama as well as a crime storyas with imdb favorite movie of all time the godfather this film had potential would make for a good remake though if done in the us more problems would probably sink the film but in the hands of the right director this would be a good remakethough its doubtful venturas performance could be toppedbr br so worth seeing but frustrating as a whole
