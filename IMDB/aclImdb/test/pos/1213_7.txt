wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining wrestlemania if not an entirely successful one the ultimate challenge is of course worth the price of admission alone but once again as with a lot of the early manias theres too much filler in between the crowd pops for almost everything and as always giving us the reliable announcing team of gorillathe body having a face vs face match as the main event for a wrestlemania was absolutely unheard of at this time it only made things that much more tense br br matches br br koko b warew frankie vs the model rick martel for a 3 or so minute match this is as good as it gets i wish it was a tad longer but what i got was pretty damn good martel wins with the boston crabbr br 2 12 5br br wwf tag team championship demolition vs colossal connectioncw bobby heean huge pop for demolition match itself is pretty dull i often had trouble paying attention andre really didnt do much so in a way it was more like a 2 on 1 there is solid talent involved here and its a shame they couldnt produce better demolition wins that titles with there pattened maneuver off the top crowd blows the roof of for the finishbr br 1 12 5br br earthquakew jimmy hart vs hercules i got what i expected here a standard boring filler match with earthquake doing his thing im not really a fan of either so it didnt perk my interest much quake wins with his sit down splashbr br 15br br brutus beefcake vs mrpefectw the genius deafening pop for bruti really good match up with sadly not enough time given to develop even further it really kept my interest and remains one of my favorites on the card beefcake wins with a slingshot to the post much to the crowds approvalbr br 35br br roddy piper vs bad news brown huge pop for piper nothing more than a boring brawl that does not know what it wants to be some entertaining antics from the hot rod but nothing else noteworthy for roddy painting himself half black and calling himself hot scottbr br 15br br the hart foundation vs the bolsheviks record breaking but other than that nothing to see here harts win with the hart attackbr br 05br br the barbarianw bobby heenan vs tito santana average for the time it got but watchable nonetheless crowd was rather dead for it except for heenans interference jessies hilarious cracks about titos food is more entertaining then the match itself barbarian wins with a nasty looking flying clothesline off the topbr br 25br br mixed tag match dustysapphirew elizabeth vs macho kingsherri big pop for dusty and an even bigger one for elizabeth who looks absolutely stunning might i add i thought it was ok it was lively at least if nothing that great im not a fan of dusty so dusty and sapphire win when she rolls up sherribr br 25br br the orient expressw fuji vs the rockers crowd is rather anemic for this surprisingly decent no doubt but with these guys involved it should have been better the constant focus with fuji kinda detracts from the match express wins by count out when janetty gets nailed with saltbr br 2 12 5br br jim duggan vs dino bravow earthquakejimmy hart duggan like an idiot brings out the american flag in canada duggan gets some solid boos for it too but that also may be due to bravos canadian heritage crappy match all around i dont care for duggan but thats not why it sucked too short in the end to really matter duggan wins when he whacks bravo in the back with the two by four duggan gets splashed for his troublesbr br 05br br million dollar championship ted dibiasecw virgil vs jake robersw damien some slow spots but when all was said and done i had a good time two solid wrestlers giving it there all resulted in an entertaining match up crowd noticeably gets ancy during parts of it though by doing the wave dibiase wins by count out jake has the last laugh by giving away some of his money much to the crowds delightbr br 35br br big bossman vs akeemw slick nice pop for the bossman too routine and too short to really mean anything in the end akeem was a gimmick i was never too fond of bossman wins with his slambr br 05br br the rhythmblues segment was pretty much a failure crowd wasnt into itbr br rick rudew bobby heenan vs jimmy snuka for a filler match before the main event this wasnt too bad if it had time to get going more it would have been excellent for sure rude wins with the rude awakeningbr br 25br br title for title ultimate warrioric champ vs hulk hoganwwf champ this one is all about the atmosphere from the crowd and the split crowd reaction for the most part warrior got a pretty decent pop but in my opinion it was a little underwhelming hogan dwarfs it completelywith his its one of wrestlemanias best matches in history with two people who arent really known for there wrestling they managed to create an amazing match up that was talked about for ages i have seen this many times and my respect level grows higher for each one for their effort considering im not a fan of either even diehard fanatics who crave pure wrestling cant bitch about this one warrior wins with his splash br br 55br br bottom line wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entry if nothing overly special its memorable for the main event the location and the crowd but its not one of the best if you ask me that being said i do enjoy it and i give it my recommendation to fellow wrestling fansbr br 710
