this was a very good ppv but like wrestlemania xx some 14 years later the wwe crammed so many matches on it some of the matches were useless im not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to dobr br however major highlights included the huge pop for demolition winning the tag team belts from haku and andre the giant the first ever mixed tag match featuring randy savage and sensational queen sherri vs dusty rhodes and the late sapphire and the first ever clash between the ultimate warrior and hulk hoganbr br some matches were a complete waste of time like the bolsheviks vs the hart foundation was only about 40 seconds long koko b ware vs rick martel was short and big bossman vs akeem was too shortbr br mr perfect vs brutus beefcake and ted dibiase vs jake the snake roberts were very good indeedbr br overall grade  b
