i have become a big fan of the work of barbet schroeder so maybe i am already a little biased by now but i think this movie is great although there may be a few lengths it is a romantic unromantic view of the great liberation in the later sixties stylistically amazingly polished great set design and in my opinion still very watchablebr br basically this is an ironic retelling of the story of adam and eve who are driven from paradise after having tasted the forbidden fruit which has turned from an apple into a hypodermic filled with heroine the woman seduces a man into using it thus accelerating his doom i say accelerating as the guy seems to be doomed and bound for an intensive life and an early grave right from the great title sequence onwards there is no place for any hopebr br although the story is rather sad i was captured by the beauty both of the beautiful location ibiza and mimsy farmer i found her character was at once shallow enigmatic endearing annoying interesting and boring somehow she represents what men see in women in a basic unoffensive way architecture and built artifacts in general are put to very good use  which seems to be a schroeder trademark of sortsbr br there is even some humor mainly delivered by stefan the german main character and his accent his main nemesis is not a snake but an older german of dubious reputation  and provider of the heroine  called wolf although it is a german name and stefan is german he pronounces it verrry english and in fits of jealousy spits the name out at his girlfriend in regular intervals  becoming a boy who cries  at times stefan has to work in order to earn a cellery at one time the guy goes snorkeling and afterward awkwardly clambers up a rock with his rubber flippers  never has male frontal nudity been funnier in movie history
