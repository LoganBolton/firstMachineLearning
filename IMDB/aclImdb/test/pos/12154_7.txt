i would be interested to hear from the director barbet schroeder as to why he decided to make more his first film and more specifically what his interest in hippies or rather this form of the eurohippie paradise and about their demise the film is at least true enough to keep one interested but in its own kind of truth its strange biased its a given heroin aka horse is awful stuff rotten the conclusion for many a dumbheaded drug user that sees that as the beallendall because it basically is after that everything else stops that becomes the life and its either a continuous run for more of the same or death more starts off as something concerning a romance between a new york girl and a german man but it becomes something else for better or worse sometimes both in the same scenebr br its basically about two young people estelle and stefan who meet in a city where stefan has come as a sort of wanderer away from his home country shes wandering too sort of and is maybe too friendly with a bigtime pusher named wolf they end up on a remote island somewhere nearby and after a somewhat daring grab for some horse by estelle they also find a pad in the form of a seemingly remoter house along the seashore schroeders comment on youth and sex and drugs isnt too simplistic which makes the film actually lucid and intelligent so many years later its both direct and subtle more about the characters and then about the fact that what hes depicting could in other hands just be a propagandistic hippieexploitation picture perhaps most pleasantly and this is just a guess schroeder uses as inspiration the sort of long sequence from bergmans summer with monika two kids in an inexorable connection some good some definitely not so good set against too perfectly shot landscapesbr br on the one hand i should mention that there are problems some big ones in fact the performances arent very convincing throughout a few scenes strike some power or have the actors in a good connection with one another but klaus grumberg overplays himself even if he is an ornery german by nature in that case i wouldve preferred klaus kinski in the part to make it crazier but deep enough for the subject matter as does farmer to her own degree and theres gaps of naivet√© in the screenplay that keep it from being as deep as it really thinks it is on the other hand there are two big things going for it nestor almendros the great cinematographer ie days of heaven is dp and is a big boost for a first time director like schroeder nearly every image is seen with an awesome purpose or artistry be it a shot of the cliffs by the sea or sun or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of a roombr br the other thing is pink floyd probably the main reason i and many others have heard of the film in the first place years before i knew really who schroeder was i saw the more soundtrack whenever i looked up pink floyd albums its very good music throughout occasionally the mindblowing variety that gives them the reputation they deserve some of it too is a little tedious even as it is a movie that concerns free love and lots of drugs and sometimes both at the same time i wouldnt rank it anywhere near as high as a meddle or animals certainly not dark side but it too helps to elevate the subject matter another notch particularly when one least expects it or in low tones or floating in and out of buildings as stefan or other walks on the streets its almost better atmosphere than the movie itself deserves but overall more is still worth watching as a period piece dated but potent like a less ambitious but more substantial zabriskie point
