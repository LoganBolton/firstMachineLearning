more maybe is mostly remembered for the excellent soundtrack composed by pink floyd in 1969 they werent superstars yet actually they made an album with the film music no fan can miss itbr br but this is also the first film of germanfrench director barbet schroeder its a cult movie when it was released censorship everywhere cut several scenes of sex and drugs it is also one of the first films to treat explicitly the theme of drug slaverybr br a german boy travels to paris and meets an american girl they fall in love together they search for sun and exoticism but its a too high price love she initiates him into drugsbr br in the sixties antidrug campaigns were not like today there wasnt much information on the contrary in many milieus taking drugs was a sort of spiritual experience so its quite surprising to see a film of that period which describes a nightmarish heroin experiencebr br the film is simple not vulgar at all and shot in a cinemaverité style actors mimsy farmer and klaus grünberg are very convincing more is a document of the end of the sixties and a document of the end of the hippies illusions as well
