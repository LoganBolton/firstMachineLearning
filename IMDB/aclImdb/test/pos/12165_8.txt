after 10 viewings in 20 years i too think this was the crazy gangs best effort on film with more cohesion in the plot than their next best alfs button afloat they were indeed a crazy trio of double acts thrown together mainly on stage sometimes in front of royalty until chesney allen retired in the 40s through illhealth he outlived them all by years apparently they were just as mad outside work regularly playing practical jokes on one anotherbr br the six wonder boys troupe head for illgethertotellme alaska to dig for the gold that was being found there it seemed a better idea than going to mansfield  because theyd been there when they get to red gulch they find their information was a mere 40 years out of date  they thought that the chips that were in the guilty newspaper theyd read tasted funny but by then it doesnt matter as theyve all fallen in love with snow white and want to help her grandad find his long lost stash of gold baddie bill m mcgrew wants it himself howeverbr br the number of verbal and visual puns is astonishing but most of them will probably only make sense to brits and expats interested in seeing 30s british bw comedies imho nearly all of the gags and routines work including the gold if patter between bud  chesney and the whistle while you work pastiche  even the always getting our man mountie inserts a marvellous little film in a rather tired looking condition but utterly recommended
