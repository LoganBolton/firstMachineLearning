this little short absolutely fascinates mebr br the only thing ive seen thus far like it is some of the work by sam brakhage the creator of dog star man however where brakhage is trying to unnerve by making us learn how to see again and provide us with an affront of headache inducing bright colors and flashes which i still totally dig and embrace as high art this film i would characterize as very relaxing and hypnotizing man rays general use of spinning objectscamera does not create so much of a dizzy feeling but a warm flow of senses intermingling and going along with the gravity of the moving world around usbr br an interesting conceit of this very short work is that as it goes along objects become more and more recognizable until we end on a nude torso of which i feel is the least feminine wellrounded breasts ive ever seen the circles and spirals of shadow and light over the torso make it an object of surrealistic beauty something that you could hang on your wall and delve over forever its because of this and other images in this film that i had to watch it again and again eventually a total seven times just because it utterly fascinates mebr br polarisdib
