its quite an accomplishment that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers could be simultaneously so insightful about gay  bisexual relationships and their struggles br br pool days is about the awkwardness of adolescence and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger one a story about experience and vulnerabilitybr br a friend of dorothy portrays a common dilemma many gay and bisexual people experience at some point in their life the intense attraction towards someone whom is heterosexual sensitively examined this story truly left me feeling movedbr br the disco years shows another version of a nowin situation getting involved with someone who is not only confused about their sexual orientation but is also terrified of being exposed as anything other than straight a very empowering story for those of us who have experienced betrayal at the hands of a sexually confused and frightened person br br while these three stories will appeal to anyone who has an iota of empathy towards others they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay bisexual or searching each story is uplifting in its own unique way
