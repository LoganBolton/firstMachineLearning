i gave 9 of 10 points i was sitting in tears nearly the whole movie because i had to laughbr br the story of course wasnt excellent but it also wasnt boring erkan  stefan are assigned to become bodyguards for the beautiful nina while doing this job they come between the frontlines of bnd and cia of course the two are neither born bodyguards nor gentlemen so they run from one disaster into another and they do this in such a funny way that when you watch some scenes you wont be able to stop the tears as actors those two dumbly grinning characters do quite well better than some so called professionalbr br you think the speech of the two heroes is curios or pseudoforeign well if you hear quite a lot turkishgerman people in munich speaking exactly like them you will remember erkan  stefan and maybe in 10 years it might have become the common speech of the youth god forbidbr br so if you like to laugh watch this movie
