i was looking in the tv guide for movies that come from germany and i found one called the bunnyguards so i watched it and i laughed myself silly i wanted the dvd but its not available here i could order it from germany but it doesnt have subtitles it was played again so i taped it and watch it from time to timebr br anyway i looked for info on it and found out its real name is erkan  stefan but i know it by its australian title the bunnyguardsbr br some people who i know from germany do not like erkan  stefan because of their accents but not being german myself i didnt notice anything the jokes are good but some germans might find their accents offputtingbr br i think this movie is funny and if the dvd had english subtitles on all the extras having a 2 disk edition with only the feature having subtitles would be bad i would buy it up in a snapbr br i recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a pretty good story
