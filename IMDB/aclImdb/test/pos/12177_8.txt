aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water including the official love interest marguerite moreaubr br i would have loved to see this movie play out as akashas power trip aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever she is on the screen she does sensual beautiful and menacing to the power of 10 watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to beholdbr br lena olin is cast in the ungrateful role of the older woman which is hugely unjustified she looks fantastic and at 46 according to the imdb still looks stunningbr br the story unfortunately is very limited plot wise weve seen it all before etcbr br the most heart wrenching is akashas death scene especially keeping in mind what happened to aaliyah after filmingbr br all in all a remarkable vampire movie
