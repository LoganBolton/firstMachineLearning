quite good dont expect anything high culturethe acting is bad the storyline fails but it is still a fairly nice movie to watch why because its dark a little bit stupid like unpredictable and just entertaining and fun to watch do not expect anything like i said just see it for yourself and you know what i meanbr br it is a movie without a plot or memorable acting but there are enough scenes that will make you laugh cry or at least make you feel compelled to watch it to the endbr br this is all i wanted to saybr br 7  10
