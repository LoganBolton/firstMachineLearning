in queen of the damnedakashaaaliyah was more sexy and had a biggerdemanding presence she just caught your eye and attention now the movie did have faults like the lack of explaining akashas past what i also did not like was the that the movie didnt really explain or show more of what the relationship between lestat and akasha was or was likeakashas aaliyahs role was sort of limited in the movie and she didnt appear until the 2nd half of the movie and then to top it off herakashas death came 2 quicklybut i liked how akasha fought back when the ancients tried to kill her because in the book the last fight between akasha and the ancients was rather boring they killed akasha in like 2 secsakashas head got knocked off in 1 sec and lestat turned into the biggest punk in the worldbr br aaliyah played akasha very well and stuart was perfect as lestat they could not have picked a better akasha or lestat rest in peace aaliyah
