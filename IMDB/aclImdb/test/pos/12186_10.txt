i remember disliking this movie the 1st time i saw it but it has grown on me i love the costumes and poses the actors make the humor the cinematography the soundtrack the scenes are very rich and it moves very quickly every time i watch it there is something new that catches my eye aaliyah as akasha is probably the only thing that ruins it but not enoughbr br also the lestat in this movie is different it is not the same character you can see that the character armand has been given lestatlike qualities because im assuming anne wanted it in but there is no reason to trash this movie just because its not like books its a fascinating by itself
