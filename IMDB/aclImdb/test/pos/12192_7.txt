despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt all the major players from the series were present talbot lestat armand maharet khayman pandora mael marius and a halfdozen more albeit most of them in cameo marius lestat and akasha were the main players and jesse of the talamasca also despite other reviews i think this movie and the music was faithful to anne rices portrayal and ethos at least as i perceive it aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene the movie didnt capture the breadth of the books series but i thought it was a nice supplementbr br im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments and i found this movie a faithful and often superlative representation of the authors vision
