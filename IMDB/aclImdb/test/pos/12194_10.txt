ive seen this movie countes times now and still cant get sick of it its like a frickin drug i know a lot of people dont like it but theres something about it that just draws me in every single performance is spectacular but aaliyah is the one who steals the show she not only played the role of akasha she became it her body movement and beauty was captured exceptionally well its also nice to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an egyptian queen no im not predjudice against white people i am one true its not known what color the ancient egyptians really were but this was a nice change stuart townsend completely made me forget about tom cruises portrayel of lestat and marguerite was striking once again all in all it was a good time at the movies for those who havent seen it be sure to watch it with an open mind and not take it too seriously i mean its a movie about a vampire who becomes a rock star take it as that
