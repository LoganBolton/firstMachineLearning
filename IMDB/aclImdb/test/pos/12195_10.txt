although this movie doesnt have the darkness of the books it is in my opinion a great movie its great campy fun with the beautiful stuart townsend as lestat he may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book but to be fair he would not look good with blond hair and lestat is most definitely about looking good he moves like the predator i always imagined lestat would havebr br  the visual effects are pretty good and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing its not interview with the vampire so dont try to compare the two interview is louis story this is a cut and paste version of lestats in any case i highly recommend
