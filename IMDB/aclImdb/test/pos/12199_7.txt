once again theres dastardly government agencies stopping at nothing to prevent public knowledge of some momentous events in this case the discovery of a new underwater species that could threaten the planets ecology although the creature is no et he does seem to befriend one youngster who protects it at all costs not realising it is but an infant of the species and is going to get a lot bigger  and badder this 2005 series had a lot going for it it is family drama scifi thriller with more than a few comedic moments the characters are believable well acted and well photographed the show holds the attention of course as with any scifi show suspension of disbelief has to be achieved and i think it is here alas the series crashed after season one so we never get a resolution infuriating there is a general comment i feel worth making here many tv networks andor film distribution companies cancel quite arbitrarily seemingly excellent tv series  particularly intelligent scifi ones now there may be some very good reasons for this although the audiences are treated with utmost disdain and rarely told the reasons this in itself is annoying what really gets my goat is that having cancelled the series they then issue the thing as far as its got on dvd in an obvious attempt to milk the cash cow as far as possible for previous viewers of the series thats ok they know what theyre in for but  many of these unfinished series end on a cliffhanger two that come to mind immediately are surface and odyssey 5 if youve heard good things about the series and not seen it you go and buy the blasted dvd and end up with an unresolved plot issue  it makes me very angry i enjoyed surface immensely and didnt realise the poor characters would end up in a situation that looked totally untenable  and well never know what happened next i believe that there should be a prominent notice on all such dvd issues to the effect that the story is unfinished nowadays i check on tv series purchases imdb is an obvious excellent starting point to find out whether a complete series is really complete or not buyer beware
