surface was one of the few truly unique shows on tv last season i can honestly say i modified my schedule so i could be home to watch every episode tons of action suspense science fiction etcbr br story was of a boy who found an egg that hatched into a sea creature the same sea creature that had killed the main characters brother and the woman character oceanographer had seen most people think it is a deadly killing machine but the one raised from the egg was very friendlybr br only problem is nbc canceled it so now well never know what happens hopefully scifi or some other channel will pick it up
