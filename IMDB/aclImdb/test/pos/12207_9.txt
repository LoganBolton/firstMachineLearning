surface from the day its teaser first showed in the summer of 2005 was a tossup on one hand it seemed so highconcept and plot driven that to the passerby it felt like it would work out better as a motion picture or several plus it felt like it was nbcs attempt at a lostkiller on the other hand one may have realized that the story was too expansive to tell in a movie or two and fans of lost seemed intriguedbr br so after one and possibly only season on nbc the show is on an indefinite hiatus that could either put it in the vault on scifi or filling a gap in nbcs lineup in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond its ratings were some of the better on the network which isnt saying much but the show has been taken off the air with no real official announcement of its futurebr br so is it worthwhile yesbr br surface follows a continuing story format driven by plot with next to no filler episodes almost everything that happens on the show is important to the plot much like a motion picture no filler episodes which put a pain in your side when you missed an episode yet the shows doubleedge helped made up for that big things seem to happen every episode but since it feels like a movie you end every episode feeling like little happened and youre left wanting more that trait of the show though shows how great it is the cast is solid the three main leads including the beautiful lake bell as laura daughtery put in a solid performance every episode each driven by their own reasons for findingstudying the creatures the supporting cast including ian anthony dale and the brief performance by rade serbedzija fill out the cast well the story is slow to start my one regret it doesnt really pick up until a 34 episodes in to the short 15episode season but the latter half of the season makes up for it the visual effects are stunning ones jaw will drop when you see an overhead view of one of the creatures attack a ship as wellbr br many of the shows problems can be remedied by purchasing the complete first season and not having to wait a week or three to watch the next episodebr br in short if youve missed the first season and youre curious go back and watch it its no twin peaks in terms of quirkiness but the highconcept nature of it puts in in league with that lost and other similar shows with a flair for action and adventure enjoy it
