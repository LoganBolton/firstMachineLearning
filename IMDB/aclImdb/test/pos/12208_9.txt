all i can say after watching the dvds of the first season is that i can not believe nbc greenlighted this show its so different than whats currently in vogue save for lost those who miss the xfiles just may have a worthy successor not as mysterious or intense as lost i find it to be overall more entertainingbr br this kind of extended story is hard to make i mean it could degenerate into childish dribble if most of the elements do not cohere together but cohere they do and i think the cast is excellent the writing sharp the location and props first rate and the special effects very good for a television budget sure it pushes what is plausible but as it does it never gets so silly as to insult your intelligencebr br bottomline is that this is great scifi drama for the entire family i doubt it will be a classic with a long run like xfiles but in the meantime i recommend getting the dvd if you missed it like i did the first time around this fall my must see shows has just increased by one more seriesbr br ps i just heard it got axed from nbcheres hoping scifi picks it up
