i dont believe it sixty percent of voters voted this show as ten now how the hell is the rating a five point eight it impossible i dont get it its totally pathetic i mean how anyway the show is great the story is great and the characters are interesting definitely a ten out of ten from me i think the creatures are cool they look great and i wish i had a nimrod great show great cgi hope theres a second series as a lot went unanswered in the first season and when is nimrod gonna get any bigger as the rest of the creatures are huge again why is the rating so low when the votes were so high br br 1010
