i love this show its truly unique i was under the impression it was going to have more seasons in anticipation of series 2 recently i purchased series 1 to rewatch it in order to be refreshed when part 2 started now after watching it i was excited and craving more so i came to the site to see the schedule for the continuation i am really disappointed to see there no longer are plans for a second series as i was eagerly looking forward to watching more of this story i think they really dropped the ball on this one there was plenty of story line left to build on and lots of unanswered questions im now a very unhappy view and i hope that they would reconsider their decision and pick up the story where it left off
