this is one of the better scifi series it involves character development a few really tensionate moments and reasonable episode scripts as one other commentator said here it looked as if it were a mini series not a full blown series with filler episodes and low budgetsbr br the problem with the show which in short is a godzilla series is that it started too big with incredible monsters fantastic science then it all boiled down to local americans doing stuff then the show ended too soon since the olympics were coming and hey a scifi show is a scifi show but half naked athletic people running around aimlessly is much more important so they only did 15 episodes instead of the expected 22 the audience was small too as people didnt really caught it on at 2000 in the end the suits did it trust a marketing plan to destroy anything that looks remotely original and promisingbr br conclusion you have a show with good special effects stuff like huge monsters killing people or destroying boats then going into genetic engineering transforming people human clones end of the world tsunamis also the only fillers are scenes with aggressive rednecks or other annoying people being killed for their stupidity the downside is that after 15 episodes that prepare something huge the show ends no real ending no closure just a bitter taste of cloth in ones mouth as if you just swallowed a piece of suit
