a fare to remember is a totally derivative almost ridiculous movie but has a warmth about it that makes it a very effective and upbeat holiday movie it stars a pretty newcomer challen kates as a highpowered ad executive who right before her wedding has to rush from la to seattle to keep a client who has rejected every other presentation she has transportation difficulties from the beginning and seemingly no money this is the first dumb thing  were there no atms anywhere she must make a fortune at any rate she meets a cab driver warner who looks like a homeless man and he drives her to her presentation and when she emerges with a huge box of beef jerky the clients product hes there to take her to the airport all flights are canceled so in order to get to la for her wedding she hires him to take her therebr br along the way they bond and learn from each other its a very sweet movie though there is absolutely nothing new in it  it combines six days and seven nights and a few other films but the chemistry between the stars is good theyre likable and the acting is good look for jerry springer as the head of the beef jerky company and a cameo by karl maldenbr br this is a nice film to take in over the holiday season its on lifetime
