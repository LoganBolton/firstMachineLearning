typically im a comedy guy i rented this at the video store under comedy and thought albert brooks awesome and rented it it seemed like the romantic comedy and i remembered i hated those and had the full mindset of hating this moviebr br boy was i wrongbr br while this is a romantic comedy its acted by an amazing lead  supporting cast brooks hunter cusack and nicholson and everything works well within itself the script sounds real and not forced like this could be happening in the news station youre watching at night it takes your emotions and makes you enjoy hunter and brooks and loathe hurt which makes the ending a bit unenjoyable and fruitless but it shows how you dont need a happy ending to end a movie you just need a truthful ending which is what everyone got not everybodys life ends well and it shows in broadcast news maybe people dont like the ending because its not your typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies but it works its real and its genius broadcast news is a classic in its time and a fine romance movie up there with casablanca well maybe not that high but its the only other romance i can think of that i likebr br broadcast news 910
