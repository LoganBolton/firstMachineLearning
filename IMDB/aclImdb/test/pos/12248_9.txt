i didnt like as good as it gets very much but i am a big fan of william hurt and holly hunters work so i decided to watch this movie and the most surprising thing for me was the superb work of albert brooks here in spain hes littleknown and only as a 2nd division version of woody allen in the west coast he played a great part but hunter and hurt were good too specially hurt in an relatively unusual role for him hunter played the role that reminds me a bit of her part in once around lasse hallstrom 1991br br finally the rest of the cast is great too robert prosky one of these familiar faces of the american cinema the exbond girl lois chiles pretty good placed on that role i think the always perfect joan cusack in her early years and specially the brief appereance of jack nicholson maybe he doesnt have any good scene but its jack nicholson anyway the best movie by james lbrooks great story well resolved and superb cast for one of the surely best movies of the 80s
