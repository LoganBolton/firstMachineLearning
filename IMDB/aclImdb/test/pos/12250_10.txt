not only do i think this was the best film of 1987 its probably in my own amorphous list as one of the 1020 best films ive ever seen for whatever reason i really connected with this movie and it is one of the most personal films i had seen at that point in my life i was 26 for better or worse i strongly identified with the holly hunter character and im a guy she plays an extremely bright loyal and intense woman who couldnt figure out romantic relationships there were so many things that she said in this movie that were things that i would say or have said to others in similar circumstances and the ending of the movie i find to be so very very sadbr br obviously this role was the big break for holly hunter clearly i was not the only one to think so highly of it
