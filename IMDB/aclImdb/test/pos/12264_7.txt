james l brook is one of those directors who always seems to take a quirky look at life he isnt only the producer for the simpsons he has some classic comedies under his belt  broadcast news is one of thembr br although it doesnt match his later effort as good as it gets broadcast news is still a very clever funny and witty movie about a television broadcasting station and all the problems they suffer theres a great comedic sequence of physical humor where joan cusack is running around the building trying to rush a news tape to the editing room in a matter of mere minutes before it is to be broadcast live on tvbr br this isnt only very truthful in terms of how hectic broadcasting stations are operated but also a skillful and honest portrayal of human beingsbr br a lowkey subtle movie with good acting especially from hurt who i dont always like so much and apt direction
