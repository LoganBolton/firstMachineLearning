cult filmmaker corbuccis rarest of his thirteen spaghetti westerns of which im only left with what am i doing in the middle of the revolution 1972 to catch is one i only became aware of fairly recently via marco giustis stracult guide its an atypically bleak genre gem in the style of the directors own masterpiece the great silence 1968 complete with desolate snowy landscapesbr br johnny hallyday the french elvis presley whom i first saw in jeanluc godards detective 1985 is a curious but highly effective choice to play the loner antihero hud who like clint eastwoods the man with no name from sergio leones celebrated dollars trilogy is fitted with a steelplate armor for protection incidentally i had met hallydays stunning daughter laura smet at the 2004 venice film festival but was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director claude chabrol gastone moschin is another curious addition to the fold serving pretty much the same function that frank wolff did in the great silence but acquits himself well and is amusingly clumsy in the presence of a bathing francoise fabian the latter then plays a greedy nymphomaniac of a bankers widow who seduces all and sundry in the pursuit of her goals sylvie fennec has the other major female role as a farm girl looked after by hallyday and who at one point is entreated into free love by hippie apache gabriella tavernese with this is mind its worth noting that the movie features surprising but welcome bouts of nudity from both fabian and tavernese incidentally the anachronistic addition of a bunch of longhaired youths who also engage in dopesmoking and revolutionary talk is a somewhat halfbaked attempt at contemporary relevance  but it all eventually adds to the fun besides even the black barmaid sports an afro hairdobr br mario adorf too enjoys himself tremendously with the smallish role of a largerthanlife mexican bandit nicknamed el diablo  who keeps a youthful biographer constantly by his side an element which may have influenced clint eastwoods unforgiven 1992 and at one point challenges the captive moschin to a headbutting duel having mentioned this the film also contains one very unusual weapon of death  as hallyday disposes of an adversary by kicking the cashregister of the saloon into his face as always the enjoyably fake fistfights are accompanied by overemphatic sound effects equally typically for the genre however the wistful score by angelo francesco lavagnino emerges a most significant asset actually the ambiguous ending is entirely in keeping with the films generally somber tone  after fabians comeuppance at the hands of the locals the hippies who had previously idolized hud suddenly turn against him when wounded and terrorize the town forcing everyone on the street and unclothedbut the unflappable gunman manages to lift himself up to meet their challenge they however scurry away at the prospect of facing him and then rides out of town leaving fennec behindbr br in conclusion i acquired this via a goodquality widescreen print in italian albeit with french credits and the occasional lapse  about one minute of screentime in all  into the french language where apparently the original soundtrack wasnt available
