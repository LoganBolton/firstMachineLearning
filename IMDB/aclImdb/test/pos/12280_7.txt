the copy of this movie that i have seen is not very good its grainy and has almost no color in some parts it switches back and forth between english and french often in mid sentence and sometimes even in the middle of a word to make matters much worse there are no english subtitles during the french language parts which i think make up at least one quarter of the film but amazingly the movie is still very understandable and enjoyable even in this condition and i think that says a lot about how wellmade this film isbr br this is a top notch spaghetti western with great acting an interesting storyline and an excellent music score it also has a cool protagonist a beautiful darkhaired girl some strange characters and events and an overall feeling of melancholy this film has euro written all over itbr br i hope there is a pristine negative or print of this film out there somewhere because it deserves a quality dvd release and when it comes out i will be one of the first in line to get it
