most movies from hollywood seem to follow one of a few preformulated and very predictable plots this film does not and is a perfect example of what i watch ifc forbr br theres a guy michael and his girlfriend left him with out a word he wants to know what happened is she ok  can he say goodbye  perhaps get some closure he hasnt been able to contact grace and in an effort to find her he has made a film asking for your helpbr br michael figures we might need a reason to help him so he tells us his story by reliving his relationship with the help of a friend  nadia  to play the role of grace  the girlfriend who left br br hind sight is 2020 and it is no different for michael by telling his story and getting feedback from his friends he realizes his mistakes and just how much he values what he has lost this is unfortunately a lesson we all have had to learn  or need to learn  and is easy to identify with that is what makes you want to hear more of michaels story and wanting to know if he finds grace
