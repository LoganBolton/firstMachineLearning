i dont want to spoil the movie for anyone but this mimics lifes reality in so many ways and if you are really honest with yourself you will resonate with it in agreement in at least a few of the scenesbr br the acting is not only believable but convincing in a way that endears one to the characters moreover its funny without trying too hard at itbr br and yes i truly believe a sequel is warranted here see the movie youll understand whybr br highly recommended especially if you like movies that have a real message
