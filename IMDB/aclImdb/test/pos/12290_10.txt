leos carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that pola x is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever seriously if i could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor i would have thrashed pierre to within an inch of his life no one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid both at the same time except maybe heathcliff in emily brontes wuthering heights after spending 134 minutes with pierre i need a large glass of brandy never have i been so angry at a main character ok having said that pola x is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes ive ever seen in any filmwhich means another piece of brilliant filmmakingand im talking graphic here by the way pola x will beat the hell out of you though so make sure youre up for it if you decide to watch it
