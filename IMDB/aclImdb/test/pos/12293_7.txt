i agree with johnlewis who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film while i do think the pacing of this film could be improved i do think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinatingbr br examples  br br pierre is going to marry his cousin even though his love for her seems very cousiny  br br pierre and his stepmother have a rathercurious relationshipbr br pierre lucie and thibault seem to have a triangular relationship and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certainbr br lucies brother is a bit of a eunuch or is he  br br and isabelle who is she really  br br overall i think it was worth my time an interesting film and one that makes me want to read melville
