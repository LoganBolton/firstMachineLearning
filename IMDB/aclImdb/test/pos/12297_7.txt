at times i really wonder when i look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than i have ive just seen it and liked it not in the way that it made me happy but in the way of having seen a good filmbr br the film needs some patience yes and yes the main character is really annoying but that im sure is by intentionbr br maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this film in a cinema or at home most people watch films at home like they are listening to elevator music this movie definitely doesnt fit as background noisebr br and no good directing doesnt mean having five laughs or explosions a second good directing means following your subject and keeping the story and actors together and while that doesnt work out perfectly at least i think it works quite goodbr br i liked the photography and sets even if they brink on the surreal at times the opening scene is really specialbr br i also liked the acting  guillaume depardieu is not playing pierre he is acting the role of a pierre who is himself playing a role pierre is not the romantic hero that he so hard tries to be he is a presumptuous and selfrighteous idiot a downright weakling who by and by harms all the people he claims to protect that even his love for truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lying and not even once asking questions or explaining himselfbr br people are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff no character who is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained there is enough information scattered throughout the film on everyonebr br and even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target practicing is seen remember that isabelle fled from a war zone  and obviously this is a refuge for fighters in a civil war most likely bosnia which was still going on when the film was produced at least thats what is hinted at by the story isabelle tells pierre when she first meets him and by the later scene where pierre shows isabelle the book with his father on the cover which is surrounded by books on bosnia
