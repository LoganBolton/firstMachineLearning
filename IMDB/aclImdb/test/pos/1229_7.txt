in my opinion the directing editing lighting and actingminus franco were very good i must admit i was pleasantly surprised and impressed with this film i wasnt expecting much in way of camera angles sound etc but in these areas the film wasnt bad at allbr br after seeing the film i personally felt frustrated with both characters because i wanted so badly for these two characters to reach out to one another and i felt like the travisfranco character wasnt really affected or changed in the end after terri commits suicide although this is probably due to the lack or inability of james franco to express emotionof any kind very well in this movie ive seen a few of francos other films and to me he just cant pull it off when a scene calls for real emotion or facial expressions the only positive he brings to the film is the possibility of more people watching this moviebr br on the other hand rachel miners portrayal of terri was well done and she looks to have a bright future ahead i could really see and feel the sadness and emptiness in her character and it made me feel for her i only wish i could have seen more into terris life before the film endedbr br for a short film this movie was good but it leaves you wanting more in the end i only wish it could have been just a bit longer to see the characters develop a little more in spite of that i hope to see more films from the director and crew in the future
