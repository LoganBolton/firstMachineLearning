john huston made many remarkable and memorable films those most often and easily recalled were released long before his passing in 1987 it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead br br once long ago a very wise man called doc asked me doesnt the dead seem remarkably more vivid and bright than any of the other stories in dubliners i tend to think that it is the story and film both contain some of joyces societal comments and criticisms but for the most part paint a warm and loving portrait of an ireland joyce himself so often railed against and would shortly leave br br hustons handling of protagonist gabriel conroy who realizes the world as he sees it is nothing more than an illusion is simply remarkable to claim that the film lacks plot is to miss the point as with any of joyces dubliners plotwhile most certainly presentis not the focus plot is merely a tool for the conveyance of the protagonists epiphany in addition to a seeming lack in action there is quite frankly little dialogue in joyces short story for the director to lean on hustons ability to translate what joyce puts in words into visuals is quite possibly the movies greatest triumph feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal br br to claim that huston has softened his writers criticism of society again misses the mark while the dead may be painted with a cheerful hue the complacency and pretense of the films characters is but a comment on society on a smaller scale we are the toddling old aunts the embarrassing drunk the tenor with the sore throat the wife with the sad rain soaked secret even the selfdeluded middleaged man br br but the dead belies its title it is not a dark story nor is it really that bleak forget for a moment the snow falling on the living and the dead and the inherent symbolism in it forget the shambles of a life gabriel awakes to at the films end it is only with the destruction of the illusions gabriel has of himself and of his world that he can truly go forward such is the central point of the film such is the central point of our lives
