james joyce arguably could write some of the best sentences in the english language and his short story the dead which ends his collection the dubliners containsin its finaleperhaps the most perfect paragraph in the english language its fitting that john huston who held back in attempting to film this story ended his career with it as with the red badge of courage and the man who would be king huston revered the literary source but made the adaptation cinematic and with the dead which was completed after hustons death by his son tony huston we get something nearly perfect in the marriage of literature and cinemabr br valuing all that cinema can do as one of the commentators points out this isnt the african queen nor does it need to be this is the kind of movie that is uncompromising for an audience all of us slogged through portrait of an artist in school and one needs to bring the maturity of appreciating how words and images in and of themselves can touch us as with silent films huston seeks something pure here and he works with the confidence of his many years and leaves the world a masterpiece that equals joyces originalbr br many veterans of the irish theater world are recruited to bring the story of a man filled with selfimportance and mock selfdoubt thats reinforced by the hosts of an annual party on the eve of the feast of the epiphany whats in store for gabriel conroy is an evening of celebration song dance poetry where hes asked to give the annual toast to the two sisters and their niece who host the party hes distracted by the task wanting to rise to the occasion and this distraction leaves him vulnerable for an earthshattering experience handed to him by his wife while his ego is shaken when he hears a story from his wifes past its also a gift where all that seems to have mattered throughout the evening is swept away by the realization of impending mortality for all who are livingbr br and rather than trying to make the last famous paragraph of the story cinematic huston brings in a voice over and we hear those incredible words recited as we watch the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling its the perfect solution to a filmmakers adaptationbr br the cast is all we would hope since this is basically a testament to the power of the written word and how it brings us together through common experience each performer seems elevated by their role anjelica huston as gretta conroy has a wide range to play and her account of a young boy who once loved her sears not only gabriel conroy but the audience as wellbr br when i think of anjelica huston its the transformation she makes in this film and when i think of her father its this film i remember first
