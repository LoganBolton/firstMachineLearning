there are so many 10 best lists which could easily fit the dead  best screen drunk best literary adaptation best use of music not specifically written for the film best use of poetry best screen speech best ensemble cast and finally perhaps best film ever made this was john hustons last and greatest film adapted by his son tony from james joyces short story and set on the evening of the feast of the epiphany in the dublin of 1904 it is confined largely to one setting the home of the morkan sisters and not a great deal happens in conventional dramatic terms they entertain their guests there is singing dancing recitations and much small talk but watching this film you cant imagine anywhere else you would rather be than in this companybr br finally of course it is about much much more it is about love loss and regret those stable mainstays of great drama in the films closing scenes the tenor bartell darcy frank patterson sings a song the lass of aughrim which conjures up in the mind of gretta anjelica huston wife of gabriel donal mccann the ghost of her first and probably greatest love a boy who died in all certainty of a broken heart at the age of seventeen and suddenly gabriel realises he has never really known his wife and that he has not been the great love of her life after all emotionally these scenes are incredibly powerful firstly as gretta recounts the circumstances of her lovers death and then as the voice in gabriels head sums up his own feelings this is great cinema the monologues superbly delivered by huston and mccannbr br but then all the performances are extraordinary this is ensemble playing of the highest order and while it would be invidious to single out one performer above another has the screen ever given us a more likable genial or convincing drunk than donal donnelly or has poetry ever been delivered with such passion that sean mcclory the ira man in the quiet man brings to his reading of lady gregorys translation of donal og here added poignancy is to be had of course from the knowledge that huston himself was close to death when he made this film which seems to me the culmination of his lifes work death may well be its central theme but viewing this film is a lifeenhancing experience
