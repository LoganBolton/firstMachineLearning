travis james franco is a young man riding a train for business reasons were to assume who leaves his beloved phone behind it gets picked up by a prostitute terri rachel miner and when he goes to her city to pick it up a series of events occur that are sure to stay with him foreverbr br both characters have barriers theyve put up to defend themselves from communication but despite their facades its obvious both are eager to bust them down in total there are about 30 or so spoken lines but from the way james franco and rachel miner use their faces you might as well turn off the volume words are unnecessary a scene to look out for is terri staring at herself in the mirror you can just feel her despair permeating the roombr br but the movie isnt perfect its mostly filmed using handheld cameras which gets a bit distracting mainly due to the acting of mr franco and miner and the photography the scripts flaws dont stand out as much still sometimes it seems as if the story doesnt really know where it wants to gobr br all in all this is the type of film that truly stays with you long after you watched it an hour after youve seen it youre still whatifing yourself on the behalf of certain characters its not flawless but still leaves you wanting more wishing it were at least 4x as long
