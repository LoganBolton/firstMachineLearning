this is my favourite movie of all time and i always think of it as john hustons requiembr br i must have seen it at least 20 times and never tire of it the mood the script the singing the dinner it is like being invited into someones home and observing the events and not able to participate even though you want to it is a rare treasure this movie and i cannot write enough praise for itbr br it is cast incredibly well with quite a few abbey theatre faces and also the wonderful tenor voice of frank patterson lady gregorys poem recited in the movie is one of the most moving ever written anjelicas scene walking down the stairs as she listens to the song is one of the best performances every seen on film i cry every time i see itfor all the right reasonsbr br we have all had love lost at an early age and weep for our young hopeful selvesbr br donal mccann acted in far too few movies for my liking he just loved stage work and stuck to it and it is our loss that we do not have more of his performances on film as he does so much with this delicate role by expression and the portrayal of a deep love for his wife that will never be reciprocated and he conveys such inner sadness at knowing thisbr br if you want your movies action and plot packed avoid this there really is no beginning middle or end just a lens onto the characters at a dinner party in dublin 80 years ago and all the little nuances and shadings of the personalities portrayed so beautifullybr br bravo to all who were involved in this production 10 out of 10
