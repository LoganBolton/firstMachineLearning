flashes of lightning a sprawling cemetery the name of adam batman west all pop up on screen before the opening credits are even over and yet despite these rather naff elements one dark night isnt as cheesy as it might first seembr br meg tilly jennifers sister plays pretty student julie who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation into exclusive high school clique the sisters what julie doesnt realise is that the other sisters plan to freak her out with some ghoulish pranksÂ—or that the most recent body to be interred in the mausoleum is that of psychic vampire raymar who feeds off the life force of scared young womenbr br admittedly this isnt the most original of setups but thankfully there are enough inventive touches to help set this film apart from the competition my favourites being the macabre sight of everyday objects embedded in the walls of raymars apartment and the creepy manner in which mouldy corpses float through the cold marble corridors of the mausoleum during the excellent finale hal trussells impressive steadicam cinematography and tom burmans wonderfully macabre special effects also add immensely to the chilling atmosphere
