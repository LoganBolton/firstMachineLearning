you have got to see this movie i saw it as a 13 year old at the theater on my very first date fast forward over 20 years and im now gay thanks a lot one dark night lol this movie creeped the hell out of me as a kid mausoleums still do but as an adult the thrill of this movie isnt in the storyline but rather the hysterical laughs it holds highlights are listening to the names the teenagers call each other from nerdlebrain my personal favorite to turkey also keep your eyes peeled for the scene where carol the blond head sister attempts to hang her phone up on a soda can cant believe they didnt reshoot that other highlights include adam wests overly dramatic outbursts and the gooey corpses if youre a fan of true horror id suggest this film just because to me its almost a parody on horror there is def a creepy factor and the plot is a good one but dont watch it if you want to be scared out of your wits unless youre like 10 years old or something
