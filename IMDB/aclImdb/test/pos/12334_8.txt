one dark night is a staple in the 1980s low budget horror genre filled with retro puns clothing and scenery odn transports the viewer to a simpler time when horror films were just that horrorbr br nothing so intense that you cant understand whats going on the film tells a dark fable of what happens when you mess with the dead well acted by its stable of screamqueens and a fine directorial job by tom mcloughlin whom revels in the time and makes you believe what hes presenting there is no who done it and certainly no big twist at the end it is straightforward and in your face horror from beginning to end with a lot of 80s humor thrown in for added spice i give it 8 simply because some of the special effects fall short towards the end of the film but at least there is no cgi perfect film for new fans to the 1980s horror genre or anyone looking to relive a fun night of classic horror bliss
