i didnt know anything about this movie before i watched it it seems to be a lesserknown teen horror from the 80s what struck me were the ways it differed from so many other movies from that erabr br the first thing i noticed was how slowly this movie builds it doesnt do the typical setup of showing characters being murdered one by one it takes its time building the back story leaving a little bit of mystery about what might happen i was almost starting to think no one would even really get hurt in this movie but everything leads to the climatic sequence during the last 15 minutes and then it gets fairly graphic this was a bad time to take a snack breaki almost couldnt finish my pizza once it startedbr br the characters also seem slightly more threedimensional than a lot of the cheap teen scare flicks there conversations were refreshingly levelheaded for the most part as opposed to the overthetop stereotypes youd expect for example the girl who is the popular snobby queenbee of the clique isnt constantly spouting insults at everyone but is capable of having doubts and showing some consideration for othersbr br so to summarize i felt this movie was somewhat original compared to what i expected and a little better made as well it drew me in kept me interested and then let me have it as i said its pretty gory during the finale but almost family friendly much of the rest of the time i dont need to own it but im glad i discovered it
