i saw this film when it was released to theaters its definitely one to remember i had forgotten the title until recently a friend found it via online searchbr br one dark night is rather unusual for the suspensehorror genre of the time in that it contains no blood it is of the teen fright variety yet the teens are respectable in their own ways its a nice oldschool film with props and scenes that reflect the times our hero rides a motorcycle with no brain bucket for examplebr br as has been mentioned by previous reviewers one dark night is currently available on dvd the original negative was not available for the dvd transition some reel changes are a bit rough but this doesnt take away from the story that being said the colors are vibrant and the lighting is very goodbr br adam west plays a rather smallish part in this film as raymars soninlaw his role as an overbearing and indifferent husband is thankfully shortbr br the story builds over the course of the film unlike many horror films of the era one dark night is a great suspense story that gives the viewer time to absorb what is happeningbr br the final 20 minutes or so of one dark night are what make it so memorable raymars telekinetic abilities are used to open old graves in the mausoleum pull the coffins out open them and move the corpses around attention was afforded to great detail in the final scenes the rotting wormriddled corpses look quite real
