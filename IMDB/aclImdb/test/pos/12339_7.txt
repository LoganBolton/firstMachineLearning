a bunch of sorority girls make a new pledge spend the night in a creepy mausoleum of course the recently deceased dont stay deceased for long and all hell breaks looseone dark night is an enjoyable 80s horror with some ghastly dead bodies floating around that are being controlled by the spirit of a dead psychic raymarthere is no gore and nuditybut the atmosphere of a mausoleum is very eeriethe acting is solidbut the script takes too much time to develop the characters until the final 20 minutes that raymar finally breaks out of his gravethe cinematography is impressive and the the mausoleum is a great location for the climactic eventsthe film takes so long to get going and this is its major flaw7 out of 10
