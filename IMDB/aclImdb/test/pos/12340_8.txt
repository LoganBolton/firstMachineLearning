one dark night is a highly overlooked and little known film from the early 80s that deserves an audience that i fear it will never get and thats a damn shame i have seen this film compared to others that have gotten a bigger name over the years most notably phantasm hell night and mausoleum this is a much different film than those and i dont see the comparisons other than the mausoleum which is a bit similar to the one in phantasm but not enough to make any real comparisons im not sure how this one slipped through without a broader acceptance maybe its all in the marketing i dont know perhaps a remake would breathe new life into it unless raymar drained all the life out of it that is im not too big on all the remakes that are abundant these days but i think they do work well with lesser known films except for the awful ghost ship remake which other than the opening scene and mudvaynes not falling blaring was utter crap so if a remake of one dark night would happen to fall into the right hands i think it would make a lot of people go and watch the original i know thats what i do if theres a remake of a film i havent seen before so anything short of a remake i fear would not bring this film back to life unless of course raymar got his eyes on itbr br anyways one dark night is a must see for horror fans especially 80s horror fans cause we all know thats when the best horror movies were made creepy setting fairly good acting very good story campy what more could you want from an early 80s horror film whats that nudity and gore well sorry no nudity or gore in this film but its still great nonetheless a solid 8 out of 10 enjoy
