this is my favorite horror film a close 2nd to poltergeist i saw one dark night when it first came out in theaters in 1983 at the theater where i workedbr br i was born in 1963 so i have a certain love for 80s horror films despite them being a little dated and the dialog not well written what i thought was so original about it was that the phenomenon of psychic vampirism has not been addressed at least to my knowledge at that time and is a very real phenomenonbr br i didnt care if adam west was in it nothing against him but his supporting role was not memorable but thought meg tilly was good casting the littleknown donald hutton from brainstorm and invaders from mars as an ambiguous scientist who oversaw studies on ramars abilities was sadly overlooked as a gay guy i was paying more attention to david mason daniels meg tillys unfortunate but gorgeous boyfriend hes selling real estate in texas now br br i felt the film realistic in two ways raymar who was discovered to have murdered 6 girls in his surreal apartment had a funeral that was sparse in attendance reflecting the fact that not only was he mysterious a hermit but a killer as you know these types are buried without fanfare second if corpses were going to be telekinetically mobile they would hover dragging their feet the filmmakers could have gone for the schlock walking groaning arms outstretched zombies but opted for what would be believable kudos the buzzing electrical discharge from ramars eyes at his throne coffin like hes overseeing his kingdom of dead cast an eerie magenta light in the mausoleum that will stay with you for years if youve ever gone to a mausoleum even on a sunny day you will notice that they have their own rosetta lighting caused by stained glass windows dont get me started on the cavernous silence even ramar himself looked like someone who could pass as an eccentric perverted old man the score was oneofakind and memorable and i keep kicking myself for not getting it on cassette when it first came out the track shooting was done where it was supposed to be i especially liked the carefullyplanned characteristics of each corpse the bride the badly decomposed child still holding its teddy bear the grandmother the tall thin black guy and the halffaced world war ii vet and the greenslimed eyed elderly gent who was the first to greet the sisters clique initiators even corpses can be good actors i suppose the only thing i had to groan about was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and choke julies boyfriend couldnt possibly be done unless a corpse was put in laying on its stomach and feet first but why it looked a little to fresh toobr br the film begins eerie with us never seeing ramars face until the last quarter of the film which is like unwrapping a birthday present as he is picking up teen girl runaways in his daughters psychic flash we then see coroners hauling his body away in his one bedroom apartment where we see hes experimented his telekinetic craft by phasing dishes into his wall the rest does drag as the heatherslike sisters group baits julie into a final initiation by spending the night inside the mausoleum but it is a wellplaced build up to the unleashing horror later the movie isnt bloody in any sense of the word the goriest part is when ramars daughter uses a compact mirror to feed his power back to him and he bubbles then melts ive always felt that a power like ramars could never die and a sequel could be worth looking into i can see it now one dark night ii turning in the grave but lets face itthe film stands alone i heard the film had other titles but the original fitsbr br a remake would be pointless but if there were to be one i would write better dialog and lengthen some scenes such as show the studies on ramars abilities done in the lab instead of hearing about it on a tape recorder in this information age something like that would be well documented on dvd and more corpses why just raise the ones in the mausoleum when ramars power could spread to the graveyard too lets just say id hate to be one of the persons who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax something that too can be shown i think having one of the initiating sisters recognize one of the corpses as a relative would have added some good if disturbing character with cg effects some awesome scenes with ramar animating cremated remains would be off the wall br br say what you will aboutone dark night but it has it all so see at least once in your lifeor death
