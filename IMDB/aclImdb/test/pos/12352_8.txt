pistolpacking pam grier takes names and kicks butt as the heroine in asylum of satan director william girdlers entertaining blaxploitation actioneer sheba baby costarring durville martin and austin stoker sheba baby is one of several tough chick flicks that grier appeared in during the 1970s including coffy foxy brown and friday foster the shortlived girdler cowrote this thoroughly routine private eye potboiler with producer david shelton in one night and it features a headstrong female shamus that refuses to rely on a man to help her take care of business unfortunately sheba baby isnt nearly as good as the blaxploitation movies that grier made under the supervision of director jack hill hill helmed the africanamerican north carolina native in coffy foxy brown the big bird cage and the big doll house anybody that analyzes images of africanamerican women in cinema should be familiar with these epics the chief problem with sheba baby is that our heroine gets too many convenient breaks naturally the secondary villains are trigger happy clowns that couldnt hit the side of a barn with a howitzer as the main antagonist dick merrifield qualifies as both an egotistical as well as smarmy villain with choice lines like anything worth having is worth stealing additionally composer monk huggins does provide a strong atmospheric orchestral soundtrack and the best song with barbara mason warbling it is good man is gone sheba baby casts grier as stylist chicago gumshoe sheba shayne she leaves the windy city to return to her hometown of louisville kentucky to help out her father when she arrives in louisville sheba learns that her father andy rudy challenger of detroit 9000 is having trouble with a local black gangster nicknamed pilot cigarchomping durville martin of hammer who demands that andy sell out his loan company to pilot or diebr br initially pilot dispatches a goon squad to trash andys office but our heroines father catches them in the act they turn shebas father into a punching bag interestingly during the fight scene girdler rarely shows fists smashing flesh earlier andys righthand man brick williams austin stoker of horror high had sent sheba a telegram requesting that she return to louisville but she didnt receive it immediately thanks to her lazy partner who didnt know where to find her brick and sheba hook up rekindle their romantic flames and share a night in the sack brick spends most of his time urging sheba to remain calm in the face of adversity as a former louisville kentucky police woman sheba prefers to shoot first and ask questions second after she arrives home sheba borrows her fathers car and barely escapes being blown to bits as she is walking out the door to get into her fathers car andy receives another harassing call from pilot previously andy had refused to discuss the prospect of selling his loan company to pilot but andy changes his mind and agrees to talk with the hoodlum a gratified pilot warns andy about the dynamite that has been attached to his ignition with a delayed action fuse in other words cranking up the car wont trigger the explosion the explosion comes ten seconds later andy and brick rescue sheba before the car blows up earlier sheba had agreed to let her father handle his problems without her interference dad i know you think im doing a mans job but im not going to sit on the sidelines just because im a woman sheba tells him after her neardeath experience sheba vows to learn who sabotaged her fathers car she grilles an old contact from her days as a cop and threatens the guy with her gun to extract the information only after sheba has ground the guys face into a bucket of chlorine dust does he relent and tell her about a payoff at the towns railroad museum brick accompanies sheba and shooting ensues with a flustered pilot getting away by the skin of his chinbr br later pilot sends a quintet of outoftown contract thugs armedtotheteeth to trash andys office these gunsels ignore their nokill orders not only do they shoot the loan company office to ribbons but they also blast shebas dad with a shotgun sheba retaliates in short order wielding her nickelplated revolver she guns down three of the four assailants dirty harry style the last hitman discards his weapon and pleads for mercy sheba has her finger on the trigger when homicide detective phil jackson charles kissinger of abby and a uniform cop arrive on the scene at the hospital andy shayne dies holding his daughters hand naturally pilot is furious at this revelation and his fury borders on apoplexy afterward sheba tracks down a loan shark walker christopher joy of cleopatra jones and pries information out of him about the pilot while she holds him at gunpoint in a car wash this is one of the better staged scenes with lots of ominous shots of the car wash equipment whirling and humming walker warns pilot about sheba pilot and his henchmen confront sheba in a parking lot and swap lead sheba flees on foot to a nearby carnival while the police corner one of pilots men she deals with the others pilot shoots one of his own accidentally and sheba runs him down she pins pilot to a rollercoaster track and threatens to hold him there until the rollercoaster cuts his head off pilot manages to escape after he has spilled his guts to sheba about the identity and phone number of the big man shark dick merrifield of the hellcats whose reputation is so immaculate that detective jackson describes him as the guy with all the right answers sheba baby isnt topnotch pam grier however the idea that our heroine can handle everything by herself without help from guys makes it interesting as well as entertaining chick flick
