if anything william girdler was an opportunist who wanted a piece of the action in regards to whatever was popular during the time i mean a blaxploitation flick in louisville kentuckywho would of thunk it i can just imagine the enthusiasm he mustve had getting pam grier quite a hot item to star in his picture if you are pretty familiar with the genre girdlers sheba baby doesnt necessarily stray too far from formula despite a change of venue the film still deals with a ruthless businessman nicknamed shark who muscles in on loan companies using stooges to threaten them in order to get their signatures br br grier is sheba shayne a former louisville cop working in chicago who returns home at the request of her fathers partner brickaustin stoker assault on precinct 13 shebas father despite sharks bullying tacticshis man in town is pilot a wannabe gangster equipped with stooges who arent that menacing rather buffoonish in nature so thinskinned they hire hit men outside of town to shoot up the shayne loan building wont give up his company and this eventually costs him his life when a warning through the use of brute force leads to his being killed sheba will get her revenge on all those responsible for his fathers death in other words sharks ass is grasscan you dig it br br seeing grier with a magnum is enough to sell this particular film the novelty of the setting being in louisville is part of the package you even get to see a speedboat chase grier in shootouts with gangstersnot necessarily the most polished kind one might be accustomed to seeing in a chicago or new york during this period in blaxploitation lots of blood spurting from bulletriddled bodies torn apart by gunfire and colorful characterssuch as a wimpy loan shark in pimpdress named walker and pilot who is one of the least scary mobsters you are likely to seewho show up during the film most having the misfortune of coming in contact with a very angry sheba the plot itself is nothing special but grier is always worth watching and girdler orchestrates plenty of action sequences to keep his target audience entertained a modest success for girdler and one of his more accomplished films
