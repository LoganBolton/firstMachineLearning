sheba baby is another pam grier blaxploitation film it was one of pams less visceral films of this genre pam plays sheba shane whos a chicago gumshoe shebas father is the owner of a small loan company in missouri when local mobsters try to run her father of of business sheba goes after the bad guysbr br pam grier had already made her mark in blaxploitation films by the time sheba baby came along fans of both coffy and foxy brown know that pam is capable of an explosive intensity as an actress in sheba baby the fiery performance that viewers had come to expect from pam wasnt as evident in this film not that pam doesnt kickbutt in sheba baby shes just not as much of a runawaytrain vigilante as she was in her previous blaxploitation filmsbr br the supporting cast in this film are a distinct disappointment so sheba baby is pams film through and through and though pams a bit more subdued than in her other films she still gives a compelling performance in sheba baby this film is definitely worth your time if youre an ardent pam grier fan
