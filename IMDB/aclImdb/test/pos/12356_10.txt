yeah i guess this movie is kinda dull compared to some of pam griers other films the plot is overly familiar the dialog stilted and some of the acting isnt too good but its worth seeing for the lengthy stretch near the end of the film where we see ms grier in a sexy blue wetsuit with the zipper half unzipped yeah it seems like a frivolous point when discussing an actress of pam griers talent but she also happens to be an extremely gorgeous woman and back in the day she had a body that wouldnt quit its nice to see it being showcased in a tight wetsuit rent the dvd and then tell me im wrong cant can you thats because you know im right  and yes i really did give a 10 just for the wetsuit scenes
