once upon a time in sweden there was a poor salvation army sister at deaths door she requests send for david holm but victor sjöström as david holm cannot be located because he is spending new years eve in a graveyard with his drinking buddies dying sister astrid holm as edit wants to see if praying for mr sjöströms soul over the past year has produced any results arguably it has not in the graveyard sjöström tells the story of the phantom carriage which he heard from his dead friend tore svennberg as georges according to legend the last person to die in each year must pick up the souls of all the dead people until being relieved next new years evebr br director sjöström whose lead performance is very strong combines with photographer julius jaenzon to create a visually appealing film the great double exposure effect is used frequently but never seems overdone and it doesnt make the films other dramatic highlights any less memorable for example sjöströms tearing of his sewn coat and axing of the door a selma lagerlöf story probably wasnt one you could or would want to tamper with in the 1920s  which may or may not be why the ending of this film is a letdown and unlike similar spiritual stories its difficult to suspend your disbelief if you think too carefully about what is really happening in körkarlenbr br  körkarlen 1121 victor sjöström  victor sjöström hilda borgström tore svennberg
