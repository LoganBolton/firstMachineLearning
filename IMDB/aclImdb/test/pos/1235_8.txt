while caricatures andor references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in shorts like this one they arent used in quantity here most of the individual gags are rather generic as im going to give examples there will be spoilers below br br there are only three well technically fourtheres a quick one at the very end of the cartoon caricatures that i spotted which is kind of low for this type of short though one is a featured character with a fair amount of activity they are jack benny as jack bunny leopold stowkowski and the inimitable ned sparks as a crab on a canchances are very good that if a crab was involved in a warner brothers short in the 1930s1940s the caricature used would be ned sparks there are also references to billy roses aquacade and a riff on a radio show character called henry aldrich coming mother a play on superman superguy here and the villain is a takeoff on king kong thats it for that kind of gagbr br the products themselves are mostly generic and the gags are more plays on basic items in unusual situations such as turtles coming off of cans of soup to attack the villain as tanks tomato soup cans doing the cancan gingerbread men who turn into paratroopers using tissues for parachutes and so on the gags are very good and its an excellent example of a bob clampett cartoon clampett had hit his stride as a director by this point and while it isnt anywhere near his best work its nothing to sneeze at either this short can be found on looney tunes golden collection vol 3 which is an excellent set that i highly recommend this short itself is also recommended
