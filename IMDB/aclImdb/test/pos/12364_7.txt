victor sjöström was quite the master in this film having starred in it directed it and even wrote the screenplay thats pretty amazing while today few have any idea who sjöström was he might be familiar to ingmar bergman fans as the star one of bergmans most acclaimed films wild strawberriesbr br as far as this film goes its a very mixed bag on one hand you have to respect it because for 1921 its a very good film the idea of the grim reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative plus the special effect of the phantom carriage is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a wellcrafted film on the other hand its an amazingly dated and preachy filmmore like something youd expect to be shown in sunday school instead of in an honest to goodness theater plus some of the story elements just dont make sense instead of coming off as dedicated or good the dying salvation army worker seems like a sapa very sad and confusing sap why is she in love with this man am i missing somethingbr br so my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with silents like me then by all means watch it but if you arent a silent fan this film might do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated
