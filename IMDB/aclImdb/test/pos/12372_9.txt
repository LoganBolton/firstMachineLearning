victor sjöströms körkarlen plunges the viewer into lifes lower depths for much of its running time with grim scenes of alcoholic degradation family violence and suicidal despair but the most memorable passages involve the mythic image of death itself here death is embodied as a ghostly horsedrawn carriage driven by a wretched sinner who was the last person to die on the previous new years eve for one year the wretch must collect the souls of the newly departed and after twelve months of this horrible servitude the drivers own soul is finally released when the last person to die on december 31st becomes the new driverbr br the scenes involving this carriage the film was known as the phantom carriage or the phantom chariot in englishspeaking countries are eerie and mesmerizing utilizing doubleexposure cinematography that was quite sophisticated for its time and still effective when seen today most strikingly the carriage travels to the floor of the ocean to collect the soul of a person who drowned as fascinating as these scenes are however the bulk of the film is concerned with the downward spiral of david holm played by the director himself in an understated portrayal of a man who has given up on the possibility of living a decent life in flashbacks we see holm enjoying a pleasant day at the beach with his wife children and brother and he appears to be a perfectly ordinary guy abruptly without segue or explanation we then see holm as an alcoholic wreck in trouble with the law and alienated from his family ordinarily this leap from before to after might feel like a storytelling deficiency but in this case the filmmakers trust us to fill in the familiar sordid details on our own its suggested that holm has been led astray by his convivial friend georges the drinking companion who first relates the tale of the phantom carriage but whatever the cause of his downfall holm appears to be a lost cause a meanspirited drunk who takes perverse pleasure in inflicting pain on his family and in refusing to reformbr br while david holm is our central figure the storys true catalyst is a young salvation army nurse who takes a sympathetic interest in his case and doggedly believes in him despite his hateful behavior when the nurse herself is dying indirectly due to her ministrations on holms behalf she demands to see him and thus inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will result in his recoverybr br at times this film resembles dickens tale of scrooge in its use of ghostly visitors who inspire a deeply flawed man to take stock of his life suffer over his misbehavior and reform i was also reminded of sjöströms 1917 drama terje vigen in which a man returns from jail to find his house empty and his family gone a sequence echoed here the director also reiterates a standard theme of scandinavian folklore found earlier in his bergejvind och hans hustru aka the outlaw and his wife 1918 that no man can outrun his fate this time however it could be argued that david holm actually succeeds in evading his seemingly inevitable fate for hes given an unexpected second chance to make amendsbr br viewers expecting a plunge into the supernatural will appreciate the sequences featuring the phantom carriage of the title but may not be prepared for this films painful examination of a troubled mans alcoholic downfall but those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate körkarlen in its entirety it stands with the best serious cinema of its era and is certainly one of sjöströms most accomplished works
