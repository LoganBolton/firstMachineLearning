much said without wordsbr br this is an excellent movie it was made in colornot color as in todays films but a special monocolor use with shadings that portrayed meaning mood sense and time it should be seen in color as it becomes an entirely different film the story by nobel prizewinner selma lagerl√∂f is effectively presented one never has a clear sense of real memory or phantom changes going on in swedish society at the time are subtly layered most highly recommend try to rent it or find it online i saw it in a swedish film class and i want to add it to my film library
