one of the best silent dramas ive seen as dark and shadowy as anything the german expressionists produced but featuring performances that were quite understated and naturalistic for the day no camera mugging and no unintentional laughs due to wildeyed armwaving histrionics sjostrom gave a convincing performance as the drunken meanspirited and frightening david holmbr br set mostly at night in a dingy swedish slum the film had a very claustrophobic setbound feel to it aided by the low key lighting and extensive use of irisingbr br there was a deep and typically scandinavian sense of despair and hopelessness to the narrative the film begins in a rather grim present and then were told david holms story in a series of flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacksa pretty complex story structure for 1921 where his character is offered numerous chances at redemption but he doesnt take them and we know he wont take them because weve seen him die drunk and wretched and mean as ever in the present the penultimate scene is as dark as any i have seen in all of cinemabr br the writing and directing is tight and intelligent even by todays standards in several instances sjostrom skillfully sets the audience up to suspect one thing and then pulls out a surprise the ending might not be such a surprise to some viewers but i didnt see it comingbr br this movie deserves a full restoration and dvd release or even a crappy budget release it just needs to be out there so people can see and appreciate itbr br 9510 which rounds up to 1010
