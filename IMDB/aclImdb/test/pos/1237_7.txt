adapted from sam shepards play this movie retains many playlike elements such as a relatively fixed setting a roadside 50s motel in the southwest and extensive intriguing dialogues a woman may is hounded by a man eddie played by sam shepard she tries to hide from him in the outoftheway motel but he finds her the film explores the history of their relationship mainly from their childhoods that has led them to this point its very easy to feel sympathy for the characters and to understand that their dysfunctional present relationship is a result of past events out of their control we mainly watch them fight make up fight make up and so on one image that stands out in my mind is of eddie hauling may over his shoulder kicking and screaming taking her somewhere she doesnt want to gobr br the soundtrack is also perfect soulful country with vocals by a lesser known artist sandy rogers she has this country doll voice that almost yodels at some points in the album this is the kind of movie that will stay lodged in some part of your brainsoul in other words go see it
