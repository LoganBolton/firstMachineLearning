the problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in people come looking for a bgrade horror film or a so bad its good movie jack frost 2 is neither of thesebr br it is to put it simply a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one to view it as anything other than a screwball comedy easily funnier than all three absolutely meritless scary movies combined is to misinterpret the movie on a basic level it would be like watching shawshank redemption and then complaining that there were no explosionsbr br the premise is simple the characters from the first movie haunted by memories of jack frost take a vacation to a tropical island a new improved jack comes after them now with essentially the powers of hydroman from spiderman essentially he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly divide himself multiply himself and worst of all hes managed to grow an immunity to his only former weaknessantifreezebr br whats sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first jack frost a simply horrible movie cant appreciate the change of tone for the sequel just as alien was a horror film and aliens was all about action jack frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and jack frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genrebr br most of the entertainment comes the live action actors who serve admirably particularly funny among them are ray tooney playing a caricature of a retired british colonel from the early 1900s christopher allport offering an insane hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film and david allen brooks taking the once serious role of manners to new totally bizarre heightsbr br the lack of memorable quotes disturbs mebr br as a horror movie jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman rates a zero but you have to understand its not a horror movie
