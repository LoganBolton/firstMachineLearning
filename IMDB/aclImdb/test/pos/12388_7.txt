i just watched this movie at the santo domingo international film festival while watching the movie i had the feeling that i have seen a movie with a similar story beforea movie with ray liotta but i cant remember much of it of course this one is a lot more dramatic especially at the endbr br this is the story emilios life becomes a lie that he can not longer sustain after 20 years lying about his entire life to his wife son and all the people he knows the truth is chasing him and there is nowhere to gobr br watching emilio make up lies is exiting and funny but after a while you get tired of the same thingthe affair with a young girl was supposed to ad something but it doesnt despite that the movie is still funny exiting and involving either it makes you want to help emilio with his lies or help everybody else catch him i liked the analogies photography and the good performancesbr br 75 out of 10
