it kept me on the edge of my seat true the story has a few plot holes but the sheer tension of it the way the director just keeps challenging the premise is simply fascinatingbr br josé coronado and adriana ozores are two of spains best actors see la vida mancha and héctor and here they appear as a happy uppermiddle class couple beneath it all the truth is that all of coronados life is a lie hes not an economist never went to college or does not work in spains central bank reserve as everybody else believes we get a few insights as to how he kept up appearances or manage to do it and while not very plausible it is still somehow believablebr br the innerworkings of the scam are shown intermittently but it is credible because coronado is a source of selfassurance and assertiveness he not only believes in the scam he also believes in the film premise and therefore he carries itbr br sure it tests belief that a wife would not know the inner workings of a marriages finances for almost 10 years but again since hes supposedly a brilliant economistbr br it has been said in a nationalistic tone that the movie is not distinctively spanish as if that were a litmus test for good film true no castanets or odd cabbies in this one just a taut thriller youll want to know how this story ends once you start watching
