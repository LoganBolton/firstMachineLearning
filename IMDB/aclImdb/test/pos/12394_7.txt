i blow hot and cold over carn√© he really can be a puzzle for me i think perhaps his inspiration left him a little earlier than it did for other directors of his generation certainly a man who came to maturity in the thirties with the popular front seems ill at ease in the france of the fifties with its rampant commercialism and heavy american influence he is almost thirty years older than his young stars and it shows the party scenes go on much longer than they should as if he were trying to buy time for the anemic scenario to work roland lesaffres characterhe plays pascale petits older brotherseems to exist only to reassure the director that his oldstyle ideas are still soundbr br at two hours this picture is far too long still let me praise pascale petit for her game performance she was a natural who should have challenged brigitte bardot for sexpot supremacy but somehow lost her way andrea parisy is excellent too as the girl who gets pregnant and wants charrier to marry her and make her baby legitimate yes they still thought that way in the fifties laurent terzieff is the only french actor who could play an anarchist convincingly he is great here as he rescues a cat from death then remarks he cant stand cats jacques charrier only reminds me how mediocre he was as an actor with that constant little grin and those blank eyes
