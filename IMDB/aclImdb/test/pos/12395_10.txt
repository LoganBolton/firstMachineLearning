first i rated this movie 1010 to me its simply one of the best i saw since i was born im 23 but i saw numerous films the story is cruel but reality is too not  it went deep into me and stirred my bowels i saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me  and i still remember it br br second there is no national preference this expression is a direct translation from the french for this movie i mean its not because it is a french movie that i put it so high  it has really caught me when i saw it furthermore i dont know well marcel carnes filmography so i dont know if it is or not his best movie but i know it is not his most famous  hotel du nord quai des brumes and les enfants du paradis are the most famousbr br third the movies in bw but it deals with intertemporal problems of youth not acne like love friends and studies in a modern way it could even be remade framebyframe with actual young actors a dolbytm sound and special effects a car crash it would still be a great film br br problem  maybe is it a film to be seen by young adults from 16 to 25 years old  and above of course  for its message to be well understood did i say it was a great movie
