this late 50s french study of disaffected youth in their early 20s actuallygrown up but not yet settled down into the adult world probably missed the mark by a mile in terms of being an accurate depiction of 1958 french youth dont virtually all youth films made by adults do this the ones that dontrivers edge comes to mind are rare indeed but directorwriter marcel carne of les enfants du paradis fame is too accurate an observer of humanity to not provide an insightful view of the essence of these characters in a sense the details are not importantyou could change the details and set this film today and it would work just as wellbut the loneliness and insecurity and superficial passion and selfrighteous anger of the characters is captured well the young pierre brice and jeanpaul belmondo are in supporting roles but leads jacques charrier laurent terzieff pascale petit and andrea parisy play the roles with subtlety and depth there is also a fine jazz score which you can get on the cd jazz in parisjazz  cinema vol 2 unlike some who have commented on the film i dont really see directorwriter carne as sitting in judgment on these charactershe seems as though he is an objective observer to me of course these middleclass characters may seem like people who are spoiled and have nothing to whine about to some workingclass viewers of the film and i think carne is certainly aware of this for this american viewer i watched a dubbed fairly literally id say version of this titled the cheaters the film provides an interesting window into the france of the 1950s it also is selfconsciously poetic the scene on the ledge saving the cat is but one example of this and has intellectual aspirations in that charming way that only french films can get away withi can imagine the heavyhanded melodramatic shallow way this kind of material would have been handled by an american studio production and the sensationalistic moralistic suggestive way this kind of material would have been handled by american driveinexploitation filmmakers i feel that marcel carne has captured the essence of that period between say high school graduation and when by ones early 30s people have largely settled into a routine whatever that routine may be those willing to watch the film with an open mind and not fire away at the many easy targets it offers should find a serious and valuable study of people in their early twenties and even if you dont want to do that you can go in the other room while the film is playing and simply enjoy the fine soundtrack with great 50s jazz and instrumental pop including the wonderful original score by an american jazz at the philharmonic group including coleman hawkins dizzy gillespie stan getz spelled goetz in the credits roy eldridge and ray brown
