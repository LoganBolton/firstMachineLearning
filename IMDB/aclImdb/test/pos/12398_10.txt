i just saw this movie on showtime in the wee hours of the night i was viewing the beginning with one eye open but instead of drifting off to sleep i became invested in this crafty nailbitter of a movie it was very believable and engaging i could have done without so much profanityas with every david mamet movie i see but thoroughly enjoyed the experience i know teenagers swear but i dont need to listen to it anyways the story had some interesting surprises which i wont reveal but if you have a chance to catch this movie on showtime i think you will enjoy it as much as i have
