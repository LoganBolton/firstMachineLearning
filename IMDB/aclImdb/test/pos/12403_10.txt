this film is like the breakfast club meets mad city its got one plot twist after another with justin walker corey feldman and james remar delivering really great performances however this movie is not for everyone if you dont like movies that go all the way with regards to violence then dont watch the last twenty minutes my wife had to leave the room of course i couldnt take my eyes off the screen this is a really gritty realistic teen drama i cant believe it came from bmovie king roger corman this film is a mustsee for those who are not faint of heart highly recommended
