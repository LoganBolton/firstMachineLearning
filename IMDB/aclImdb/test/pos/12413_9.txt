i know that chill wills usually played lovable old sorts in westerns but his role in this segment is something ive remembered for a long time wills could be a first rate villain yes burgess merediths fall was correct that look in hepplewhites eye it expressed porcine greed ignorance and the threat of violence all at once quite a performance i thinkbr br the segment itself was a good one too question couldnt the little black bag cure alcoholism i guess it did sort of with fall but the doctor would have been wise to apply the cure if he had it as quickly as possible to hepplewhitebr br there is one moment that was annoying but also necessary and it is something that appears to recur in these night gallery segments its serlings constant need to sermonize for thats what we got one more time with dr fall i dont know what was more frustrating losing the black bag and all its miracles or not being to stop fall from preaching about the bags benefit for humanity all while rubbing hepplewhites greedy face in the mud and therefore all but begging for hepplewhite to strike out at him but as i say it was necessary at least it was for me otherwise we wouldnt have been able to see wills performance discussed above all done without moving a muscle or speaking a word
