this is a surprisingly great low budget horrorcomedy its funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending all the characters are pretty cool and the story while unoriginal is very good plus eric jungmannadam and justin urichharley had fantastic chemistry together one of the funniest moments in the film for me is when adam is trapped in the bathroom and harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there and decides to take a pss in the truck and aimee brooks is just plain sexy plus this is one of the best low budget horror films i have seen in a long time its very gory but in a comical way and i thought it was very well written as well plus michael bailey smith is fantastic as the monster man and had some wicked makeup its similar to films like joy ride duel jeepers creepers etc etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there plus the gore effects are really well done for the most part this is a surprisingly great low budget horrorcomedy its funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending i highly recommend this one the direction is very good michael davis does a very good job here with great camera work good anglesgood use of colors and using a great setting plus he kept the film funny and at a very fast pacebr br there is a lot of gore we get extremely bloody nose bleedsgory impalings bloody stabbingsguy is cut in half by a monster truck human remains in a cooked stew guts all over the placeguys guts fall outpencil in the eyesbloody slit throatbunch of people walking around without limbsgory dead squirrelheads are squishedsevered limbsbloody and mangled corpsesdecent amount of bloodshedone very gory scene at the very end and morebr br the acting is very good for a low budget film eric jungmann is fantastic here as adam he was a nerd but a very likable one he had fantastic chemistry with justin urich had some cool linesand i just loved his character he also seemed to be enjoying himselfand he was especially good at the end justin urich is excellent as the ass of a best friend however i just couldnt help but love him as he was very funny and often stole a lot of the scenes i really dug him aimee brooks is gorgeous and did great with what she had to do she had good chemistry with jungmann and like jungmann was especially good at the end as i loved her mysterious character michael bailey smith is wonderful as the monster man he was very creepy looking had some awesome makeup and is now one of my favorite slashers rest of the cast do finebr br overall i highly recommend this one 12 out of 5
