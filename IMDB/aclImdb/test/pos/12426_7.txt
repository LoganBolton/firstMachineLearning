adam eric jungmann and obnoxious best friend harley justin urich are driving cross country to a wedding along the way they pick up sexy hitchhiker sarah aimee brooks then for no reason a monster truck keeps trying to run them off the roadand maybe kill them who is doing this and whybr br pretty good horror film its energetic and full of flashy direction which gets you right into the action its also a horror comedy most of the humor is infantile and really gross but actually somewhat funny also this movie really piles on the gore at timesbut thats a good thing the acting is okjungmann overplays his nerd role a bit much urich is stuck with the hopeless role of the foulmouthed sexobsessed best friendbut pulls it off brooks is good too in a limited rolebr br but i could see the twist ending coming long before it happened and logic totally disappears at the end especially the rescue still this is a gory sometimes funny and sometimes scary horror movie i give it a 7
