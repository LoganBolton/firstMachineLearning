before watching this movie from beginning to end i happened to just catch the last half hour ordinarily i dont watch a movie if i havent seen it from the beginning but a friend had it on and once i started watching it i couldnt stopbr br im really surprised this movie didnt get a wide theatrical release this is quite a funny movie often gallows humor  and the monster and monster truck in it are quite menacing the monster makes leatherface look pretty and the monster truck is a like a cross between a world war i german artillery vehicle and a giant coffinbr br a timid twentyfive yearold virgin guy is on a long drive to stop the woman he loves from getting married his exbest friend tags along and rags on him constantly theyre menaced on the road by a vintage black hearse and the aforementioned monster truck they also pick up a hitchhiker played by the very sexy aimee brooksbr br i also watched the animated trailer with the directors commentary and the electronic press kit and i found those both to be interesting i would bet that the feature commentary with the director and the two male stars is pretty enjoyable too but i have so many other movies to watch ive never seen before
