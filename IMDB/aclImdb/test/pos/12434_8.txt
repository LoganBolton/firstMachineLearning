carefully nurtured girls br br yes a terrible mistake has been made by the ministry of education nutbourne is a school for boys st swithens is a school for girls and what makes this one of the best postwwii british comedies nutbournes head master is wetherby pondplayed by alastair sim while st swithens head mistress is muriel whitchurchplayed by margaret rutherford br br st swithens says pond you dont mean to say that yours is a school for boys and girls he asks one of the early girls only girls she says cheerfully does this mean sir asks one of nutbournes teachers that we are to expect 100 young girls it means that not only have the ministry made a mistake in sending a school here at all but that it is guilty of an appalling sexual aberration br br margaret rutherfords miss whitchurch as positive and immovable as a battleship intends to make the best of it by briskly taking over nutbourne if possible alastair sims pond is exasperated up to his big bald head and is determined to salvage his school in the meantime there are 100 young girls and 170 young boys to be fed and places found for them to sleep along with all their teachers the cooks and caretakers totally put upon walk out miss whitchurch and her girls however are up to the cooking tasks come now angela she says to one girl who is trying to stir something in a big pot havent you made porridge

up into the beds just as the governors walk in the boys are observed at rugby and as soon as the governors turn their backs the goal posts are taken down nets for lacrosse are put up and just then the parents walk over to observes the girls one parent spots her daughter in a science class then moments later sees her in a choir practice then moments later theres angela again she says to miss whitchurch why so it is she replies hustling the parents out to avoid the governors who are approaching just around the corner the childs quite ubiquitous br br when we leave nutbourne everything has been discovered the students are milling about the teachers are dazed except for two who are kissing the education ministry has just sent several more busloads of students the parents are speechless but the governors are not were waiting for an explanation one says sharply pond holds his head and shudders cant you see im trying to think of one br br the film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation after another braced by a very funny script and two hugely comedic performances by rutherford and sim sims droll exasperation and rutherfords implacable determination are so well
