this film is just plain lovely its funny as hell and as old as the hills the acting is superb and its fascinating seeing postwar britain and how we used to behave in those days this seems to have been some prerunner to the st trinians films given the alastair sim and margaret rutherford connection  theres also a very young george cole in there who appeared in many st trinians films but i dont myself understand the connection it was shown on bbc4 recently after a biography of st trinians creator ronald searle however i missed enough of the biography to miss the connection with this film anyway a great film in its own right and something that should be preserved for all time
