this film was made thirteen years before i was born but i still think it is the wittiest dottiest most harmless piece of fun ever made it simply could not go wrong with the cast of superb british character actors it boastsbr br where to start alastair simpeerless margaret rutherforddittothe wonderfully alkward innocent gossage played to perfection by the imperious joyce grenfell the caddish victor hydebrown a guy middleton special and the rest of the staff sum up postwar middleclass england to a teebr br the humour is sometimes obvious but it is of that special ealing variety and is never offensivebr br i have watched this film more times than i care to remember and still laugh like a drain at the antics every time the storming of the dorms occupied by the girls school the magnificentlyplanned but ultimately doomed twin tours of the school and the chaotic ending involving the arrival of a third school to add to the anarchy are pricelessbr br its an old clich√© i know but they really do not make them like that anymore how i wish they did if you havent seen it please do you wont be disappointed
