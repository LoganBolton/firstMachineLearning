this dvd usually sells for around 20 i wouldnt pay this much for the dvd if i had known what i was getting but regardless this is a pretty good disc it displays the knot in all their glory with footage from their concerts playing surfacing wait and bleed and scissors among other tracks including the spit it out music video which was apparently banned from mtvbr br slipknot for those who dont know is essentially a symphony of the damned nine masked men who display total chaos on stage with machine gun drums squealing guitar and vocals that will tear your face off and leave you wanting more for those whove never seen slipknot before i cannot recommend enough you get this dvd probably off ebay or amazon so you can get a better dealbr br a short though well made show of the knotbr br seven out of ten
