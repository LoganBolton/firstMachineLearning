before i review this film i must make a confession that is rather a bold statement to make as a film reviewer anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that ive always been controversial in a lowkey sense giving high marks for flops such as captain america and 1985s creature and panning such film classics as alistar sims a christmas carol and shakespeare in love with that in mind this confession might not come as a surprisebr br the simple fact is christopher lambert is probably one of my favorite actors woah now dont start getting crazy on me just yet let me explain myself i by no means think hes the greatest actor in the world i clearly confess that he is not he is certainly no morgan freeman or anthony hopkins but i would say that his acting ability is probably somewhere up there with at least bruce willis what i admire about him however are the human qualities that he brings into his action heroes he is just an average guy who laughs and cries and bleeds who is a hero because he has to be not necessarily because he wants to be it takes a lot in my opinion to be able to bring out those qualities in a character especially in the movies hes worked in and lamberts heroes are a far cry from schwartzenneggers or stallones quite frankly lamberts characters are easier for me to relate to hence hes not the greatest actor in the worldhes just a personal favoritebr br i cant say that same however for his films however much i appretiate his acting it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leave something to be desired most of them are quite frankly terrible and any ridicule that hes gotten over the years from me isnt due to his acting but rather his bad choice in scriptsbr br with that in mind i can say that his debut film tarzan is one of his best films and probably his greatest performance as i mentioned it is effective becasue of the humaness he brings to the role and for how seriously the director writers and actors handle the material this is a far leap from the bmovie action adventures with johnny weismeller from the 1940s in fact i would hesitate to call it an action movie instead it is a serious drama that takes all of er burroughs material seriously showing tarzans quest to discover his real family in scotland after realizing that he doesnt fit in as a white ape he is torn in between his old family and his new one which includes a wonderful sir ralph richardson in his final role in an attempt to adapt to humans his ape instincts also kick in and he cant decide what he loves more his real family or the one that hes always known all in all it is a wonderful commentary on society and a wonderful character studybr br if nothing else it launched lambert into international stardom which continued will into the 1980s with films like highlander and he sicilian unfortunately it didnt last but just wait a whilehis latest career moves such as gideon and resurrection have proven that though he still have a long way to go hes a competent enough actor to be able to perhaps make a ahem comeback if hell just pick his roles betterbr br for now however heres the verdict on his first filmbr br  out of
