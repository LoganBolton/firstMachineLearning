where this movie is faithful to burroughs vision it is excellent where it departs from burroughs it is superb it is a tale of family of the seeking of a father by a real and emotional orphan lamberts speaking of one of the most anguished lines in all of cinema he was my father is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the most cynical critic not a perfect motion picture  the notorious overdubbing of mcdowells voice by glenn close is unconscionable and only explicable in terms of a very british error  but a fine if flawed masterpiece and a noble farewell to sir ralph richardson
