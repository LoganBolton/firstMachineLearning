especially by lambert this is the essential burroughs tarzan that i grew up reading when i was a kid i have read a few negative reviews on this film and couldnt help but wonder what their issue was they obviously didnt see the movie i did or they were expecting something that was more akin to the saturday afternoon serialsbr br this was the tarzan that was of the novel and the film makers should be applauded for tackling the source material and taking it seriously lambert was excellent i still think he is one of hollywoods most underrated actors this was a movie that he shines inbr br the photography and the apes done by rick baker both were amazing you definitely felt the since of the jungle the 2nd half tarzans attempt at being civilized really pulls you into the emotional conflict he had was forced to resolvebr br i highly recommend this film
