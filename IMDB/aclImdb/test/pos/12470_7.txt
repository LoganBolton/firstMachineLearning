this begins a series which ill hopefully keep up every weekend of films that came out during my childhood  in this case its one ive only managed to catch now it was clearly intended as the last word on the subject which basically had been debased to the level of hokum over the years however in its uncompromising striving for a seriousminded approach a sure measure of which is that the protagonist is never once referred to by the name hes been known all this time the world over the filmmakers rather lost track of the fact that the thing was intended primarily as entertainment consequently we get a decidedly staid representation of events  with more care given to meticulous period reconstruction than in providing a functional thematic environment for its mythic jungle hero even so christopher lambert rose to stardom  as did another debutante andie mcdowell playing his love interest named jane of course  with the title role which he handles creditably enough under the circumstances however ralph richardson to whom the film is dedicated this being his swansong steals every scene hes in as tarzans natural grandfather who in spite of showing obvious affection for his longlost kin cant bring himself to forget tradition in an effort to understand his predicament the hero in fact is much more comfortable interacting with primates even contriving after having gone back home to save his adoptive dad from captivity the film is otherwise very good to look at with cinematography by stanley kubrick regular john alcott no less features an appropriately grandiose score as well as remarkable makeup effects by rick baker  and while essentially disappointing as a tarzan outing retains considerable value nonetheless as a prestige picture of its day
