after i first saw this i thought wow this is the most spectacular movie visuallyspeaking ive ever seen since that time ive seen some that topped it but it still ranks as one of the best in that department im just disgusted the longawaited dvd was so poorly done the quality of this transfer hardly better than the vhs tapebr br the jungle scenes are filmed in cameroon and lush is the best adjective to describe what you see except for jungle sounds seeing is certainly almost everything in the beginning as there is almost no hearing no dialog until tarzan christopher lambert befriends ian holm and viceversaso be ready for that if you havent watched this film br br storywise all ill say is this is not the tarzan many of us came to know in johnny weismuller filmsbut thats not a complaint for those craving action and dont care about cinematography as i do you just have to get past that silent introduction period br br in this tarzan version our hero goes back to scotland his roots adapts to that environment for the most partand a little too quickly for credibility frankly and then returns to the jungle without jane this is supposedly more true to the tarzan books written by edgar rice burroughsbr br the special effects in here were done by rick baker one of the best in the business sharp dvd or not this is still a stunning film to view and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes
