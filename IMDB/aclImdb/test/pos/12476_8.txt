pretty good movie about a man and his wife who get caught up in murder and the police officer investigating the case it starts off marvelously but kind of hits a wall at a certain point were sure we know what happened then a tiny plot thread that seems at first like a red herring pops back up and disappoints still clouzots direction is great and the acting is quite good louis jouvet who also costarred in marcel carnés drôle de drame gives the best performance as the clever detective i wonder if the coen brothers were influenced by this film when they wrote fargo much like that film the police officer doesnt appear until nearly halfway through and then he becomes almost the focus of the film theres also a lot of droll comedy surrounding him although sometimes his methods seem sort of fascist
