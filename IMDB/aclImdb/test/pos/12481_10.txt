one of the best film i ever sawbr br the performance of louis jouvet is fantastic he really fill his part and this is wonderful hes such a good actor that you cant think of anyone else to take his part br br and both suzy delair and bernard blier are good as standard french people trying to defend themselves in the struggle born with a murderbr br the story is breathtaking and well built you can feel the ambiance of paris for that period which is about 193040 between two wars the clubs the old little buildings the neighborsbr br all those things contribute to make a great movie
