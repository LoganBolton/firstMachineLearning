first the obviousas a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama quay  is disconcerting straightly independent and a menace to banality jouvets aplomb is put to good use in a tough cop performance immediately noticeable by its vigor and exuberant force his antoine is not so much a man of intellect but a man of vast life experience and earthly instinct quay  is not subversive in the sense that todays and already yesterdays  philistines enjoy using the word it is clouzots most playful hour he tended to adapt steemans books in a satiric note its said that clouzot was a big reader of detective novels as a director clouzots firm hand is successful br br it is not a mystery or a thrillerbut a satirical look at a parisian couple and at the polices proceedings those accustomed with clouzots masterpiece les diaboliques might find slightly disconcerting the multiplicity of things styles elements in quay here clouzot speaks about many things about a couple and a hidden love story simone renants for blierabout the entertainments world and about old spinsters about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise etc there is a note of exuberancenot only in jouvets performance but also in the films conception br br quay is a realistic crime drama made as a satire it offers an outstanding performance by jouvet as a tough police inspector antoine is an old cop with an adventurous past he fought in africa but did not climb the ranks stair because of his independent behaviors he lives with his son a schoolboy at work antoine is tough and merciless an able inspector bitter intelligent and harsh it is a role of great gusto very picturesque jouvet composed his character of several defining traitshis clothes his expression his funny accent his brutality and that mocking air antoine is not made to look more clever than plausible when he interrogates blier antoine makes mistakes and his talent is presented like the talent we meet in real lifemixed with errors and lacunae and defects antoines talent is one that comes also from experience from daily observationits not the almost supernatural divinatory genius of almost all the famous detectivesbr br quay  is multifacetedit is a realistic crime drama and also a satire and a melodrama one can consider it among the first filmic forays into the legendary toughness of the french police long ago eastwoods and waynes harsh cops there was antoine br br the title is interesting suggesting that this is a movie about the police not about a case or a mystery br br as craftsmanship clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in france in the way that welles was quay  is very true to clouzots naturea sardonic comic sharp observations much psychology sharp unsparing irony the man was firstclass when he filmed somethinghe knew what to shoot what to choosesee the introductory scenes of this film with jenny lamours great stage success each scene is memorably exemplarily shot clouzots technical stylistic aptitudes were amazing his style is inventive satirical sharp extremely limpid ingenious br br jouvets style was exuberant powerful vehement some disliked it precisely for these features as he had been a great stage actor his movie style was deemed as too theatrical etc his antoine is a fine example of what was meant by composing a role by a composition br br jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomymuch like a menacing bird of preysomewhat like van cleefyet much subtler nobler and more intelligent and distinguished jouvet had this predatory ferocious air and it is useful here as he performs an old tough cop one of quay s sides is that it is a jouvet recital he is immediately recognizable identifiable by the quality of his play i see that many watching this flick do not know it is a jouvet moviewhich is an astounding quality in itself br br fresnay and jouvet are the two french actors that i admire the most the first one was revealed to me by a renoir drama the famous one while jouvet by a carné comedy i was charmed to see that clouzot gave leading roles to both of thembr br to end a word about steeman he wrote the novel used by clouzot who had previously adapted another steeman novel as a fresnay comedy steeman was an old school mystery writer in the wallace vein he became quickly outdated with the new hardboiled fashions when i was 11 i have read one of his thrillers and liked it much
