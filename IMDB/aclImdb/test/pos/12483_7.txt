this film is so lovingly made you want to be part of it forever the flics are straight but not without malice the goods are transparent and evildoers are hardly there even the cabaret are so naive theyll make you daydream with nostalgia in comparison to anything available on tv blier is fine if a bit one sided louis jouvet is perfect you just cant have a better copper he has the best line my dad cleaned other peoples dirt and i do the same susy delair is unbearable but i guess in part its the songs wardrobe and hairdo simone renant on the contrary makes a great femme fatale if a bit silent i didnt realize she may be a lesbian as imdb user dbdumonteil and others rightly suggest
