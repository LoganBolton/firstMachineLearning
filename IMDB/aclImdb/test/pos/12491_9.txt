this is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it the acting and writing are terrific and there are lots of great twists and turns in the plot as a french noir film its language is certainly a lot earthier than its american counterparts but to me this just added to the realism additionally i liked how nonglamorous everyone wasparticularly the husband and the lieutenant about the only negative and the reason the film gets a 9 and not a 10 is because there was a glaring plot hole like another famous french film dr√¥le de drame the confusion between the cops and the accused could easily have been settled in the beginning but the characters made rather stupid decisions for this you just need to suspend disbelief and keep watchingthe payoff is well worth the waitbr br this is simply one of the finest french films i have seen period
