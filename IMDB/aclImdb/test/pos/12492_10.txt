quai des orfevres directed by the brilliant henrigeorges clouzot is a film to treasure because it is one of the best exponents of french film making of the postwar years m clouzot adapting the steemans novel longtime defence shows his genius in the way he sets the story and in the way he interconnects all the characters in this deeply satisfying movie that as dbdumonteil has pointed out in this forum it demonstrates how influential cluzot was and how much the next generation of french movie makers are indebted to the master especially claude chabrolbr br the crisp black and white cinematography by armand thirard has been magnificently transferred to the criterion dvd we recently watched working with clouzot thirard makes the most of the dark tones and the shadows in most of the key scenes the music by francis lopez a man who created light music and operettas in france works well in the context of the film since the action takes place in the world of the music halls and night clubsbr br louis jouvet who is seen as a police detective is perfect in the part this was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a pillar of the french theater jouvet clearly understood well the mechanics for the creation of his police inspector who is wiser and can look deeply into the souls of his suspects and ultimately steals the show from the others in an unfair comment by someone in this page jouvets inspector is compared with peter falks columbo the television detective frankly and no disrespect to mr falk intended its like comparing a great champagne to a good house winebr br bernard blier is perfect as the jealous husband blier had the kind of face that one could associate with the man consumed with the passion his wife jenny lamour has awakened in him martineau is vulnerable and doesnt act rationally he is an easy suspect because he has done everything wrong as he finds in the middle of a crime he didnt commit but all the evidence points to the contrarybr br the other great character in the film is dora the photographer its clear by the way she interacts with jenny where her real interest lies simone renant is tragically appealing as this troubled woman and makes an enormous contribution to the film suzy delair playing jenny is appealing as the singer who suddenly leaps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like brignon the old lecherbr br the film is one of the best clouzot directed during his distinguished career and one that will live forever because the way he brought all the elements together
