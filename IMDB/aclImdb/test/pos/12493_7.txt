quai des orfevres takes too long getting going with clouzot so enamored of his backstage milieu that he is almost in danger of forgetting the story however once it does its clouzot at his best bertrand blier father of bertrand blier and costar of his buffet froid is the worldworn pianist who married beneath himself and who plans to kill the seedy studio mogul with designs on his wife only to find that someone has beaten him to it not only that but his carefully planned but clumsily executed alibi falls to pieces not least when a thief steals his car at the murder sceneÂ…br br the film really kicks into life with the arrival of luis jouvets police inspector a rather wonderful creation half alistair sim in green for danger and half worldweary maigret with better dialog in a neat running gag his investigation is constantly conducted at the top of his voice against chaos and noise whether it be the noisy typewriters of the police station or a loud rehearsal the police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation a wealth of chaotic and telling small details that makes steve bocchcos once revolutionary 80s us cop shows look like antiquated museum pieces by comparison br br if suzy delair is a rather unconvincing femme fatale the supporting cast more than compensate with the beautiful simone renant a standout as the lesbian photographer in love with her from afar and constantly mistaken for bliers lover by delair and other interested parties only jouvet similarly unlucky with women understands and genuinely sympathises with great black and white photography by armand thirard this is a terrific little thriller with a nice twist ending and a lovely scene with a cab driver reluctantly identifying renant in a police station trivia note pierre larquey who played the playfully philosophical dr vorzet in le corbeau turns up in smaller roles as a cabdriver in both quai and les espionsbr br the criterion dvd is quite superb  great picture quality plus an illuminating extract from a french tv show featuring interviews with clouzot blier and renant
