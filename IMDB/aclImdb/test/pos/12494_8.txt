and i love it wonder showzen will pick up a cult audience and once its canceled the dvd sales will go though the roof this is a very funny show in its own ways its a parody of childrens shows namely sesame street our puppet characters consist of chauncy a yellow furry monster with a hat whose our host clarence is a blue lizard like thing that does his own segments where he goes out on the streets him is a weird dog like thing that refers to himself in the third person wordsworth is the smart one whose brain always shows then theres the newscaster and the pink puppet its a very funny show not really as nasty as youd expect but more the situations they take 7 year olds out on the street tell them what to say and have them make mean jokes that they dont understand my favorite segments are clarences videos especially when somebody doesnt want to be filmed i prefer tv funhouse which was a similar show but this is still a very funny show that i hope lasts for years to comebr br my rating  14 out of  30 mins tv ma
