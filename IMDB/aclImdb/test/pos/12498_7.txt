im torn about this show while most parts of it i found to be hilarious other parts of it i found to be stupid and simply shock for shock sake the off the wall parody of some of the cartoons are brilliant as indeed are a lot of the scenes with the children however i dont think its clever getting little children to say rude things its not that i think oh poor children theyre being exploited  its just that its really not clever its something that anyone could do therefore making it as simple and pointless as making a paper airplane in order to make this show better they would have to stick to the natural responses from children which i think can be funnier than the scripted at time br br by far the funniest part of wonder showzen is clarence the blue puppet who wonders around the streets talking to and annoying strangers its really funny and its mostly improvised seeing him in a long scene about the importance of patience test the patience of an extremely patient man was by far the funniest scene in my opinion br br you should watch this show though because all in all its very funny even if it is stupid at times
