the kid  at 39 years old russel duritz has a life that most men would envy  he has a great job is respected and feared has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money but everything comes at a cost in this case no social life no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone he just needs someone to show him the waybr br as i watched the movie i kept wondering why disney didnt pass this film on to miramax  not because its particularly daring or edgy but because it is clearly a movie for adults this is exacerbated by the marketing campaign which is clearly targeting children  it is lumped in with trailers for rugrats the movie and pokemon 2000 arent they passe yet but i quibblebr br i was impressed by the sensitive treatment of the subject matter  rather than the typical male midlife crisis that involves some pathetic sap buying a porsche convertible and acting like a moron willis character undertakes some serious introspection and takes stock of his life his guide on this journey of selfdiscovery is himself at age 8 they never explain how rusty arrives and frankly i didnt care young rustys innocence and unbridled optimism give him a distinct advantage in divining the truth  he sums up russells job as an image consultant thusly you teach people how to lie and pretend to be something they arent in order for a good script to succeed however you need actors to bring it to life not a problem herebr br although willis has thrice ignored wc fields warnings about starring with children or animals he has lucked out once again meshing as well comedically with breslin as he did dramatically with osment willis manages to balance russells cutthroat powerbroker traits with vulnerability and confusion without becoming ridiculous breslin meanwhile gives a dead on portrayal of a kid from everyones childhood  the one that always stuck out for some reason and got picked on we also get two bonus performances lily tomlin is great as russells levelheaded assistant and jean smart is perfect as an insightful charming anchorwoman i loved her in guineverebr br the kid is charming heavy and real and it will appeal to adults of all ages
