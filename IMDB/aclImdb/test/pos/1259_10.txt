this is a totally awesome movie if you havent seen it yet you damn well should sure the plot is slow to develop the special effects are laughable the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed but as wrestler ddp would say thats not a bad thingthats a good thing everything about this movie is hilarious especially if you get the dubbed version which has even worse actors its countless laughs until you get to the end yearning for the sequel where the mummy fights wrestling women thus i give it ten stars unless youre one of those discriminating and intelligent people with good taste who likes only high quality films of the highest calibre i recommend this utterly monkeydellic movie
