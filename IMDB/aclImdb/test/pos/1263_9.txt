this film is superb it has the same lowbudget first film feel of pi and clerks but has the style of memento also by writerdirector christopher nolan the score sound effects photography and editing are almost memento prototypes and the story shows that christopher nolan is best when writing and directing dont be put off by the lowbudget look and acting or even the short length of the film and just watch it
