im amazed that memento which is an excellent flick is so wellregarded in the top 250 and this one doesnt even appear what the hell is that to be honest  when this movie ended my kneejerk reaction was that this movie is better than memento after the euphoria of the fabulous ending wore off i concluded that they are equal in their excellence i am just confused about why its not in the top 50 along with memento im going to venture a guess that sadly its because its in black and white or because again sadlythat the characters all have british accents sadly because that is no reason to not appreciate a great movie like thisbr br im telling you that if you loved memento you will love following as well brilliant
