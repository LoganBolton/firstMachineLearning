there are two things that i noticed in this film this is not a spoiler just a mistake in storytelling when cole takes bill to his first be he finds the box as soon as cole finds it he says the box everyones got a box a minute later just before he dumps the contents on the floor he says were actually very fortunate you dont see these oftenbr br observation 2 spoiler alertbr br i had to watch the thing three times i couldnt figure a couple of things out then i watched the chronological version and saw that they were having flash backs from the latter to the previous during the time changes so at some points we were actually watching three different times in about 1 min of wall timebr br that was a good thing because i dont know how many more times i could watch it before returning it to netflixbr br color me obsessive
