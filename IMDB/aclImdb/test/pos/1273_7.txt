if christopher nolan had made memento before following then all of the flaws in following would have been corrected in memento nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly we were able to tell when it was the past when its current etc however nolan experimented with it a little and it just doesnt work although he had a small budget and couldnt use color which is one way memento worked it was just too hard to distinguish between time on the dvd is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order i intended to write my review after watching it so hopefully it would make more sense but of course it wasnt workingbr br you cant blame nolan for not coming up with original ideas a young man bill jeremy theobald is bored so he decides to follow random people on the street he finds one cobb alex haw that particularly interests him soon bill becomes friends with cobb and goes with him as he breaks into houses and robs them then a saucy young blond lucy russell enters and the movie becomes even weirder from therebr br the ending of following is one of the most shocking endings ive seen sure fight club had an amazing ending but the way that followings ending played out was amazing i felt like someone had smacked me on the head and given me a concussion nolan has a thing for making good endings well maybe not i could guess insomnias from a mile away and can really construct a great story following may not be the easiest to follow or look at but its such a finely crafted original story with a shocker ending that youll probably want to watch all of its 70 minutes againbr br my rating 710br br rated r for language and some violence
