following is a littleknown 1998 british film which was made with a budget of £8000 and has a running time of 70 minutes when watching it youd never expect its director to go on to make it in hollywood and become one of the most acclaimed and celebrated directors of the 21st century  well everybody has to start somewhere i supposebr br the director of following as you probably already know is englishman christopher nolan who directly after following would go on to direct the criticallyacclaimed independent film memento a few years later he would be hired by warner bros to direct the new batman series which further brought him acclaim and so on and so forth my point is everybody has to start somewhere  even if its not in the most astounding debut  and christopher nolan introduces himself to the world in 1998 with followingbr br when watching it i couldnt help but draw resemblances to another directorial debut avantgarde auteur david lynchs eraserhead following is not a surrealist psychological horror film in that sense but the similarities are noticeable most notable its shot in grainy blackandwhite and has an atmosphere about it that makes it unique its hard to describe in words but it loosely resembles the smoky atmosphere youd find in the film noirs of old hence it can be said that following is a contemporary film noir or a neonoir overall its an amalgamation of that and a psychological thriller and the story is most appropriate to these two genresbr br the main character is nameless and the movies title stems from an early obsessivecompulsive trait he possessed  randomly picking out people on the street and following them sometimes even for hours on end during one of these stalking expeditions the main character becomes noticed by one of the people he is following and is confronted turns out that the confronter is a man who is willing to befriend our narrator and he introduces himself his name is cobb and hes a petty burglar who invites the narrator to follow him on his burglariesbr br from there the main character becomes swept up in cobbs world and he becomes embroiled in crime passion and violence as he gets more and more intimate with cobb following is not so much a character study but instead a film which follows the tumultuous relationship between these two main characters and the devastating ramifications it has on our narrator nolan succeeds in making the film resemble a film noir and emulates the respective atmosphere wellbr br as a thriller following is taut and atmospheric however as a film in general its somewhat of a disappointment if not that then one could definitely call it underwhelming the entire film is shot in a nonchronological and nonlinear fashion and it makes the story and filmexperience unique to some extent  this style has been done so many times now its almost commonplace technique  and the story itself is unique to some extentbr br however following is ultimately underwhelming for the entire film and is disappointingly unspectacular the story calls for more  more action more suspense and more thrills  but it becomes too embroiled in its own storyline and instead focuses on creating an intricate story following does succeed in doing that but without any other elements its a film noir that doesnt quite work out its got a sense of emptiness which isnt enormous but still noticeable nonetheless furthermore the films shocking revelation at the end  almost a mandatory convention in film noirs  is one that makes us feel cheated its unpredictable and comes out of nowhere but in relation to the story its disappointing as it essentially makes the preceding scenes and the entire film seem like an enormous waste of timebr br but the positives far outweigh the negatives and in the end following turns out to be a flawed but satisfying film yes everybody has to start somewhere christopher nolan does it with following and he does it in a fine manner a quiet meek but fine manner its not the most astounding movie and it isnt quite worthy of the accolades the director would go on to receive in the following decade but its still a good film nonetheless when singling out following you find a wellmade taut and atmospheric thriller one which lacks noticeable nuance or innovative style but still manages to grip audiences nonetheless
