given christopher nolans string of successful films its a no brainer for me to want to check out his filmography watch his debut feature which is shot in black and white back in england running less than 70 minutes long done with little budget but containing all the hallmarks that has made him a master filmmaker and storytellerbr br though short the film is no less gripping with its meandering plot that will leave you guessing because the premise doesnt even scratch the surface of this tale which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the narratives structure and characterization as told we follow a writer wannabe called bill jeremy theobald who starts a habitual obsession with following random people he fancies on the streets in a voyeuristic manner which at first could be conceived as research before he starts to make up his own rules and break thembr br he meets up with charismatic cobb alex haw who turns out to be a robber with peculiar sensibilities and modus operandi and soon finds himself hooked with hanging out with him as they go about breaking and entering and speculating about their victims livelihood as does the pursuit of a femme fatale blond lucy russell a mobsters moll who rejects his every advancebr br told in a nonlinear fashion which comes with scenes that dont quite add up in the beginning this sets the film up for multiple viewings as you study just how nolan sustains that suspense and intrigue with you as the audience expecting and wanting more which gets duly delivered there are enough twists here which spins the film into a dizzying crescendo where loose ends begin to come together and the brilliance of the stellar story start to shine throughbr br its also amazing how as a first feature shot on the cheap that something that clever and sophisticated can be conceived from his own experience in being burgled with nolan involved in every stage of production from writing to shooting producing and directing having worked on the project for a year since shoots can only happen on weekends i guess heres an example of a successful filmmakers humble roots which should serve as inspiration and spur new filmmakers out there now ill patiently wait for christopher nolans inception due out later this year whose trailer is already such a tease
