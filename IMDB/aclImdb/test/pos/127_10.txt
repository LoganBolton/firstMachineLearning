previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the films plot details than i could what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful in every sense  emotionally visually editorially  just gorgeousbr br if you like movies that are wonderful to look at and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of artbr br on a scale of 1 to 10 id give it about an 875 the only reason i shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece if you are in the mood for a really artistic very romantic film then its a 10 i definitely think its a mustsee but none of us can be in that mood all the time so overall 875
