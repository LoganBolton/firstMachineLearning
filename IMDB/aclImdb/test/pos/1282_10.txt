even with only 6000 bucks and a cast of parttime actors christopher nolan was a master nolan is in my opinion the next great and our first taste of nolan doesnt contradict thatbr br none of the problems that constantly plaque and discredit the low budget independent picture haunt nolan and crew our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver and engage us in this story in all honesty i think following is nolans best screenplay because it is the one he had the most control over its a beautifully imagined film it takes us into a world where we dont feel limited by the constraints of budget the dialogue and atmosphere is bold and intelligentbr br nolans trademark method of telling the story out of continuity is applied for the first time here and here it is done in a way that throws the story full out at you with memento and the prestige you have to think a bit to truly get a complete grasp on the genius but nolan doesnt try to confuse people with his prototype film we can distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist this method of telling a story is both creative and engaging i am glad that nolan has had so much success with it because his films become more than what they could be with this method the pay offs in the prestige and memento would not have been thrilling at all if the movie was told in a conventional format this idea has been done with moderate success before but nolan has truly made it his ownbr br the script here is nolans finest i had some doubts about his writing abilities i all ways imagined that his brother jonathon was the writing talent but he proves me wrong with following it is a thought provoking story which makes interesting observations of people and how they function cobbs assessments about burglarizing and how it can lead you to discover what makes people tick actually sounds plausiblebr br my only real complaint is the camera work gets shaky at times but it doesnt take away anything from the story or the actingbr br following is the first film of the man who will personify 21st century filmmaking at its finest
