christopher nolan had his goals set on following in a very narrow direction and in that direction he pulled off something that reminded me of the kind of great little povertyrow movies the likes of ullmer directed back in the 40s only this time hes able to implement touches of homage things like black and white photography a given due to the shoestring budget but also essential to the dark crevices these characters inhabit and casting of the actors the john doe lead the slick male counterpart and the beautifulinagritty way femme fatale while keeping it in the realm of the 90s underground indie where for several thousand dollars and specific choices in locations and music and such anything could be possible that and as well in the filmnoir mood nolan also puts together a cunning web of a plot maybe even more so than memento where the latter was a work of a psychology unfolding by way of a plot enriched by looking to the past inch by inch here the nonlinear structure serves the purpose of showing how far someone like bill can go through as dark a path as cobb only in an environment where keeping on your toes is not for someone whos not really twisted and into the deeper mind games cobb isbr br of course the whole act of following someone becomes the main thrust of the story and going into it i wasnt even sure where it would lead if it might be some kind of stream of consciousness ala slacker where nolan would lead his character along to one urban british person to another but the establishment of the ties of bill to cobb are done in a quick and excellent way as we see right when cobb approaches bill at the caf√© to ask what hes doing following him tells almost all we need to know about both that and the first robbery he brings him along for what seems to soon be a good score on the horizon is really all one big setup by cobb and his lady just called the blonde maybe a tooobvious homage to noir but why carp but this is revealed in a way that actually truly had me guessing as the manipulation of the narrative worked all the more to arouse questions not so much of why but of how the density is brought out all the greater due to the actors understanding of their essential points as characters with alex haw being brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely mask his deep ideas about what it is to really take pleasure in a burglary and theobald with that demeanor of someone who can never be as smart as he is in what he really does but is more intelligent in that naive way that stands no chance in the dank environment such as this russell almost makes it too easy even with a face that would send ana savage shaking her headbr br meanwhile nolan is also on the ball with his style as a cameraman keeping nothing in that doesnt add to ambiance and suspense with the fadeinfadeouts not too quick to leave a lasting impression but enough to add to the thiscouldleadanywhere logic of the script he follows it in handheld form as if he knows where his limitations lie and yet is fantastic at keeping the essentials closeups when need be one i loved is russells face in a small mirror and a fairly simple techno track that never detracts sometimes as mentioned the line between seeing something in presentday and seeing something that is as everlasting as a solid pulp story of lowlevel criminals with mindgames and moral ambiguity is always never totally clear which for me is practically irresistible in its dark way simply put this is one of the great calling cards ive seen from a filmmaker in recent years and should hopefully be something that future fans of nolans other work can look forward to to discovering or even to those who think that noir has gone to the rapidediting and biggunfiring dogs of the mainstream even in independent films its a bright little 71 minutes
