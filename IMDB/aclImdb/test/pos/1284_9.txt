bill jeremy theobald is an inspiring writer who hasnt gotten anything published as of yet bill also has an odd and strange habit he likes to follow peoplebr br bill picks out some stranger in the streets diner or on the subway metro and follows them as if he were their shadow maybe bill does this to help him in inspiring himself to write the great novel that hes been dreaming about or get an article of his get printed in a major magazine maybe its because it fills bills lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by his paying attention to him or her or maybe it gives bill someone to look after and care about and be responsible for besides himself bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone  after you follow him or her to their home or place of work you stop br br one day bill follows cobb alex haw home and instead of following his rule of stopping he still keeps following cobb bill will soon realize how right he was with that rule he set for himself in following people and at the same time how wrong he was by breaking it br br amazingly good lowbudget movie made by christopher noland in 1998 before he hit it big in hollywood with his groundbreaking and original motion picture classic momento some two years later that has already become a major cult movie br br following is actually a much better movie then momento because its a conventional and easy to follow story compared to momentos which was at first confusing and then when you realize what the movie is telling you in its backward storyline very complicated whats makes following so much better is just by it being simple but at the same time brainy in its affect on those who watch it the movie is far more direct as well as devastating and you dont have to see it over and over to get just what it was trying to tell them like momento did following is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising as well as simply manipulated ending if you watch the movie again and notice the clues that youll ever seebr br made with an unbelievably small budget of 600000 thats less then what most hollywood movies budgets out for coffeebreaks with a noname cast in black and white and just over one hour 71 minutes long hollywood as well as the motion picture industry outside of hollywood can learn a lot from chris noland in how someone with nothing more then talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases cant make an intelligent and at the same time penetrating film with next to nothing in money and no big name stars
