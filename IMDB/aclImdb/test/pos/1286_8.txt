great film no gratuitous gimmicks like in most hollywood films everything supported the suspense of the plot bw gave it a basic nofrills feel also in short it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and castbr br following serves as an interesting contrast to memento characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively in that sense both reminded me somewhat of in the company of men also highly recommendable one difference between nolans two films is that memento was a little easier for me to follow given that the bw scenes progress in a constant chronological direction and so do those in color i dont think that was true of following where scenes seemed to be shown at random if you have the choice between vcr and dvd id highly recommend dvd since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in chronological order not just in the scrambled albeit ingenuous order presented by nolan it also makes it easier upon a second viewing to piece the order together for yourself if you want tobr br as another viewer noted one of the best things about both this movie and memento is that none of the cast were famous they were characters not bigname actors who brought in personas developed in other moviesbr br given certain similarities in the plots i wonder if memento is sort of a remake of following but intended to reach a bigger audience like edward burns made shes the one in the mold of  and with largely the same cast as  the brothers mcmullan
