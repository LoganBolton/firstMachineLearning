i just finished watching following and i thought it was great i rated it 8 out of 10 i plan on watching it again with the directors commentary and then again in chronological orderbr br i rented this movie because of my fascination of christopher nolans more recent movie memento following has some similarities this movie was probably the blueprint for memento even the music in some parts is very similarbr br shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel the story and dialogue is really good the performance of the actors is believablebr br christopher nolan made this movie on a really low budget i look forward to his next release insomnia a big budget movie with my favourite actor al pacino
