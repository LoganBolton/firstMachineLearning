christopher nolans first directorial effort a year before he did memento and this is almost as brilliant as that classic he uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell his story and its a very clever onebr br bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what theyre all about one day he follows this man cobb who turns the tables and confronts bill who breaks down and confesses what hes up to br br cobb is a burglar and he takes bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them br br but theres an ulterior motive for cobb nurturing this relationship and it all ties in very smartly at the end no i wont spoil it but this is a very cool movie and im beginning to think christopher nolan is a geniusbr br if you like suspense films with surprise endings this one is a must see
