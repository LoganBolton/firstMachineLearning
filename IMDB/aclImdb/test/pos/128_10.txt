its worth boning up on the hindu pantheon before watching this film three main female deities  wise sita nurturing lakshmi and kali the transformer  as well as three main male deities  grave rama playful krishna and shiva the ender  are all alluded to knowing the folklore as surely every indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the presentday story in fact one folktale is enacted first on stage as part of a lesson in spirituality and then in the movies real life fire speaks out against the misogyny and homophobia in the society to which its producers are native and it does so with a beauty that weaves the message into multiple levels of the viewers awareness making it a deeply satisfying presentation this is the finest film ive seen in the past ten years very highly recommended
