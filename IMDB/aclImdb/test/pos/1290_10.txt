christopher nolans first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out shot on a micro budget of 6000 this is a student film with real class the film is shot in black and white and features people who you assume are friends of nolans appearing in the movie this is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good you could see jeremy theobald and alex haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they havent since this was made 6 years agobr br nolans thriller much like memento does not play chronologically it shifts the scenes around much like pulp fiction the writing is fantastic it is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting i thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellentbr br for a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all this is so good it is superior to most that hollywood studios offer and nolan after three films this the superior memento and the not quite as good but still excellent insomnia has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times i cant wait for batmanbr br this film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch it is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising i also thought that the score from david julyan was also excellent very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it he has gone on to compose nolans other films br br overall i would recommend this i intend to get all of nolans films this is a low budget gem br br
