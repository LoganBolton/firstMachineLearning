i was geared up to not like this movie and the first 10 minutes or so did nothing to allay my fears it starts off with 2 high school gangs squaring off against each other with bad kungfu a scenario found in countless other korean films hohum add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote he was cool which was barely passable and well i thought i was in for a nondescript 2 hoursbr br but dont give up so quickly a romance of their own was directed by taegyun kim who also did volcano high which i thought was loads of fun anyway romance of their own soon takes a turn much for the better a high school girl just having moved to seoul finds herself in the middle of attention from two prospective suitors each guy has his own merit and it is not clear which one if either would be the right pickbr br what follows is not your usual teen love triangle the emotions are complex and while you may not agree with certain choices or actions as the film develops you can certainly understand why the characters make thembr br the movie asks questions of the characters and the audience who does one choose at what point is one obligated to even make a choice and is it unfair to one if it seems he is being strung along after you or your heart has made a choice how do you react and how should you react when new information comes up that sheds new light on the situation there is one scene near the end that is very subtle but perfectly captures what i think would be a reallife reaction instead of overthetop movie reaction the subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed basically he doesnt know what to make of things instead of having him act out something or look all gapemouthed dumbstruck he just stares off at some fixed point unable to react or say anything at all its like someone just pulled the plug on him his reaction rang true to me and i appreciated the scenebr br like most korean films there is a mix of action bravado slapstick and melodrama korean films often take abrupt turns see sex is zero for a great example which can be quite a shock for the uninitiated go ahead and initiate yourself with this one like it love it or hate it i think most viewers will be able to relate to and appreciate the characters actions and reactions
