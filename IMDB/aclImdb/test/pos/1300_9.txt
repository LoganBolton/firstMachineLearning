lets face itbr br this movie is incredibly clich√© as korean romance dramas and movies go first of all theres a pair of longlost siblings one of which falls in love with the other second theres a notsopopular girl and two gorgeous popular guys who fall for and fight over her third one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease which eventually takes his lifebr br still i like this moviebr br without the right actors this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel but because the actors fit the roles perfectly the movie is engrossingi honestly couldnt stop watching kang dong won despite his pretty face gives an awesome heartrending performance not to mention lee chung ah and jo han sun plus all the supporting actorsbr br id definitely recommend this movie to everyone
