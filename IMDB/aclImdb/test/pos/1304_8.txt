i just found the entire 3 dvd set at walmart in the bargain bin for 550 so i thought i would take another look total of 13 hours to watch it all 26 episodes i was born in 1948 and saw most of them on tv in the sixties many independent stations repeated them for many yearsbr br better than i expected actually time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of its creators and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all the allied fighting men and women more abstract and arty than a straight forward documentary but very truthful in its depiction of the causes and final results of wwii that war was greatly dependent on sea transportation and the final victory was dependent on who achieved the final mastery of the worlds oceans the allies were the ones who were able to do itbr br interesting too to see how they try to strike a balance between big events and the individual soldiers and sailors that made them happen the score is impressive if a bit too much by todays standards i read somewhere that robert russell bennett contributed just as much as richard rodgers to final score i imagine that rodgers provided all the major themes and it was up to bennett to fit them to the images great jobbr br should be seen by every ruler or potential ruler a warning to tyrants that wars are eventually won by ideals determination and the supplies to back them up logistics their quality and delivery will determine the eventual victors the allies outproduced and surpassed the material quality of the axis attacked their very source in the process and insured their eventual defeatbr br sorry to see that the producer henry salomon lived a very short life imdbs facts were rather skimpy i have to find out more about him he did a few more outstanding documentaries before his early death might have more to say at a later timebr br trivia i had all 3 lp records made of the background music pretty good overall unfortunately the producers decided to add sound effects to the last one relegating immediately to just novelty status rather than for serious music listening too bad too because it contained some interesting but more minor themes in the series silly stuff like 16 inch guns firing torpedoes being fired bulldozers planesjust for kids mainlybr br rsgre
