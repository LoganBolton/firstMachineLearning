definitely worth renting good clean family entertainment my 4 and 5 yearolds and i loved it kept them on the edge of their seats i recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this as it can be quite suspenseful for them its not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children and so this is a rare find some of the acting  realism isnt quite there at times or maybe is a little corny but children dont seem to notice or care they love it parts are predictable but other parts are not  like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are the movie doesnt have any really scarycreepy stuff and so i doubt it will give children nightmares it does inspire children to dream which is something we need to encourage and foster more in our children rent and be blessed
