this film is titled junior pilot here on imdb but final approach at netflix go figure the movie is a delight for both the target youth audience and for adults who can suspend their maturity long enough to watch this film through the eyes of their own youth for the adult the story is quite predictable and perhaps trite and melodramatic whereas the tale may seem new and creative to youngsters who have not yet seen or read many films or books with such a story linebr br in any case credit must be given to the films creators particularly the director james becket and the cinematographer denis maloney for making this most entertaining and visually interesting film the cutaways to the young protagonist rickys fantasy thoughts are hilarious as well as delightfully filmedbr br the young actors give uniformly believable performances seemingly quite invested in their rolessilly as many scenes are jordan garrett plays the protagonist ricky with quite well having excellent camera presence jeffrey tedmori creates a delightfully soft and sensitive shashi who of all ridiculous things thrives on hot sauce skyler samuels and adam cagley give solid performances as wellbr br as is typical of his always fine acting larry miller creates a solid parental figure around which the childrens partreal partfantasy world revolves compared to his fatherfigure the other major adult roles appear to be shallow and onedimensional intentionally and quite humorously so to be surebr br this movie is a simplistic youthtargeted story of course yet it is quite entertaining perhaps repeatedly so to the targeted youth crowd but also for at least one viewing by adults who retain the ability to view such a film from their onceyouthful perspective
