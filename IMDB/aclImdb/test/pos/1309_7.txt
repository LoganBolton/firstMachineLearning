ive just watched this with my three children  12yrs boy 10yrs boy and 8yrs girl and this film was good old fashioned family action adventure although definitely aimed at the kid market id say 5 to 13it was certainly watchable and as a parent it is a pleasure to find a movie that appeals to a broad range of ages whilst still being suitable for the whole family to watch  particularly younger childrenbr br the story revolves around ricky a bit of a nerd with a vivid imagination this can definitely be seen in his daydream sequences who foils a kidnapping and major art theft while on onboard a flight to washington for a school trip rickys dad is an airplane mechanic so ricky not only knows the structure of the aircraft inside out but is also a topgun on his computer flight simulator this comes in handy when the pilot and copilot are out cold through a series of misadventures and there is noone left to fly the plane i dont want to give away any more of the plot
