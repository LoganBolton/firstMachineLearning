mishima a life in four chapters is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative ease it is based on the life of controversial japanese author yukio mishima who committed suicide in the 1970s it is not really a biopic  at least not one in the traditional sense  but an exploration of mishimas iconoclastic oeuvre the film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unembroidered totally engaging manner paul schrader makes you sympathize with mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work it doesnt quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it an added bonus as we see mishimas fury over the lack of tradition in a morally vacant modern society schrader gives us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and execution in cinema john baileys cinematography is spectacularly good the grandiosity of composer philip glass work is perfectly suited for the project mishima is the best film ive seen this year so far
