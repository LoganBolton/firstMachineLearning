the only pure life is one that ends with a signature in bloodbr br so says mishima anyway a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author the life of one of japans most celebrated literary voices is told from three perspectives his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a japanese military base and commit ritual suicideshown in color flashbacksshown in black and white and scenes from his novelsshown in a kind of dreamy technicolor set design somewhere between traditional noh theater and the wizard of oz these stories are often told at the same time but are edited to reinforce the slow fusing of mishimas life with his fictions until the endor the beginning when like the ancient samurai he so admires he will be at a balance of pen and sword when his words and actions are the same and he is a full and pure beingbr br paul schrader wrote the screen play for taxi driver and directed cat peoplea bizarre erotic horror film which left strange impressions on me as a boy and in mishima he comes closest to making a really excellent filmbr br whats interesting is to watch the poet the homosexual the shy and awkward man with a low body image who overstates his tuberculosis to get of of ww2 of which he seems forever ashamed become a body building samurai obsessed asexual media phenomena all the while still writing prolific amounts of novels plays and short storiesbr br a short and sweet version is to say mishima has no father and becomes obsessed with masculinity beauty sex and self destruction in some tragic attempt to feel connected to something bigger than himself that he was always missing watching him with his fellow suicidal cadets you see him happy delivering his big paternal speech giving orders and loving the controluntil the speech itself the point where pen and sword meet of course this ignores the subtlety of the story telling craft here which makes this transformation so natural and remarkable br br though the story fascinating at times really isnt this movies greatest success the cinematography performances editingmusicby philip glass and set designs are really what make this worth seeing and more than a traditional biopicbr br one day i will pick up a mishima book he does seem to have an ear for prose and for staging ideas but for now im satisfied with the filmbr br those interested in japanese literature and postwar culture should check out fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions should enjoy as well
