mishima is one of the greatest films ever made now i think paul schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time but i dont really like the films hes directed of what ive seen with the exception of this and affliction but this is an amazing disturbing and highly 3dimensional character study it follows the life of yukio mishima japans most celebrated writer combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories i dont know how but paul schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way the acting is great so is the photography and a perfect score by philip glass although confusing the first viewing this is one of the few films that becomes richer with each viewing truly an underrated gem of a film
