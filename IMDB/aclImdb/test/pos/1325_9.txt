the first season told pretty much how all elements of the marine corps would operate ie ground air helicopters and jets as a team thats the season i give the high rating to true there are still a lot of liberties taken in season 1 but the stories were more believablebr br the subsequent seasons were a gawdawful attempt of melrose place meets top gun br br i was a marine stationed at miramar at the time and i remember them shooting the show around the san diego area i got to talk to rod rowland and james brolinbr br rowlands character was good to gobr br brolins character was good in the first season only for some reason he slacked off after the first ep of the second seasonbr br if you want to see a little of how the marine air ground team operates then season one is the one to watchbr br if youre into melrose place and soap opera like plots with an attempt to merge them into top gun then see the last two seasons
