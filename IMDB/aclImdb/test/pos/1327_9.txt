i heard that after the first oceans movie the sequels begin to go downhill i believe that this is not the caseat least not for this film this movie is even better than the first film the original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed terry benedicts casinos now benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks to do that they must do a couple heists in europe to get the moneybr br the acting is very good the allstar cast exceeded expectations matt damon brad pitt and catherine zetajones were probably the best in this filmbr br there are some confusing moments in this film but that does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments anyway this movie is only made for harmless funbr br overall this is a great heist movie i rate this movie 910
