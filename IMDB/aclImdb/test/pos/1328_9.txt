oceans twelve is probably better than oceans eleven i know most people would disagree but i actually liked it more after three years it was good seeing the gang return the reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around i see why they stole from benedictandy garcia in the last film this film they have a bit more motivation the second time around oceans twelve is more entertaining and cooler than oceans eleven with a funny cameo by topher grace saying i just walked in that new dennis quaid movie and other things i think oceans twelve is probably the best in the seriesbr br the plot a year or so after oceans twelve terry benedictthe guy they robbed in the last film is back and says that if oceans eleven doesnt pay him back the money they stole hes going to call the cops so danny ocean and the gang go to europe where rusty meets his old cop girlfriend isabelle after she meets him again she begins to follow them around also the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they arebr br with many funny scenes like when tessjulia roberts goes to europe and pretends to be julia roberts oceans twelve is a pretty clever film its cooler funnier and more entertaining than oceans eleven
