with a cast like this i knew the acting would be amazing still i was cautious as i always am of sequels would it sustain the feeling of the first film could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of oceans 11 well never know because they didnt try at least not in the way i expected instead they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre if you want a gripping logical heist dont watch this if you want a good laugh with witty dialogue quirky characters and an absolutely genius scene where julia roberts has to impersonate herself then youll love oceans 12
