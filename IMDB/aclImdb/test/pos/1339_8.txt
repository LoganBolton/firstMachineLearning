this is a tough film to review since several factors need to be taken into account lets filter the more judgmentalok are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer can you withstand an independent lowbudget film are you objective enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look well if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one this film is an almost 100 accurate dramatization of dahmers adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an autobiography it isnt a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer 2001 was the movie begins with dahmer played quite convincingly by carl crew sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment his thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a pasttense narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmers psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder almost 20 times we get to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life it isnt anyones fault but dahmers that 17 people died but being a criminal psychology student i was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented truthfully in this film you see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain you do see two deaths that i remember one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid while you dont see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low you will see the results there is a prop hand and head or two but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesnt look to be exploitive besides these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible although acceptable they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing the film actually concludes before dahmers death in 1994 due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior thats about the only big difference from the real story and the information that remains is as ive stated very true to the facts the film quality could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet and the acting of several characters is a bit hammy but its not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of americas most remembered serial killers i think its safe to say the film is memorable as well and i respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner aided by a thoroughly excellent carl crew as dahmer
