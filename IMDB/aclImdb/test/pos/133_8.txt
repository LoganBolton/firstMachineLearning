spoiler alert dont read on unless youre prepared for some spoilersbr br i think this film had a lot beneath its shell besides the apparent connections with oldboy and parkwooks other films an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric physical actionbr br the main actor kangho song is terrific in the r√¥le of the priest sanghyeon  coincidentally sang means blood in some languages  who truly loved taeju played by okbin kim their relationship reminds me a lot of that between martin sheen and sissy spacek in badlands where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her fingerbr br their relationship is one thing but the girls mother is entirely different while moving she is stiff onedimensional and taut but paralysed she says all through not moving or through the wink of an eyebr br parkwook has really really mastered his cinematography in this film and owes a lot to stanley kubrick there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catchbr br the music is quite stock using mostly strings to accompany the main thespians monoreaction its a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is while he does very little and loses at that he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot while his loveinterest says and does a lot her actions display very little thought behind it in my humble opinionbr br all in all a very disturbing film that is not made for action which isnt even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days its magnificent and repellant at the same time
