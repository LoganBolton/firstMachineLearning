this was one of my favorite shows when i was a kid it had it allmusic stories a talking squirrel and chuckling daisies i wanted to be one of those hippie chicks singing and swinging on a swing im 35 and i grew up in south jersey but we got three new york channels with our cable hookup and i think it was on channel 11 they just dont make shows like this anymore i know that makes me sound really old and it blows my mind that i grew up with only 9 channels on our tv but i could always find something cool to watch ive only talked to one other person who actually heard of and watched this show shes three years younger than me and she grew up in north jersey i would love to see this series on dvd so i could show it to my 5 year old daughter and she could see what silly but great stuff her mom used to watch i just found a vhs tape of a few episodes and a music cd from the show on ebay and i bought them right up even though they were a little pricey i cant wait to get them to relive the great memories
