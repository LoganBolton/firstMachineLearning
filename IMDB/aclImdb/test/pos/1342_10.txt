i grew up in new york and this show came on when i was fouryearsold i had halfday kindergarten and this was on wpix channel 11 in the afternoon i just loved the music and stories and remember humming them around the house when playingbr br i just saw part of an episode on youtube and for a moment i could remember how it felt watching those shows as a small child i of course stopped watching when i got in 1st grade because it was on before school got out no vcrs or dvrs back then i grew up not realizing that the show was still on until i was in 11th grade br br i also had no idea that there are dvds and wish my nieces and nephews were young enough to enjoy this show but now theyre all past the demographic or id buy all of them dvd sets this was so much better than a lot of the kid shows today
