i caught this film at an outfest screening in los angeles in july 2006 its rough around the edges sound recording in particular is wobbly and often very funny the script is rather jarringly episodic and ends abruptly but ash christian infuses the film with lots of genuine heart its also a refreshing change of pace to have a gay film that doesnt star underwear models obsessed with partying and chasing straight guys props to a warmly sympathetic jonathan caouette as mr cox a kindred spirit to rodney ash christian the lively and spirited ashley finke as rodneys best friend and deborah theaker as rodneys mom who is given the best oneliners in the script and steals her every scene the film is like its writerdirectorstarÂ—lumpy and a bit odd but also very sweet
