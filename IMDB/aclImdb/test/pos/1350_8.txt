i had read up on the film and thought it would be cute a feel good saturday night movie i wasnt expecting anything great figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience i have to admit i was pleasantly surprisedbr br the dialogue was pitch perfect most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely ash christian was perfect his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see he could have turned this character into something weve all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character it was wonderful to see jonathan caouette again i didnt know what he would do after tarnation ashley fink is gem a great young character actress that hopefully will get more workbr br there are moments in the film that could have used some work but all in all not a bad time at the cinema my friend described it as a gay angusnapoleon dynamite but its something more than that its a character study into what its like to grow up gay in a small town the pain is there but the humor behind that pain that only age can make clearer is magnified i look forward to seeing more of ash christian ashley fink and jonathan caouette soon
