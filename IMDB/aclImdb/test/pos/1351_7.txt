a good entertainment but nothing more  in this western we are between the classics and the spaghetti ones this provides us a good a conventional story but its always a pleasure to see robert mitchum with his legendary flegma although he isnt as fit as in the forties or the fifties and dont forget david carradine is the son of john carradine
