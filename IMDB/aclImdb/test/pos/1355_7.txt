there is something that one of the characters the aging film director who pretends to be dead says which may summarize all the film in italy its the dead who rule true this is a country without a future in the hands of old and jaded men and bellocchios cryptic portrait of the country pivoted on the apparently senseless story of a director who has to film marriage parties to earn a living manages to say a lot about what is not working here but foreigners may miss the point as its not clearly expressed i understand that australian or canadian people who watch this may get bored and wonder if theres a meaningwell theres a meaning but its clear only to people who live here today and keep their eyes wide open like bellocchio surely its not one of his best films and its not as powerful as buongiorno notte but its worth seeing for italians who live in italy
