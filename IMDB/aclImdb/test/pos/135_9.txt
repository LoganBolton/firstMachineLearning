the cinematography is the films shining feature park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own i hope theres a bluray release of this film because it will look fantastic its rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology park used for his vision sanghyeon has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless has incredible strength and is vulnerable to sunlight he doesnt however have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirrorbr br although ive never seen the film i couldnt help but feel like this was chanwook parks version of twilight the entire middle portion of the film is devoted to sanghyeons and taejoos love for one another it felt like the adult version of twilight really theres a lot of blood nudity sex and even a few obscenities thrown in for good measure maybe its the chanwook park fanboy in me but i honestly feel like i can guarantee that this is the better film of the two the psychological aspect that i love about parks previous films is in thirst as well thats a major factor for me as any film that causes me to think or is unusual in any way winds up becoming a fan favorite the soundtracks to parks films always seem to fit its respective film like a glove thirst is no exception while the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time around it fit the overall atmosphere of the film rather effortlesslybr br the middle portion of the film did seem to drag on longer than everything else in the film its weird though as the scenes during that time are crucial to the storyline of the film and its hard to imagine thirst being the same film if any of those scenes were cut nevertheless it is my one nitpick of the filmbr br chanwook park bites into the vampire mythology with thirst and puts his own dark psychological twist on it parks films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following great writing beautiful cinematography a solid cast some sort of psychological twist thatll mess with your head and a memorable ending thirst delivers on all fronts and will hopefully get more of the attention it deserved during its theatrical run on dvd and eventually bluray hopefully
