i liked this quite a bit but i have friends that hated this theres no sex but theres very little nudity in any of the episodes  which is a good thing also keitaro has a toilet fixation thats explored in at least half the episodes toilets are way more advanced in japan hmm im wondering why i rated this so high myself it certainly isnt that i like naked cartoon girls in some ways keitaro oe the main character is analogous to johnny bravo except instead of being an obnoxious musclebound jock keitaro is a hyperactive nerd or you can think of him as japans answer to leisure suit larry hes easier to take if you watch it subtitled rather than dubbed but he grows on you either way if you give him a chance he is the goldenboy br br the formula is the same for each episode boy meets girl boy tries to win girls heart despite being a dorky pervert boy somehow succeeds against all odds typically the girl doesnt realize she likes keitaro until after hes beaten to a pulp andor pulled off some spectacular stunt like engineering a modern operating system in one week or winning a race against a gasolinepowered motorcycle using his bicyclebr br episode 1 features a rich software tycoon i think animating her boobs put a major dent in the budget because shes the only female that has this kind of animation she also dresses completely unprofessionally most people who rate this negatively probably never got past the first episodebr br episode 2 has the rich young daughter who likes to tease shes only 16 but thats legal age in japan and in some states in the us i might add her father is also a brutal yakuzza type that has a reputation for killing guys interested in his daughter br br girl 3 is the sweet innocent daughter of a noodle shop owner thats mixed up with a bad boyfriend aside from keitaro running interference for the maiden and being kissed by a guy theres almost no ecchi of any kind in this episode  a sharp drop from the previous two nevertheless keitaro and the evil boyfriend really pound each otherbr br episode 4 has keitaro trying to impress a topnotch swimming coach keitaro seems more direct about his intentions with this particular girl than any other and shes pretty direct in returnbr br girl 5 is the biker babe shes probably the most topheavy of the 6 although not superbuoyant like girl 1 and raciest in terms of sexuality and vulgarity this particular episode is easily the most overthetop in terms of lack of realism keitaro should have broken every bone in his body at least twice during the race against the biker babe but i think the producers and writers said its just a cartoon we can do anything this lapse in realism makes it a fan favoritebr br finally episode 6 introduces a new girl thats works in animation and the previous 5 girls help keitaro as he tries to cope with impossible time and resource constraints to get an oav out the door by the deadline in terms of ecchi this ones very tame as well but theres plenty of humor the ending has all 5 extremely pretty girls from the past team up to hunt keitaro who slips away unnoticed ostensibly with the intention of gangraping him yeah that almost happens in real life someone crossed ukyo tachibana ala samurai shodown with steve urkelala family mattersbr br all in all theres no middle ground for this youll either hate it or love it if youre new to anime you probably dont want to start with this at the same time if you can stand characters like happosai from ranma 12 or johnny bravo or you like comedies that lean more heavily towards silliness but have very sexual overtones you should give it a shot
