believe me when i say this show is just plain hilarious the basic story is about kintaro oe who travels from town to town taking part time jobs chasing women and learning all he can about life kintaro has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made he takes everything to the extreme and its just laugh out loud funny every time from his constant never ending quest to study life to tiny things he instantly blows up into life or death mattersbr br one of the funniest things about this show is simply kintaros constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions he spends a great amount of time in various super deformed modes like dragon half or trigun other times in less then 01 seconds his face will turn not just serious but mangafighterstyle life or death expressions like a weight lifter trying to benchpress a new record its hilariousbr br if that wasnt enough the writing is superb and the english voice acting couldnt possibly be better kintaros english va is just perfect and will have you rolling around when hes not even really saying anything the one thing to mention though is this is without a doubt an ecchi series it practically defines the word if youre an adult anime fan who can get a laugh out of movies like american pie youll love thisbr br  rirathcom
