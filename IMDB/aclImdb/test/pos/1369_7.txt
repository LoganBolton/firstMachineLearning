my buddies and i spent the majority of a saturday afternoon watching a selection of bad movies among the flicks we watched the strongest contender for quality badmovie fare was easily jacko its ludicrous that movies such as gigli glitter and you got served are listed in imdbs bottom 100 while theyre certainly bad movies they dont belong in the bottom 100 theyre robbing jacko and keeper of time etc of the bad movie greatness they so richly deservebr br so what makes jacko so great in bad movie terms for starters steve latshaw the director decided to cast his son ryan latshaw in the role of sean kelly unfortunately for steve ryan latshaw was dangerously close to being outacted by a block of wood the kid seriously has no ability to emote whatsoever the end result unintentional comic gold the kid could be listening to a joke or just moments away from getting his head smashed asunder and his expression is one of stony emotionlessnessbr br the other aspect of the movie that we found awesome was the sheer number of double dreaming sequences what is a doubledream well its when a character wakes up from a nightmare and then something equally nightmarish happens and then the character wakes up again basically they wake up after dreaming about waking up from a nightmare clever device no i believe the character of sean kelly experienced no less than 3 doubledreaming sequencesbr br lets see what else oh yeah this movie has a veritable cast of thousands its truly stunning to see how many speaking roles are introduced throughout the course of the movie best of all almost none of the characters have anything to do with the story theyre either killed by jacko or they serve no purpose whatsoeverbr br jacko himself was pretty sweet like most other bmovie monsters jacko has the amazing ability to seemingly teleport over great distances hes invariably hangingout somewhere in the background whenever youre dealing with a major character whats puzzling however is that when hes actually chasing someone he moves at a shamblingstumbling speed and yet hes able to keep up with people who are sprintingbr br thats all for now closing remarks if youre looking for a unintentionally hilarious bad movie you cant go wrong by renting this beastbr br bad movie score 710 good movie score 3510
