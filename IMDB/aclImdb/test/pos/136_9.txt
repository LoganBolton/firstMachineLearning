i wasnt expecting much because of the harsh reviews and proceeded to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result softer colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of his previous films in my opinion allowed the narrative to take the focus though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was commonplace i felt like many of the other things were not for examplebr br how his powers were often revealed through interaction with herbr br the very strong and well acted love scenesbr br the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them even morebr br their strong differences of what it means to be vampire created by their prior life experiencesbr br the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the moviebr br ive heard and read several things about tricks used in other films of course however i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and i feel that he does this well i dont need a director to use new tricks i prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately which i feel is the case with this film br br i recommend it
