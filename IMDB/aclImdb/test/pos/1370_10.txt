crazy scottish warrior race stranded deep in outerspace low on food and budget free started ten now down to three who will help these men of pluck with visual effects that semi suck but i kinda liked the freaky being if i met one then id be fleeing but not if i had scottish mates wed fn swear and avoid that fate so in the end it wasnt botched it was a dvd im glad i watched but if they ever make a sequel dump some actors not all were equal some were good with gritty acting some were wooden and should maybe pack it in but the action kept me watching all the shooting shouting didnt stall ill tell my friends not to fear and watch again in another year
