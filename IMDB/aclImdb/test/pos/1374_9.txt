got this the other day from the creators on dvd i saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst family were stopping in a hotel had never heard anything about it after reading it was filmed on balmedie beach i just had to buy it i used to take the kids to the dunes in the film all the time whilst living in aberdeenbr br 1st off im not a big scifi fan baring star wars i was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location i was presently surprised this didnt turn out to be a standard scifi more like a mix of scifi and survival horrorbr br had a good storyline which was different had great special effects for the budget that it was produced with Â£8000 acting was better than average for a low budget film the way they have edited out the whole coastline to make it feel like the dry desert planet that they are on was nicebr br weapons in the film were realistic and the creatures were cool kinda like predator in invisibe modebr br all in all i will buy any future releases from these guys maybe a all out horror next hint hint the extras on the dvd were very informative on giving background for the producers i would like to see some of them shorts included as extras on a next dvd releasebr br excellent work keep it up
