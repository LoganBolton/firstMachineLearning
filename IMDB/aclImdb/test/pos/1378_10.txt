on many levels its very good in fact considering that this was a lowbudget british indie by a first time featuredirector with a largely neophyte cast its a magnificent achievement i dont know how much it cost the figure of Â£8000 was bandied about in publicity but you never know how reliable a figure like that is the point is that this film looks like it cost a couple of million quid and it clearly cost a tiny fraction of that great special effects terrific production design effective props and costumes excellent photography good acting and direction an impressive score and an absolutely stunning sound mix even having said that much of the script was great the characters were clearly identified and all had something to do this is a movie about ten men all dressed roughly the same in one location and it would be easy for them to be nameless faceless blanks but these were ten characters  mostly that was done through the dialogue and the way they reacted to things throughout the middle act when the plot was developing the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters if the whole film was like the second act it would be stunningbr br before the ship blows up twelve people make it to individual escape pods or epods which blast away from the ship theyre not much more than automatic metal coffins and the poor sods inside are trapped cramped and have no real idea where theyre going  but that makes sense i like the epods  theyre an excellent idea done very well and make more sense than a nice roomy escape capsule i also like the way that we are specifically told later that they are designed for shiptoship escape but can just about make planetfall in an emergency  because lets face it these guys were bloody lucky that their ship was blown up so close to a planet that said it doesnt look to me like there are 116 unused epods still on the freighter and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to get into an epod  but in he gets and it has just occurred to me shouldnt the captain have gone down with his ship rather than being the first guy out of there anyway the epods all land on a barren planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation  or at least on a sandy sparsely vegetated part of the planet which may have icy wastes and lush jungles elsewhere nah its a planet in a scifi movie  it will be exactly the same all over we have to accept that all the epods come down within a few miles of each other so that the ten survivors are able to meet up firing flares into the sky to locate each otherbr br the captain a muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in action flicks if he gets the right agent decides that they should try and contact captain behan with whom they were intending to rendezvous but they cannot do this from the planet they need to get into orbit the engineer says that if they combine the power units from two epods they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift itself on antigrav doodads high enough to blast above the atmosphere it can all be done on automatic but it will need a pilot to send the signal the captain valiantly volunteers for this but in a commendably sensible move the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man into the somewhat dodgily repaired epod is ridiculous and that it needs to be the lightest member of the team thats kid i really liked the way that he now points out that his name is david and the captain starts using it treating him with dignity and respect that was good storytelling and good characterisation
