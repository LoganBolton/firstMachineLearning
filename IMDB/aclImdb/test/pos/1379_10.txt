i was trying to work out why i enjoyed this film its not because of money spent on it thats for sure did i see a painted water pistol in there maybe they dont have the same sort of visual effects houses in the scotland or maybe they just didnt have any money the making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds awesome but what i really liked was the grit of the performances mike michell and patrick white play the lead parts like 2 normal guys no hollywood histrionics herebr br ok so the effects work isnt very good the spaceships just dont look as good as they should in todays fx world and ive seen much better free stuff on youtube but the film holds together very well once they get to the planet was this filmed in scotland or just by a scottish crew or is it just better effects work did they edit out the water by the end i kinda loved this film and was disappointed when they all died
