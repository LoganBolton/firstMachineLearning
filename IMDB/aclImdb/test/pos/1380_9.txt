id buy that for a dollarbr br i did buy this film for a dollar and ive seen much worse for much morebr br this is a scottish scifi film from mark stirton and according to the making of hysterical by the way the production only cost 8000 eight grand that wouldnt pay for half a minute in hollywood nevertheless  this is top fun film making if you like things gritty then youre in for a treat these are some rough character with rough voices and harsh swearing i didnt mind but my girl friend did the actors do a fine job and its interesting to see people that ive never heard of or seen before it meant i had no idea who was going to die firstbr br if you watch a movie for its latest of the latest visual effects then watch a star wars the effects here are ok but kinda weak in space but the monsters are very well done if a bit pred likebr br stirton does an amazing job with not very much and id love to see his take on a real hollywood movie it least it wasnt predictable and i almost fell off my chair when one dude got his head blown off ok so it is a little derivative of other scifi but for this budget it is an amazing attempt and anyone who thinks making a scifi film for 8 gs is easy or happens a lot clearly knows nothing about the film industrybr br good marks for a good film extra marks for working so hard extra extra marks for a really interesting making of no standard bull here all the problems of production are gone into making it like lost in mancha only with a film at the end but why no commentary keep going scots
