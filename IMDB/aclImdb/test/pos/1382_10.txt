got the chance to see this at a friends house today and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget not that this ever bothered me anyway since i love low budget scifi like dr who blakes 7 and dark star hell even outland wasnt a big budget affair so whilst money helps it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them goodbr br the story is straightforward at first with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet they then discover the prisoner has made it too hes a stone cold nut case and thats only the start of their problemsbr br the effects except for the gunfights are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it computer effects look a bit dodgy at times but serve their purpose well and add to the story lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings films like i robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot like all too many of hollywoods offeringsbr br whilst none of the actors get oscar material its tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes doesnt outstay its welcome the characters dont get fleshed out much but then they didnt in predator either which it resembles in feel big man mike mitchell is a good stand in for arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawnbr br some people may be annoyed at the lack of explanation towards the end but i like it unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained it is not so obscure that you cant get a handle on it at all and id like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored furtherbr br a cracking little film from an enterprising team done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour if this is what they can do on a shoestring id like to see what they would do with a bit more cash and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics dont knock all the creativity out of them firstbr br recommended
