wow talk about a film that divides the audience this is a real love it or loath it kinda movie personally i really enjoyed it i noticed that other reviews are comparing it to pitch black  this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is sand people can be real stupid no this film is far more in common with the thing how people fail to notice is amazing  they even have the same basic music lots of carpenter touches are there blue collar heroes sharp humor endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood perhaps what stops this film being a real classic is its deference to other carpenter works not least dark star which it has something in common with id be interested to know how much it really cost 8000 is that even possible maybe it was based on a short film that cost 8000 but i did find myself strangely moved when the various space dudes died they are so underplayed that its like watching a documentary at times having said that the script is kinda clunky and only about half of them can act however and im not sure the big guy playing the captain is one of them but his gun is awesome give it a chance if you like early carpenter you might fall for it just dont expect 2001
