bottom of a pit now only claude jose and peter are left they stumble across a cemetery with lots of empty graves and signs of recent black magic rituals claude spots a snake on a nearby rock suddenly a shot is heard and the snakes head explodes a woman on horseback named amanda marvin barbara bach is revealed to be claudes saviour she tells them to leave the island immediately as it is owned by a edmund rackham richard johnson and he doesnt like visitors claude jose and peter decide to carry on regardless eventually finding rackhams large house in which they are invited to stay that night peter goes after amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp peter quickly becomes food for the fishmen and a voodoo priestess called shakira beryl cunningham who lives with rackham performs a black magic ritual involving slitting the throat of a chicken at the cemetery the next day claude and jose decide they should leave the island as they feel very uneasy about rackham and think he is lying to them jose rides off on horseback and is lost claude is saved from one of the fishmen by amanda and is again told to leave claude wants to confront rackham again rackham reveals that he has a scientist and amandas father named professor ernest marvin joseph cotten who he needs to be kept alive rackham says that the longer ernest stays alive the chances of his own survival will dramatically increase rackham tells claude his plan rackham has found the lost city of atlantis at a depth of over 2000 feet he is using the fishmen as a means of getting at the lost treasures of atlantis and needs amanda and her father to control them he claims the fishmen are descendants of the original inhabitants of atlantis rackham offers claude a share of the treasure if he will help him keep ernest alive later claude remembers the name ernest marvin as a scientist who was condemned for experiments transplanting animal organs into human beings finding ernests secret laboratory he discovers rackham had lied to him and the fishmen arent descendants their actually genetically altered people turned into amphibious creatures by ernests grotesque experiments rackham has finally had enough of claude and decides to put an end to his meddling by sticking him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water as the islands volcano starts to erupt and send lava flying everywhere rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and amanda will claude escape almost certain death to save amanda and get off the island before the erupting volcano tears it apart directed by sergio martino i really liked this film that mixes various genres the script by sergio donati is fast paced interesting and entertaining the plot is revealed bit by bit which kept me interested in watching it all the way through i must say at this point that ive seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for its us release by roger corman barbara bach makes for an extremely attractive leading lady but i hated the way she was introduced by shooting a snakes head off i thought it was more than a little distasteful richard johnson makes a great villain and claudio cassinelli a likable hero the fishmen themselves look a little fake when the camera lingers on them too long but their cool looking and ive seen worse some of the miniature effects look a little poor too but overall again ive again seen a lot worse theres no real gore violence or nudity in it but that didnt really bother me actually the photography by giancarlo ferrando and the production design by massimo antonello geleng combine to create a very nice looking film period costumes props and sets like rackhams house and ernests lab with its old scientific equipment the lush green jungle settings also add to the visual splendour on show i really liked this film and i was entertained throughout its running time im not sure who id recommend it too as it mixes various genres i guess someone who maybe fancies something a little bit different and generally well made if you can find a copy give it a go im glad i did
