action packedwith my favorite type of creaturei wont give any of it away if you havent seen itcause its worth taking the time to sit down and unravel in the mystery of things as presented in this filmit did gets slow at times and those were the moments my mind wondered which does easily anyways but moist of it kept me quietly thrilledwhere you keep it in your head instead of letting it outprobably the mood i was in at the timespecial effects and action sequences you could feel made up for the occasional lullsof course therees a duschload of movies out there exactly like thisthe film still has its own style and flavorwhich i respect from underground independent horror movies anyways
