although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turned inside out this is a total lie in fact apart from the opening segment the film isnt even a horror movie with its sunken treasure legions of fish people and mad scientists its a lot more like a doug mcclure adventure movie obviously this film is no work of art but its kind of fun to watch just be warned that the beginning is quite gory
