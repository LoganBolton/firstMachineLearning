this movie surprised me the box is misleading the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading the movie is quite gory wellacted and beautifully shot the specialeffects are topnotch and seem to be ahead of their time until you realize this movie came out in 1979 not in 1963 like its tone would suggest it is a unique take on the dr moreau story and one of the better versions filmed the first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking but the film doesnt ever really fall apart definitely worthseeing if you are a fan of dramatic costumehorror classics and gorefests
