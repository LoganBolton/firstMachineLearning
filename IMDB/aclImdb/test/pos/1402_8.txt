this is a very odd movie for harold lloydat least in regard to the sweet character he played in movies throughout the 1920s and 30s instead of a nice guy he and snib pollard are con menout to rob everyone blind in a particularly successful con chester pretends to have lost a very valuable ring and a bit later harold finds it as a stooge is also looking for the ring the ring of course is a cheap one dropped and then found by harold but the greed of the stooge is so great he convinces harold to say nothing and sell him the valuable ring and then they run away to enjoy their luck again and again they find patsies until they meet up with a woman who herself is a con woman working with a guy doing fake s√©ances she arranges a nifty con and takes all the money they stoleand has a cop standing by to make sure they give her the moneybr br as luck would have it the two con men stumble into the ladys shady business when no one is home soon the lady returns and messes with their mindsreleasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their wicked waysbr br all around this is a completely odd and contrived film but it is also exceedingly funny as the jokes work very well and lloyd and pollard make an excellent team plus while creepy and strange i liked seeing pollard dressed like a lady
