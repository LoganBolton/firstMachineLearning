i just watched this an early harold lloyd short film that featured his glasses character on kino videos dvd of the harold lloyd collection hes actually a con man with snub pollard as his partner who gets discovered by bebe daniels who herself performs fake s√©ances what she discovers is that lloyd and pollard bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are lost ill stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when harold and snub enter the place bebe works and encounter some creepy contraptions and put on costumes like snub trying one of bebes outfits not too much slapstick but what there is of was also quite funny so on that note i recommend are crooks dishonest
