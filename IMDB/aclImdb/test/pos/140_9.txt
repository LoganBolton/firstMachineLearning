the definition of a vampire is an inhumane corpse supposed to leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living bakjwi nearly nails this concept on the head minus the clich√© of pointy fangs and neck biting being an r rated movie i knew this was actually going to pertain to vampires actually being vampires which means that the characters in the movie are going to do what vampires actually do without restraint and rightfully lack any glamorous moments in comparison to twilight having viewed chanwook parks preceding oldboy i had very high expectations of bakjwibr br i anticipated some awkward plot sequences with our antihero known as priest sanghyeon and was very impressed by his performance as a holyman who is forced into this quandary of being humane and obeying his thirst as a vampire spoiler after the initial premise of him surviving the defective blood transfusion he starts to crave blood and discovers his super strength and his flying ability the screen shots do his transition phase without overbearing on exposition he starts drinking the blood of the dying and those who wish to be euthanized for moral reasons the oft tragic and dysfunctional love affair the priest has with the manipulative taejoo is very riveting as they are played by the hosts kanhho song and actress okvin kim the special effects are properly placed in the backdrop and while it doesnt offer anything new in the ways of stunts and cgi it didnt impose itself into the plot driven and character developed premise the story and the pivotal plot points are very perverse and grotesque yet very original in its own korean style br br there arent many negatives i can say about bakjwi sometimes i ask myself if the priests transition phase could have showed more of the priest having an emotional crisis with his transformation but then again this would have made the movie 3 hours long the movie was long to begin with on the same token vampires really dont have much in the way of expressing emotions to begin with as mentioned before this movie is very tragic so dont expect anything hopeful while watching this br br overall bakjwi is delightfully dark morbid and original i strongly recommend this movie for serious viewers who are past the teenage phase of twilight this is definitely the korean answer to the swedish let the right one in which is also a good movie
