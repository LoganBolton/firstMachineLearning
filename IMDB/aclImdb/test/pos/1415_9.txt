stephen hawking has one of the greatest minds or if thats too simplistic to coin for him one of the most curious and daring that also happens to be trapped in a body crippled by a disease that leaves him in a wheelchair and a computer to communicate perhaps i didnt know enough about hawking going in i always knew him as that guy speaking like a computer who knows a lot about like the universe and stuff you know that he is british that he was a rather normal kid and perhaps most remarkably the disease that could have possibly left him dead at 21 put him in the position of putting his life in focusbr br according to errol morriss equally curious and coolly visually dazzling portrait in a brief history of time hawking was already brilliant in spurts when other oxford students were faced with daunting algebraic equations he answered more than three times the amount in an hours time but when faced with challenges mostly from other theories by other scientists he bounced back with his own beneath some of the complex scientific talk and if you got any less than a b in astronomy like me youll need to keep your ears especially perked up in explanations of times possible infinity or the peculiarities of the black hole theres a human being who just wants to enjoy his goose on his birthdaybr br morris captures hawking just right for those who cant get enough of his theories on how particles may be going in and out of a black hole or if there is even a creator or not depending on how much one takes into account einstein and time but he also captures the backstory on the man and his condition which creates this as something much more interesting than if morris had done one or the other too much talk about the cosmos would make ones head hurt and too much about his personal life and one might wonder what all the fuss is about this bloke whos book of the films title was on bestseller lists for over five yearsbr br almost in spite of his appearance hawking defines what it is to be a conscious entity in a universe which he observes he wont be apart of if and when the universe goes kaput another 10 billion years from now through it all in a brief history of time we get a glimpse of a genius and his humility not to mention his colleagues and familys ten cents here and there through an unfathomably hypothetical and mathematical thought process of the universe
