i have been a huge errol morris fan ever since i saw thin blue line and heard it saved a life to date this movie is his best piece of workbr br the plot is a mixing of stephen hawkings book of the same title intertwined with the mans life the story is told through interviews with family friends and hawkings himselfbr br dont be fooled it totally sounds boring but the whole package is dynamic and thought provoking the blending of life and theories is seamless and thoroughly entertaining i was particularly moved at how well they humanize this genius and omniscient man tho physically powerless hawkings greatness and shear brilliance is encapsulated into a real live human being that we are allowed to laugh at and aw over at the same timebr br find this movie watch it and enjoy and if the studio who owns this picture reads this a 15 year anniversary edition would be perfect now
