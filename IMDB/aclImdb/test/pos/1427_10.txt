clifton webb as mr scoutmaster is one of the alltime greats for comedy and remembering an innocence now diminished in the world i cannot understand why the networks like american movie classics and such do not show this movie although i have requested it time and againbr br this movie should be shown to children now for its portrayal of loyalty respect dedication and resolve to achieve the best possible on an individual basis there is so much low selfesteem talked about in present daily lives but this movie among many many others would be a wonderful learning tool for the presentday younger generation to see what can be accomplished by common sense and decency and pride in yourself and your achievements to better yourself sad that this type of movie does not appeal to modern audiences it certainly appealed to us baby boomer generation of yesterday old lessons are universal and timeless
