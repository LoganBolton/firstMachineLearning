im the first to recognize that chanwook parks thirst is exceptionally well made but spending over two hours with taejoookvin kimis enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time sanghyeonkangho songis a priest desiring to volunteer for experimental studies on those willing to subject themselves to rigorous injections concerning a specific virus which kills infectiously instead of legitimately dying hyeon becomes a vampire always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flatlined him to begin withbumpssores and the body vomits blood sunlight as is known in the vampire genre causes torturous death if exposed to hyeon for a length of time hyeon falls in lust with taejoo the wife of sickly childhood friend kangwoohakyun shin taejoo was taken in by mrs rahaesook kim regarded as a puppy and practically used as a domestic animal to be ordered around tajoo is miserable in this situation and begins a torrid affair she instigates with hyeon soon manipulating him into perhaps killing kangwoo by having him believe shes a victim of abuse renouncing his priesthood hyeon dives headlong into the relationship with taejoo soon a willing participant in killing kangwoo this incident which taewoo contributed tousing a boat in the middle of a lake both proceeded to burying him underwater taewoo keeping him kangwoo from resurfacing as he attempted to reenterwill haunt both as circumstances arise with kangwoo missinghyeon got rid of him where police would not find his corpse soon mrs ra suffers a strokethough one finger and the ability to blink her eyes contribute mightily as the story progresses showing that she more aware than they are led to believe and hyeon gives taejoo a special birthday giftvampirism in doing so hyeon has created a monster taejoo admitsthough a slip of the tonguethat in fact kangwoo never hurt her and as she thirsts for blood it is soon realized that killing for a supply doesnt bother her morally or psychologically taejoo becomes such a hand full hyeon has to take desperate measures if he is to stop such a menace to society himself includedbr br i will say that thirst is one of the best horror films ive seen regarding 2009 its a methodical approach park takes and we are led down a dark road with hyeon and taejoo as they commit terrible deeds with nothing positive ever to come from their unholy union innocent people die because of hyeons lovewhat once was lust shifts into an obsessive love by the endfor taejoo and it will cease to end if he doesnt make a painful choice we see inside their heads their souls and it isnt always pretty 2 hours with them can be quite exhaustingbut credit to the director for pulling no punches in regards to devious behavior and how the powers of vampirism can be given to the wrong people hyeon seen as a rather pleasant soul at the opening accepts hell for taejoo so one could look at thirst as a unique love story but not exactly a healthy onebr br in regards to the violence while park does have a tendency to pull away from extremely graphic details theres enough sadism involved to perhaps turn the stomach a bit at the very least the way the violence is carried out may be certain to leave a lasting impact the sexual situations between hyeon and taejoo can be pretty heated and erotic while also sordid and morally reprehensible the movie i think is still quite a complex examination of the lengths one will go to remain attached to an object of affectionlust
