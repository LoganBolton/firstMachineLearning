great little groundbreaking movie in 1955 about an important subjectbr br i wasnt expecting much from sinatras performance and was pleasantly surprised by it loved kim novak she was gorgeousbr br loved the jazz score by elmer bernstein as great as that by lazlo schifrin for bullitt i am very surprised it doesnt seem available on cd if anyone knows about the soundtracks availability on any other format they should post it here somewherebr br premingers direction was as usual borderline flawlessbr br havent read nelson algrens novel nor have any idea how faithful the screenplay was to it the subplot of frankie as a hot card dealer was a bit of a surprise too as were a few other things but see for yourself its very much worth seeing
