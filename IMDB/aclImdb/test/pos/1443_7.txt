 spoiler in fifth paragraph  this was an amazingly frank uhhuh uhhuh picture for 1955 otto preminger and carlyle productions took a chance by making it the motion picture association of america balked at certifying a film that openly shows a junky jabbing a syringe full of heroin into his arm frank sinatra took a chance both on playing an addicted musician and at falling flat on his face in a role that required at least twice as much acting as hed ever done all in all these gambles paid off the movie is a classic though its not perfectbr br nelson algrens novel may be great but it has far too much going on to fit comfortably into a two hour movie the man with the golden arm is 119 minutes and often feels much longer however in my opinion its not just frankie machine sinatra that makes the film but the other characters and their subplots all involving frankie ultimately its not just frankie who has the addiction everyone and everything seems to be dependent on him and he feels it keenly when the pressure gets to be too much the drums start pounding on the soundtrack and frankie steps across the street with his welldressed friend louiebr br its an exaggeration to say that frank sinatras music career was ever really in the doldrums but in the early 50s he was in limbo between his days touring with big bands and the las vegas era from here to eternity established him as a serious actor and his career as a singer rebounded as well but the man with the golden arm was still a significant challenge the whole show sinks or swims with his performance he pulls it off with such skill that for several minutes at a time i forgot i was watching frank sinatra he must have known junky musicians and exploited that knowledge to the utmostbr br set side by side with billy wilders masterpiece the lost weekend there is more emphasis on the sociological causes of addiction in the man with the golden arm whereas don birnem ray milland in the lost weekend seems to struggle mostly against himself frankie machine is beset by external forces and he takes refuge in the needle neither approach is wholly right or wrong mostly because addiction is impossible to fully explain but it seems like this film might have benefited from a little more insight into frankies internal strugglebr br  spoiler  one of the problems i have with this film is the clich√©d reliance on quitting cold turkey i realize that the man with the golden arm was probably setting the trend rather than following it but that doesnt make it any better in the beginning of the movie frankie has to all appearances kicked his habit with the help of a doctor and a treatment facility of some sort naturally the drama of the film requires that he backslide but i found the allamerican ideal that a man has to face his problems alone or maybe with the help of a good woman out of place here going cold turkey and riding off into the sunset with kim novak seemed too unrealistic the end of the lost weekend was similar but in my opinion was a little less rosy
