lots of scenes and dialogue are flatout goofy but when you add it all up ie machines daily cycle from depressing walkup to depressing bar to depressing burlesque hall to depressing smokefilled poker games and back home again you get a weird sense that somebody somewhere is trying to give a faithful depiction of the junkies life circa1955 whether its sinatra who obviously would have bumped up against this type of character growing up in hoboken and working in numerous bands or preminger who uses the soundtrack and the frankiezosch subtext to slip the addicts interior worldview past the hays code cage you get a good companion piece to on the waterfront which was filmed almost exactly the same time sort of a fauxrealist work that leaves you realistically wondering how deep the drug culture is embedded in american life
