frank sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic he plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer but he cant avoid running into his old friends he had been arrested originally not for any drugrelated charge but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game his skill at poker has earned him the nickname of the man with the golden arm and the men who run the game one of them being his former heroin connection want him to deal again meanwhile frank has to take care of a woman whom he injured in a car accident zosch eleanor parker and make up with his old girlfriend molly kim novak the film is great at putting us in sinatras mental state when he feels sure of himself at the beginning of the film i felt good for him but when a promised phone call doesnt come one day he descends into depression and goes back on the smack later when he finally gets to audition he arrives completely strung out his embarrassment when he cant play the correct beat is devastating he had such big dreams and the other musicians dont even pay him a bit of attention as he rushes out of the room the film moves quickly and it shows franks drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a social message picture the actors are uniformly fine elmer bernsteins score is one of the best of its time the only thing i dont like about the film is the endingbr br spoilersbr br although i really like the character of zosch and parker is very good in the film they could have done a little more to fill in her backstory the ending is a little too pat while there is surely pathos that will remain with the characters after the film closes zoschs death ties up all the loose ends a bit too neatly frank is free to love molly and he wont go to jail also his dealer is dead so at least the immediate threat is gone well i guess in hollywood theres always a desire to tie everything up in a neat little package it harms the film a little but as it stands its still one of the best and most adult movies about drug addiction i can think of 910
