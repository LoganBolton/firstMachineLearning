i am fifteen years old and have seen thirtythree of sinatras films not counting videos of tv shows and documentaries and have been unimpressed by only two of them till the clouds roll by and the miracle of the bells dont really count however considering that in the first all he does is sing a magnificent ol man river and in the latter hes not half badonly the picture is pathetic my favorite records radio shows tv shows and movies concerning sinatra change virtually every dayeverything taking on a different connotation at each viewing and occasionally seeming the best thing he ever did and occasionally the worst until the cycle comes around again but there are a couple things that are beyond comparison when it comes to movies the man with the golden arm heads that list everybody who knows anything about sinatra knows he thought this was his bestever performance he was oscarnominated it was the first serious look at drug addiction etcetc the jazz score is unforgettable kim novaks likable despite a ludicrous accent eleanor parker is annoying and waaaay too dramatic the turtlelike arnold stang is amusing the first time but more embarrassing every time out and darren mcgavin makes a wonderfully slimy drug dealer the sets are unconvincing  at first glance it seems a peculiar mixed bag tossed together by the great otto preminger with an offcenter charm br br then you come to sinatra like everything else in his life  other than music  reports of his acting are alway divided in half directors like fred zinnemann frank capra billy wilder stanley kramer martin scorsese peter bogdanovich and otto preminger all agreed that had sinatra worked as hard on his films as he did on singing hed have been among the greatest actors in the world  if not the greatest humphrey bogart even saidthis guy has the most natural acting talent ive ever seen not bad for a man who never took an acting lesson in his life was at the same time producing the discography that would make him the greatest singer of the 20th century and did almost all his scenes in one take br br in direct conflict with all of this are those other reviews and biographies that sniff haughtily about what a lousy actor was this mrsinatra and how many bad movies he made the question will never be answered to everyones satisfaction because controversy was among sinatras greatest assets and both arguments were in a sense playing into his hand in any case at this time in this role sinatra is magnificent a reviewer said in the late fiftiessinatra may not be the greatest actor in the world but there is none more fascinating to watch no matter what sinatra is doing in a film its hard to take your eyes off him this of course is a charisma that ive only seen in a handful of other peopleorson welles richard burton marlon brando montgomery cliftperhaps james cagney theres no real definition for it and it often makes it hard to figure out whether youre really enjoying a performance or just spellbound but that quality on display here is what makes the movie sinatra is downright riveting real intense  transcending decades and thousands of paperdoll pop stars with something called quality like it or not this is a oneman show with a few character actors hanging around in the background he covers every emotion with remarkable subtlety from sweet lonely tenderness with kim novak to the terrifying shock of frank sinatra frank sinatra whimpering and screaming in the agony of cold turkey sinatra was right  this is his best performance no question br br i was eight when frank sinatra died i wasnt around for all the years of bobbysoxers and anchors aweigh mr ava gardner and from here to eternity albums with lamp posts and swingin lovers kennedy vegas ringa ding ding basie and mia and reagan and concerts from madison square garden to south africa to the white house to the sands i cant say i like sinatra because i heard him at the paramount or because i hear september of my years autobiographicallythe usual excuses and my excuse when i was eleven i watched a movie called on the town
