ive always enjoyed frank sinatras music and just recently i wrote a term paper about his life story ive been fascinated by the life and legend of ol blue eyes however ive never seen any of his movies so i wanted to see if his acting was as great as his singing wellit was i was blown away by his performance in this movie he really does a tremendous job as recovering heroin addict frankie machine whos trying to put his life back together and audition as a drummer for a local band br br otto premingers direction is great as well i havent seen any of his other movies i read his biography on the imdb he seems like one of those directors who was sorely misunderstood and people had conflicted thoughts about him seems like the kind of person who appeals most to cult enthusiasts i havent seen enough of his films to know for sure if hes really brilliant but now im curious i want to see more of his films because judging by his attempt with the man with the golden arm this guy has talent i also loved the music for this movie the score definitely contains the kind of music that ill remember if i ever happen to hear it again thats when you know you have a great scorebr br the supporting performances are fine as well including darren mcgavin as the local drug pusher eleanor parker as frankies wheelchairbound wife and kim novak as his lover br br its interesting to see how filmmakers handled the subject of drug abuse as opposed to modern attempts in films like trainspotting and requiem for a dream back in 1955 just mentioning the word drugs caused controversy and if you watch the film they kept the subject on a very discreet level theres only one scene where frankie is actually getting heroin injected into his arm and they showed a closeup of the reaction of his face rather than showing the needle graphically poking into his veins but it delivered its message without making it feel watereddown in a powerful drama like this with powerful performances and direction like this you dont need graphic portrayals of drug abuse to keep the audience intrigued br br the man with the golden arm is a dramatic gem that all film buffs should check out it really is an amazing piece of workbr br my score 8 out of 10
