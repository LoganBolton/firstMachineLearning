frank sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that its hard to single one out as the best if i had to name the best thing he ever did though it would be his performance as frankie machine the heroin addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved just barely by the love of a good woman played by an exceptionally babelicious kim novak the coldturkey scenes between sinatra and novak are terrifying and heartbreaking the movie is very nearly perfect in fact from saul basss title graphics to the groundbreaking jazz score by elmer bernstein it might not be the sort of thing anyone thinks of in regard to the 1950s but its a mustsee nevertheless
