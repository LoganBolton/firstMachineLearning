theres this whole theory of horror that some people adhere closely to that the monsters and the violence should be kept offscreen park chanwook throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wantsand what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety from a stylistic perspective park seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across whether its long involved ensemble scenes with the camera whizzing around a mahjong table or entire weeks confined to a single shot between two other scenes dialog from the scenes before and after bleeding over them park doesnt keep to a specifically structured style but focuses more on telling the entire story of a couples relationship from virginal remove through utter codependence to utter selfannihilationand uses vampirism as the link and priestliness as the drama its that simple and that complex at the same timebr br you gotta give him credit too many people are ready to compare any modern vampire movie to twilight with twilight almost always being the lesser of the works but here the stories are actually comparable but this one is more raw and honest none of this sparkly coming in the window during the night to talk crap but anything ranging from the dirtiest most desperate and virginal sex scene to eventual spousal abuse as the two leads begin to vie for power over one another its the same dealguy and girl meet girl finds out guy is a vampire decides to join him anyway but with no happily ever after just straightup limited time as they become forced to keep each other closer and closer and run out of options the girls motivations are particularly interesting as one desperately craving power and attention to a fault foiled by the guy who just wants to live a good life as best he can under the circumstances but is a hypocrite who cannot admit that hes merely using his vampirism as an excuse to act against his moral trainingbr br the movie isnt perfect and it does tend to stretch theres no three act five act or any act structure here just scene after scene of character building and dysfunctional romance but whats great about it is that park chanwook is willing to show everything frankly and honestly while delighting the horror sensibilities of tension and gore he also provides an expertly chosen soundtrack to hit the emotional highnotes in a pretty effective way toobr br polarisdib
