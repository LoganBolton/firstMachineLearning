this is a very strange series with dean learner i really didnt understand the guests i knew they werent serious but whether they were really them was unclear becausei guess im just that stupid i dont know if this classes as a spoiler but the guests arent real like in ali g or anything theyre played by one man or so i believe i love the serious look that hes got going on its like that programme that was on on a sunday morning that i forget the name of lol i also really like the suit and moustache thing he has got going on its quite hot hes insensitive which is one of the funniest qualities i also like the way he has subsections of the programme it makes it seem more authentic
