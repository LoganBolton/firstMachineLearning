this british documentary was recently shown on comedy central during their best ofÂ… week and can also be seen on south parks second season dvd i remember seeing many commercials for the dvd showing clips of this documentary most of which occurs with matt stone trey parker and some other guy in a hot tub it was funny when i saw it in the commercials but i was used to seeing it by the time i saw the actual documentarybr br overall goin down to south park is a fairly funny and interesting look at how south park episodes are made and of the series history going back to when matt and trey came up with the idea in college however there was something about the tone of this documentary that actually felt sort of depressing its not as fastpaced rapidfire and as lively as the actual south park episodes instead it kind of has a slow drywit style which at times can be funny but most of the time youre just waiting for something to happen if you get the chance to watch it by all means go for it but i dont think youre really missing much if you never see itbr br my imdb rating 710
