a beloved and devoted priest from a small town volunteers for a medical experiment which fails and turns him into a vampire br br physical and psychological changes lead to his affair with a wife of his childhood friend who is repressed and tired of her mundane life br br the onetime priest falls deeper in despair and depravity as things turns for worse he struggles to maintain whats left of his humanitybr br the vampire movie should have really been extinct now thanks to the poor efforts of the twilight and underworld franchises but the director injects new blood into the story of the vampire by putting simple things into perspectivebr br these vampires have reflections and no fangs but still feed and die the same making the main protagonist a priest really opens up a can of worms for questioning ones acts the priest primarily feeds to make himself better but when he meets his friends unfulfilled wife carnal instincts set inbr br what makes this film intensely erotic is that when the couple consent for the first time they are experiencing something they have never before forbidden passion which makes the scenario all that more sensualbr br chanwook adds some much needed humour into the film but this is only realised in the final third of the movie we see the daughter lift her mother in the chair in front of everyone and when she realises her own strength just puts the chair down and carry on hilariousbr br and the final act wouldnt be out of place in a carry on film or even the three stooges as the couple fight for survivaldeath respectivelybr br cgi is subtle and fantastic and the scenes with them jumping from building to building is so graceful you could be watching balletbr br the vampire genre feels fresh and vibrant after this but more importantly has the eroticism and intensity that most vampire films are missing these days its violent but from the director in question i wouldnt expect anything differentbr br a really interesting story with fantastic characters and beautiful cinematography
