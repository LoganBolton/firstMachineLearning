well i saw that yesterday and it was much better than the other makingoff from vh1 too bad than this one its pretty outdated but you get to see all the staff who makes south park very interesting stuffbr br its also funny than this documentary portrays trey and matt like selfish greedy snobs creators who doesnt work and spend all the time having fun or relaxing which is kinda ironic because they work pretty hard on the showbr br it also shows all the animation process to make a south park episode interview with the actors who brings characters voices and much morebr br if youre a fan of south park i highly recommend you this
