ok when i rented this several years ago i had the worst expectations yes the acting isnt great and the picture itself looks dated but as i sat there a strange thing happened i started to like it the action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump brion james maybe one of the greatest bgrade actors next to bruce campbell is great as always the story isnt bad either now i wouldnt rush out and buy it but you wont waste your time at least watching this good bgrade post apocalyptic western
