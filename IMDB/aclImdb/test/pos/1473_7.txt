it has to be said that this film is definitely one of the better bargain bin movies out there  id feel a bit cheated if i had paid £15 for it but at about £150 i felt that i definitely got more than my monies worth br br the film cant quite decide if it wants to be mad max or one of the clint eastwood man with no name spaghetti westerns and as such is stacked with clichés from both even the manic loony who hangs out with the bad guys in mad max is therebr br that guy from blade runner also cops a good billing although he only turns up at the beginning and the end of the moviebr br favourite bit  for me the punchup on top of the oil refinery  if you look closely you can see the postapocalyptic rush hour traffic thundering past in the distance as the two protagonists knock seven bells out of each otherbr br get several lagers in a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drivel
