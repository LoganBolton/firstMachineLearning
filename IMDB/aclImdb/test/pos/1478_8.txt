im rating this pretty high just because of sam elliott i couldve done without the female nudity but id sit through almost any nonsense in order to see sam strut his stuff he gets to spout wonderfully cynical witticisms many of which i agree with and its a joy to see him in a role in which he actually gets to emote instead of just standing around scowling and looking virile as can be my boyfriend opined that this movie is in a couple of ways similar to a film in which ed harris had a hispanic partner in the police sense of the term who was a little overeager to prove himself you can draw your own conclusions on that score but if you like sam youll like this you could say im biased but who isnt in some way id buy this on dvd in a heartbeat
