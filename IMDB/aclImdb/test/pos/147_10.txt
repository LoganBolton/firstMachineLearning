of the korean movies ive seen only three had really stuck with me the first is the excellent horror a tale of two sisters the second and third  and now fourth too  have all been park chan wooks movies namely oldboy sympathy for lady vengeance and now thirst br br park kinda reminds me of quentin tarantino with his irreverence towards convention all his movies are shocking but not in a gratuitous sense its more like he shows us what we dont expect to see  typically situations that go radically against societys morals like incest or a libidinous bloodsucking yet devout priest hes also quite artisticallyinclined with regards to cinematography and his movies are among the more gorgeous that ive seenbr br thirst is all that  being about said priest and the repressed conscienceless woman he falls for  and more its horror drama and even comedy as park disarms his audience with many inappropriate yet humorous situations as such this might be his best work for me yet since his other two movies that ive seen were lacking the humor element that wouldve made them more palatable for repeat viewings
