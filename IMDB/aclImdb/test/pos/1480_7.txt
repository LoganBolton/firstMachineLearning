all the reviewers are making one big mistake this movie was not suppose to be taken seriouslybr br it was made for kids and teens of the late 80ies or early 90ies and as such it was truly a film of its time if you hated that period or love the first movie so much that you cant even take a joke about it then this is garbage but only because it wasnt meant for you the low budget here and failure of the beastmaster 1 at the box office grossed under four mil with a nine mil budget were obviously the reasons to drop the seriousness of the original and to put it in the present day you can complain about the story dialog or logic but again this was made to run not to win races if the movie had tried to take itself seriously it would be a total failure but it doesnt do that for a second in our world dar sees a movie theater thats advertising the beastmaster 2 enough said to paraphrase clint eastwood from dirty harry movies this movie knows its limitations its more of a comedyparody then usual adventure soundtrack for the time was also great actors arent taking themselves that seriously either so even the usually irritating spoiled rich brat role played here very well by young kari wuhrer turns out good br br so if you are nostalgic for the 80ies90ies cheese culture or you liked the first part and dont mind going out on a cheese limb youll have tremendous fun with this attempt to revive dar in the 90ies literarly this is not really the sequel to the first and dont watch it if thats what you want its more of a what if fantasy sequelbr br as for the why different dimension and not just different time question when in history did we have those tall winged humanoid creatures that suck the flash of bones from the end of part 1 by the way the movie ends in the zoo because of an attempt at a cheap moneywise big finale its suppose to be the best place for dar to show all his moves him being the manipulator of animals
