because mr bean almost never speaks i heartily recommend using a dvd player with the teacher holding his finger over the pauseplay button at the end of any age groups lesson simply devote 5 minutes to pausing and playing the dvd encouraging students to shout out the answers to whats this what will happen whats happening whats wrong or any other question that elicits responses from that lessons new vocabulary and grammarbr br because everyones looking at the tv normally shy students become vocal because the dvd can be started or stopped at any point its a perfect filler for the awkward between times while students are leaving and arrivingbr br i tried other dvds notably tom  jerry cartoons and red skelton dvds but no others were as good as mister bean at holding students constant attention
