oldboy director park chunwook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie historybr br trusting the latest hollywood fad vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent asexual lovelorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual bloodsucking mindmanipulating manbeasts of yore this is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past well at least in the second halfbr br thirst starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story the vampire transformation of a priest is over quite some time sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story which makes for some awkward viewing but the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly gory well maybe not so surprisingly if you know oldboy and im a cyborg but thats ok but i guess its fair to say that thirst beats parks earlier films in terms of inyourface violence br br all in all be warned that this is neither art cinema nor a horror flick it may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some thirst is original entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than park chunwooks earlier endeavors
