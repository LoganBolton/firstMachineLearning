mr bean was great fun i loved it every episode was really funny rowan atkinson was perfect for this role hes a funny looking bloke and his facial expressions were hilarious br br the series was so successful that they even made a mr bean movie in 1997 which was also pretty funny by the way br br its funny seeing all the adventures and situations he gets himself into this series was a classic for sure and i still watch an episode from time to timebr br mr bean is well worth a 1010 in my book fans of offbeat comedy must check this out
