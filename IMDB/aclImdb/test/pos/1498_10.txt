hearkening back to those good old days of 1971 we can vividly recall when we were treated with a whole season of charles chaplin at the cinema thats what the promotional guy called it when we saw him on somebodys old talk show we cant recall just whose it was either merv griffin or woody woodbury one or the other the guest talked about sir charles career and how his films had been out of circulation ever since the 1952 exclusion of the former little tramp from los estados unidos on the grounds of his being an undesirable alien no schultz hes not from another planet br br charlie had been deemed to be a subversive due to his interest and open inquiry into various political and economic systems everything from the anarchist movement from the 20s and before the technocracy craze to socialism in its various forms were fair game for discussion at chaplins hollywood parties which of course meant the inclusion of the soviet style which we commonly call communismbr br compounding mr chaplins predicament was both confounded by one little detail he had never become an american citizenbr br anyhow enough of this background already br br suffice it to say that he had become persona non gratis in the united states of america it was high time to get the old films out of the mothballs and back out to the movie houses itd sure be a great gesture by us easily forgiving and quickly forgetting americanosbr br it would be a fine gesture to the great film making artist besides the academy of motion pictures arts  sciences was planning to honor chaplin with a special tribute at the 1972 oscar show this would surely be a tearful yet joyous packaging of pathos a plenty for having america invite charlie back and have him come and receive a special academy lifetime achievement award in front of a worldwide television audience numbering in the millions br br besides that would be a natural for promoting the chaplin season at the theatre remember the little tramp was as astute as a buine man as he was as a film maker the program consisted of showings of modern times city lights the great dictator monseur verdoux a king in new york and finally the chaplin revue we remember being very excited in the anticipation of the multi date film festbr br in our fair city of chicago it was booked for the carnegie theatre on rush street the festivities lead off with modern times and all of the others would be shown one at a time each staying for whatever period was necessary in order to satisfy the publics desire to view each picture as we recall the very last on the schedule was the chaplin revuebr br in retrospect we look back and wish that they had begun the run with revue as there were undoubtedly legions of moviegoers much like ourselves who knew very little about his accomplishments in motion pictures except for those keystone essanay and mutual silent shorts that were being shown as regular feature on so so many kiddy shows all over the country oh well once again no one consulted mebr br concentrating on todays honored guest film the chaplin revue we found that it was actually three separate pictures carefully bound together by the use of narration by chaplin himself some lively themes and incidental music once again written by chaplin and some happy talk and serious narration ditto by chaplin he opens up the proceedings by making use of some home movietype of film depicting the construction of the chaplin studio in hollywood as well as some film taken of some rehearsal time showing director chaplin demonstrating just what he wants to a group of actorsbr br this segment was well done and well received by the audience both the building humor and the rehearsal were amplified by making them seem accelerated the rehearsal naturally the building by use of speeding up the cameras photographic process the old trick makes it appear that the buildings were almost building themselvesbr br this amalgam of shorts incorporated three of chaplins short comedies from his stint with first national pictures roughly that being 1917 to 1923 the choice was well thought out and gave us a wide variety of subject matter and moodbr br first up was shoulder arms charles chaplin productionsfirst national pictures 1918 as the title suggests it is a tale of world war i released in october of 1918 with about a month to go before the armistice day of november 11 it was a comedy of comical army gags and a romance between private chaplin and a french girl miss edna purviance the levity is fast physical and in the grand old tradition of ridiculing the enemy the german armybr br displaying an excellent example of the old adage about children and dogs bringing folks together the next film a dogs life chaplin productionsfirst national 1918 traces the parallel lives of chaplins tramp and a newly adopted stray scraps the movie story involves families two of them one homo sapiens one canine and both supplying us with some big surprisesbr br as the finale we have the pilgrim chaplinfirst national 1923 was a good choice to have as the finale it was bright light and tight it was an excursion into the area of the western spoof comedies of such type having been done since by every comedian and team the pilgrim in the story is not of your standard thanksgiving variety but rather a dude or tenderfoot who has ventured out west the tramp is not only that guy but his character is an escaped convict who is mistakenly thought to be the new clergyman of a western towns churchbr br our rating that is schultz and me is  thats four derbiesbr br poodle schnitz
