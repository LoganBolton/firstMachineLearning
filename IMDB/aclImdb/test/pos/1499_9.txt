most of chaplins most famous films are his fulllength features and i assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his prefeature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts this is really a shame as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st centurybr br if someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of chaplins better shorts because chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film this is great for several reasons first in chaplins earliest films from 19141915 his character of the little tramp is still in its earliest incarnations or is absent altogether plus even when he is there he was often meanspirited and selfcenteredsomething very alien from the little tramp we have grown to love second because the shorts that were chosen were in great condition if you watch this film you wont need to worry about watching scratchy film with gaps and lousy musical accompaniment that doesnt fit the action a common problembr br so for a great look at chaplins shorts at their finest give this film a chance its sure to provide you some excellent laughs
