in the late 1940s there was a short film series entitled flicker flashbacks in which excerpts from silent dramas featuring the likes of mary pickford and blanche sweet were played for laughs scratchy clips from antiquated old movies were rearranged projected too fast and given an overlay of jangly music and lame quips the attitude expressed through this brutal treatment pretty much summed up midcentury hollywoods view of its early days silent cinema was considered hokey florid a little embarrassing and only good for a chuckle during the 1950s this attitude gradually began to change for a number of reasons james agees famous 1949 essay on the silent clowns for life magazine was a factor but television played a major role in reacquainting viewers with silent movies admittedly the tv networks sometimes handled the material as crudely as the flicker flashbacks people but highertoned series such as silents please treated the films with respect another milestone was robert youngsons compilation feature the golden age of comedy which proved to be something of a surprise hit when it was released to theaters late in 1957br br i dont know if charles chaplin was aware of youngsons film or its success at the box office but it was around this time that he decided to launch a theatrical rerelease of three of his best short comedies a dogs life shoulder arms both made in 1918 and the pilgrim made in 1922 and released the following year these three movies happened to work well as a trio since they contrast nicely in plot theme and setting in addition all three feature familiar faces from chaplins stock company some of whom play multiple roles in each short at the time of the rerelease the films hadnt been publicly screened in over thirty years so perhaps chaplin was concerned about maintaining his reputation with a new generation of moviegoers especially since his best work was seldom shown on television in the new mediums early daysbr br unfortunately chaplin apparently concluded that the films moved too quickly at the old silent projection speed so the decision was made to stretchprint them which meant that every other frame was printed twice maybe he wanted to avoid the flicker flashbacks look but this wasnt the best way to go about it aesthetically speaking the results were awful and practically destroyed the movies flow of action but nonetheless thats how the chaplin revue was released to theaters in 1959 and thats the version that was transferred to video and made commercially available by playhouse video in the 1980s i purchased a vhs copy of the movie at the time and was terribly disappointed with the jerky stopandstart rhythm of the filmsbr br its a particular pleasure to find that david shepards restoration of chaplins compilation originally produced for the laserdisc format is a vast improvement over the playhouse video version for the most part the projection speed has been corrected the stretchprinting is gone at any rate though the action seems to drag a bit at times for example in a dogs life during edna  charlies awkward dance in the green lantern cafe ednas bare arms appear visibly blurred at another point during the trench scene in shoulder arms when charlie is relieved from sentry duty the action appears oddly sloweddown for a few moments but this may be the result of a maneuver by the film restorers to cover a bit of decomposition over all picture quality is fantastic considering the age of the movies themselvesbr br other bonuses the revue begins with rare behindthescenes footage taken at the chaplin studio this includes shots of an obviously staged jokey rehearsal session where chaplin throttles diminutive actor loyal underwood as well as scenes of charlie at his dressing table putting on his makeup and trimming the famous mustache these scenes are accompanied by chaplins narration delivered at a rapid clip chaplin also composed a new musical score for the compilation and in my opinion his themes for the revue rank with his best compositions especially the pieces used during the caf√© sequence in a dogs life the only exception is the song written for the pilgrim a pseudosingin cowboy number called bound for texas sung fiftiesstyle by matt monro sounding rather like gene autry which is distractingly anachronistic and out of place otherwise throughout the rest of the revue the music is perfectly suited to the action and the atmospherebr br it feels as though the image release of the chaplin revue is in a sense its longpostponed debut presenting these classic comedies the way they were meant to be seen all along in this form the revue ranks with chaplins most durable and enjoyable works
