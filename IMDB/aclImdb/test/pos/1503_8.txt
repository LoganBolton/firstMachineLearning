i honestly have to say that a cat in the brain is one of the most fun and unintentionally hilarious films ive ever seen this film is packed with stupid dialog ridiculous scenes and a selfinvolving plot starring legendary horror director lucio fulci himselfbr br the threadbare storyline is about an aging director fulci who is also named lucio fulci in the filmwho is starting to go nuts and hallucinate because of all the vicious things hes put down in film over the past many years he goes to a shrink who hypnotizes fulci and tells him that he will believe himself to be a killer but that the shrink will actually be the one doing the killing the rest of the film is made up of shots from the film that fulci is directing during all this action scenes of the shrink killing people allthewhile grinning like a fcking moron and some of fulcis hallucination sequences oh and a few tits thrown in for good measure as wellbr br a cat in the brain is completely overtopand ridiculous in every sense the gore is classic fulci  nasty and strong with some really decent scenes the chainsaw sectioning of a female corpse is pretty cool as is the chainsaw beheading of a small boy lots of stabbings gougings and other cool killscenes make this one a pretty nonstop bloodbath the ridiculous dialog lick itlick it as well as some of the insanely goofy scenes the nazi orgy the opera singing slapfest and the running down of an innocent hippy come easily to mind make this one fun as hell not nearly as dark as some of fulcis other films  cat is more of a selfindulgent horrorcomedy that if it wasnt meant to be funny is actually kind of sad i say to grab a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle in to this one i watched cat with a few friends and we laughed the entire time this is the feelgood movie of the summerrecommended 810
