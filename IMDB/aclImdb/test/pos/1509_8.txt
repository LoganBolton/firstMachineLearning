i couldnt help but relish the entire premise of cat in the brain because it dutifully explains a directors steadily going mad seeing people murdered from past movies he has made even mundane activities such as cooking a meal in the microwave or running a faucet of water yield some horrific butchery from a film in the past director fulci playing himself is directing ghosts of sodomand can not seem to deprive his mental well being from constant murder he seeks help from a psychiatrist who instead uses fulcis work as a method to execute a series of innocent people hypnotizing the director into thinking that perhaps hes responsiblebr br this is obviously a film playfully poking fun at fulcis image while exploring the themes of how such a profession which produces so much death and destruction rarely untamed could mold and shape a legacy the film features pretty much a wraparound story surrounding nonstop graphic violence with every possible way to kill a woman expressed in grisly detail this has a shower murder hitchcock never could direct or probably want to the films savagery compliments the mental state of fulcis fulcii knowduring the running time reality and cinematic fiction have fused and fulci can find no escape the endingexplaining the old clich√©its only a moviecouldnt work any better than it does here fulcis boat says perversionexcellent touchand he sails offi can only wish this was his final film because thats a perfect close if there ever was one david l thompson is the deranged psychiatrist planning to kill his adulterous wife jeoffrey kennedy is a cop fulci fears had a family murdered by the fiendbr br the ultraviolence in the film features plenty of unique ways to take a head off such as the door to a chest a scythe a chainsaw and hatchet the most brutal violence derives from nasty chainsaw activity as a dead body is hacked to pieceshow a gardeners chainsaw work on a log fits beautifully in one nightmarish hallucination sequencethe most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a little boy gets decapitated the opening scene with the puppet cat tearing away feasting on fulcis brain is a howler the scenes which are spliced within the film featuring a horrified fulci looking on are obvious but i couldnt help but enjoy this anyway
