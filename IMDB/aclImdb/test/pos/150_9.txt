the great thing about thirst chanwook parks latest film is that its the antitwilight some of you may take that as a minus but in reality its a big plus park takes the method of vampirism seriously and as well the torrid love story between sanghyeon and taejoo we see the conflicts of both of the characters sanghyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that unbeknownst to him turns him into a sickly but trueblue vampire and taejoo with her mother and idiot brother the latter is killed by sang as in a very strong melodrama theres nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point and the implications put forth from religion early on sang for example is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism even as he just cant be that and knows it on top of those about good vs evil push it up into another plane cinematicallybr br that thirst also rises up to the awesome standard of artistry that park has displayed with oldboy lady vengeance and the underrated im a cyborg but thats ok should be taken as a given thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part satiric part romanticerotic part dramatic and lastly fantastical and it doesnt always treat vampirsim as something of a simple horror movie setup though as a horror movie park has more than his share of scary scenes its more akin to the movie near dark which never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was and treated it with sincerity and a kind of lucid track of attention and that the disease itself and its effect on a persons existence is perhaps scarier than the killings or bloodshed once you see one vampire jump up really high or heal its wounds youve seen em allbr br thirst also has a wicked sense of humor much like oldboy only here with a bite pun intended meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being an example of this can be found with the priests predilection of sucking off of blood from people in comas by taking their blood tube and suckling on it on the floor or the manner in which taejoo holds on to one scrap of humanity by keeping her mother alive even as shes had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of reacting to the bloodsuckers whove brought pain and horror to her home but these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience what makes thirst last in the mind is how elements come together of drama and existential pains of a bunueliansurreal sense of catholicism i especially loved the dynamic between sanghyeon and the other priest who gives his arm up for bloodsucking but really wants to be a vampire too and of the erotic the scenes where the priest finally gives in to taejoo are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets not in a pornographic manner but in the sense of these characters release and escape which doesnt last long over the scope of the storybr br if its not as great as oldboy its not something to carp about not all films chanwook park directs will reach the stature of his masterpiece and at the least hell always be known as the man who directed that movie but thrist is an excellent addition to his oeuvre and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general the filmmaking is crisp and exciting and even dangerous and what a white room of daylight the characters live in the humor is dark and hilarious the acting is intense and moody especially from subtle strokes from song kangho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from kim okvin and the ending when it does finally get there is one of those truly superb vampiremovie endings youll be talking about for years in a good way in a battle between thirst and twilight thirst takes the knockout in the first round between let the right one in or near dark its tougher to call 9510
