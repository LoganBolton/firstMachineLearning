un gatto nel cervello or nightmare concert as its more commonly know amongst english speaking audiences starts as horror film director lucio fulci played by the man himself lucio fulci goes to lunch after filming a very gory  violent scene however he orders steak  has a horrible vision relating to cannibalism the grotesque visions hallucinations  dreams continue  begin to affect his mental state fulci decides to seek help  contacts professor egon schwarz dvid l thompson for psychiatric help schwarz claims that fulci cannot separate fantasy from reality  agrees to help him however schwarz has a more sinister ulterior motive as a serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes  fulci thinks he might be responsiblebr br this italian production was cowritten  directed by lucio fulci who also stars in the film as a horror film director named lucio fulci which doesnt really feel like a lot of effort went into it anyway un gatto nel cervello is gory if nothing else  for that alone i rather liked it the script by fulci john fitzsimmons giovanni simonelli  antonio tentori is nothing more than a threadbare excuse to edit together lots of gory footage from other italian films it serves its purpose well enough i suppose  to see fulci on screen has a certain fascination if your a fan of his or are familiar with his films the ending is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money as it just has a policeman telling fulci they killed the killer  thats it another thing about that ending when the two cops put the white sheet over the dead killer in the field  then they walk away leaving it there without any other police presence i mean would the police in italy just leave a dead body in the middle of a field on its own it moves along at a good pace  if you like your gore then you have to see this although if you dont like gore then youll hate it with a passion it all depends on your disposition so the choice folks is yoursbr br director fulci was never the most artistically adept filmmaker  it shows here as his footage is bland flat  looks like it was shot for tv the footage from the other films 7 in total doesnt match the stuff fulci shot  it is obvious that this has been pieced together from different films if your looking for gore youve hit the jackpot people are dismembered with chainsaws put through meat grinders faces are melted there are a few decapitations there are some slit throats someones body is gorily crushed under a car a tongue is ripped out someone has their throat crushed as a wheelchair runs over it there are loads of stabbings someone has their guts removed with a hook theres a rotten corpse complete with maggots someone hand is cut off someone has their head bashed in  their eye falls out a gory death by piano wire as it slices through someones throat there are loads of severed limbs gallons of blood splashed around  a scene of some cats eating brains  theres more as well having said that some of the special effects are a bit fake  look cheesybr br with a supposed budget of around 100000 it shows this is pretty cheap looking it has no visual style or artistic merit but then again why would you want those when you can see a nazi orgy sequence  walltowall gore the acting in this is terrible including fulcibr br un gatto nel cervello is a top film if your a gorehound like me however if your looking for something with a little bit more substance or indeed any substance then this ones not for you this is the sort of film which divides people straight down the middle youll either love what it does or hate it
