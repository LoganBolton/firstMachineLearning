lucio fulcis cat in the brain is an inventive and somewhat egotistical tale of a directors decent into madness the director in question is fulci himself who stars in the film fulci has become known to horror fans everywhere as the godfather of gore and for good reason as he has provided us with some of the nastiest and most gruesome films ever to grace the silver screen from the eyeball violence in films like zombi 2 to a man been hacked to death with chains in the beyond all the way to the full on gore fest known as the new york ripper if you want gore and lets face it who doesnt fulci is your man however all this catering for gorehounds like you and i has taken its toll on fulcis mental state and hes quickly delving into madness brought about by what he films fulcis problems dont end at his mental state either as his psychiatrist that he has gone to see about his problem has took it upon himself to take up murder as a hobby using fulcis films as blueprints for the murdersbr br ive got to say the acting in this film is absolutely atrocious there is one scene in particular that involves a hooker and its only fit to be laughed at for both its acting and its stupidity fulci takes the lead role of the film obviously hes not an actor and it shows but his performance is actually the best in the film its even safe to say that one the whole the acting is bad for an italian horror film of course nobody goes into an italian horror expecting good acting so its somewhat forgivable but i do think that fulci could have hired some better ones bad dubbing doesnt exactly help either however something that does help is the fact that the terrible acting is counterbalanced by lots of gore and its extreme to say the least people get their heads cut off a woman is slain in the shower and unlike psycho here we really see it people are hacked up fed to pigs and theres lots and lots of cinemas finest melee weapon  the chainsaw on display which delighted me no end the amount of gore is massively over the top a lot of the time which gives the film something of a spoof feel but cat in the brain is obviously a tongue in cheek film anywaybr br it would be hard to make a film about yourself and not come across as being a bit of a big head and fulci does indeed come across as a bit of a big head in this movie his name is mentioned often and hes on screen nearly all the time its not too much unlike new nightmare in the ego stakes but its obvious he had a good time making this and i for one had fun watching it so we can forgive him a little egotism the films ending lets it down  i saw it coming a mile off but then didnt seriously think that the movie would take that route but i was wrong it did unfortunately the ending left me cold and the film is a better watch if you turn it off just before the final two minutes however despite its ending and terrible acting cat in the brain is a lot of fun and will please fulci enthusiasts no end and it is therefore recommended
