korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head and the latest by the celebrated director chanwook park is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire add a temptress leading him astray and a cast of eccentrics and you have a wonderful recipebr br directed in part in a style similar to the sympathy trilogy its as sumptuous as it is dark steering clear of clich√© it does offer some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre its an existential movie trying to capture the moral conundrum of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the blood lust however the film doesnt take itself too seriously and there is boundless humour throughoutbr br our leads play their roles to perfection playing with our emotions and revelling in the dark humour there are moments of reflection on the whole moral conundrums involved in the film but its never preachy some might find it overlong and it can lull at points but its worth giving it a chance to the endbr br if you like left field films then there are fewer better than this one of late dark and engrossing it will pull in a crowd one id recommend you give a try
