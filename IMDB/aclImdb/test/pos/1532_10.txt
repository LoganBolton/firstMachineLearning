i really love this movie it has a very real feel to it i believe it was never popular because of the subject matter however because of the subject matter it makes the movie all that much more importantbr br this is an a movie and i recommend it highly if you liked 1984 book or movie i think you will like this one as wellbr br this is harsh to say the least including mental and physical acts of torture some pretty vile not for the week at heart or stomach no gore but his movie is so great at projecting the mental anticipation it doesnt need blood and gutsbr br if you are not a realist or a pestimistic person i dont think you will enjoy it it leaves you with an uneasy feeling about humans what theyre capable of and the very real possibility that our governmentsdoes not necessarily have our personal best interest in its heart
