even the trailer for this movie makes me cry like the first time i saw this movie not for people who are easily upset by intense material the finest performances by alan rickman and madelaine stowe without a doubt this dreadful tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture its citizens for any reason whether they are anarchists or the writer of childrens books will chill you to the bone i saw it when it first came out 1991 and i remember every frame it still scares the hell out me today its happening nowbr br apparently imdb requires ten lines to meet their criteria for a film review imdb might want to get a grip some of us are a little more succinct about writing opinions
