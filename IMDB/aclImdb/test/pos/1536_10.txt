closet land tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements you could read lots of stuff about the movies plot before hand but you dont really need to all you need to know is that the movie is all about an interrogation along the way we learn lots of things about the interrogator and the person being interrogated we also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place especially when you have absolutely no control over itbr br in the end the movie amounts to a warning really though the movie has several different aspects to it about what happens to peoples freedoms when they look the other way and ignore injustices happening to those around thembr br if youve got about an hour and a half and know where you can rent this i strongly recommend that you do so
