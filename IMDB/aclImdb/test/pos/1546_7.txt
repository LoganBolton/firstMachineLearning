recently released on british dvd this is a good movie as long as you have an attention span and iq of more than a fruit fly not as depressing as it could have been this is kitchensink at its most dirty terrance stamp is great in it the music is sweet carol white is very believeable as the single mum tart who cant stop loving criminalsbr br my favourite scene is where carol and her friend who works in the pub with her the one with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down over one eye sit outisde and gossip about all the men who walk pastbr br the only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of carols first husband but if you can get past that youre ok and donovan provides some of the most languid mellow bittersweet lyrics to come out of the 60s
