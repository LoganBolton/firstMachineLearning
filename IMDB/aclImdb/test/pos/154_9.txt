no pun intended im not going to spoil anything about the story but its safe to assume that you already know what kind of character the main actor portrays and of course being a priest while being naughty exaggerates all that plus this is the most erotic movie from park chan wook yetbr br if you have seen wooks previous worksmovies you know he is very visual in a good way and it shows again here while it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface it still has quite some heat hidden underneath and when that boils quite a few bad things start to happen but through all that dark there also moments of light fun to be had too a very stylistic and though provoking movie that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job
