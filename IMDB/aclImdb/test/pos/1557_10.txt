what alice found is the greatest movie that nobodys ever heard of i underestimated it when i heard of it and i though that it would all sex no plot and just really stupid but in reality it was really good they say all indie movies suck but this one and napoleon dynamite didnt suck i asked my friend whod seen it before i did and she said that alice has all these threeways and you see all this nudity but no there is no threeway that i remember and little nudity the movie did have a point and it taught me never trust hitchhikers i liked that in the end they got alice a little dolphin in the end on her way to flordia i totally suggest seeing this movie
