fantastic film wow  this is really a treat i cant believe that i discovered such a gem of a movie br br a pretty young girl traveling south to florida meets a friendly older couple with an rv after she has a flat at a rest stop however she learns that things arent as they seem and the couple gets a bit creepy after she spends some time on the road with thembr br everyone in it was just so perfect for their parts you just about believe that you are watching this happen in real life in front of youbr br newcomer emily grace did a fantastic job as the really cute yet somewhat shy alice emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing and you can see just how she got into the situation that develops in the film im sure well be seeing emily in more films in the futurebr br contrary to what some others have said the lighting and photography in this were just perfect the editing was done well too  just the right way to put together images of the highway to give you the feeling that you are traveling along with the cast on their road tripbr br i didnt see it on the big screen but i can only urge everyone to go out and see it more films like this are exactly what we needbr br sf
