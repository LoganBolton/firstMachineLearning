i wasnt expecting a whole lot when i rented this film as a lot of independent films seem to be a bit overrated these days well hollywood films too for that matter but this movie was fantastic really great its too bad it didnt reach a huge audience because its just superb i really love alices determination it really makes me look upon my life as a gift and i see how privileged i am just to have an education but all of that aside this movie really proves that a good artist can tell a good story no matter what the budget its an excellent film and everyone should watch it they will love it and definitely learn something from it i dont have to be roger ebert to know its one of the best movies ive seen all year and certainly one of the most truthful
