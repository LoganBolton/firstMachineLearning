the vampire craze has in my opinion actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization there were many subgenre films last year from a multitude of countries ive reviewed many and have a few more to discuss forgive my indulgence but since ive recognized the trend as a phenomenon which it is and coincidentally features my favorite horror staple im going to now move outside of north america for a bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didnt see as of nowbr br of the many effects of twilight is the creation of guy and girl vampire movies i hate this sexist categorization which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into sides i think men are prone to hate stephenie meyers work and its offspring to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated women may be unlikely to enjoy future neutral pics since they grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced four times we need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying unequally if vampires are going to survive the craze and remain relevant cue thirst this korean film was directed by park chanwook of oldboy fame there are two ways to dissect it either it straddles between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable or it is a floundering mess that doesnt decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one dont let me convince you that the film has no inclinations its director is a man whose fame is storydriven action films its protagonist is male and has a passiveaggressive interest in his lover more on this later still his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal life is not contrived and his attention is returned there is a male slant to this picture yet it is not so onesided that women could not enjoy it the same cannot be said of daybreakers or new moonbr br the plot follows an emile zola novel called thérèse raquin which i have not read according to wikipedia the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man he kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her the two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead mans body between them they are thus driven to insanity but care for the womans ailing mother at the novels conclusion they try to kill each other discover each others plans and commit suicidebr br now transcribe this nearly 150 year old french novel into modern south korea and youve got thirst chanwook doesnt embellish the story enough to elevate this to mustsee he often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration i think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative his use of the motherinlaw as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect see itbr br the protagonist is originally a devout christian who becomes a vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine he thus becomes the god he once was smitten with people flock to him and view him as a grand healer ok thats really cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it instead of confronting the delusional people he instead sips blood out of comatose hospital patientsbr br lets continue with the christian allusion the woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband her overprotective motherinlaw suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughterinlaws treachery finger waggles the man kills her but resurrects her the two of them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans the man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with him they both die but he atones for her crimes and his own but the film portrays her evil more prominentlybr br the woman character is a caricature and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior she is a housewife with no education while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive vampirism magnifies their characteristics she becomes a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge he becomes a demigod with a spirit his life is how atheists view themselves and her life is how religious people view those without divine intervention
