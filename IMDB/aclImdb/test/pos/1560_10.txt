this is most likely the best picture not many will see it presented a culture in a real unhollywoodized way a must see for all who like indie and for those who dont i think this movie will draw more into the indie scene the acting was top notch the character of alice was portreyed so well with perfect akwardness this movie ahould be brought to the mainstream i think it would do phenominally alice is the most real look at an element of our culture that i have seen since go ask alice a look that is untouched by the hollywood hand movies like this show young people that these things arent glamorous but that they are real and compelling if you liked pieces of april you will love this one
