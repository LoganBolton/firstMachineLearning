six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses the one negative review happens to reside or did on the first page of the movies location in the imdbbr br i found what alice found to be one of the best movies almost no ones heard of that i have seen this year its 64 rating is misleading and may be more a function of the difficult subject matter than the quality of the movie who would think that a movie purportedly about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing guess againbr br for me alice was a positively gripping psychological thriller i was virtually on the edge of my seat the entire time its a very credible story with a realistic script and is very well cast in a fairer world actress judith ivey would win awards for keeping you guessing whether she was good or evilbr br ignore the rating and see this terrific movie and by the way i wish there was a soundtrack album
