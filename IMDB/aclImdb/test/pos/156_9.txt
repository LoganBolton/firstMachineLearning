from the director of oldboy comes this slick vampire flick kangho song stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being cured of a deadly mysterious virus his vampirism and priesthood are quite at conflict but he is able to survive by robbing the hospitals blood bank and unconscious patients who might not mind some siphoned blood because of his supposedly miraculous survival he comes into the lives of hakyun shins family shin has cancer and his mother believes that song can cure it unfortunately songs vampirism raises his levels of lust to a height where he cant help but fall for shins young wife okvin kim kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism and the two become lovers the film from there goes in weird directions that i think one should experience for themselves what really should be mentioned is chanwook parks mastery of the medium of cinema my god ive rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the peak of his powers the major flaw of the film is that its a little incoherent especially near the beginning park is interested in telling his stories mostly in the visuals which can be difficult to follow at times but when it works man does it fly the film is also perversely hilarious the final sequence easily one of the best of the decade is simultaneously heartbreaking and delightfully ridiculous okvin kim should become a worldwide star after this film she gives one of the best performances of the year
