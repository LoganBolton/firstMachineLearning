until i did a web search on what alice found i didnt realize that the name of the film is embedded in the title of one of lewis carrolls books the books complete title is through the lookingglass and what alice found therebr br the alice of the film comes from a background quite different from that of lewis carrolls alice her fresh and assertive character however is similar the movie alice begins as a young woman in new hampshire who steals money from her asspatting boss and takes off for miami vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins she encounters a middleaged couple in a motor home the husbands retired from the military who rescue her from a strange man at a roadside stop and from her cars breakdown perhaps caused by their mechanizationsbr br as it turns out the couple is heavily involved in truck stop prostitution and see sweet young alice as a promising recruit the wife played by judith ivey in a performance worthy of some big award buys alice sexy clothing and shows her how to apply hot makeup initially alice passively accepts her ministrations and with the couples instructions does several tricks the encounter shown in the most detail is quite different from most cinematic sex but may be typical of what most often happens in real life the man is shy and deferential and apologizes for finishing too fastbr br whats wonderful about alice and different from her prototypes from clarissa to sister carrie is that she learns from her experiences and asserts herself this is how things really are prostitution is everywhere people are neither all good or all bad alice leaves the motor home with her wellearned money and a feeling of mutual respect
