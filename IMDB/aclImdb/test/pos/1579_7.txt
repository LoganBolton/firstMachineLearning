guts of a beauty is a bit better than its predecessor guts of a virgin although this film isnt really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment i did find beauty to be a little stronger and better put together allthewayaround than virginbut then again thats not really saying muchbr br beauty starts off as a pretty rough and straightfaced exploit film a couple of yakuza cats are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang raping her in pretty brutal fashion as this nastiness is going on the head guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in africa and that theyre gonna do the same to her they then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more she somehow gets away and ends up at a clinic where the nurse there listens to her sob story the rapee ends up freaking out from the stress of her prior experience and commits suicide the clinic worker moved by the young ladys story decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lowerlevel guys and trying to hypnotize him to make him kill the yakuza leaders this whole plan backfires so now ms vigilanteclinicworker gets exposed to much the same treatment that our original rapee got  only worse some pretty rough buttrape ensues along with the prerequisite gang rape she too is drugged but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly hapless victim  it turns her into a raging hermaphroditic blood demon no sht thats what really happens this is when beauty really takes off with some pretty fcking insane kill scenes  including a very classy chestburstrape that looks like a cross between alien and a bad porn and my favorite  a headengulfedbydemonvagina kill complete with demon vaginaslimethat has to be seen to be believedbr br definitely some promising stuff going on in guts of a beauty but still very disjointed feeling beauty almost feels like two different films being forced together in a noncompatible way still i have to give the film credit  the rape scenes are very rough and misogynistic and the kill scenes are just totally off the wall a solid 710 for another crazy jhorror classic
