this movie i would like to say was completely great i can see how many people would think that its just a shocker film this isnt completely untrue but its as much of shocker fiction as chuck palahniuks books are one of my favorite movies of all time bijo no harawata is a certain type of crudely made movie that you can have just about any reaction to its scary funny silly gross full of offthetop material and to some people arousing the fist time i saw this it was with my friend and his mother had brought it home for him to see it he said it was just some screwed up japanese movie but i saw so much more of it its badly made yes but it has a certain type of poignancy as to be beautiful too as the director says himself this is a shocker movie made for a certain reason its like atrophy if you leave audiences soft then the entire human race is going to be soft i think this is a good philosophy and i agree with it onehundred percent bijo no harawata is the type of movie that gang rapes the hell out of fitness yogurt and all of this newwave stuff
