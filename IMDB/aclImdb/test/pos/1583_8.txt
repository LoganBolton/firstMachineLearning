i recently saw episodes 14 and now i cant wait for 5  6 to be available ive heard they are coming soon commanders log seems destined to become a cult hit among the university crowd and all others with a taste for quirky comedy its obvious that the budget was small but the care taken in crafting the script is quite evident in fact the simplicity of the show allowed me appreciate the writing and the acting more bowlsby is a master of the putdown i just wish i could remember all the best ones for later use on unsuspecting coworkers lets just say that if you dont like commanders log ill personally see to it that your undies get extra starch
