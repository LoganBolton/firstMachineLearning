i first heard about commanders log when i was on the concom for the local science fiction convention craig bowlsby linden banks sophie banks and brian oberquell came out to show the video and give a couple of panels on making tv on a shoestring budget i have to say that i was very pleased when i finally had the chance to see the show comparisons with red dwarf are inevitable since the first seasons of red dwarf were also shot on a low budget although commanders log has to set some kind of record for the least amount of money spent per minute of air time and thus have to make up for the lack of eye candy with good writing and acting linden banks who plays chief petty officer blather does a particularly good job of presenting an earnest but clueless personabr br bowlsbys original idea was for the story to be told in two minute interstitials shown in between other shows over the course of an evening although for some reason space didnt get how cool an idea this would have been and so the interstitials were all rolled up into a onehour show which space normally showed in two halfhour episodes the existing dvd doesnt include episode 3 which premiered at cascadiacon in seattle in 2005 or episode 4 which was previewed at vcon in vancouver in 2006 but if youre in touch with your local fannish community you may catch news of a showing somewhere near you
