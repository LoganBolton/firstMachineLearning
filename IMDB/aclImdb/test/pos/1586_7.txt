a kooky but funny bit of diversion you kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow whats happening but each report to earth has its own little joke pretty good special effects for a very low budget scifi tv show its fun to watch sort of in the vein of red dwarf but even more low budget for someone whos just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent because theyve been moved up the ladder of command because the other officers died also the main guys are from the laundry corps which is why they have laundry in everything if you like red dwarf youll probably like this slightly different tv concept in that all you see is the commanders report each daybr br it would be better if this were explained more not just in the very beginning of the first episode but then it was pretty hard to figure out what had happened in red dwarf too if you hadnt been told
