caution spoilersbr br although this film moved a bit slow at times the brilliant scenery richness of the characters and powerful themes make morte a venezia a rewarding experience i have not read thomas manns book but i am certain that viscontis visual splendour musical score and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice br br the study of gustav von aschenbach alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions behaviour and passion this tendency is demonstrated in the scene in germany between alfred and gustav when alfred describes music as being both mathematicalie quantifiableand emotional this conflict arises again in the scene where young tadzio is alone playing fuer elise in lobby of the hotel and gustav recalls his visit to a bordello where he is drawn to a prostitute who plays the same song in his flashback after paying the prostitute gustav is clearly physically seized by the consequences of his actions this reaction acts as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that tadzio representsbr br ultimately gustav is forced to make his biggest decision stay in venice and resign himself to his lust and temptations or flee venice to save his own life his early attempt to flee venice at the train station resulted in a futility and foreshadows the outcome of prolonging his staybr br complimenting the captivating character interaction viscontis powerful scenery especially of venice at dawn and the final scene of tadzio walking into the water and pointing to the horizon renders this film a true masterpiece
