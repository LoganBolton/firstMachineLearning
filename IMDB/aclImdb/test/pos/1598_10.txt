his music especially what we hear of it here is very slow from around the time of bachs death composers had been working out ways of making music progress at a slower and slower pace over a century later wagner and then mahler wrote pieces that are about as slow as it is possible for music to get of course one can cheat by writing a 44 march and then specifying a tempo of say semiquaver  1 but that tempo wouldnt be the correct tempo wagner and mahler wrote music that is properly played at a snails pace given that the slowness in no sense sounds too slow snails pace is the wrong expression a critic wrote of a famous wagner conductor he doesnt beat time he beats eternity for all i know this was meant as a complimentbr br i get the feeling that around the early 1970s directors worked out how to make the slowest possible films theres death in venice and theres solyaris i much prefer the former for one thing solyaris steps over the line or some line and becomes soporific death in venice is gripping from beginning to end not much happens but it all happens in the right sequence at the right pace with photography you can get lost inbr br another way of cheating with music by the way is to write something that doesnt really have a tempo at all such music sounds slow but is really just unmusical just as many films feel slow because they lack rhythm and form death in venice isnt one of them beautiful in every respect it will remind you of the timelessness and contextlessness of quality you need no theoretical knowledge to respond to viscontis mastery as you do to respond to a lesser directors incompetence its a great work
