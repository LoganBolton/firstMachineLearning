if you love chanwook park you know what to expect his films are brutal poetic tragic and artistic with splashes of very grim humor thirst is clearly parks style and i loved every second of it from the cinematography every shot is gorgeous and creative to the story which blends shakespearean tragedy murderous love gothic horror and layered character drama the characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy the direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced  like sympathy for mr vengeance there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing chanwook park is an intelligent bold consistently surprising filmmaker its unpredictable  scenes go from brutal and heartwrenching to laughoutloud hilarious in an instant this is closer to lady vengeance then sympathy for mr vengeance as far as being overthetop and comical but like lady vengeance its incredibly rich thoughtprovoking and rewardingbr br if you like beautifully told vampire stories let the right one in or are a fan of chanwook park seeing thirst should be obvious easily one of the best films of 2009
