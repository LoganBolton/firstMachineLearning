personally i can only but agree with stephen12 indulge theres really no point in trying to capture this film i like movies where nothing explicitly happens herzogs aguirre der zorn gottes has got the same nothingness though that movie is less convincing since the climaxes are rather in the beginning of the story so herzog had to focus on nature versus kinski morte a venezia is wholly different though since it has several climaxes turns etc in fact from the point where aschenbachs luggage is lost the movie almost rushes to its grand finale his final grains of sand begin running through the hourglass after the moment of bliss where he fantasises about warning the polish family and caressing tadzios hairbr br you can if you want to seek some real cluessymbols in this one his trying to leave behind his luggage from the moment he arrives the pointing tadzio at the end the fact that in the whole film content and form are completely in sinc but theres no point in doing this it wont make the film better or worse since its force lies in the whole storylines undertow which is never made explicit tons of history decaying europe the end of the romantic era as weve come to know it which has proven to be only the beginning of it individual emotions  expression are more important now than they ever were but wait now i myself am beginning to develop the one minor tiny flaw of the film the lets talk about artparts now theres one thing never to do i myself believe it could have been expressed by other means furthermore i believe it becomes already very clear in the rest of the filmbr br i dont like explicit films i can read books so i dont want a storyline that speaks merely to my rationale i prefer films that you cannot explain in words but only in film lynchs lost highway weirs picknick at hanging rock and roegs man who fell to earth also belong in this category for then and then only it has a reason to exist as film and not merely as a book so what about thomas manns novella ive never read it but forget about it the movie gives a different point of view it says things you can never say in a book it uses the movieart to make you feel through images and music the same thing that mann made you feel using text equally brilliant but different worlds
