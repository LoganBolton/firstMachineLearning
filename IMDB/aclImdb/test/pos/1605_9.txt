from the first to the last scene of the movie director visconti excels at his art to the extent that the movie is ensured to remain as a cultural treasure for only god knows how long it is perfection  as a movie that is but the story has some minor shortcomingsbr br thomas manns novel is also a perfect piece of art so of course it is impossible to bring into another media visconti follows the story pretty much and it is only when he allows himself to deviate slightly that the transition falters and no matter how wonderful the scenery is the tension in the air between the characters the hundreds of subtle signals and allegories the almost unbearably heightened serving of mahlers music  still the minute anomalies in the plot disturb mebr br maybe im just a victim of mans desire to flaw the flawless nevertheless i will offer one example which i regard as crucialbr br warning spoilersbr br in manns story aschenbach eats the strawberries which probably contain the disease that will kill him after giving up his frustrated chase of the boy tadzio in venice unable to catch one delight he settles for another  which poisons him it is very subtle in the book but it is there the forbidden fruit of sorts but more a sign of him surrendering life itselfbr br in viscontis film he also eats strawberries but in a rather insignificant scene by the beach the chase in venice ends in a much more melodramatic way it works too but lacks some subtlety indeed and also the multilayered symbolism giving food for thoughtbr br but thats all forgiven when the film allows us to feast on beautiful sceneries faces and constellations and certainly as many other symbols as we can possibly digest  the last gesture of tadzio standing in the water being the equally sublime and mysterious finale
