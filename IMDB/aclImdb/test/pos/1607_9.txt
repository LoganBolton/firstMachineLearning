i cant quite explain why i find this so alluring and the leopard not it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film those intimate moments that visconti can render so magnificently like that film it has a majestically slow pace but this time it isnt overlong its the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that i think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own ministory like the leopard it has a sympathetic lead who brings out the same kind of worn pathos  though bogards performance is more willing to open itself to being unlikable especially in look he has a really stupid grin thats easy to dislike its often quite beautiful in the quiet moments its the opulence of viscontis films the grandeur of the ball scenes that i find tedious as they exchange individual clarity with mass precision but here that is part of the point  gustav surrounded by a visual dinbr br the way in which the object of gustavs affection is introduced to us is quite brilliant  the camera shows a girl girl girl then this beautiful femininefeatured boy its like an allusion to shakespeares sonnets and it doesnt feel heavyhanded its not until the camera views tadzio fully pulls back and we see his long slender legs that we realize he is not a boy but an adolescent  at first were forced to question gustavs attraction in an uncomfortable way visconti must have known that and he doesnt shy away from it visconti is extremely patient with gustav we get a sense of the man we know him its a largely silent performance and when he does open his mouth its to spew venom no wonder he wants the angelic openfeatured boy to project himself onto theres a difference with tadzio we never know him just as we never know a handful of fellini grotesques but thats because his life is another its own film but its not as flirtatious as its been made to seem there is one scene however where he twirls around a pole thats too much tadzio isnt necessarily leading him on  hes looking at him visconti just zooms in is allbr br the film doesnt detail gustav as being gay  tadzio isnt even really male hes a prettified version of a boy delicate pale wispy with golden locks that everyone seems to love including one gorgeous slightly older young man who he wrestles with the closest they go to showing what could be understood as a reference to gustavs homosexuality is the famous barber scene which unlocks his repressed vanitybr br it isnt totally successful  the whole section with alfred is a waste and some unnecessary scenes people carrying bags in long shot could have been excised some parts are heavyhanded such as when gustavs boat pulls in and rowdy boys pass him by  the looks on his face are too obvious but during the same scene gustav throws a fit wanting a new rower something so unexplainable that it makes up for it but there are some scenes  touching for the first time  that build up a remarkable quiet intensity tadzio repeating a piano song again and again the notes quivering in the air may be the best example of the anxiety the film has there is one discussion that contains a debate im especially interested can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses or does it have to go beyond them we can consider tarkovsky who esteems both visconti and mann to be the prime example of someone going beyond mere sensory sensations i think this one manages to do both 910
