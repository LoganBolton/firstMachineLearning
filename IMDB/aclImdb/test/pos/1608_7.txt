in luchino viscontis film death in venice it is not only the beauty in the surrounding world that decays but in the pursuit of beauty itself gustav von aschenbach decays into a mere shell of a man to understand the decay we must acknowledge the beauty which enchants us it is best described and explained in a quote from socrates found in thomas manns version of death in venice beauty alone is lovely and visible at once it is the sole aspect of the spiritual which we can perceive through our senses else whatif the divine if reason and virtue and truth were to speak to us through the senses should we not perish and become consumed by love we see in the film this very thing happen the man becomes enveloped by a longing for beauty which turns into a longing for the boy tadzio even though the levelheaded part of his mind tells him that adoration of beauty can lead to sensuousness and abandon he cannot contain himself br br it would be easy to describe this as a beautiful film early on we see the extravagance of the parlor and we are treated to a perfect summarization of turnofthe century upper class life all captured on film perfectly by cinematographer pasqualino de santis but visconti does not indulge in the picturesque aspects of venice instead the glorious and sensuous artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensuous beauty and these things are relegated to the past the city we know to be of incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a leisure resort with a nosy hotel staff the streets become exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting filth and rot the city decays in step with the protagonist only through the flashbacks are we allowed a glimpse of why this famous composer is a frail and innocuous man the death of his daughter and presumably his wife along with the failure of his music allow us to understand why he is destroying himself br br alfred with whom aschenbach has in depth conversations on the meaning of beauty and who can create it but alfred is more than a friend he is aschenbachs alterego and what alfred says articulates the composers own doubts and fears the scene in which aschenbach decides to leave venice is immediately followed by a clip of alfred telling him that he is weak alienated and lacks feelings in the end we might be able to conclude that these flashbacks are not reality at all it is a decay of memory rather than objective renderings of the past these flashbacks become distorted memories we can say that these are decayed memories because even aschenbach alludes to it he declares reality distracts and degrades us and following the scene in the travel agents office we see aschenbach confront tadzio and his family and warn them  leave venice but directly after the encounter we see him sitting with the clerk again and realize it was all in his imagination he employs long scenes without dialogue that are framed by the poignant music of gustav mahler he allows the viewers mind to wander as we watch aschenbachs life and respectability decay with the beauty around him br br slowly the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by exhaustion that is mixed with a growing awareness that the town is suffocating in filth the crumbling city sets the stage for the middle aged mans attraction to tadzio it is romantic longing for something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed even in fantasy the beauty of this polish boy kindles a fire in him that at first makes him glow then consumes him the film concludes with von aschenbach sitting feebly in a beach chair watching tadzio fight with his friend we see the black dye from his hair running down on his cheek and it looks like rotten blood it is a vision of his lifes expiring moments though before his last breath the final decay has happened all around him the city is soiled and with it he has become what he detests as aschenbach dies he has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film a man that had disturbed him it was the pursuit of beauty that initiated his decay in the pursuit of artistic beauty he could not sense his own demise and that of the city around him his sensuality is indulged in while constantly kept in check by the presence of death and decay it is these three themes that tie the damned and death in venice together beauty death and decay these themes are viscontis art the beauty of his work is in the decay of beauty itself br br in this film we are treated to the deliquescence of one great man we see the honored composer gustav von aschenbach in the pursuit of true and pure beauty and it is in the pursuit of this trait that it decays all around him and leads him to a miserable lonely death watching the target of his affection i believe that through these movies visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful cannot last decay is intrinsic in the world around us and when we become distracted it can destroy the splendor in death in venice it is because of culture and through the pursuit of beauty that all is deleted beauty and deliquescence are woven together like thorns in viscontis works at once beautiful and destructive it is these themes that define his art
