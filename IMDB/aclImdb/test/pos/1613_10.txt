cinemas greatest period started in postwar europe with italys neorealist movement during the next 2 or 3 decades that followed frances new wavers caught everyones attention and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces but in 1971 luchino visconti brought the artform to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous work death in venice which might as well be called the death of europoean cinema after the sixties wound down so did the great european filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new american generation of movie brats coppola scorsese  co this movie absolutely feels like a grand summingup not just of viscontis particular obsessions but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies and rest assured you will find no sterner taskmaster than the visconti revealed here hes not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind the pacing is a challenge slow but never without emotional weight incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturmunddrang cosmosbr br we will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies one of the centurys great writers who inspired the tale thomas mann one of the greatest filmmakers directing it visconti one of the greatest actors in the lead role dirk bogarde and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background gustav mahlers 5th symphony taking full advantage of mahlers ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast visconti changes the main character aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer even making bogarde up to look like mahler geeky mustache specs shaggy hair ducklike walk bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies its a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance  a difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpsebr br cinema just doesnt get better than this ill ignore the complaints from the ritalinaddicts out there who say that its too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbachs flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced the flashbacks fit neatly within the movies thematic concerns ie which is the better path to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway a nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture but this movie is actually about something and what its mostly about is suffering romantic capital r suffering in particular as a suffering romantic himself visconti knew whereof he spokebr br spoiler    i guess if for nothing else see death in venice for its portentous opening credits    and for its unforgettable ending with bogardes jetblack hairdye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalkwhite face meanwhile off in the distance young tadzio the object of bogardes dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture the climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty death in venice is a miraculous work of art br br dvd tip as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece the damned i recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie its ostensibly in english but the dvds sound seems muddy and theres a lot of italian spoken during the film anyway br br
