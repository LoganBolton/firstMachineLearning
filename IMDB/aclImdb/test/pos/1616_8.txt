i bought this dvd from walmart for cheap thinking it would be a typical crap straighttovideo monster junk but it turned out much better than expected there isnt really any criticism to say about it its obviously low budget but that just adds to the cheesy old fashioned fun its very cool and entertainingbr br theres everything horror sex a great plane crash and good characters and id say its pretty original cuz it really doesnt come off as any other movie ive seen it has its own unique look which i liked very much thats why this film deserves credit i look forward to seeing more of these awesome movies from the scare master brett piper whom ive never heard before this onebr br the dvd menu is really creative with groovy music playing over it so its perfect just to keep it on when youre not yet ready to sit down and watch it it also includes some special features which are really interesting but we never get to see the director or hear him in the commentary must be shy this comes out of edgewood studios in vermont usa i highly recommend it to all horror buffs youll love it
