ok i am a sucker i loved it i had no expectations and had them all fulfilled it was a terrible movie i loved it i have managed to wear out a dvd from over use no one can understand my obsession i cant either to tell the truth for those who have seen the movie this will come as no surprise but i asked the clerk at the video store if i could buy a copy and i could because there were two in stock and only one had been check out and over half of the time it had been to mebr br now the movie is terrible the special effects are terrible the acting is terrible but i loved it the actors are silly the plot silly the goofs numerouslike being able to see through the monsters the arachnids looked like they were made out of plastic garbage bags maybe they were there was light underground tnt wasnt deafening etcbr br you must really love bmovies to get any enjoyment out of thisalcohol helps enormously for others
