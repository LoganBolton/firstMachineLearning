first i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da vinci code sure you have the religion vs science problem but it doesnt try to make a big statement about it its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well one scene particularly that involves fire i found extremely well done br br second the changes from book to film although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others i gotta admit i was wrong it was refreshing that the film didnt follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in da vinci if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though however the big twist is still there so dont worry about that finally im glad they removed some silly subplots and didnt even try to hint at the possibility of langdon and vittoria getting together br br the performances are really good but nothing out of the ordinary thats okay for a film like this br br id give it a 910 mainly because it delivers what it promises entertainment pure entertainment
