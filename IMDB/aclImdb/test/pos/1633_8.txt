where da vinci code introduced us to dr robert langdon and his knack for solving puzzles angels and demons ups the ante by providing a huge puzzle with an 8 hour limitbr br with a cast of award winning actors ron howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept the da vinci code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break would leave you a bit confused on return i didnt feel this was with angels and demons the plot was straightforward and the action kept the interest level peaked throughoutbr br cardinal strauss armin muellerstahl was easily my favorite character in the movie his portrayal of the elitist yet misunderstood rank of the catholic church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment camerlengo patrick mckenna ewan mcgregor you will find yourself choosing sides immediately upon introduction there isnt a great amount of tom hanks time as the film focuses more on story than character development and this did well with me being that i had more than enough introduction from the first moviebr br unfortunately i found ayelet zurers character vittoria vetra to be an unnecessary femme assistant in the quest since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an afterthought she does play a key role in the beginning of things but she soon fades into the background of being langdons familiar moreso than a necessary partnerbr br the plot is as such one of the organizations that the catholic church wronged in the past there have been quite a few has sought revenge in a most artistic manner some men of the church are kidnapped and are set to be executed at specific times until an ultimate end to the church itself will happen dr robert landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and teams up with the beautiful vittoria vetra a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the churchs enemybr br music staying relevant and the cinematography beautiful i could chime on about this menial things but what makes angels and demons absolutely work is its conclusion it was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings i have seen in a movie and i was impressed at how offguard i was when it hit me like anyone else i appreciate a great wrapup and this movie wraps it up quite tight and drops a pretty bow on it needless to say i left the theater pleased at the movie in its entiretybr br if you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your catholic principles i can say that where the davinci code painted catholicism as a shady coverup group of sadists angels and demons paints them with a much lighter brush the church is shown as being a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even a few who have infiltrated their modern ranks
