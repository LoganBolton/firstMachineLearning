this definitely the most tension filled xfiles episode of the first season this episode is what i think of when i hear xfiles the plot is simple but exiting our main cast plus a few scientist go to investigate an alskan outpost in which its research team appears to have killed each other it turns out a small parasite that got dug up from the ice had infected the research team the parasite attaches itself to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity soon none can tell who they can trust or whos infected or notbr br this episode was a direct tribute to john carpenters great horror film the thing the thing is set in antarctica and a team of scientist find a destroyed outpost in which its occupant have been killed or killed themselves an alien that had been buried in the ice for a 10000 years had been thawed out it has the abilities to imitate any life form therefore the main characters can no longer distinct friends from foesbr br believe me the thing is one of the most exiting and tension filled horror movies youll ever see if you liked the episode ice i advice you to see it or if you have only seen the thing i advice you to see icebr br ice is the best direct tributehomage to john carpenters the thing i have ever seen and it lives up to its inspiration as one of the best xfiles episodes i give it a 1010
