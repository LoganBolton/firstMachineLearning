this isnt a bad tv movie shtrafbat is short for shtrafnoy batallion which means penal batallion such battallions were formed due to the increasing demand for soldiers as the soviet union was taking heavy casualties all through out the war these battalions consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who were given the chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat they were looked down upon as scum and were expended easily during combat without much regret or much honor on the part of military they were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties the ones who refused to fight were executed on sight needless to say their lives suckedbr br there were some very nice performances by the cast especially by yuri stepanov who played antip aleksandr bashirov who played stirah and roman madyanov who played major kharchenko however the series isnt really that addictive in part because its too long it couldve a lot shorter and as effectivebr br although its about war shtrafbat has very mild violence and pretty much no gore it relies solely on the actors to make it work and after all its a tv series so the producers didnt want to scare off the viewers and the sponsorsbr br shtrafbat explores the cruelty of the soviet regime and explaines why so many men chose to fight the nazis instead of joining them personally id rather be a fascist then a communist given the circumstances presented in the film one character explains that the soviets stripped his farm clean and his family died of starvation out of anger he burned it down which got him arrested for destroying kolhoz property and he ended up in the penal battalion as a criminal antip reminisced on how his mother killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family both men explained that they fought for their motherland rather than the for the sovietsbr br the penal battalion had one marinenaval infantry who raped a girl killing his comrade in the prosess threatened his other comrade to keep his mouth shut about both ordeals and then feigned injury when it came to fighting on top of all that the girl committed suicide due to shame i imagine if enough marines watched this movie theyd pick up banners and riot on the streets calling for a boycott or an official apology from the producersbr br to say the least id recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in the former soviet union or world war ii i dont think i wasted 500 minutes of my life
