rififi directed by jules dassin is in line with the melville crime pictures particularly bob le flameur and to a point le cercle rouge of being totally focused on story and character and making sure not a word is spoken that doesnt need and was ahead of its time ionically it still has a kind of professionalism among its characters a kind of respect if not for selves than for others a kind of duty that rings well in postww2 france its actors carry faces for these characters that say we know what these guys are about and from there the story takes off maybe its because i have a weak spot for heist pictures particularly where we see just the nuts and bolts err actual physical side of how a heist is pulled offbr br one of the problems with how the actual heist is filmed in todays movies is that its all very fast ie snatch or done in ways weve seen too many times before dassin like melville years later decided to create practically a silent film of a heist sound effects included the tension that builds up in this scene may not top what melville had in rouge but on its own level it achieves its own greatness and momentum and just as crucial originality to whats been done before there are some kept closeups for example as the safe is being cracked that mark some of the best ive seen from france at that time an added plus for the film aside from the larvalstage newwave touch to the film which in the end makes it a little more modern is that the story works so well and differently it becomes completely about character at points and then keeps up the thrills the last ten to fifteen minutes are downright miraculous like with another classic heist picture the asphalt jungle its not even the last stop that matters but all about how much one will go past the call of duty putting humanism over greedbr br you almost wonder in all the exhilaration of the camera flying by the trees at a high speed with the car that he might just make it dassin has here a very entertaining and intuitive film of its genre with a nifty little musical number as well
