what a gas of a movie film noir has always been one of my favorite genres but this one stands apart from the rest only the big sleep out of the past murder my sweet and the killers can come close to this caper classic i know these four american films i mentioned are not caper movies per se but rather detective stories with complicated story lines which still exude a noirean gritty quality about them similar to rififibr br what is different here is the way jules dassin sets into motion the total ambiance of the film not only in the gritty realism of the principals but also in the usage of the streets of paris as a subliminal character and coconspirator unto itself the movie centers around le stephanois a dark moody and complicated excon getting pulled into one last shot at the hefty payoff even though he is an unsmiling and hardnosed tough guy one still senses in him a yearning for some kind of redemption by extricating himself from the demons of his past hey he saved little toni dassin picked the right guy jean servais for that rolebr br that aside the rest of the story development kind of falls into place as we journey through the famous silent caper scene to the the eventual demise of the principal perps only their women survive except for ida marios honey they seemed to best understand the underlying futility of it all
