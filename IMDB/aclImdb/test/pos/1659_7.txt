this 1955 heist film follows tony le stephanois recently released from prison for theft as he undertakes the robbery of his life he teams up with his old heist buddies and they bring in an expert safecracker cesar from milan played by jules dassin who also directed he only directed because he had been blacklisted as a communist in the us and couldnt work in hollywood the brilliance of this film is the 12 hour during the robbery during all this time there is no dialogue and no music only the muted sounds of digging through the floor or drilling the safe this increases the suspense and draws you in they get away with several hundred million francs worth of jewels but a jewel offered to a dancer by cesar brings their haul to the attention of a trio of brutal brothers they set out to get the stash for themselves and bring misfortune in their wake great heistgangster movie but i prefer jp melvilles films in this genrebr br this movie is like some lemonade i had last night i had gone to a caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugar cane juice instead of sugar it also had a lot of ice and was heavy on the lemons leaving it fairly sour which i like the sugar cane juice imparted a subtle slightly more mellow taste to it than actual sugar and the ice made sure it was cold and refreshing as i sucked it down 7510 httpblogmyspacecomlocoformovies
