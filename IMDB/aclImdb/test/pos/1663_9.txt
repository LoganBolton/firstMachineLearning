its a mystery to me as to why i havent caught up to this masterful 50s caper film Â– turned brooding noir until now but im certainly glad to report that it didnt disappoint i havent seen any of jules dassins american films for several years but based on this ill probably be going back and rewatching brute force and night and the city quite soonbr br jean servais a name unknown to me but a face rather familiar in its worldweariness and coldness has recently completed a lengthy stay in prison and as is the way in these films hey there wouldnt be a story otherwise isnt coping well with the straight life an opportunity presents itself an easy multimilliondollar jewel heist that can be done at night with no fear of discovery by a few men the taut filming of the robbery half an hour of total silence is what people most remember about the film of course and indeed its pretty remarkable but i liked the halfcompleted location of the final shootout once the robbery has gone sour thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves the excellent portrayal gritty sides of paris in stark black and white and servais channeling of both eddie constantine and humphrey bogart in his spare but brutal performancebr br perhaps its a bit too sentimental in the end but this is one of those classics that really does live up to its reputation just as pure entertainment even if what it has to say about the human condition isnt exactly deep or thoughtprovoking george aurics at turns modernist romantic and jazzy score is another highlight
