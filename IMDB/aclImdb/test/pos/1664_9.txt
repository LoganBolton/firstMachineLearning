i have been wanting to see this since my french teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago perhaps the long wait was worth it since the criterion collection dvd restoration is impressivebr br in its outline this movie follows the timeworn script a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault the heist takes place a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all even though the heist footage is transfixing it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film this film separates itself from the typical heist movie by giving us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations  its plays as much as a drama as it does a thriller relationships play a big role and a kidnapping is tacked on giving us two movies for the price of onebr br john servais plays the idea man tony le stéphanois always referred to as le stéphanois with such worldweariness that he could have just stepped out of a camus novel tony has just recently gotten out of jail and resists reentering the life of crime until he has a highly unpleasant interaction with his exlover who has taken up with another man where as punishment he physically whips her with a belt thankfully that scene occurs off camera but you are not likely to forget it after that sobering event since there seems little hope of reviving that relationship tony meets with two of his old partners in crime jo and mario and decides to join them in one last big heist they enlist the services of cesar an italian safe cracker  played by director dassin himself  and we are off to the heistbr br the heist goes off without a hitch but cesars womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned however we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he has fallen for since there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub act  it has to be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir filmbr br it is established early on that tony has a close relationship with jo and his family in fact jos son refers to him as uncle i think it is partly to help jos family that tony agrees to the heist the ending scenes where tony saves the life of jos kidnapped son partially redeems his more brutal and amoral actions but only partially
