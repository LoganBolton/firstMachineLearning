after seeing naked city and night and the city which is still my favorite dassin i was more than excited to watch his masterpiece oword criterion rififibr br now i am a little bit disappointed about the storybr br so i have at least these five questions in my mindbr br 1 in the final countdown louis grutter shot from the inside a house the main character tony le st√©phanois he couldnt know if he is still alive or not but he didnt care about it and ran directly after it outside the house with the money to reach his car so of course tony wasnt dead and shot him big questionmarkbr br 2 in another important scene the specialist in safes cesar gave directly after the robbery as a present a diamond ring which was a part of the robbery a woman which was working for louis grutter in a night bar stupid because before this character wasnt that stupid and of course louis knew directly that tony planned the jewel robbery small questionmarkbr br 3after the gangsters behind louis grutter murder mario ferrati and his wifetony and his best friend joe planned a revenge against louis gang at the same time they dont care for the security of joes wife and his five years old child of course louis gang kidnapped the son cheap and simplebr br 4 the perfect heist of course this is the best 30min long scene in the whole plot without any word spoken in the whole time but was this a perfect heist comparing with other movies which handle with this theme i could only smile when for example tony was taken a fireextinguisher to banned the alarm also too simplebr br 5 the grutter gang went to the house of mario because they knew however the jewels will be there then they murder mario and his wife and then they are not searching for it no they ran directly out of the apartment and more they not observing the apartment after it so tony can go after a while which was the same day inside to take the jewels big questionmarkbr br over all its a good movie because of the brilliant 30min silent heist scene because of the very good cut the end scene in the car through paris is stunning  because of a very good actor called jean servais because of this blackwhite fever you will get while watching it because of some other reasons too other user wrote about but please dont tell me this is a stunning story
