story about three eclipse maybe even indigo ha children beginning their love for murder oh and the people who are hot on their trailbr br bloody birthday a pretty mediocre title for the film was a nice lil surprise i was in no way expecting a film that dealt with bloodthirsty psychopath kids and i may say its also one of the best flicks ive seen with kids as the villains by the end of the movie i seriously wanted these kids to die in horrible fashionbr br its a really solid 80s horror flick but how these kids are getting away with all this mayhem and murder is just something that you cant not think about even the slightest bit of investigation would easily uncover these lil shts as the murderers but there seems to be only a couple police in town well by the end only one and he seemed like a dimwit so i suppose they could have gotten away with it haha yeah and im a chinese jetpilotbr br nevertheless this movie delivered some evilass kids who were more than entertaining a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage no kiddin if youre put off by the less than stellar title dash it from your mind and give this flick a shot its a very recommendable and underrated 80s horror flick
