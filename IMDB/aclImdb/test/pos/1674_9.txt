the minutiae of whats involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all heist movies then theres the robbery itself a wordless thirty minute nailbiter that has never been surpassed followed by what is probably the cinemas most pronounced example of dishonor among thieves as things begin to spectacularly unravel and we have what is unquestionably the greatest of all heist moviesbr br this was a tough and unsentimental film when it first appeared in 1955 and it is just as tough and unsentimental today it displays some of the edgy brutality of dassins earlier brute force there isnt a flabby moment or duff performance in the entire film and dassin captures the milieu of seedy clubs and parisian back streets like noone else and the final drive through paris by a dying man is one of the most iconic closing sequences of any movie a classic
