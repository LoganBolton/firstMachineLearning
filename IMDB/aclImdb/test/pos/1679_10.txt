rififi deservedly gets a lot of mention for the famous heist scene and indeed that scene deserves all the credit it gets its a masterful piece of suspense character interaction and photography but rififi isnt just this one scene  every scene in the film is as masterfully put together and as a whole the film is not only taught with suspense plot and character but an adroitly told moral tale that set the scene for film noire for years to comebr br cinematically and technically the heist sequence may be the most impressive scene of the film but for me its the final scene that holds the most power  tony le st√©phanoiss hallucinogenic drive towards redemption
