du rififi chez les hommesrififi1955 can on the surface be described as a french variation on john hustons seminal heist film asphalt jungle1950 the difference between the two films is rififi1955 pays a little more attention in detail to the robbery sequence also the police arent involved in the aftermath of the robbery in rififi as much as in asphalt jungle in the end rififi1955 is in my opinion a slightly better film than asphalt jungle1950 remarkable noir picture that defines 1950s french cinemabr br spartacus1960 may have been the one which broke down the infamous blacklist but in my opinion rififi1955 was the film that began to break apart the unbreakable hollywood blacklist first film in five years for jules dassin who was victimized by the mccarthy communist hunt of the late 40s to early 50s he got some sort of retribution when rififi1955 became a success around france and europe thus defying the poisonious hollywood blacklist in a major way that probably inspired others to do the same rififi1955 is the most important film of dassins career because it not only restored his name but also gave him a second chance at making filmsbr br jules dassin gave the filmworld and its ever growing audiences a masterpiece of influential proportions his handling of the material is exceptional and direction of the actors is flawless builds up tense situations with precise craftsmanship dassin came full circle in the film noir genre by directing his best and last noir rififi1955 marked the end of dassins period in filmmaking when he was involved in doing noir picturesbr br rififi1955 is the number one film in an arsenal of thirty plus films for director jules dassin a masterpiece in acting cinematography directing editing and writing not a film to leave your seat for one minute because there is always something memorable going on as brilliant as anything by jean pierre melville who was a master of this type of film masterpieces such as rififi1955 are relatively small compared to the probably billions of films made in motion picture historybr br the one fascinating aspect of rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up a bulk of the 118 minute duration the main characters plan and execute the jewel heist in the same way a film director prepares for the preproductions production and postproduction of a film shows how difficult a jewel heist like in rififi1955 is in committing and why very few would do something like it the fact that the scene hardly contains a mess up like in other heist films turns this scene into something even greater close as one can get to having a perfect sequence in a motion picturebr br lack of unnatural sound in the landmark thrity minute heist sequence puts it in a realm of absolute realism any dialogue orand music would ruin any suspense and tension the director is trying to create the use of natural sound makes the heist sequence a rewarding film viewing experience now filmmakers and producers would use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of a lack of confidence of a mainstream filmgoers patience sustains a level of consistency that never once lets downbr br maintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the heist sequence tick to perfection the director achieves suspense in the heist sequence thats rarely equaled in most robbery scenes from heist films jean servais and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with some low key acting getting suspense put in a scene is a task few are capable of doing the robbery sequence of rififi1955 reaches a hitchcockian level of suspense and tensionbr br many filmmakers from the years following du rififi chez les hommes1955 have been influenced if not inspired by it one filmmaker influenced was jean pierre melvilleoriginal choice for director of rififiwho used variations of the heist sequence in le doulos1961 and le cercle rouge1970 another filmmaker influenced was stanley kubrick who made a similarly themed film in the killing1956 also quentin tarantino whose debut feature reservoir dogs1992 was inspired by this film other film directors influenced are john woo michael mann paul schrader ringo lam etcbr br du rififi chez les hommes1955 is comparable to bob le flambeur1955 in many ways one jules dassin and jean pierre melville directed groundbreaking films in rififi1955 and bob le flambeur1955 two each film involves an aging criminal who plans and carries out a daring heist three bob le flambeur and rififi finishes in fatalistic fashion four each film shares many motifs and situations that classify the two as film greatsbr br part of rififis charm are the colorful characters that surround the story such as tony le stephanois jo le suedois mario farrati and cesar le milanais most of the violence is implicit yet effectively brutal the main characters led by tony le stephanois abide by a strong outdated code of honor that is remindful of sam peckinpah and john woo jean servais becomes the role of tony le stephanois with his cynical outlook and tired looks du rififi chez les hommesrififi1955 became a favorite of mine the moment i saw it on the big screen from beginning to end
