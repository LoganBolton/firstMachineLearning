i was amazed at the quality of this film particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director  all 140 lbs of him truly a boy directing a movie about a boy i look forward to seeing more luke eberl filmsbr br i did think this one was a bit too long there was too much time spent showing connor being unsuccessful and unwilling to make a move on owen caleb didnt try hard enough owen being so young could have easily become closer to caleb and later decided it wasnt his preference and owen would still have learned the valuable lesson about corruption and politics instead he didnt give himself a fair chance to learn about his sexuality and what about poor caleb owen could have been a good influencebr br though the film intends to show owen as a hero who overcomes perverted corruption i felt sad for owen he was offered the opportunity to have some boyboy fun with caleb who was extraordinarily beautiful owen didnt have to go along with the political perversion as offered but he could have tried to have some fun with caleb and still walked away when he wanted it was clear that owen was in charge  no one forced him to do anything he didnt want to do but he could have had more fun and with a very hot boyfriend at thatbr br i hope luke makes more movies where appealing young characters have more fun
