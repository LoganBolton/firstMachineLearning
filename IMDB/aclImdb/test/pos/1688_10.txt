when i first saw this movie back in the middle of january 2005 i didnt like it i thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star judith light acted were so unlike her which of course is true and then i watched bits of it the next day when it reaired and i felt pretty much the same then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing i even cried the first 2 times but mainly because the actress was actually crying and i am a big fan of hersbr br it is a very well acted and done tv movie judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film i keep watching it over and over its a sad movie but very goodbr br if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it its not usually my type of movie but i did enjoy this one a
