this movie is not as bad as some say it is infact i think its more enjoyable than the original  maybe thats why some people hate it as much cos they dont want to admit its a good not great moviebr br most if not all fx were done by cgi which i didnt mind at all cos it was an enjoyable movie phil buckman  chris was in my opinion the best guy in the movie julie delpy was rather attractive she brought the sexiness to the moviebr br there were a lot of wisecracks in the movie which i thought were good this movie is in my collection but the original is not because i dont like it as much as this one i was not bored when i watched this movie it kept me watching unlike some horror movies i could mention like oh say  driller killer  suspiria dario argentos movie thats to name but twobr br this is an ok werewolf film it should be in peoples collection if they like werewolf movies maybe ill get the original at some point maybe i have only one complaint and that is phil buckman  chris should have been in it more than he was but apart from that the movie was finebr br rating for this movie 810 an ok werewolf movie not the worst one out therebr br
