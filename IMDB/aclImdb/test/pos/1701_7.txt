ok most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake but at the same time its also a different movie in its own right dont get me wrong american werewolf in london is a superior film but american remake in paris is a decent movie as wellbr br first off the only real similarities are the title 2 american backpackers and werewolves other than those 3 things american remake in paris stands apart fairly well on its own with its special blend of humor actionadventure and horror most of the people who say this film is better than the original are the youth of todays generation that think any movie made before 1990 is total crap while those of us who grew up in the 80s can appreciate older films and what they have added to the horror films of today what a lot of people fail to realize is that without the old classic films including the bw ones horror wouldnt be what it is today now im getting a little off the beaten pathbr br an american werewolf in paris is a good attempt at recreating a classic but it will never surpass the original ever with that said this is still a very entertaining film to watch and i do recommend it im giving it a 7 out of 10 maybe thats being a little generous but ive seen much worse attempts at trying to recreate a classic
