i just finished a double feature night of an american werewolf in london  paris let me start by saying london still holds up after all these years and the transformation sequence is by any standard quite impressive the film was funny and scary also a bit of gorenow lets get to paris its enjoyable a few scars lots of gore not as exciting or eerie as original but it does have a few laughs in what has become quite the fashion these days in films so maybe in that sense it was ahead of its time the transformations ala cgi while good for the technology of its time are nowhere near as impressive as the original i gave this movie a 7 because i have to admit it was enjoyable i laughed a lot and found tom everett scott to be so silly that at first i wanted to dislike his performance only to end up liking itgo figurejulie delpy was competent as was the direction its the script that lacked a bit of shine  finesse i read here that john landis was supposed to direct to bad he didnt i am quite sure it would have been a different movie altogether i also noticed some discussion of a sequel what if well no one has noted the obvious it should be in american and here is my title an american werewolf comes home or in dc that would be fun all those political dogs need a good scare you simply must see the original in its new dvd transfer with dolby 51 sound and see both of these on an hdtv with upconvert turned onnice
