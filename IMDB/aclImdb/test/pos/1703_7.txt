the title suggests that this movie is a sequel to an american werewolf in london none of the characters from the previous movie return and arent even mentioned in this movie by name so as a sequel aawip fails one would saybr br i dare to say the oppositebr br an american werewolf in paris is a charming effective horror movie its one of the better werewolf films i have seen in a long time too and i have seen quite my share such as an american werewolf in london the howling wolfen the wolfman and the underworld trilogybr br the story tells of three americans visiting paris on a vacation at the top of the eifel tower one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide what starts out as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealedbr br i really liked the acting in this film especially the two stars of the movie the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her they have good chemistry together but the other two americans also play their roles nicely i didnt really find anything annoying about the acting so thumbs up for that br br the effects on the werewolves are nice it doesnt look too cheap or fake to me of course the opinions are divided about this subject but lets just say that i wasnt disappointedbr br theres also a good amount of humor in this movie there are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long timebr br so to sum it up an american werewolf in paris might not be a direct sequel to its predecessor but its still an enjoyable movie perfect for fans of werewolves 7 out of 10 stars
