i have mixed emotions about this film especially as it compares to its forerunnerbr br an american werewolf in london that film had its funny moments it was still more of horror tale than anything else this updated version now set in paris does not have that edge at all and simply isnt in the same classbut it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall its still fun to watch br br so werewolf purists aside most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the london version ill still give it decent marks since i dont care what others think i liked it even though i agree london is better and i prefer that version too br br the first 3040 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a balloon in a restaurant it also introduces the lead female character played by julie delpy i dont see enough of this actress she doesnt seem to make that many films or least ones i hear about over here in america this french actress has a face that is classic beauty so the film got points for having her in it and she looks greatbr br when the horror starts it can get scary and the special effects are good i also liked the lack of profanity in this film unlike the first one no fwords and no lords name in vain  amazingbr br however there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me the soundtrack is heavy metal which isnt appealing to a middleaged guy like me either this film is geared a lot more toward 20somethings if that helps anyonebr br its entertainingjust dont expect it to live up to the first film
