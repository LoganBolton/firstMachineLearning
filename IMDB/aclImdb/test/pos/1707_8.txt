tia carrere was the reason i decided to watch this film as neither the title nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film  which goes to show me and everyone that a dvd shouldnt be judged by its coverbr br spoilers the film felt like it was trundling along not really going anywhere for the moment  the awkwardness of paul faber zak orth around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch and the fringe on the otherwise attractive kirsten beck as alexondra lee being too schoolgirlish to watch where those really fashionable in 1995br br the relationship between vicky mueller tia carrere and todd boomer jason london was tantalising from the start of though that first meeting across the lake  magical what a beautiful coincidence they should meet again just as he has behaved like a complete moron boomer with two os as in moron in front of alexondra a shame really that we as the audience knew who vicky mueller really was well the title did give that away wouldnt you thinkbr br what really surprised me was the acting especially in the scene where vicky gives todd a metal version of his alter ego the dog character in the little white jewellery box the actors really managed to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss  point of no return for todd and vicky a shame really that the film ends with focus on after getting over todds fathers harvard drive his reuniting with his friends i could envision a whole new film  following vicky to new york  there must be a good art university there that todd could attendbr br nevertheless a film that does just what we want hollywood to entertain us for the duration of the film did anyone else notice how none of the loves are happy ones in this film todds mother is slightly insane on the phone 247 his dad doesnt find her attractive any more todds teacher obviously is disenchanted by his wife and vice versa  todd himself enters into a wonderfully erotic  daring relationship which however nice it may be would realistically be very difficult to maintain age difference maturity difference etc and alexondra  zak do not get together because alexondra is not mature enough to handle a relationship  her reactions towards the condom the cheating zaks advances etc are all very immature and often involve running away and zak himself the poor guy  is too much of a best friendlike a brotherguy to pull even alexondrabr br mind you good film though i gave it an 810 brilliant performance by the actors  who bring the script to life
