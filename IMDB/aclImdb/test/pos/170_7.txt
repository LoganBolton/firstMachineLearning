sorry about the extremely clever summary phrase i dont know what i was thinking but i really couldnt help myselfbr br ive been meaning to see bloody birthday for a long time and i must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price and believe me i live in a small south american village and these things are very unlikely to happen its a real shame that some of these gems from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten bloody birthday is one of those movies that surprisingly ages well enough to remain watchable nowadays not a masterpiece for sure but still entertaining and guess what it doesnt really have unintentionally funny scenes i know its a shocker if we keep in mind that this is a low budget flick from the early 80s about a group of evil children who kill people but trust me the movie manages to remain respectable and watchable for the most partbr br in blood birthday the story revolves around three children who are born during a a total eclipse according to astrology during eclipses the sun and the moon block saturn which controls emotions as a consequence the three children who are born that day eventually become uncaring and evil since they dont experience any feelings of remorse whatsoever these 10yearold kids gang up against basically everyone who stands in their way including their own parents and siblings and kill them the body count increases day after day and the police authorities believe that theres a psychopath lurking around the place in the meantime debbie curtis and steven dont hesitate to keep butchering people since nobody seems to suspect of those sweet angel faces br br like i was saying before bloody birthday is surprisingly not funny i know i said that before but im truly surprised by this i was expecting some hilariously bad scenes but the movie proved me wrong true its not exactly what most people would consider a serious horror movie but if i have to be fair id say that the story is decently executed one of the most important reasons why one would normally expect laughable situations like i did its because in these kind of movies in which the main villains are children the young actors tend to be plain awful and they make the whole thing laughable lets face it kids tend to be horrible actors which is understandable and we cant blame them for that but to my surprise the three young actors who played the merciless killers in this film looked very disturbing and not at all funny the rest of the actors are also good and if youre a george clooney fan you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie yeah i know right who cares also julie brown the great actress singer comedienne and gay icon gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and in case anyone is interested in nudity she also strips in one of the scenes and she looks great naked too bad she didnt have more time on the screen though julie is absolutely fabulouspbr br so basically this movie is fine if youre in the mood for some modest horror from the 80s my only objection regarding bloody birthday would be the way to justify the childrens motives this is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film lets see if children who were born during an eclipse end up being heartless killers then how come these three were the only ones who actually murdered people im sure there were other children who had been born the same day and during other days of total eclipse too oh well overall no big deal its just a simple observation thats all ive seen worse trust me take the children 1980 for example in which the precocious killer get their evilness after being turned into zombies by toxic cloud no believe me bloody birthday is far more decent and if you enjoy simple slashers youre going to enjoy this one very muchbr br so now you know youre invited to the childrens birthday party and the hosts will be serving a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests come on you cant miss it
