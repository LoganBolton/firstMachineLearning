harry langdons saturday afternoon is often ranked among the greatest silent comedies at least where short subjects are concerned and therefore may come as a bit of a letdown for some unlike some of the other recognized classics such as keatons cops or chaplins the immigrant this film is in some respects a familiar conventional situation comedy and doesnt offer much in the way of belly laughs one may even wonder whether langdon belongs in such rarefied company nonetheless in my opinion its a perfectly charming comedy in its minorkey way and harry is fascinating to watchbr br for a modern viewer raised on tv sitcoms the plot of saturday afternoon may suggest the honeymooners or its many spinoffs two dim guys one of whom is married and very much under his wifes thumb try to sneak out with a couple of goodtime girls for a fun afternoon but everything goes wrong and they wind up having to fight the girls tough guy boyfriends does this sound familiar and perhaps a little dreary well the premise was already shopworn when this film was made but beyond that nothing about langdon was typical he was odd starting with the fact that he looked like a middleaged baby who was half asleep any freudians who catch saturday afternoon will have a field day with the scenes between this timid pudgyfaced babyman and his stern gently domineering mommywife when harry tries to hide money under the rug but she catches him in the act and forces him to hand it over youd swear youre watching an interaction between a 6 yearold boy and his mama    and maybe thats why harry langdon gave some people the creeps and still doesbr br but hes a compelling screen figure and its not what he does so much as the way he does it in that scene with the coins under the rug for instance harry finds the coins by placing one foot before the other carefully like a tightrope walker counting off his paces until he finds the right spot and his technique is hypnotic langdon moved like no one else whether or not he makes you laugh the guy is mesmerizing seemingly in a world of his own where the plot of his films is concerned harry is curiously passive and almost never drives the story forward himself in the finale of saturday afternoon when the big fistfight is taking place harrys costar vernon dent is in the thick of the action but harry is in a daze for much of the time and winds up sort of punchdrunk between two cars sitting on the running board of one but with his feet on the other while they race through the streets its a memorable image and as the critic walter kerr wrote it encapsulates langdons screen persona quite perfectly hes a passive figure who somehow finds himself in the middle of frantic action blinking sleepily while the world rushes past its also worth noting that langdon and dent who worked together frequently have a rapport in this movie that suggests a blueprint laurel  hardy would follow when they teamed up a year or so later langdons style was a likely influence on stan laurel especially herebr br saturday afternnon and its star may not be for everyone but the film is well worth a look and you might find that langdon makes an impression thats hard to shake
