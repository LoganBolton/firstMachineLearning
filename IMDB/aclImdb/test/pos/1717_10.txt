if youre a longtime fan of the doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series rest easy  it more than meets the high expectations of the original the pacing is much quicker than the original shows fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes the writing is excellent the acting superb the hardest  and best  thing to get used to is the production values of the new series compared to the original its got some now although i will always have fond memories of bubblewrap and handpuppet monsters if youre not a fan or if you tried the original and couldnt get a handle on it jump in with both feet now everything you really need to know about the doctor theyll tell you as they go along this series was written with minimal references to the doctors enormous back story specifically to encourage new viewers admittedly im only seeing the first new series now as its being shown on the scifi channel in other words probably cut to ribbons for time constraints but im looking forward to future episodes either on broadcast tv or on dvd july 4th cant come soon enough
