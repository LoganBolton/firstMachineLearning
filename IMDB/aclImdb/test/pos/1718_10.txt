as a fan of the old doctor who and after the mediocre fox movie i was dubious of this new series of doctor who i gave it a chance though and am so glad i didbr br yes some episodes arent as brilliant as others but they are all enjoyable and yes ecclestons doctor is far from any weve had before but ecclestons doctor is just about the best there is his performance is at times comical at others dramatic sometimes completely crazy but always fantasticbr br this and bille piper as rose make this series a cut above the rest camille coduri is also fantastic as roses mum and there is a depth to this series not present previously this series is incredibly powerful especially considering its scifi i mean whod have thought you could ever have felt sorry or even cried for a dalek prior to this how many times in this series history have we had moments like those with roses dad the emergency doctor and the you were fantasticso was i final speech i advise anyone whether a fan of doctor who or even tv drama to buy this set on dvd it truly is fantasticbr br now only 4 episodes through the latest series and looking forward to the new cybermen i have to say that david tennants doctor is just not as good of course you may disagree but i dont think his doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in the previous series i also have to say that in my opinion so far this series has not been as good as the last however the return of sarah jane  k9 was a fantastic episode a true gem not to say this series is not good just not quite as goodbr br so whether you like it or not and whether you prefer tennant or eccleston the doctor is back and hes here to stay fantastic  almost as many fantastics as the doctor
