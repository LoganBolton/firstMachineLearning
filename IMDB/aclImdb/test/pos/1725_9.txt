im a next generation personive never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about the series that sparked a great fan base in the past and still making its mark in the 21st century the new doctor who started in 2005 but for those that live here in the states like myself we pretty much see it as new episodes on scifi channel or bbc america from season one we are introduce to a new player rose tyler billie piper and a pretty cool new doctor played by christopher eccelson misspelled last name sorry these two go on some many amazing and very extremely dangerous missions to save the worldevery now and then they have companions from roses exboyfriend mickey to the now ever present jack harkness who can now be seen on the spin off torchwood from season one to season two the pace is just about rightthe stories can be from the outlandishly weird to the most action packed paced driven but either way its one rollercoster ride from the start of the theme song which is very catchybr br in season two he becomes different and changes and now the new doctor david tennant continues the fight to save the world with rose and from this point there can be some that say some of the season wasnt as good but i have to disagree and it was sad to see rose and the doctor part ways but it leaves the opening companion role to martha played by the very sexy freema agyeman who helps continue the fight to save mankindseason three now is more on the actionadventure level and sometimes on the emotional but not as much as the first two seasons here the relationship between the doctor and martha is fitting but the attractiveness can be rushed into at times and the obviousness comes into play that shes not rose tyler being that you experienced her company in the first two seasons and not in the third season it can be a bit awkward it was for me cause you get use to rose and her ways and now to see someone who at times dont really question the doctor on an emotional level but all the same makes the pace very exciting for viewers which keeps you at the edge of your seatbr br all in all this is one thrill ride of a television show i would give it more but there are some flaws to this show as well that i cant mention cause its sometimes hard to pick up but just one does which is the doctor and marthas relationship is rushed and not leveled on the get to know you base ive seen good shows on british tv but this is by far one of the coolest scifi adventures for the old and new generation to experience but you dont have to take my world for itstep into the tardis and join the adventure
