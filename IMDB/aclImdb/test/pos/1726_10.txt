unlike most people whove commented i was born after the last sylvester mccoy episode and so couldnt have compared the two centuries of doctor who at first i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series i have since then seen old episodes of doctor who and some where great but like the doctor the series needed to regenerate to continue the 21st century doctor whos are great i thought martha was great almost a match for the doctor and if jacks appearance is anything to go by shes going to be brilliant when she cameos in series 4 or 5br br speaking of jack the spin of torchwood is also brilliant and you should watch both of these programmes though this is definitely more suitable for kids however if you insist that this isnt the same and just isnt doctor who please just stay in your basementbr br 1010
