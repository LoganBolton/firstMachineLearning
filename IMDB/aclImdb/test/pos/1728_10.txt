honestly i dont really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show it embraces the elements of the original while expanding on them the storytelling has been updated and while some of the episodes seem to be a bit fast that is a good thingbr br christopher eccleston is perfect in the role easily as good as tom bakerbr br rose is one of the best companions on par with sarah jane smith or leelabr br i like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed  no more politicking with the doctor acting as president emeritus and it adds something to the character to be the only one leftbr br the sfx are outstanding  especially in comparison to the originalbr br take it from me and i was a huge dr who geek  i actually took notes while watching the show all the way from dr number 1 to dr number 8 i tossed the horrible movie out of cannon personally this is the best sci fi show on tv right now possibly ever watch it and buy the dvd
