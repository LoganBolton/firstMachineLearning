okay i grew up on who but havent loved a doctor since tom baker christopher eccleston made me love who again and ill be furious with him forever for leaving br br the writing is grand the acting superb the directing which was dreadful in the old days is just fantastic i was very skeptical about this programme and watched it merely out of being forced but am now a huge fan and love it i have a ringtone of a dalek screaming exterminate then br br a few of the things i love about the new programme  1 people actually notice when rose billie piper disappears off the planet some of the old shows an assistant would drop off for a while and then come home like nothing has happened no one noticed 2 chris ecclestons doc loves rose  romantic or not will be debated but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares about his companion hed destroy the world if he had to to save her which the old show was lacking  often a doctor wouldnt care if he never saw his assistants again 3 they talk and think like real people  when rose is shown something outlandish or new such as aliens she acts like a real person would  gobsmacked i never liked it when an assistant from the old show who never saw anything alien would just fit right in and adapt instantly i want to see the surprise on roses face when she sees a plastic dummy come to life she gives that to me br br the few things i dont like about this series 1nearly everything happens on earth london or cardiff and i was sort of hoping for a more offworld sort of show 2 that eccleston left so quickly he really made the show brilliant br br but i can let those few things go  i far more enjoy the series than i ever expected to so i dont mind if they have stuff set on earth br br just dont take this show seriously  its fun its smart its entertaining but its not a superserious heavy duty show its pure fun and pure british and i cant get enough watch it with an open mind and just put your brain into neutral and enjoybr br ps  dont watch series 2 or later series 1 was brilliant the first few episodes of series 2 were good but dont watch it once it gets to love and monsters utter rubbish completely destroys the show
