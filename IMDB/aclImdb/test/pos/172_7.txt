this movie is not the scariest of all time but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick  low budget no stars lots of inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats the premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well a nice starting point for just say julie brown exposing her talents early in her career this film wont be seen by many but for fans of 80s horror its a must
