i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local pbs station played while growing upgot introduced to the doctor by way of john pertweeas well as camera copies of doctor who sent to america by uk fans to their us counterparts i had a great time w the show but it never seemed to take itself seriously  i mean as seriously as a scifi show about a time traveler could be i went to the cons did the costume bit doctor56 and tegan were my costume characters loved it then it all came to a sudden halt program politics and lack of interest and funding turned doctor who into a 25year old antique that drifted into the ethosbr br when i heard that the scifi channel had picked up the new doctor my first thought was cool now my 11 year old son can see what ive been babbling on about all these years and know what the heck a tardis is i have several phone boxes and tardises of various sizes around the housei didnt expect the excellent quality of story character development and fx i was to say the least  pleased for the first time i found a doctor that wasnt a curmudgeon a clown a fop a triphead a pussy or a jerk christopher eccleston is by far the most believable doctor to datenow now calm down tom baker fans dont get me wrong i loved almost every doctor and his quirks but christopher gave something to the doctor that hed never had before  real word believability im just sad that he decided against another season ill try out david tennant as i would any other doctor but now the bar has risenbr br bad wolf rulesbr br 2008 update  i love david tennant his mod persona is something that my generation remembers my sons generation can deal with and fashion gestapo can relax hes a little more human than christopher but not as humas as other former doctors i miss rose i dig martha and what were they thinking with donna noble its still the best ride on tv
