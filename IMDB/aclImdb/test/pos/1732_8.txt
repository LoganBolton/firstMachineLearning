i have just watched the season 2 finale of doctor who and apart from a couple of dull episodes this show is fantasticbr br its a sad loss that we say goodbye to a main character once again in the season final but the show moves onbr br the bbc does need to increase the budget on the show there are only so many things that can happen in london and the surrounding areas also some of the special effects all though on the main very good on the odd occasion do need to be a little more polishedbr br it was a huge gamble for the bbc to bring back a show that lost its way a long time ago and they must be congratulated for doing sobr br roll on to the christmas 2006 special the 2005 christmas special was by far the best thing on television
