as a child i was never in a situation where i could be introduced to dr who and though i had heard of the series in passing i never really realized exactly what it was it was then with some hesitation that i sat down to watch the ninth doctor and his antics having be told that he was something like arthur dent from the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy but cooler i cant believe what ive been missing out on seriously why had no one told me about this before my entire childhood was deprived of doctor who adventures me being a tremendous fan of most scifi and fantasy adventures honestly i thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to any future episodesbr br i have to admit that at first i was not so sure that billie piper would be the best actress but im happy to say that she did very well i thought and added a very realistic touch to the series i think actually that was one of my favourite aspects of the series the contrast between great alien conflict scenes contrasted with the infuriating normality of the south london council estate life im always interested in instances where peoples ideas about the world are drastically challenged and how people can take any situation and edit it in their minds so that it may fit in with their mundane lives i also loved christopher eccleston i havent seen many of his films and ive never seen another actor as dr who but i thought his portrayal of the doctor was brilliant immensely likable and yet dark enough to make you wonder i find that many other characters with his sort of character history tend to be a bit twodimensional they have all the right emotions and actions but they always seems slightly shallow this doctor on the other hand earned my loyalty with his stratified personality i agree with some of the other comments that a higher budget for the special effects aliens and whatnot might have been a bit more effective but then again this isnt about special effects though they help from what ive read and heard from longtime dr who fans its the spirit of the whole things that really counts and i dont think they did a bad job with what they had i quite liked all the aliens but my favourite had to be the daleks if i ever knew anything about dr who before watching the series it was that there were things in it that looked like upturned dustbins on wheels previous to watching i was quite sceptical about these pepperpots threatening the existence of humanity but some of them were quite scary which i lovedof coursebr br overall a good show i look forward to future episodes with delight the doctor has a new fan
