i get a kick out of the new who fans who call it excellenttheir entitled to that opinion but the new series isnt quite there yet its getting there its definitely goodbr br first the good things the special effects are obviously better nearly 20 yrs later since the last episode of doctor who battlefield was airedbr br one thing the bbc has always liked is doctor who except when they tried to cancel in the 70s and 80s however the anticipation and the pressure was great but i think the new series has passed the test its good its still not excellent because it does have its flaws some of the stories dalek were very poor i assume it was written in a couple of minutes by some idiot who never bothered to remake the dalek character or never bothered to watch the old seriesbr br aliens in london was by far probably the best episode so far it started a new storyline about aliens which has lasted across several episodes including boomtownbr br now the other bad things the companion rose billie piper isnt great shes actually quite annoying but as is dr who a young teeny bopper had to be eventually chosen and she got the partbr br christopher eccleston is pretty respectable hes started to catch his niche he tried to play the character straight then funny always missing the right punchline but hes taken it much more serious and it showsbr br continuity wise there still some issues that didnt get resolved well paul mcgann was still the doctor before this but he didnt get put backbr br aside from that though the series overall is pretty good i havent missed an episode and it never gets boring so i recommend any doctor who fan to check it out and see the new doctor who series
