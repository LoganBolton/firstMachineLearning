i seriously enjoy dr whobr br seriously dont just dismiss me as a scifi person because im not normally i caught on because a friend got me hooked when they started watching it it is actually really funny and more often than not its fastpaced all of my family watch it pretty much and thats a miraclebr br christopher ecclestion is pretty good but david tennant is brilliant i think its because he made the doctor so manic and its just nice to have that little bit of eccentricity in a tv character againbr br i dont know what it is about it but everything manages to work like clockwork br br all im going to say is just try it one episode probably best if you dont pick the second half of a twoparter though
