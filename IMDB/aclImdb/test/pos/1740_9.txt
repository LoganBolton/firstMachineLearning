first off i never got into dr who until recently honestly i never got the opportunity to watch any of the previous incarnations pun intended since it was never big here in the us as it is everywhere elsebr br that said i must say obviously that after finishing the 2nd season that this is one of the best scifi shows ive ever seenbr br now i watch a lot of scifi shows from all over and this show stands outbr br the first season was tops to begin with with christopher eccleston in the title role and i thought he was terrific of course so was the lovely billie piper who just adds such humanity and warmth to the character of rose that no one couldve done it better lets not forget camile coduri as jackie and noel clarke as mickeyricky who are just a blast to watch then theres david tenannt at first i thought he was too gawkylooking to play the character his ears but after watching the 2nd season he fits in just fine his sharp acting and physical comedy is almost flawless hes great with snappy dialog and can turn serious without batting an eyebr br aside from the great acting from the cast is the acting from most of the guest actors that have appeared a lot of them are veteran actors but some are new to me and are damn finebr br the production and direction of the show is top notch occasionally therell be some cheesy effects here and there but thats always been a factor in the original series and like those episodes is negligiblebr br my favorite thing of all about the series the stories writing folks is always the key to great entertainment russell t davies has written many of the episodes along with a few other writers and they have done an excellent job theyve managed to bring excitement ingenuity intelligence and fun with clever concepts and great dialog i also appreciate the fact that they can breach the older doctors past story lines and enemies well my friend explains much of this to me while we watch the show and respectfullybr br i wont mention anything about the 2nd season and how it ends since the scifi channel just started airing the 2nd seasonbr br i wouldnt want to spoil it its so much fun and excitement youll never want to take your eyes away nor miss a word of dialogbr br it really is that goodbr br ps thanks to the producers for nicholas briggs back exterminate
