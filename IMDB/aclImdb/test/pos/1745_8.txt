while disney have been the animation studio for the past 70 years there have always been rivals to their supremacy when this review was written in 2009 for example companies like dreamworks and to a lesser extent warner brothers and ardman were bringing out animated movies that could be said to challenge the disney dominance back in the beginning in that late 30s and early 40s heyday when disney was serving cinematic banquets like snow white dumbo and fantasia the competition was provided by brothers dave and max fleischer despite releasing two very commendable films they never quite cornered the market  many attribute their downfall to the commercial failure of mr bug goes to town released the same week as the attack on pearl harbour which gave the american public something more significant to think about than going to the cinema to watch a cartoon that this film has faded into relative obscurity is a travestybr br in a patch of overgrown garden in the city a bunch of bugs are in dire danger humans use the land as a shortcut discarding litter and cigars and other hazards right on top of the bugs homes as they go honeyshop owner mr bumble voiced by jack mercer fears that the future is bleak and wonders how he will ever be able to raise his daughter honey voiced by pauline loth in more secure surroundings a highly unscrupulous creature bagley c beetle voiced by tedd pierce offers to provide her a safer place to live if she will accept his hand in marriage but honey is much more interested in her childhood sweetheart the perennially cheerful and optimistic hoppity voiced by stan freed hoppity believes that everything is about to be resolved for the better but is left looking foolish when bagley beetle and his pair of comical sidekicks manipulate the crisis to their own devious end only at the very end as their patch becomes the foundation for a huge new skyscraper do the bugs switch loyalty back to hoppity as they look to him to lead them a new safe home away from the destructive influence of humansbr br what really works in this film is the delightful characterisation  all the bugs are cleverly developed and designed for maximum audience appeal the bumbling villains swat the fly and smack the mosquito hilarious names if you stop to think about it are particularly memorable equally admirable is the storytelling drive  even the youngest of children can enjoy this story while at the same time it skillfully conveys a message for older audiences about the way human carelessness can impact upon the survival of wildlife time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film and when viewing it the audience needs to accept and forgive these occasional signs of general age and wear but on the whole mr bug goes to town is an accomplished funny and very slickly presented animation with a worthy message to boot
