people who know me say i have a weakness for animated filmsbr br to be fair those people are half right my actual weakness is for exceptionally welldone animated films such as this vintage family flick from max and david fleischerbr br you may be thinking to yourself well if its so great why havent i heard of it fair question this movie was released the same week as the attacks on pearl harbor the unavoidably bad timing caused the film to sink into relative obscurity things are looking up though because it has finally been released on dvd under the title bugvillebr br its funny that the film went through all this because it kind of mirrors the actual plot although some people claim that the movie is trying to send an environmental message ugh i personally think that the movies main idea is perseverance through adversity and hard times after all the country had barely pulled out of the depression at the timebr br our grasshopper hero hoppity desperately wants to help his endangered community problem each time he tries whether through the illwill of others or through simple bad luck he fails miserablyand slowly begins to earn the disdain of the very people hes trying to save although he does his best to maintain a positive outlook he occasionally breaks down and its only through the encouragement and support of his friends that he gets back on his feet and fights the good fight just a healthy reminder that when all is said and done no one is really selfsufficientbr br okay youre saying it has a good message two actually does that really make it exceptionally welldone br br my answer partiallybr br its not just the message that makes this movie special its the characterization this is one of those films where you can just see the personality of each cast member in their animation you almost dont even need the spoken lines a good way to sum it all up is energetic or lively a lot of movies have used the selling point lovable cast of characters whenever i hear that line it always makes me think of this moviebr br case in point the bad guys swat the fly and smack the mosquito many movies have lovable villains but i dont think youll find any as entertaining or endearing as these fellows forget that 3 stooges cartoon from the 60s swat and smack are the closest thing to an animated version of moe and curly but sadly not larry that youll ever find virtually all of the funniest moments somehow involve this gruesome twosome yeah theyre rotten nogoodniks but you still care about them thats the kind of power you only see from a really talented writer director and crewbr br the movie has two brief jokes revolving around racial stereotypes native americans and chinese i dont think they were intended to be malicious but theyre there regardless they didnt bother me but itd be pretty unfair of me not to warn someone who potentially would be bothered by thembr br so if you share my weakness and i think you do give this one a go
