leslie carbagas excellent book on the fleishers tells the whole story of the fleischers big move of their entire animation unit to florida and their subsequent ejection by paramount br br mr bug goes to town didnt destroy the animation pioneers credit with paramount although its often told that way and this was paramounts favorite version of the story according to carbaga the big studio more than anything wanted to get their mitts on the animation studio and ease the famously bickering brothers out of the picture altogether mr bug provided them the pretext to do just that the sad closing of a great quirky innovative chapter in american animationbr br i wanted to comment also that the film actually debuted december 4 1941 not december 7 that may have been close enough to do the trick anyway in terms of national mood damaging the films success but another part of the legend of this troubled little film is that it was killed by having the bad luck to be in the theaters at the same time dumbo released october 23 1941 was still doing very brisk holiday business i havent done the research into box office numbers but id say that dumbos concurrent presence in theaters likely had an impact on mr bug moviegoing was at an all time high at this period and successful films could go strong in theaters for months  something unimaginable in these typically shortrun quick todvd days
