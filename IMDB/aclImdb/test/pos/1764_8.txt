like all of the very earliest films this movie is very very shortlasting about one minute so because of its brevity its not really possible to compare it to more modern films but for its time its actually a very remarkable film much of this is because the prints were hand paintedmaking annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance ive actually seen two different versionsone where she is red and another where she changes color throughout i think the red one depicted on the dvd the great train robbery and other primary works is the best of them the dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a piece of amazing performance art and unlike other one minute or less films of the day this one is one i could see repeatedlyits just that visually compelling and oddbr br if you want to see it online there is a 36 second version on google video type in serpentine dance
