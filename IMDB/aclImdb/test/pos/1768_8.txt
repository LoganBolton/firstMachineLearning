i like the good things in life as much as anybody i suppose but until about five years ago opera didnt figure into my entertainment choices oh i made a few attempts to learn what all the fuss was about id watched several television productions  notably parts of wagners ring cycle on public television  hoping to understand other peoples fascination with the art form and i knew i could like parts of various operas i remember being surprised as a kid that i actually liked the snippets of madame butterfly in my geisha and i enjoyed the opera scenes in moonstruck and pretty woman but unlike the characters in those films i just didnt get itbr br then in 1995 i saw a live performance of rigoletto presented by the new york city opera company and that night i got it what a wonderful glorious pageant of color and music and raw emotion and i do mean emotion with a capital e the key i think is that the operatic music allows the performers to overact freely and believably in a way that would seem silly if their words were just spoken everything hinges on the music of course and when the music is magical as it is in rigoletto an opera can be a magnificent entertainmentbr br a sympathetic family member gave me a laserdisc copy of the 1982 tv production of the opera and ive found that since i cant see live performances of rigoletto live on a regular basis this video version is a fine substitute luciano pavarotti is perfect in the part of the duke ingvar wixell is excellent as his meanspirited court jester rigoletto and rigolettos beloved daughter gilda is played by the somewhat plainfeatured edita gruberova the sets and costumes are lavish and the location shots on the river late in the film bring a heightened sense of drama to the story that could never be matched on a stagebr br if youve never seen rigoletto or if you think you dont like or understand opera i urge you to find this one on videotape and buy it or rent it if you dont like this if this production of rigoletto doesnt make you appreciate the power of the art form of opera well just give it up and move on to something else but i suspect if youre new to opera as i was that youll be pleasantly surprisedbr br bill anderson
