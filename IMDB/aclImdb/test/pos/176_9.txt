having just seen walt disneys the skeleton dance on the saturday morning blog as linked from youtube i used those same sources to watch a remake done in technicolor for the columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same manub iwerks the colors compared to the earlier black and white are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gagslike when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another ones off or when one dances with the other with part of that other goneare just as funny as the previous short it does get a little repetitious near the end still skeleton frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier silly symphony
