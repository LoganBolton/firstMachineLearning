this is one of several period seafaring yarns of its era which has the added distinction although not in itself unique of a female buccaneer at its center at first both leads – jean peters and louis jourdan – might seem miscast but they grow nicely into their roles eventually thanks no doubt to the talented players herbert marshall thomas gomez and james robertson justice who support them velvetyvoiced marshall is uncharacteristically cast as the ship’s obligatory philosophical lush of a doctor and gomez is suitably largerthanlife as blackbeard the piratebr br the cast is completed by debra paget as jourdan’s wife who incurs the jealous rage of the tomboyish titular character in whom jourdan instills the first pangs of love which however does not spare him the occasional flogging or swordwound incidentally the film was the second exotic teaming of jourdan and paget in one year following delmer daves’ bird of paradise the direct result of this unexpected softening of anne’s character is her falling out with blackbeard’s crew and her unlikely climactic sacrifice in order to save the lives of the stranded jourdan paget and marshallbr br while the film is not a particularly outstanding example of its type jacques tourneur’s energetic direction and franz waxman’s grandiose score ensure an aboveaverage effort that moves along at a brisk pace incidentally tourneur had already done service in the genre with the superior burt lancaster vehicle the flame and the arrow 1950 as usual with vintage technicolor productions the cinematography gives the film a sumptuousness that is invigorating by the way differing runningtimes are given for this film 81 or 87 minutes and for the record the version i watched was the shorter one
