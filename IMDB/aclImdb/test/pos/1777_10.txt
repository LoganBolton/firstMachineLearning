it would be great if a discussion on this medium length film is initiated with a brief tale about hypocrisy of hollywood peopleit was in 1988 that chuck norris saw this film at cannes international film festivalhe made a silly remark by uttering that the senseless killing depicted in dekalog 5 is far more effective than killings which have been filmed in his hollywood films with him as a potent action starhe was speaking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in kieslowskis film by a reckless psychopath who hits him cruelly with a big stonethere should be absolutely no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human societythis is the reason why chuck norris statement appears as a cruel joke which defends violent means in a society which is increasing becoming restlessan honest reviewer would not be making a mistake if heshe states that kieslowskis film dekalog dekalogpiec 15 has universal connotationsthis is because the events depicted in dekalog 5 can happen in any part of worldthe best lesson which kielowski gives to us concerns levels of violence which are acceptable in a just societythis is the reason why the brutal slaying of an innocent cab driver is capable of causing a feeling of repugnance in uswe would not feel the same hatred for homicide when it appears in films featuring arnold schwarzeneggerchuck norris and jean claude van damme as they appear much too artificialone can easily grasp that special effects and modern studio techniques can charm only toddlers but make no sense to serious film enthusiastskieslowski also champions helplessness of human beings in rescuing fellow humans beings from the clutches of death and miserythis is particularly interesting as time and again it has been proved that strict laws and capital punishments have not been able to prevent homicide
