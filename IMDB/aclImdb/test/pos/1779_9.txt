identityÂ–     i am part of my surroundings and i became separate from them and its being able to make those differentiations clearly that lets us have an identity and whats inside our identity is everything thats ever happened to us ntozake shange qtd in fires in the mirrorbr br pieces like decalogue v used to intimidate me i felt that if i accepted them than i would be compromising something what i thought before really isnt worth getting into i understand what naturalism is trying to say i experienced a tangible katharsis and one that fell into existence piecemeal and one thats still alive that i still have to reckon with its still working inside me br br the film wasnt sympathetic per se it doesnt need to say that the death penalty is a wicked thing there are certainly wicked people whether or not they should die is for another film what decalogue shows is that good beautiful people exists who kill other people when their society and primal urges jack them up br br the science of naturalism is what has helped me to appreciate decalogue v its not worth the writing space to go into why i would not let myself before but i see now the worth in making art like this to make people or perhaps to make people do something br br theres a method to lazars compromise of his    light much of that meaning makes sense only in retrospect this should not be too strange of an idea after all how much of respectable science does not gain meaning in retrospect i wince when i say it but naturalism seems so much more productive and so much less nihilistic when i have the power to say to myself this ruin this process this natural process makes me want to buck the system br br i do not think naturalism is painting a doomsday portrait of humanity telling us to give up our powdered wigs and head to the woods instead i think that it is cataloging proofs and experiments that we are of course free to ignore we can ignore it all we want if we want to give the naturalists more corpses to bury br br for surely despite their aesthetic specifically designed without sympathy towards their characters likely and catastrophic fate they are impassioned by readerly inaction and writerly snobisme i do see the delightful risk in the hope that the audience will understand whats to be done with what they see as has been mentioned theres danger in the hopeless seeing their fate immortalized in stone theres danger in the hopeful disparaging the natural because it doesnt correspond to their world viewbr br and i dont think that the hopeful need be either wealthy or fortunate i have not seen it but it seems that the film american beauty proves the inadequacy of circumstance as a provider of vision or comfort there are ascetics as well as gluttons as well as beggars who wonder where within themselves their humanity is who grieve because they cant find anything that separates them from their landscape br br landscapes can be powerfully and beautifully portrayed but in reality landscapes do not enact they change sure and dramatically but only by a large set of natural law which no one truly have power over but it cannot be changed itself
