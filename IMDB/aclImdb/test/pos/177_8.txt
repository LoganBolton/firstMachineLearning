in 1929 director walt disney and animator ub iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their silly symphonies series the skeleton dance iwerks and disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s in disneys laughogram cartoon series however their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave disney and start his own animation studio that was the birth of celebrity productions where iwerks continued developing his style and technique and where he created the character of flip the frog while his work kept the same high quality it wasnt really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed later that year iwerks was hired by columbia pictures and iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance this time in colorbr br 1937s skeleton frolics is essentially a remake of the 1929 classic the skeleton dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune like that short film it is set on an abandoned graveyard where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play the dead rise from their coffins ready for the show thats about to begin as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune now its not easy to be a musician made of just bones as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts however the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance a lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra its hard to dance with loose body parts everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the skeletons run towards their gravesbr br directed and animated by ub iwerks himself skeleton frolics follows faithfully the pattern set by the skeleton dance years before although with a crucial difference iwerks did the whole film in technicolor the bright tonalities allowed iwerks to create a more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving disney creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before it is certainly a more experimental film than the skeleton dance although sadly this doesnt mean its necessarily a better film for starters the film is practically identical to the one he did with disney with the only differences being the music more on that later and the color effects it looks beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after allbr br however it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film after all iwerks executes it in a wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody created by joe denat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by carl w stalling for the skeleton dance in other words while denats tune is effective and appropriate for the theme its easy to forget about it rapidly while stallings song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable being a musical film this is of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music brings down iwerks flawless work of animation personally i think that with a better musical accompaniment skeleton frolics would be remembered as fondly as the skeleton dance despite not being as groundbreaking as its still a fun film to watchbr br its kind of sad that most of the work iwerks did after leaving disney is now forgotten due to his poor success however it must be said that if iwerks lacked the popularity of disney or fleischer disneys main rival he did not lack the quality of those companies films it was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to disneys mouse for the first time to face failure out of disney despite its shortcomings skeleton frolics is a very funny and visually breathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film one just cant help but thinking of the skeleton dance while watching it it definitely reminds us that iwerks skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire usbr br 810
