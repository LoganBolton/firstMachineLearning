having seen the full length film kieslowski made out of this episode of the decalogue years ago came back to this viewer as we watched the complete ten vignettes as with the other films this one is loosely based on the fifth commandment or thou shalt not killbr br kryzsztof kieslowski writing with kryzsztof piesewicz took a look at the mind of a young man who commits a heinous crime in murdering an innocent person to vent his own frustrations this installment has a dostoyevskian character that kept reminding us about crime and punishment or at least some of the qualities of the novel are passed to the aimless youth who apparently has no redeeming qualitiesbr br the story shows the young man as he roams the streets of the city without a clear idea of what to do or where to go the only tender moment he displays is when he visits the photographers place to ask to have an old picture of his sister restored kieslowski leaves it up to fate to have the murderer board a taxi with the intention of robbing the driver but its his anger and frustration that get the best of this youth to kill a man that didnt deserve to die the last moments of this criminal is one of the most gripping sequences in any film past or presentbr br the other element in the story is the relationship between the public defendant and the criminal nothing can prevent the court to condemn to death the young man the lawyer feels at the end he has failed his client and goes to the judge to see where he went wrong all he is asked by the young man is to retrieve the picture and send it to his motherbr br kieslowskis account of how he interprets the fifth commandment makes for a surprising film that will stay in the viewers mind long after this episode is forgotten
