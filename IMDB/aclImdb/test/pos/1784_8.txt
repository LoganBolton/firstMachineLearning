three distinct and distant individuals lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another the onehour film only reveals the event that brings the three individuals together only after half the film is over i have seen other segments of the dekalog but this one struck me as the most sparse one in dialogue and yet most fascinating in structurebr br the film opens with a law student practicing a mock plea of defense for a man charged with murder obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a fullfledged lawyer but this is never shown on screen at least in the short 1hr version of dekalog 5 we are made to imagine that this must have been the case a cab driver who is a misanthrope has two facets to his character the good side feeds a mangy dog cleans his cab meticulously picks up dirty rags thrown by people who lack civic sense and remembers his wife while dying the bad side frightens small poodles refuses to give a ride to a drunkprobably worried that he will puke in the caband ogles at pretty girls the repulsive protagonist who murders without mercy drops stones from bridges on fast moving traffic and pushes strangers into urinals without any provocation is also a person who can make innocent young girls laugh kieslowskis film and the script thus present the good and the bad side of two of the three main charactersbr br yet the film is not about capital punishment but more a treatise on killing the fifth commandment thou shalt not kill is explored theologicallyeven god spared cain sociologically the tenderness of brutes to children and poor forlorn dogs and psychologically after effects of drunken night with a male friend that led to the accidental death of his sister whose photograph he carries with him what makes ordinary persons turn into killersthis is never fully explained but suggestions are legionbr br in kieslowskis world there is a pattern where events and people are interlinked in a cosmic sense note the resemblance of clown to the killer as it hangs from the mirror in the cab kieslowski and the young idealist lawyer seem to ask us to look at the commandment literally and figurativelywhy do we kill are the people legally killed truly bad is there a force beyond society the drunken night that led to life of a girl that makes us into abhorrent murderersbr br it would be missing the forest for the trees to discuss the two detailed killings in the filmboth without mercy the film invites the viewer to contemplate why we are asked by god not to killbr br i understand a longer fulllength version of the film was made by kieslowski but even this short 1hr version is superb with its bleak and sparse script intelligent editing interesting cinematography and topnotch direction that provides much more than the sum of its partsbr br this segment anticipates the more wholesome dekalogs 67 and 8
