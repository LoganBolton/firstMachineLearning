a year after her triumphant first special my name is barbra barbra streisand regrouped with her production team to produce this followup cbstv special in thenrevolutionary color first broadcast in march 1966 color me barbra follows a similar format to its predecessor  three segments the first two with unique concepts the first takes place in the afterhours halls of the philadelphia museum of art where dressed as a period maid she roams the galleries and becomes part of the artwork through song in various guises streisand expresses a variety of moods from the comedy schtick of the minute waltz to the melodrama of non cest rien in a modigliani painting to the beatnikstyle frenzy of gotta move set to abstract art my favorite moment in the special is when she transforms into a dead ringer of queen nefertiti while singing a haunting rendition of rogers and harts where or whenbr br opening with another comic monologue full of silly nonsequiturs this time in french the second segment is back in the studio for a brightlycolored circus medley where she interacts with animals including her beloved poodle sadie she finds an appropriate context for sam you made the pants too long with a bevy of penguins and comically compares her profile to an anteaters with we have so much in common as with the first special the program ends with a riveting solo concert in which she sings some chestnuts any place i hang my hat is home where am i going and starting here starting now among them also included is the brief introduction she filmed in 1986 ironically dressed in allwhite when the special was first released on vhs the juxtaposition of locale and song is even more effective than in her first special and a 23year old streisand is in peak form
