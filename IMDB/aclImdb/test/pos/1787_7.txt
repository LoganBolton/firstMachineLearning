followup to 1965s my name is barbra and shot in brilliant color color me barbra has la streisand alternating nostalgia clowning comedy feminine romantic angst and beguiling seriousness for a crazyquilt hour of showbiz razzle dazzle shes a cutup and a femme fatale a sprite and an enigma with her egyptian eye makeup and everchanging hairstyles shes also a chameleon her voice is rich and moving even if a few of her songs are not one kiss yesterdays the circus sequence isnt as intriguing as the museum trip with the conceit of barbra becoming the images in the paintings an idea which works better than you may think the circusmedley built around songs featuring the word face is girlishly cute without ever really becoming enchanting still this is a lively jazzy specialnot quite as emotionally tantalizing as my name is barbra but certainly a sterling sophomore effort
