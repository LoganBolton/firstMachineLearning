ostensibly hans  isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother a nagging wife and a lovers rejection and despite the complex portrayalhans himself doesnt precisely make these claimsthe above must be a substantial part of fassbinders thinking as well his use of freud and marx but the viewer may look no further than hans gender and sexism to locate the truer cause of his crushed spiritbr br first its highly unlikely that his mothers lack of love pushed him into signing up with the foreign legion it was far more likely and is in part indicated that it was a quest for adventure male camaraderie escape from the female world of mother and sister and male identity itself which both the legion and war offeredbr br second hans loses his successful job as a policeman because of his own sexism by falling for a prostitutes wiles at work he not only rubber stamps prostitution as an oppressive institution but shows that he cannot even control his sexuality in a professional arenaand is even willing to jeopardize a desirable careerbr br third he commits serious verbal abuse against his wife in front of his sheeplike male buddies making no distinction at all between her absence orwhen she shows up looking for himpresence in fact he is more brutal in her presencebr br a few hours later in a violent and drunken state he beats his wife in front of their daughter who intervenes on her mothers behalf the terror he instills in her and his daughter are palpable but both heand the audiencemove on with nary a whimper of conscience or protest why because his wife is cruelly characterized as both nagging and sexually promiscuous yes this this may be fassbinders view of what capitalism does to womenowned insecure and a commoditybut this hardly absolves hans brutality nor fassbinders exploitation of her in the battery scenebr br and then there is this male role pressure which hans could choose to reject and protest but instead accepts hes too short for a male and too unheroic to achieve the worldly success the male role recommends but how can these be causes of despair when he not only gains his lost love as a mistress but marries a tall woman who is considerably more attractive than himself finally hans allows harry his war comrade to remain over his wifes convincing plea to the contrary on in their house by this decision he not only makes it clear that he is more tied to harry than to his wife but that male bonding supersedes his love of women and supersedes in the end his own life because it is harrys superior competence and spirit around the house that causes hans star to fall hans the merchant may be to a degree the victim of capitalism but more to the point he is the victim of his own allegiance to his own male identity his inability to let it go is the ultimate cause for his isolation and despairbr br this is something that is lost i think not only on fassbinder but also on hans sister annaalthough only to a degree lost for annas and fassbinders support of her brotherover her mother only goes so far she is quite insistent that only he can save himselfthat her support and love cannot it itself end his selfloathing unfortunately she does not offer any of this same support and love for his wife who must be much more embittered than hans but who in the end is able to pick up the pieces and save herself and daughter and present a marked contrast to hans fall
