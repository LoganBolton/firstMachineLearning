i remember seeing this movie back when it was released and i still remember the buzz i felt when i left the cinema everything about this movie is magnificent the music is top notch and i still play the soundtrack after all these yearsbr br i have seen this movie so many times and yet i still get yearnings to watch it again and again nicholas cage was great and whenever i see cameron dye in anything nowadays i always associate him with this movie it is too bad the rest of the cast didnt go on to greater things but maybe that is part of this films charmbr br i wont do a film school critique as i am sure all the analysts out there can find fault if they wanted to but what i will say is that this movie defined my teenage years and still continues to influence my life over 20 years later the movie feels great and stirs up emotions when you watch it wellit did for me and i cannot recommend it highly enough for anybody who has not yet seen itbr br you either get the movie or you dont those of you who get it will be rewarded with a unique movie experience
