valley girl launched nicolas cages career and was an 80s version of romeo and juliet it is a definite example of an 80s teen classic nicolas cage deborah foreman and elizabeth daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie but it will never top fast times at ridgemont high as the ultimate 80s teen flick because if it werent for fast times then the 80s generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head thats for sure
