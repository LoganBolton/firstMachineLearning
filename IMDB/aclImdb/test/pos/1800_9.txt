this is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production martha coolidge herself said she only had 350000 dollars to work with this is a movie that i loved growing up in the midwest i remember friends and i having the nostalgia trip on this movie 10 years ago great things about this moviegreat cast with hungry actors and a hungry director bad points of this movieto small of a budget calling for way too much improvisation if martha coolidge had been given more money and time on this movie then the results would of been even better they should have taken the story from an early 20s prospective and not from a 1517 year old high school stand point most of the actorsactresses were in their early to mid 20s trying to play 1517 year oldscome on the music is extremely memorable and the two soundtracks get played all the time in my car the best scenes in this film take place in seedy hollywood clubs by nicolas cages character i gave this film a high rating of 910 for five reasons nicholas cages improvisational on the spot acting the camera work and angles are excellent given the budget they had and only being able to have one take of each scene the sytles music and lingo are captured perfectly and forever again the music is incredible and carries the story along from scene to scene and finallymartha coolidge could turn a weak script unknown actors and a very very low budget and 20 days of shooting the entire movie into such a good and memorable movie is astounding
