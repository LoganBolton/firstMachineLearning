this is a romantic albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites it is one of the many classics of the 80s genre like pretty in pink or some kind of wonderfulbr br nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley preppy girl julie it is a heartwarming love story that makes you root for him to win the girl in the endbr br true most of the acting sucks but br br i have been in love with nic since seeing this in the theaters and have seen nearly every movie hes been in since hes really grown as an actor but it is obvious in this early movie of his that he had a lot of potentialbr br if you love 80s movies you will love this classicbr br go rent it
