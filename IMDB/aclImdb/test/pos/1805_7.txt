ive seen this movie quite a few times and each time i watch it the quirkier and funnier it becomes perhaps its the lack of research that went into nicolas cages characters punk persona or just the cheesiness factor because it was such a typical eighties filmnonetheless its a cute love story with extremely funny unique characters i think its right up there with fast times and weird science quintessential eighties flicks
