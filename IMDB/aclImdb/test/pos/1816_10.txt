putting aside the im so sures and totally gnarlys this is one of the sweetest and lifelike romances portrayed on film deborah foreman where is she now as julie and nicolas cage as randy are as classic as romeo and juliet tony and maria jake and samantha you cant help but fall in love with them plus the soundtrack  the plimsouls sparks the furs the flirts and of course modern english  is also outstanding for fans of films about young love id equally recommend the recent film all the real girls by david gordon green
