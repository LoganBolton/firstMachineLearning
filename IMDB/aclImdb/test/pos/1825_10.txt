valley girl will always hold a special place in my heart i would say this is certainly the best of the 80s teensexcomedies but that is a backhanded compliment this is a good movie period it is very specific in time and placenearly twenty years later this is a marvelous snapshotyet its story remains timeless this is just romeo and juliet minus the death after all nicolas cage is wonderful showing all the early promise that it turns out he has squandered on overblown action crapola deborah foreman is the revelation of this movie and i cant believe she didnt go on to have a bigger career someone rediscover her quick this is sweeter and gentler than most films of the genrethe requisite nudity seems thrown in by contractual obligationand while not groundbreaking it certainly is nice to see this kind of movie that respects its characters and doesnt crucify its shallow young girls for having funeven foremans crew of best friends misguided by peer pressure are never presented as villains indeed her friend stacy forced to doubledate w cages friend fred has a good time despite her protests and makes out w fred in the backseat this will take you back to the early 80s if you were there but it holds up quite well today warning to those unfamiliar with the movie do not watch one of vh1s seemingly continual showings of itgo rent it in its unedited glory otherwise you are missing some of the movies most potent timespecific dialogue and one cant write about valley girl and not mention the fabu soundtrack of great 80s tunesmost of them by onehit wonders which are not only integral to the sense of time and place in this movie but thematically wellchosen see itawesome little flick fer shur
