i dont normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy and maybe i will in the future after seeing return to me the plot was simple and no secret after the publicity you dont have to be einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes what you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where the chemistry abounds and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have a good time i love this movieand have the dvd on order
