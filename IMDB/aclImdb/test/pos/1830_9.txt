this movie is sweet  not cloying just warmspirited and kind i found it only mildly funny and the premise is wildly improbable but the characters are so charming especially minnie drivers that they had my full attention right from the beginning and soon had my affection toobr br bonnie hunt has done a great job in her directing debut and a good job with the writing as well i highly recommend this movie and will see it again im sure
