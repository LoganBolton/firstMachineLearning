i love this movie at first i didnt expect much of this movie since i didnt hear anyone talk about it and it seemed like it went on video soon after it had just opened in the theatres i also didnt think david and minnie would make a good onscreen couple ive expected a lot out of onscreen couples since i saw youve got mail and sleepless in seattle with tom hanks and meg ryan personally i think joely richardson shouldve played minnies part and vice versa i dont know i just think joely shouldve stayed in the movie longer with david they seemed perfect for each other but it just figures that in a movie the girl next door always gets the guy  like in while you were sleeping i was very wrong though this movie was fantastic everything was done brilliantly bonnie hunt did a great job of directing the lines were perfect with the wise cracks everywherebr br warning spoilers aheadbr br i love how everything intertwined with each other for example in the beginning elizabeth and bob were talking about going to italy and in the end bob meets grace in italy sydney the ape doing the hand thing with grace like he had done with elizabeth is an example toobr br notice spoilers end nowbr br one thing i didnt like about the movie was it was a little unrealisitic well i just dont think a man could get over his wife in a year when she was the only woman he had ever been with his entire life youd think hed isolate himself from the world for years before even coming out of his house to talk someone instead he goes on a blind date a year later and falls instantly in love with a woman hes never seen in his life but feels a connection withbr br over all it was a splendid movie it had me crying two or three times and it had me laughing countless times the scene in the restaurant with bobs picky date for bottled water was hilarious it is definitely up there with great romanticcomedies like youve got mail sliding doors and while you were sleepingbr br go rent it today
