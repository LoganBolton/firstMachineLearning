this movie doesnt have any pretense at being great art which is good but it is a well written script with well developed characters and solid acting i think if i wrote it i could do without the drama surrounding the wife but it wasnt distracting enough to detract from the main story concerning minnie drivers character i think that all too often hollywood abandons an attempt at real quality writing to try and inject more visual drama when with an adult themed movie such as this the emotional type of drama is all thats really needed  and probably more believable too overall its a very well done offering and well worth seeing
