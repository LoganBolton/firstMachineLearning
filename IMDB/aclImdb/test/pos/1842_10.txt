awesome movie great combination of talents im a huge fan of david duchovny and he is outstanding in this movie i would love to see him in more movies of this nature his talents are definitely underused and has so much more to offer besides agent mulder although im a huge fan of that series too anyway i want to see more of him he is easily the cary grant of our generation if you havent seen this movie you must great love story that shows love never dies its with you forever minnie driver is great and how can you go wrong with a cast containing mr oconnor and mr loggia and mr belushi this movie didnt get any type of awards nod but deserved one great job bonnie hunt  by the way the soundtrack is great too
