i watched this movie again yesterday with a 20yearold intern from my office ok  it was the quiet day after thanksgiving and we both loved it i love the unique plot david duchovny david allen greer and the way the dog keeps waiting at the door isnt part of each of us just like that dog after someone we love diesbr br i also love the old folks at the restaurant  they remind me of some of the older people around southern new england where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion and i love the wedding at the endbr br minnie driver is great in this movie  and bonnie hunt should have won an award for everything br br bonnie  make more movies
