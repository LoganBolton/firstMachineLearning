i love this moviebr br this beautiful charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters and heartwarming romance i became so attached to the characters throughout the film that i felt as if i knew them personally the storyline is very enchanting and it brought me to tears in several touching moments duchovny and driver have a very cute chaste relationship that you cant help getting involved in this ones worth watching more than once and showing to all your friends im just curious why wasnt this a big hitbr br i give this a 10 out of 10 spectacular film and this is coming from a guy who thinks that 9 out of 10 movies arent even worth watching
