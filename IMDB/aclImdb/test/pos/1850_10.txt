i saw this movie with my mother and i loved it it was such a sweet story not to mention funny because of the supporting cast they never make movies like thisever my favorite part is when graceminnie driver finds out about her boyfriends wifes death and that she has the deceased wifes heart and she screams what was god thinking i do believe everyoneno matter who you believe in has thoughts like that once in awhile but while its very sappy it just might make you believe in true love and destiny for once and for allsighbr br the comedic timing between bonnie hunt and jim belushi will just make you crack upespecially in the aforementioned scene its terrible and yet so funny they make a good pair and i hope to see them again in something soon 1010 stars
