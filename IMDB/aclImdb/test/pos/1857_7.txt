last year was the 200th anniversary of charles darwins birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of the origin of species so its fitting that jon amiels creation got released the movie focuses on the period of darwins paul bettany life while he was writing his famous work and the mild strain that it put on his family lifebr br i guess that the movie overplayed darwins tension with his religious wife emma jennifer connelly and his guilt over his deceased daughter annie but i still like the thought of darwins theory working like a karate chop on religious dogma as it was the us was one of the last countries in which creation found a distributor due to the creationismevolution debate yes its still going onbr br all in all this isnt a masterpiece but i recommend it the same way that i recommend inherit the wind i hope that one day the creationismevolution debate wont be an issue if this film helps put the debate to rest then more power to everyone in the movie also starring martha west jeremy northam toby jones and benedict cumberbatch
