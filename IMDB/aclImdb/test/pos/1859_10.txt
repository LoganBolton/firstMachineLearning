i have read reviews of this film that found it disappointing and confused i am at a loss to understand why this should be so from the beginning i found it a remarkable experience and a complete joy to watchbr br spoiler the opening titles overlay a beautiful visual of the evolutionary process and this introduces the story with a serene and sweeping style the film isnt about the process itself though it concerns charles darwins struggle with his conscience his love for his wife his deceased daughter and his search for truthbr br the appearances of his daughter are the manifestations of a tormented mind that knows it has killed god the daughter is an adult making adult comments about his work and torturing darwin with personal doubts was he in some way responsible for her death husband and wife in real life paul bettany and jennifer connelly give truly wonderful performances as charles and emma darwin as does martha west as annie bettanys size and awkward gait give darwins character a genuine sense of reality whilst connelly seems very comfortable with her english accent and occasionally somewhat severe personabr br its easy to misunderstand the times in which this film resides the grip that religion had on society and the inner struggles that a man like darwin must have endured to seek the truth in what he witnessed science and religion have always been awkward bedfellows and although it didnt cost him his life as it did with so many earlier men and women science put a barrier between husband and wife fact and faith this film portrays that barrier supremely wellbr br i give creation ten stars because i think its beautiful profound superbly well acted and a genuine noextraneousfrillsrequired look at one of the worlds true geniusesbr br what seems obvious to everyone today well almost everyone see bill mahers wonderful religulous was hidden for millennia the truth once it was discovered was undoubtedly painful for many creation examines that pain and the realisation that we are all that we possessbr br a wonderful cinematic experience
