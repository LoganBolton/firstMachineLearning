i saw this film on 19sep2009 at the cambridge film festival br br the beagles only in a couple of short flashbacks the whole thing is about darwins life from 1841 to 1859 when he was ensconced in kent with his growing family 200 pages of origin had already been drafted and he was wondering whether to complete the book br br the script is based on randal keyness book annies box annie charless daughter died when she was 10 it is mostly a family drama but does include sex scenes  however the participants are married both on and off screen not too exciting not much science but a wellmade film thats pleasant to watch and pushes the right emotional buttons a bit of a romantic weepie actually i suppose the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic freethinking scientist from an atheist family background and still be an emotional romantic as well as an excellent father br br some of the characters and darwin himself state or wonder whether he killed god but the viewer is able to doubt that what is beyond doubt given the deadly struggle for survival and the web of predation on the meadowbank wellknown before darwin and completely uncontroversial and the failure of darwins prayers is that the idea of a kind providential god who loves his creatures is untenable br br i really cannot see many americans objecting to it very much some may have problems with the title which is probably the most controversial thing about the film or with the fact that bettany does not have horns a tail and a pitchfork
