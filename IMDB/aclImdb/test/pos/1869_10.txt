i was a huge fan of this series yesterday i watched it again on dvd i was apprehensive about whether laughs would come or not but in a few episodes i was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good acting wise rakesh bediraja  satish shah is brilliant whereas swaroop sampat is plain bad but i think she gets the job done maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her this series shows what good clean comedy isbr br if this series were to air in the current year i would have given it 910 and to think that this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good i give it 1010 i would highly recommend this series for watching on dvd
