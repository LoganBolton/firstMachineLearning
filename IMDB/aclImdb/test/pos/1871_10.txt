one of the best sitcoms to run on indian television along with dekh bhai dekh and idhar udhar great acting well paced and an extremely amusing script made this a truly memorable series the fun filled opening montage sung by none other than the inimitable kishore kumargave a very accurate picture of what one could expect i used to borrow it from my local video library years after doordarshan had stopped airing it i wish indian television would revert back to serials such as these rather than the asinine saasbahu soaps and reality television which is all its good for these days anyone whos found of genuinely good comedy ought to go and get this series youll might also enjoy a couple of pakistani sitcoms such as ups and downs and aik aur aik which are certainly comparable to indias best
