its taken years for cult icon bruce campbell to get this project off the ground  but he finally has its here  and what a great piece of schlock entertainment it is looking at the plot it sounds like two things a great base for a very silly bmovie and a shameless excuse for bruce campbell to what he does best  evil dead ii style slapstick humour and this film delivers on both counts the man with the screaming brain is comic book nonsense all the way through  but theres some really great scenes and its almost impossible to be bored with this movie bruce campbell wrote directs produces and stars in this film  and while its not quite citizen kane it has to be said that this is an achievement for the man most famous for battling off his own hand in a woodland cabin the plot follows american businessman william cole on a business trip to bulgaria with his girlfriend the trip goes awry however when he his girlfriend and his taxi driver end up dead thanks to the same woman mad scientist stacy keach is on hand to merge cole and the taxi drivers brains into one and weve got a cult flick on our handsbr br the first half hour or so is entertaining and features a few laughs but once the main plot point has been executed the movie really picks up bruce makes best use of the scenario in all kinds of silly situations from changing his clothes in a waste bin to deciding with the taxi driver in his brain what to eat in a restaurant the humour is mostly of the slapstick variety and anyone who enjoyed evil dead ii which should be anyone whos seen it will no doubt enjoy this too it does feel like campbell is playing to his strengths a little bit too much with this whole project but if you tuned in and didnt see bruce doing what he does best disappointment would ensue besides that no disrespect to the man but hes never been the actor with the greatest range despite being lots of fun the movie isnt great as it gets a little bit too silly at times and theres a whole subplot with a robot that i didnt like but overall the man with the screaming brain is a film that we sadly dont see too much of nowadays the film is an allout no holds barred bmovie and it deserves respect for that if nothing else
