ok well no one in their right minds would pick up a movie titled the man with the screaming brain and expect it to be serious this is an outrageous bmovie and that means a truly hokey plot strange characters clich√©s overthetop action and ohsocheesy one liners for that odd segment of the population including myself that gets a kick out of that kind of thing this is a gembr br the acting is better than expected stacy keach is embedded in his character bruce campbell brings a spirited convincing performance his physical comedy skills are truly impressive in this movie and hearken back to the evil dead films
