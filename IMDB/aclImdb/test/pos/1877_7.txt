or if youve seen the evil dead trilogy andor bubba hotep then you should know that his movies are total farces with man with the screaming brain he goes all out again in this case he plays smarmy american businessman william cole visiting bulgaria  when do we ever get to see that country  when a woman kills him so strange scientist ivan ivanov stacy keach replaces half of coles brain with the brain of a former kgb agent leaving him acting sort of like steve martin in all of mebr br yes the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense much of the real humor comes from evil dead director sam raimis brother ted as ivanovs nearly braindead assistant pavel the two men have a relationship more like laurel and hardy or gilligan and the skipperbr br so just understand that this is a totally silly movie and you wont be a bit disappointed i liked it anyway
