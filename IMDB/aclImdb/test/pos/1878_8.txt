an awesome made for the scifi channel movie which by far surpasses many of the poor previous efforts theyve churned out bruce campbell is on superb form as a possible investor who gets caught up in a bizarre experiment led by a delirious professorstacey keachand his halfwit assistanceted raimi the film is pure b movie gold and its great to see keach and ram up on screen with bruce and the fact that a lot of the film works purely on bruces comic slapstick acting is what make it hilarious and makes me ask the question why isnt this guy getting more of his scripts commissioned it indeed a sick world definitely worth a watch
