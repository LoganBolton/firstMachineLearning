im out of words to describe the beauty of the cranes are flying but ill try anyway to write about it its a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in the second world war its the classic story of lovers boris  veronika separated by the war and of what comes between them the films images are so gorgeous that youll be carried away  the film technique is in perfect unison with the emotionbr br there are few scenes that portray directly the war a bombing  wind lightnings explosions  that will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist veronika who waits for the return of boris and theres another scene on the front where we we will be confronted by a emotionalvisual hurricane showing the images played in boris mind another scene works as the leitmotif of the film and provides its title  the cranes flying in the sky this image stands as a the symbol for nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film not to give up hope and fight for a better futurebr br kalatozov is a great director this film is visually stunning and it also touched me deeply it is not just pure technique br br tatyana samojlova is perfect as veronika what more can i say the film transcends the time it was made  the action takes place during the second world war but it could have happened anytime anywhere as long there are wars great or small the film and its message will remain relevant
