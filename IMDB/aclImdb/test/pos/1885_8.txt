ah classic comedy at the point in the movie where brains get messed together a two minute scene with bruce campbell beating himself up partially reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a whole moviebr br for years and years bruce campbell knows what kind of movies we want out of him we want to see weird movies like bubba ho tep we want to see cameo roles in sam raimi movies and we want to see man with the screaming brain with the title alone one knows that its going to border that completely silly type of movie like army of darkness only with more silly and less monstersbr br the idea of the movie is simple bruce sees doctor doctor has new idea bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor coincidentally its the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him hilarity ensuesbr br with the addition of ted raimi as a weird russian guy and journeyman stacy keach as dr ivan ivanovich ivanov its funny that does this movie complete funny never a point of scarybr br if you like the silly bruce campbell youll like this then again why would you be watching this if you didnt like bruce campbell
