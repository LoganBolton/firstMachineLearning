sick of the current cinema output particularly american cinema ive been making an effort to see the oscarwinning foreign films thats when i came across this gem slow to start it picks up nicely once war is declared basically an old fashioned girlwaitsforboytoreturnfromwarstory the performances the cinematography make this so very much more why tatyana samojlova as the young woman didnt become an international star after this is beyond methough she has remained successful in her own country you take the journey with her young defiant impetuous young girl who through the ravages of war becomes a very sober somber woman who keeps a glimmer of hope her final scene is devastating we love her as much as the camera does and the camerawork was this the pioneer in handheld camera work it truly adds an immediacy to the story and the beauty of it like when tatyanas character is running up stairs and next to a slatted fence i am humbled and grateful to see this film
