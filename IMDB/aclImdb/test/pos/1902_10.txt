dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best it is a pivotal film in the black exploitation genre as where it caused a dramatic shift between the films that came before it in contrast to the films that came after it it wasnt necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and its fight to overcome issues like racism or anything as important as that but it was the story of one badassed dude fighting whitey with his army of hot kungfu mamas it was a guilty pleasure great fun and best to watch it with friends 10 out of 10
