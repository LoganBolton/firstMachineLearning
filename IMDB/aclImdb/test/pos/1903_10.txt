dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero who takes down the man meanwhile hooking up with all the finest women that the ghetto has to provide mind you that these women know karate and are fine foxy ladiesbr br spoilerthe end fight scene is pretty crazy with dolemite ripping the heart out of willy green make sure your copy is unratedbr br plus there are a cast full of innovative brilliant characters like the hamburger pimp reverend mayor queen bee and others the apparel is great and the sets are full of 70s style there are a few messups in the production such as boom mikes accidentally appearing among other things but that adds to the charm and laughsbr br i would recommend drinking a 6pack before and during this movie and keeping squares and the man a far distance away
