of course seeing a few boom mikes doesnt mean anything does it lord rudy ray moore and durville martin really put this one together didnt they i laughed a lot as often happens in these types of movies but i dont know what i was supposed to laugh at because i laughed at so many other things i am not saying the movie was bad but i will say that a little more editing would have done wonders i am a huge fan of blaxploitation so i dont think that it was horrid but i know that the human tornado was several times better than this i think that those who can make it through this movie might need a colt 45 or two afterward i mean it really helps you to not notice the boom mikes when you watch it again
