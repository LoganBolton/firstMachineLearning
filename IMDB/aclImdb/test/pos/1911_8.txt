a blaxploitation classic this movie was terribly influential in rap music for the toasts that rudy ray moore performs toasts are long rhyming stories that are funny and deliver a point and you can see how they would naturally evolve into rap for more on toasts rudy ray moore and why this movie is important go to dolemitecombr br which leaves us just to talk about the movie itself this movie packs in a great deal of laughatthefunnyoutfitsandhairstyles bang for the buck as nearly every shot has some sort of outrageous element or dialogue it starts as dolemite is being released from prison in order to find out who framed him and bring him to justice i was unaware that prisons release people so they can prove their own innocence but thats me im a neophyte in the prison scene he is helped in this by queen bee who is dolemites lead prostitute and has been running his brothel while hes been gone she has also put all of his prostitutes through karate school so now he has an army of female karate fightersbr br i watched this movie in two parts which is usually a mistake but in this case it provided an interesting contrast the first part i watched on my lunch break while exercising and wasnt enjoying it much at all it struck me as particularly poorly made blaxploitation with a ludicrous story shoddy craftsmanshipwell i guess that makes it sound like it had some craftsmanshipand tons of outrageous locales outfits and dialogue but i wasnt enjoying thatin fact it kind of made me feel dirty lets face it a white guy watching something like this to laugh at the outfits and the things the characters say is essentially getting an enjoyment out of it that is racist how ridiculously those black people dress what silly things they say i wasnt really enjoying it wasnt laughing and wasnt looking forward to watching the restbr br later that night when i was in a much more relaxed state i watched the restand legitimately loved it like disco godfather which i had watched a few days previously this has a warmth and sweetness at its core that makes it likable even when its silly or violent the character of dolemite has an element of selfparody about him that makes the whole thing fun and the appearance of several actors who were also in disco godfather implies that were watching the group effort of a bunch of friends who just want to make something fun together even the poor dubbing karate fights and everything else just makes it that much more charmingbr br what i find interesting about the dolemite films is that they have some moral ambiguity i dont see in other blaxploitation films and certainly in very few mainstream films in this one there is an africanamerican woman who gives a speech about the white mayor saying he has done more for the black community than anyone we later find out that the mayor is surprise corrupt but i like that the movie would present this woman as essentially misguided and not try to redeem her in some other way theres also the figure of the hamburger pimp who is presented as a useless junkie and no one makes an effort to find some redeeming socially positive angle to what he is he just is in disco godfather the religious character lady reed plays is presented as just nuts for wanting to pray for her child hopelessly lost to angel dust i like that the films would present such harshly critical portrayals of people in their own community without sugarcoating or trying to redeem them to make them more palatablebr br there are a lot of hootworthy elements such as when dolemite says move over and let me pass or im gonna be pulling these hush puppies out your muthatf a there is queen bee reaching over and answering the phone dolemites total experience and you will not be able to miss though you may wish to cover your eyes the extended nude scene by the repulsive mayor i am all for mustachioed pervy older men but even i have limitsand my limits are usually a few miles past most peoples so be warned the dvd i had is clearly edited which is noticeable in certain of the dialogue scenes and at the end when dolemites killing of a major character with his bare hands obviously excludes the main eventbr br if you do get the dvd however be sure to watch all three trailers for the dolemite films as they are a hoot i wasnt going to watch the human tornado but after seeing that trailer youd better believe that i am also there is a scene in the dolemite trailer that i dont remember from the movie when dolemite swings at a mexicanlooking thug obviously misses and the guy flips himself into a nearby car trunkbr br after watching the first half i was going to say to skip this and watch disco godfather as the filmmaking and story has marginally improved but after really enjoying the second half i would advise watching this one over disco godfather as this one is even more exuberantly fun outrageous and goodnaturedand has those toasts which even if one doesnt understand the roots and nuances of the form are still something to seebr br  check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies cinema de merde cinemademerdecom
