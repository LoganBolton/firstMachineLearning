filmmakers made a rather boring everymans story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home at the same time were exposed to a truly original existential french loner br br the film is more than a documentary hardly ever do i feel that ive experienced something thats accidentally profound which makes it all the more profoundbr br film has visually interesting interior moments absolutely loved the journey the filmmakers took me on quite a lot of europeans in the credits hopefully pbs will screen this so that it reaches a wider audience in the usa
