even if you do not typically enjoy documentaries odds are you will find this one fascinating not only does it have a wellmapped out plot that while easy to follow contains its interesting detours it also has a very strong emotional resonance and not one that relies on a simple specific tone instead the emotions here are as profound and turbulent as the seas featuredbr br that being said if you know nothing of donald crowhurst and the 1968 singlehanders boat race around the worldas was the case for meplease stop reading and rentview this film br br spoilers followbr br my friend brian recommended this at the same time that my aunt had sent me a clipping linking this film with antonionis work in 2007 i was mesmerized by several of antonionis films still am to connect this film to antonioni i think is a bit of a stretch the character most likely to be seen in one of michaelangelos movies is francoise moitessier de cazalet its funny on the main imdb page he isnt even listed as playing himself which is probably a function of his lengthy name as opposed to his self realizationrenunciation since moitessier sails right out of the race that could be considered is a bit like anna in lavventura quite a major minor characterbr br while there are many things to love about this film the actual footage from the time the stoic best friend the sheer power of the roaring forties i walked away with a simple connection a man truly at sea there have been times in my life where i wonder how i got to such a point caught between dreams and reality feeling like a stowaway in my own skin it may be that im reading too much into this documentary and that in turn the directors read too much into crowhurst but i found that sense as spellbinding as the other secrets kept in this filmbr br on the odd chance that crowhursts wife who seemed a remarkable study in restraint with understandably conflicted overtones and his children so young in the found footage and still young at this late date in the sense of their pain and pride for their father i am certain the comments here and the film itself fail to catch the man that your father was in his death however he has given the world a glimpse of something like a lost myth he is a pregps odysseus never finding his body adds to the air of frail immortality if not the stature of a cosmic being of which he had writbr br this film sticks with you after the viewing as if you expect another twist to emerge from the deep waters or at the very least you hope for the moitessier sequelbr br thurston hunger 810
