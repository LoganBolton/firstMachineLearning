have you ever found yourself watching a film or documentary and having to hold yourself back from screaming things like no dont do it no well its time you do and undoubtedly deep water is the one to get you startedbr br the story is based on that of donald crowhurst and his entry into the first roundtheworld yacht race to be undertaken by individuals in 1968 that word individuals is important as the men who set off on this nearly suicidal escapade head out alonebr br most of the men are wellknowns in the seafaring communities of england where they launch from but one of them is the unknown dark horse and his name was donald crowhurst struggling financially crowhurst enlists a backer who can take everything from him should he fail to at least attempt to make it through a large portion of the race he could take his home his property everythingbr br crowhurst now finds himself between a rock and well deep water either attempt the race with an unproven ship and an unproven captain or lose everything you own which was significant since crowhurst had a wife and several children youll note the term unproven captain in there too not only was he unproven hed never been out on the open sea did i mention suicidal flicking between archival footage of the pre and postrace and those of crowhursts friends family and acquaintances of today deep water is put together masterfully initially seen as a poor sap who got in over his head the film gradually shows you the limited choices crowhurst had after months and months out on the water his ship leaks equipment breaks psyche stretched to the breaking point and beyond crowhurst finds himself lost in an internal struggle with no successful way out it is interesting too to see the psychological breaks that other racers have as they deal with their solitary confinement onboard their respective boatsbr br the wavelike emotions that youll feel as you watch this astounding documentary may make you a bit ill not unlike trying to get your sealegs and youll probably be frustrated at the choices being made perhaps just as frustrated as poor mr crowhurstbr br the ending is also amazing in that we get to see the actual ship that crowhurst sailed sitting deserted and rotting on a caribbean beach not unlike other things that felt deserted and rotting toward the end of this poorly thoughtout racebr br incredible
