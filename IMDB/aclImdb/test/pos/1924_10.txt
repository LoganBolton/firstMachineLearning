deep water 2006 br br it is indifferent its there waiting for you to make one slip up those words paraphrased are perhaps the best sum up of the nature of the ocean i have ever heard muttered its furies are boundless not least of which her loneliness those words come from the mesmerizing and heartbreaking documentary deep water it is the story of donald crowhurst an amateur sailor who partook in the 1969 sunday times race around the world if you do not know his story it may be best to stop reading now dont read this or any other information on crowhurst or the race find the film and just watch it br br after the first solo circumnavigation of the ocean in 1967 adventurers and watchers of adventurers began seeking the next oneup this time the journey would have to be done without making landfall or stopping along the way having fallen on hard times crowhurst saw the race as a great chance to get his family back on their feet he had lived through financial hardships as a child and wanted part in going back to such a life so he set out to find sponsors and soon did in stanley best and rodney hallworth the two men spelled the potential cash cow and granted crowhurst a boat on the condition that if he should pull out of the race he would be forced himself to pay the expenses his boat however was in serious need of repairs and he feared it would not be ready in time for the final departure day he was informed however by his sponsors that he simply must go Â– after all they ponied up the dough and expected it back many a time over br br the details of the story are infamous crowhursts boat began taking on water and his progress slowed to a crawl faced with the decision of trying to round the horn of africa certain death in such a boat or turn back financial devastation and destitution he searched for a third option he chose to hide out alone on his yacht waiting for other competitors to round cape horn in south america from there he would rejoin the race he reported false positions and record breaking speeds then he stopped all communication for fear that his position would be given away he also had to painstakingly construct fake log books for each day of a journey he did not take eventually the loneliness the guilt and the realization that he would likely be caught weighed too heavy on crowhurst his final log entries make the musings of a kurtz seem entirely sane only a few weeks from home he turned his boat away from home and is reported to have jumped overboard soon thereafter br br crowhursts odyssey is a fascinating one and its ending is heartbreaking but strikes of inevitability our dreams so often turn into fears and the consequences of our actions often leave us so few options for a happy ending it is a story of a descent into madness teased on by the infinite abyss of the cruel seas the filmmakers do a wonderful job in telling this story its put together with chilling audio and video recordings done by crowhurst and narrations of his everincreasingly maddening log notes the story starts slowly and may distract some viewers but the rewards of the story are entirely worthwhile as it progresses br br there are also inquiries into some of the other competitors such as frenchman bernard moitessier who was on par to likely win the speed competition only to pull out and begin a second trip around the world also in the film is robin knoxjohnston who was the winner of the competition he donated his prize money to the crowhurst family br br to read briefly on the crowhurst saga simply does not do justice its interesting of course but a quick browse bypasses the raw emotions and oddness presented here the final moments of deep water are genuinely heart breaking hearing the thoughts of his widowed family and the adoration and understanding of his friends this is a fascinating story and it is that which carries the documentary into such great channels
