ideas are dangerous comment by one intervieweebr br dvd rating b  4 out of 5  8 out of 10  worth the timebr br a great story for adults  or teen boaters but not for children none of the stupid violent crime stuff so often mistaken by hollywood these days as quality work and it can be used as a trainer film on what proper boating preparation is all about or not about prior to sailing the seven seas the movie starts out somewhat slowly to develop the story as most documentaries do but as it draws the viewer into the saga emotions begin to percolate in ones head emotions include anger sadness and disbelief the era late 1960sbr br that solo sailing around the globe is dangerous is not surprising what is surprising is all the twists that viewers wouldnt expect its not your average group of guys in a sailing race each boat was different as allowed by the race rules each solo sailor had different levels of ability as allowed by the race rules there were well known sailors among them and a few not so well known one was considered a mystery man as nobody seemed to have any knowledge of his ability at all each boat was allowed to depart at will so long as all were underway by a certain date and this was of course prior to modern electronics that allow boaters to communicate with shore about vicious storms etcbr br actual video and audio recordings are interspersed with interviews of family members and others involved the mood of the interviewees is always somber despite the years that have passedbr br the main character don is the focus of attention  how his journey relates to those who he not only wanted to beat but due to circumstances of his own creation had to beat he had to win the story was about what that circumstance did to his life as he moved south west across the atlantic ocean over a years time alone on the waterbr br do not fail to view the special features section of the dvd once the film is finished the entire saga isnt fully understood wo viewing the bonus stuffbr br in the end once youve watched everything on the dvd you will likely just shake your head and exclaim wow and keep in mind that is why the story has remained alive for the last 40 yearsbr br spoiler do not fail to view the special features section of the dvd once the film is finished one sailor who was headed back to england after circumnavigating the globe decided on the fly that no he was going for another spin and the film records his spouses opinions about that decision the opposite story unfolds as another sailor wishes the race allowed two on board so he could take his wife along and their photos demonstrate a very warm union between them the interview with an burley ex paratrooper who had actually rowed a boat across the atlantic with a friend prior to the solo sail race was incredibly funny as he described not even knowing how to sail and who thought the bad things happening to him were normal too many people think that setting sail in the open sea can be an romantic adventure without mishap dont you be one
