one of the last films directed by lionel barrymore ten cents a dance stars barbara stanwyck as the dancehall girl barbara in her sixth role stanwyck looks quite plainjane in this one and opens with her getting chewed out by the dance hall manager then along comes rich guy bradley carlton ricardo cortez who wants to sweep her off her feet cortez and stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s then she meets eddie whos very different from the dashing carlton the writer jo swerling had worked on some biggies its a wonderful life guys and dolls and gone with the wind so i was surprised that the characters and script in this were so ordinary the story starts getting more interesting about halfway thru and is very similar to the bride walks out from 1936 also starring stanwyck tbwo is much more clever but also more tame due to onslaught of the hays code
