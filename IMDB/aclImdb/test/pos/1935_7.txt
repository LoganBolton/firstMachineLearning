this is one of barbara stanwycks earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme shes making money by dancing with men at a dance hall she really doesnt like the work but its a living her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy but shes also pursued by rich guy ricardo cortez well after marrying it turns out her nice guy is a thieving womanizing weasel and rich cortez turns out to be a heck of a guy by the end of the film barbara simply has had enough as any sane woman would walk from this horrid marriagebr br in the 1920s and early 30s hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes or scenes that would surprise many todaysuch as nudity adultery and bad language while ten cents a dance isnt a blatant example of this morality it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the toughened production code was created and enforced starting in 1934 in some ways the code was greatafter all parents didnt need to worry about what their kids saw in films such as nudity in ben hur 1925 however it also tended to sanitize some of the movies far too muchand there is no way this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorcea serious nono 1934 and thereafter this is really a shame as i dont think ten cents a dance was bad at all to discuss thisespecially since the star barbara stanwyck was married to a philandering thief even so allowing the film to end with her divorcing him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just couldnt have beenbr br overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time give this one a lookbr br fyisadly ricardo cortez was actually not hispanic but changed his name because of possible prejudice because he was jewish he was an excellent leading man of his time but today is all but forgotten
