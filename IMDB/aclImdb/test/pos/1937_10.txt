this is a forgotten classic of a film and harmony karin borrowed a ton from it for gummo gummo is good rivers edge is way way better its no secret that keanu reeves isnt the best actor whoever walked the earth no in fact hes a horrendous actor but he was born for some roles ted preston esquire from bill and ted and his role in this film he is perfect as a sort of good natured but very apathetic and confused teenager then theres crispin glover i think his performance in this film is the best of his career he is phenomenal as the drugged out wackjob character then theres dennis hopper who is perfect as well this movie is simply amazing and if you havent seen it run out and watch it today its brilliant one of the best portrayals of modern america ive seen
