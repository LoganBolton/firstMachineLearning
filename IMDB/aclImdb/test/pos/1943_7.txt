i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when i came across this movie it was so clearly about teens in the early 80s and i called my mom hahaha turn to channel such and such the kid totally looks like if dad were a kidbr br um yeah turns out this movie is about my dad  his friendsbr br even without it being about loosely based on my dads childhood id say watch this movie br br it is justbizarre to say the least the apathy instilled in teens even back then this is a good human interest and showcases some strange sides of the psyche
