i have seen this movie three times going back to vcrs in the 1980s and again on the encor channel last night feb11 2010 based on a true story which i remember being in the news during the early 1980s ive decided that i find it too disturbing to watch ever again yet its hard to look away from a car accident the creepiest character is joshua john miller who plays keeanu reeves little brother br br the story this movie was based on can be found anywhere on the internet  just google it its about anthony jacques broussard who murdered marcy conrad in milpitas california in 1981 the characters portray generation x pregrunge borderline sociopaths with the exception of keeanu reeves who grows a consciencebr br old hippies did a great job raising that generationbr br for such a young kid i thought joshua miller was excellent as the serial killer in the making character in actuality he went to yale and has written screenplays as well as directed his acting capabilities in this film were amazing just the way he treats his little sister by drowning her doll and tearing up her dolls grave gave me the shivers it gave me nightmares even with whats happening in our world today in 2010 it still is the most degenerate film ive seen to date br br the apathy and dysfunction of these families is enough to make one puke this thrill kill almost makes the manson murders pale in comparison br br crispon glover got a little too much into character he wound up on david lettermen to discuss his role and almost kicked the host in the head apparrently glover had to seek psychiatric help after portraying his character br br also fight the good fight to the great dennis hopper youre one of the best
