i didnt expect much from this movie it was just one of those movies i thought id just watch because it was on television i certainly underestimated this movie br br its about a guy who kills his girlfriend and brags to his friends i was very happy with the acting they had the characters played well it was a particularly great scene when feckdennis hopper and johndaniel roebuck are talking to each other about why john killed jamie its upsetting to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel control and thats why but feck had loved the girl he had killed feck felt remorse while john felt nothing hell he was proud of what hed done it really makes you think about people keanu reeves did a great job as matt and ione skye was good its weird to see her as a valedictorian in say anything and her as clarissa every actor did great at acting it was real nice for a change it was a great movie and i would definitely say i recommend it
