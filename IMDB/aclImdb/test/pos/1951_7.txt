a teenage film about angst friendship loyalty and growingup but this isnt a happy outing on its part due to the circumstances and lifechanging dilemmas surrounding the premise what eventuates is quite numbing haunting and downright cold however i was expecting something a little more powerful and effective and while engrossing and unforgettable it didnt entirely stir up much in the way of emotions the performances are reasonably a mixed bag but theres a brutal honesty to them all dennis hopper and especially daniel roebuck are amazing crispin glover eccentrically over does it and keanu reeves dead as wood turn seems to pay off in his custom slacker role joshua john millar is quite good and so is ione skye jim metzler chimes in with a short but highly engaging performance the story is dramatically confronting characterlaced and harrowing in its eventual breakdown where it infuses a gritty and painful punch jürgen kniepers swirling music score is simmering with anxiety tension and wonder as the morals and commitments are tested and learnt
