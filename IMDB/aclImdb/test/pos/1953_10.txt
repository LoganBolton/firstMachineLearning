apparently this movie was based on a true story im not sure how accurate it is though but it really reminded me of how when i see that someone has been murdered on the news its amazing how much it doesnt affect me sure i think its terrible but i honestly dont care i move on it seems that murder is trivial now this is what rivers edge shows nobody really seems to care about this girl and her death not even the killer then whats the point br br the killer in this story is john and for the large amount of the movie he hides out with another killer named feck played by dennis hopper feck is older and you can see the generational gap he says he loved the girl that he killed when he asks john if he loved the girl he killed he simply replies she was okay the movie only seems to offer one solution life is more important than death a characters life is spared people get second chances and one hopeless case is killedbr br the acting is really good after watching this movie i could only come to the conclusion that crispin glover is either a brilliant actor or a terrible actor i still have no idea he was my main reason to see this movie though but the best performance is clearly given by dennis hopperbr br even though the fashion is really 80s and characters sometimes mention thencurrent issues i still think rivers edge is as relevant today as everbr br my rating 1010
