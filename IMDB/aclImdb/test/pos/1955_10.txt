imdb forces reviewers to type a certain amount of lines but all i really want to say is  this is an incredible film and you cant consider yourself a film fan without having seen it you ought to just trust me on this one and stop reading this review and get the movie and push play but i have to type something so let me point out the following br br 1 rivers edge contains what still may well rank as crispin glovers alltime funniest and best performance in a film and if you have been following crispin glover at all you know that that alone justifies giving it a 10 funny lines galorebr br 2 rivers edge contains the secondmost memorable performance of dennis hoppers career other than the one in blue velvet and it is really excellent dennis hopper is really funnybr br 3 rivers edge contains the best performance of keanu reeves career and it is excellent it was the role he was born to play he has plenty of good lines but one in particular is really really funny listen close when his character and the stepdad are talking to one anotherbr br still the best stoner film it is much more than just that it tends to show up in the drama sections of filmrental stores but if this is a drama its the funniest drama of all time
