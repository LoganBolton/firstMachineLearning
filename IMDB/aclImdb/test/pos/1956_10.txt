i really dont have any complaints about this movie except for the disturbing scenes with the body i fell upon it while switching around the tv one night the acting was actually amazing i didnt expect it to be better than it appeared i thought keanuswho looks the same since 1986 which is a very good thing hehe acting was really great and crispin played his character perfectly this movie is a hidden gem its a fresh awaking of reality to the 80s compared to the other teen movies done by the brat packeven though i do like those moives alot too all in all i give it thumbs up
