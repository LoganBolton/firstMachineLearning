i can remember a college professor commenting as to how disturbing this film was reflecting the apathy of adolescents this was before generation xbr br in a way most of us are products of the same consumer culture these high school kids spend their time drinking getting high and wondering what to do about the body left on a riverbankbr br what would they do today would things be different some very important questions there are some excellent scenes with keanu reeves and the dysfunctional family he lives with his 11 year old brother going out to get wasted the mother has no idea what to do spends her time drinking with her boyfriendbr br this film was a bit before its time in that it addresses the problems in lower class american society these kids had no outlet what is available for them in this dirtwater town  all in all a few interesting social commentaries are presented and there are no solutions 910
