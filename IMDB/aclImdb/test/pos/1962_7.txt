less than zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they actually stuck to the damn book but where they hadnt this movie presents does the job and leaves you with the creepiest feeling when its all over in ways not done until the late nineties with larry clarks movies kids and bully br br societal outcast teens are faced with a rather curious dilemma they dont treat it much like one when their estranged friend daniel roebuck boasts to them that he killed a teenage girl near the rivers edge in their suburban town keanu reeves may be the only civilized character among the bunch the only one willing to exhibit any sort of conscience anyway while the others either dont do anything about the girls death or want to help their friend hide the body br br i dont know who is more sick in this filmcrispin gloverwho becomes nearly obsessed and quite paternal in trying to protect the friend and hide the crime by smuggling him out of the state dennis hopper an onedge drug dealer who clings to a female blowup doll that befriends the teens as a dealer of course and suddenly becomes involved in the events or josh miller who plays reeves little brother tim he appears to be the most apathetic of them all at least until his emotional breakdown at the end it is definitely not peppy 80s teen fare obviously and certainly makes the point strikingly clear about the serious detachment these kids deal with despite a bizarre series of events thanks to many great performances all around even reeves proved some acting capabilitybr br help yourself to a comedy to recover if it rocks you too hard
