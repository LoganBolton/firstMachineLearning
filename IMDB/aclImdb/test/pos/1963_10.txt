i just saw this movie for the second time i first saw it back in the mid90s as a vanguard video selection it has retained it powerbr br it is interesting from several aspects one is that it is based on a true story two is it is a launching pad for two interesting actors keanu reeves and crispin glover and three it has dennis hopper in one of his better social misfitpsychotic character rolesbr br the movie is also a study in the way people act in different settings you have characters in oneonone family peer group school general society settings etc the story does well in demonstrating how a person will act in each settingbr br i wish i could find the details of the actual murder to compare to the movie i saw a short bit that indicated it occurred in california and that several schoolmates were taken to view the corpse br br this is a good choice for a rainy night video rental be prepared to feel unsettled at the end
