one of the better movies to come out of the 1980s this basedonfact movie tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend leaves her naked body on a river bank and brags about it later to his friends what is just as bad is their inability to feel anything about itbr br disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic kids who have no respect for their parents or any sort of authority who seem almost doomed to live lives of rebellion and recklessness this drama hits hard and is impossible to forget the young cast does a creditable job  even keanu reeves in one of his earliest roles is better than usual of course theres no reason for the character of layne crispin glover to be as crazed and offthewall as he is but thats just glover being himself veteran dennis hopper has an especially good role as a loner who despite his own sordid past is saddened by the attitudes of this group of kids i would like to point out the chilling performance by daniel roebuck as the young murderer hes an underrated actor and aside from hopper his is probably the best performance in the filmbr br i saw rivers edge for the first time a long time ago when it first started being shown on cable tv movie channels however i didnt catch all of it i saw it in its entirety for the first time a number of years later and now ive seen it again for what is probably the definitive timebr br some potently affecting moments include madeleines constance forslund breakdown where she wails that maybe she should leave her children just like their worthless father did i also liked the scenes where matt reeves faces off with his disturbed younger brother joshua miller and when the teacher mr burkewaite jim metzler deplores the fact that the girl has died and that none of his students seem to carebr br i will never forget this film not as long as i live its too saddening for thatbr br 1010
