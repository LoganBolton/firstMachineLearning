this is actually the first movie i ever saw in a theatre  where the people didnt leave immediately when the end credits started in stead they remained seated for a few minutes  gaping with their mouths open staring in the infinite  trying to understand what they ve just seenbr br the only thing i can say try to go watch this movie with as little knowledge about it as possible so did i i gave it a 10
