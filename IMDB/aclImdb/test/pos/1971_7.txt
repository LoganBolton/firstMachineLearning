david cronenberg movies are easily identifiable or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks fetishism the blurring between the organic and inorganic squishy throbbing things that shouldnt be squishy and throbbing existenz is classic cronenberg briefly its about a future generation of computer games but instead of a video monitor visuals are supplied by your mind the game plugs directly into a bio port in the base of your spine and while the game is running the player cant tell reality from game jennifer jason leigh plays the games developer guiding a novitiate marketeer jude law through the games paces while in the game they uncover strange goingson and possible crimes but are they real or is it the game not even the games author knows br br the movie is quite a treat keeping the viewer engaged but in the dark until the final minutes another thing i like about existenz is that it doesnt use a heavy reliance on special effects its the story itself that propels the movie recommended for the saturday night when science fiction is called for
