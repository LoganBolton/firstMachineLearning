this movie is breathtaking and mindblowing but i think maybe it can only be appreciated by diehard rpg funs it is like a game one problem is the plot is too gamelike and just has too many twists the twists are excessive jude law gives a very good performance i really like him in this movie just as jerome in gattaca and gigglo joe in ai
