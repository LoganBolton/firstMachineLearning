warning plot spoilerbr br the alwaysabnormal movies of david cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste fans of his earlier films will probably like existenz but it definitely isnt one for the squeamish all of the usual elements are here a game pod made out of skin hooked into your back buckets of blood a gun made out of bones and a manic mechanic to name but a few the result is good in parts bad in parts and just plain weird in others but one thing the film has is undeniable originality br br despite the excessive use of weirdness it does prove a point virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people in the movie a character shoots someone dead claiming that he was annoying assuming that she was still in the game but it leaves the question as to whether that really happened or if it was an occurrence in this stunningly lifelike game existenz leads to a conclusion that can be responded to in several ways br br despite some extra gadgets and gook it was simply your classic it was all a dream or was it twist it is a smart surprise and answers a few questions but giving that the entire film was leading up to this moment is a bit disappointing at only 97 minutes it could have went on a bit longer too in a peculiar way the film raises moral issues but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way br br jennifer jason leigh appears here in her first big role in quite a while but her character doesnt have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a likeable character jude law on the other hand equipped with a curious american accent is good as your average joe sucked into this abnormal world we see the film through his perspectivebr br existenz is far from flawless but it certainly is a movie experience to remember theres tonnes of weird characteristics to match the similar styles of david lynch what next  being consumed by a question mark it definitely isnt for all tastes but it is rewarding enough to recommend my imdb rating 6210
