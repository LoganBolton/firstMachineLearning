so lets beginbr br the movie itself is as original as cronenbergs movies would usually appearbr br my intention to see it was certainly jjl being one of my favourite actresses she is as lovely as usual this cutiebr br i would not say it was my favourite movie of hers still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow br br the rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array br br recommend with confidence
