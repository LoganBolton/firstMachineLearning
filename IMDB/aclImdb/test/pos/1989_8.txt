existenz is an exploration of reality and virtual reality wherein characters run from realm to realm landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where its leading them within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games calling into question which reality they arrive from is the real onebr br of course its not spectacular at hiding the fact that its not going to reasonably answer to a true reality instead tossing the idea of whether its real or a video game into question even up to the end im not even sure cronenberg pretends that twist wont be there its so incredibly obvious in a sense its kind of disconcertingbr br the problem with this film though is its base nature in a sense cronenberg is questioning reality and criticizing game play yet the same things that he uses to criticize game play makes him revel in it the violence the discontinuity the lack of focus and in a sense the pixellation even if there isnt such pixellation in the film i have once heard someone state that cronenbergs violence is actually a criticism of hyperviolence in media but he hides that well with the fact that he derives such incredible pleasure in ripping new orifices into humans animals and amorphous piles of biological sludgebr br what is brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of video game conceits not being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that dont make sense only a few people around where it feels there should be many and viceversa all of that stuff along with the motif of penetration it definitely deconstructs the video game reality in a way thats nauseating and absurd but it does it even better by replacing video game electronics with literal pods of biological matter that squirm and shift and are frankly disgusting to the one of the most horrifying degrees for what its worth this film causes a reaction in youbr br but what for it criticizes virtual reality but its a movie it is its own virtual reality it seems to criticize the banality of video game plot lines and character design yet it maintains that banality it definitely seems to worry over whether killing a video game character is more okay than killing an actual human being and how video games can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in real life and yet i say again it derives the utmost pleasure from ripping people objects beasts things and organisms into bloody shredsbr br so whereas it has a key focus of angst it doesnt really do anything with it not really only what it does do is present that angst in such an original way it cant really be denied its own moment of splendorbr br in a sense itd be much easier to just hate this movie for being gory and violent because theres no good reason i can see for loving it and yet i cant disregard it as mediocre or bad itd be easier to simply not be able to take it but since i can theres nothing i can really do with it i do believe it is a little excessive it really didnt need to go as far as it went but cronenbergs intentions are so mixed up and confused i dont know if that was cronenbergs flaw or cronenbergs point and i dont think theres really any way to figure it out except maybe ask him directlybr br polarisdib
