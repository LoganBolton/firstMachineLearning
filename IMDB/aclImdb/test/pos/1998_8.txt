okul is the first of its kind in turkish cinema and its way better than i expected those people who say its neither scary nor funny have a point its not all that great indeed but it must be kept in mind that everyone involved with the movie is rather amateur so its basically a maiden voyage and comparing this one to sinan çetins other films such as the 1st class garbage propaganda this movie is pretty damn goodbr br one thing that must be said it deals with the highschool students life in turkey very realistically thats exactly how it goes the scenes that are meant to scare are somewhat cheap and hollywoodish most of them even if not all but that religion lesson scene made me laugh in tears and emre kýnay performs the best acting of this flick as a religion teacherbr br its not a waste of your time go and watch it youll find it rather amusing especially if you know turkey enough to relate to turkish youngsters school lives
