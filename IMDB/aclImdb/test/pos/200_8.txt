i had long wanted to watch this romantic drama with a wwii setting and now that i have all i can say is that its a veritable masterpiece of russian cinema br br soviet films are known for their overzealous propagandist approach but thankfully this ones free of such emphasis  with the interest firmly on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vivacious girl doomed by the outbreak of war for which he gladly volunteers but from which hell never return the girl a remarkable performance from tatyana samojlova is also loved by the young mans cousin and when she doesnt receive word from her boyfriend gives in to the latter and marries him he however is an aspiring concert pianist bitter about the war having curtailed his chances for success and knowing too that the girls still devoted to the soldier begins to neglect her finally word reaches the girl of her loved ones death but by the end of the film she has learnt to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and is content to live with her memories of himbr br the film features some truly amazing camerawork which makes extremely judicious use of the screen space and by frequently adopting tracking tilted and high or low angle shots renders great power to the unfolding emotional drama individual sequences are equally impressive  two in particular the stunning scene frenetically edited and spedup to boot in which the girl saves an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck and the young mans premature demise in an unfortunate incident at the front undoubtedly one of the best of its kind ive ever watched with the sun moving away from him symbolizing the life thats seeping out of his body as he imagines the wedding day hell never have also notable however is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home thats been hopelessly devastated during an air raid as is her final violent capitulation to the concert pianist  which she tries to resist by repeatedly slapping him in the face  taking place during a later air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of billowing curtainsbr br disappointingly the r1 dvd of this outstanding film is a barebones affair the ruscico edition features a few supplements but being an export tends to be heavily overpriced and hard to track down to boot criterion released it in conjunction with another warthemed russian classic ballad of a soldier 1959  which my pal at the local dvd rental outlet has told me is forthcoming br br the only other film ive watched from this director is the arctic epic the red tent 1969 albeit via the muchshorter usrelease version a starstudded international production based on true events given the unmistakable artistic quality of the cranes are flying i regret missing out now on his famous documentary i am cuba 1964 a number of times when i was in hollywood late last year apart from receiving a oneweek theatrical run it was shown more than once on tv accompanied by a featurelength making of
