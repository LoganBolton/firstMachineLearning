well let me put it this way  i have always been one of the hardcore brothers ive always loved rock music and especially heavy metal thats why this movie is like a gift from god i believe this movie is one of the best movies ever well except from neverending story and star wars of course  its great to hear all the classics like long live rock and roll dio stranglehold ted nugent songs by jon bon jovie deep purple acdc zakk wylde and several other legendary rock bands heavenly absolutely gorgeous wonderful i hope they will make more movies like this otherwise its just crap movies like that ac in da usa or what they call it and 8 miles bulls well i strongly recommend this anyway everything im missing is a couple of stratovariussongs but except from that its one of the best movies ever ten out of ten
