so you wanna be a rock star see this movie you dont like rock you say or youre really into heavy metal then put on your favorite album and dream yourself away this movie has nothing to offer rarely have i ever seen a movie being able to portrait the dream of being in a rock band as good as this i had long hair during the late 1980s and early nineties and i have played guitar for the last 15 years or so did i like rock star oh yes the music is good not great the actors are good and believable even jennifer aniston plays her part to perfection and mark wahlberg is perfect as the wannabe rock singer so you know what youre going to get a movie about dreams coming true being stepped on and finally figuring out what life is really about its a good solid seven out of ten no more no less
