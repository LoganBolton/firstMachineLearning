i was very excited to see rock star because i am a big fan of mark wahlbergs i was surprised to have liked it more than i originally thought i would the script did leave something to be desired but the movies performances made up for it there were a few moments when visions of spinal tap came rushing back and i cant help but think this movie would have been even better as a mocumentary but i digressbr br wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent as he plays with believability an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true he does it with the wonder and innocence that make you not only believe him but also make you really care about his characterbr br jennifer aniston who hasnt impressed me in movies up to this point is surprisingly good as the girlfriendmanager she shows more real emotion than ive seen in her last few movies combinedbr br but above all its the music in this movie that really draws you in peppered with some 80s tunes lets face it  bon jovi would have any 80s music fans rocking in their seat the movie really rocks with the original steel dragon songs and wahlbergs performance of thembr br i plan to see this movie again but first im going to rush out and buy the soundtrack
