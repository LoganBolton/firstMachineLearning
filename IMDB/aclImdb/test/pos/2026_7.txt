rock star is a nice movie everyone is nice even the guys who arent supposed to be nice really are nice chris is a nice guy who learns a lesson in life he goes back to his girlfriend emily who is also nice br br its a good movie despite all the niceness maybe im just used to all the angst of the x gen music in some ways the film was a caricature of rock stars and not hard edged enough to be believablebr br mark wahlbergs acting is quite good jennifer aniston played her role well but it was uncomplicated she was a nice girl br br go see it if you have ever been to a rock concert or seen spinal tap go see it
