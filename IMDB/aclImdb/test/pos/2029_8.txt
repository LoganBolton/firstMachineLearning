what to say about a movie like rock star a lot actually this is the type of movie that is almost tailer made for the critics to slam it is also a movie i as a major hard rock fan enjoyednoloved actuallywhile all the while being very consciously aware of its many flaws and that the movie while a decent effort in some respects missed the chance it had to escape into greatness and become a rock movie classic oh wellbr br i loved this movieand would see it again and againbut i know thats purely based on my own personal tastesrock star is a movie that will appeal to anyone who has experienced elements of the rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go down the road to nostalgia it was a great time for metal heads and its nice to have a movie that effectively captures thatlong forgot by many nonrock fans time effectively as i think that rock star has done that is one of the films strengths the concert footage you will feel like your right there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love that as far as setting the atmosphere rock star gets a 10 of 10 it also gets a 10 of 10 for pure entertainment if you want a movie to just let yourself go and free flow into some great memories of good times past then this is the movie for you it is also the reason why i loved this movie sobr br but it isnt a great movie i understand that and were it my actual job to review movies professionally id probably have to be a bit hard on this one the problem with rock star is the character developmentbr br what is wrong with the character development is this there isnt any none the movie has certain scenesfew and far between but they are therethat do touch on greatnesswarning brief scene spoilers 3 examples 1when izzy makes his debut on stageincluding the fall he takesbr br 2the first after show party with emilyanniston and izzybr br 3backtracking a littlein the beginning when the original lead singer is casually dismissedfiredthe whole business as usual tone sets the stage for whats to come its played very effectivelybr br but the problem is nothing ever does come there is little to no character development of anyone in this movie peoples personas are merely touched on but never fully explored i dont think thats the fault of the actorsactressesparticularly anniston who tries hard they just are not given much to work with its just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the formula feel into true movie depth rock star was so sugarcoated at timesincluding towards the end it was almost ridiculous and  though those scenes i mentioned were outstanding and very believable sadly much else in the movie wasntbr br another reviewer mentioned the lack of buildup towards the end and i agree but there was actually a lack of buildup about anything why does izzy leave at the end because he misses his girlfriend and the band wont let him write songs it tests the limits of believability and frankly the end was just corny made no sense and had no reality to it at allbr br watching this its almost like watching a movie where the makers of it said ok this happens here and then this happens and then this etc etc etc by the end its no longer a movie about a boy whos dream came true its just another thickly formulated love story and you wonder why so much detail is left outbr br i hope im not being to hard on rock star because i truly loved itbut not for the right reasons i would have liked to love this as a great movie about the highs and lows of rock fame instead i loved it for its 80s period feel the clothes the hair the lights the life although many others loved it to i suspect most are people who lived the life of a rock fan like i did or some who play id have liked to see the movie cross over and just be respected for being a good well told movie instead of a clich√© i think one of the problems was the length i myself hate over long films but this was one that really should have been longer if a movie is done really right the length is not even feltthere is just to much to the story for it to be as short as it wasthats one reason why there doesnt seem to be much development of either the story or the human beings portrayed in the moviebr br soto wind downthis is a movie you can greatly get into but not a great movie see it for fun see it for entertainment see it to go back to that great great space in time when metal wasnt just a part of life it was lifeand for those non rock fanssee it to get a little glimpse into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us
