if you like the 80s rock you should definitely see this movie ive only seen it recently and completely fell in love with itbr br overall the movie is very entertaining provides you with a great load of rock tunes and not a single second of the movie do i find boring it was a great idea that some of the reallife musicians were in this doing what they do best i was happy to see zakk as well as blas elias they all delivered solid performances i tend to agree with a lot of people saying that the first half of the movie was much better than the second one specially in the terms of the scriptthat could have been worked on a bit better but not a major biggie one thing that did bother me a bit was jennifer anistons performance i thought she wasnt the right person for this rolei just couldnt see her as a rock star girlfriendbut as the movie goes on you somehow realize that she did a good job with thisthere is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity she delivers that just doesnt live you cold br br to summarize a good and a funny movie that doesnt go deep into characters but provides you with a good fun a sense of nostalgia and of course the mighty vocals by jeff scott soto and mike matijevic
