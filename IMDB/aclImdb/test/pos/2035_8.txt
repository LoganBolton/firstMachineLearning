rock star is a welltold hollywoodstyle rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how ripper became rob halfords replacement for judas priest mark wahlberg poured on his likable boyish charm and performed with believable admirably something he has been known to do since the release of boogie nightsbr br stephen herek no stranger to musicallythemed movies takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species the hairmetal rock god wahlbergs izzy acts as the films host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true his likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the metal goat horn handsign several times overbr br the only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast namely the other members of the band were not fleshed out or even introduced properly more interaction with these lifelong rock musicians would have amplified and solidified izzys new surroundings br br naturally rock star is filled with great music rabins score the steel dragons original work and plenty of 80sstyle metal hits makes this soundtrack a musthave lets all hope that films like rock star not only give a credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation but also spark a veryneeded revival
