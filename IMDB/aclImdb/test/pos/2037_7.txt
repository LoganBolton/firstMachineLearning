surprisingly wellacted wellwritten movie about hard rockinbutdecent young man getting that muchhopedfor ticket to stardom his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer not farfetched the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesnt go overthetop it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business but the script despite solid dialogue follows a triedandtrue formulaic pattern and gets bogged down by its own clich√©s in the final act i enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball almost famous it has a nice bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence but a stronger finish mightve made it more memorable 12 from
