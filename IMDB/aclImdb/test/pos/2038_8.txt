im an action movie fan but until today ive never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in italy so i went to see the long kiss goodnight on paytv hoping for nothing specialbr br but what a surprise this movie is great the only problem i found is the presence of some holes in the plot but the rest is the most entertaining intriguing and funny action movie ever madebr br the transformation of samanthacharly from ordinary wifeteacher to coolblooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea the action scenes and the stunts are the best ive ever seen samuel l jackson adds some of the best lines i have ever heard and his chemistry with geena davis is goodbr br and what about geena she is wonderful she plays the best action heroine ever seen and does strong convincing acting and fantastic stuntsbr br so i think this movie had weak performances at box office and bad critics because most reviewers and some kind of public have a hard time with strong female lead rolesbr br 910
