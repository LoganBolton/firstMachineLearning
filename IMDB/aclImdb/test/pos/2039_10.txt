this is one of the best action films i have seen geenas portrayal of the tough as nails charlygentle mother sam was superb and samuel l jackson just keeps you laughing all the way through with his classic one liners sure there were a few holes in the actual story but this fastpaced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the endbr br i felt geena was a perfect choice for the role of samcharly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie stuart little both samuel and geena were well supported by david morse brian cox sweet little yvonne zima and newcomers sexy craig bierko and melina kanakaredes this film accentuates the growing trend of strong female character and the diversion away from traditional malefemale stereotypes as we see samcharly davis and mitch jackson hurtling from one disaster to the nextbr br while i and many others loved this movie it is fair to say that there will always be people that dont and thats fine  each to their own i highly recommend this film to action fans for its hilarious scenes and fastpaced action
