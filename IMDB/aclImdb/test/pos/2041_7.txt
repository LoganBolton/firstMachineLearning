br br spoilers in this reviewbr br the long kiss goodnight is yet another prime example of a common affliction of many modern films it starts off on a very interesting concept  a trained assassin whose memory was erased regains consciousness of herself  and the initial setup is engaging but then it seems the writers dont know very well where to go next and the whole thing trails off down increasingly confusing andor inane paths leaving the disappointing taste of something that was ok but promised to be a lot better the baddies are remarkably unremarkable and even jacksons comic sidekick turn seems more like something from his prepulp fiction days it looks like harlin as in cutthroat island made every effort so that noone would upstage his then wife her character is by far the best of the film and this fact only makes you feel even more frustrated that they werent able to do something better with itbr br however there is still something about this film which for me sets it apart from the runofthemill hollywood actioner and places it above average if only just it is something very subtle i cant quite put my finger on its a disturbing cold dark even sickly edge a nightmarish and unreal feel a decadent air a mean streak which keeps cropping up in various ways its in the dark reddish photography and almost permanent night the characters dwell in its in samanthas dreams in front of the mirror its in her vicious eyes and smile whenever shes about to kill a man or when she announces how she will enjoy watching her nemesis die with her daughter listening its in mitchs comeback at the wheel of a car while he is spurting so much blood from his mouth he can hardly speak i dont know its an atmosphere something i cant define but which gives me the creeps a bit and which makes this film still oddly intriguing for me
