almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor geena davis is a schoolteacher housewife who suffers from amnesia shee even on the pta but then an auto accident awakens the woman she used to be and its hot samuel l jackson is hilarious as the low rent private eye who tries to help davis find her past only to find out hes in way over his head davis has some hilarious lines too and the interaction between her and jackson works surprisingly wellbr br look for brian cox the original hannibal lechter and david moorse finally managing to shed his st elsewhere tv image the film is directed by davis husband who almost seems to have built the whole film around her but it worksbr br i pull out this dvd and rewatch it often i still love the makeup scene is geena hot or what
