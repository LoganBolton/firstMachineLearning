i was happy to find out that at least now this movie is beginning to get the appreciation it deserves just view those votes not topclass action like die hard or lethal weapon but still something like a solid 7 out of 10 fine script good actors with working chemistry and a director who knows what he wants sadly this was director harlins last good film deep blue sea managed to reach an ok rollercoasterride status but cutthroat island and especially driven are welldeserved flops personally i think the turnoff at the boxoffice might have been the woman as an action startheme well give her a chance because davis does deliver a performance above par and after all this film doesnt concentrate so much on the feminineside but instead on good ol action buddyism jackson as a sidekick is given a lot of room in here plus his share of action and about a thousand killer wisecracks and on the plot from shane black the writer of lethal weapon and the last boy scout the latter of which as a movie is on very many levels much like this onethe theme the clever plot also as good and as underrated overall if one hasnt seen this one yet dont forget to rent it for the next quiet saturday night
