i love this film ive seen it 1000 x on dvd and i cant say enough about it it has it all comedy awesome action and incredible stuntsfx samuel jackson steals the show here big time i dont think there isnt a moment that hes in that he isnt funny everyone knows that when you make an assumption you make an ass out of you and umption the fx are great the bridgetruck explosion is incredible although the sound isnt all that greatwhen samuel drives out of the truck the sound is off a little i think and what he says is priceless for those of you who own it on dvd put the audio in french its halarious even emotional moments are great when the bad guy discovers that samscharlies daughter is his is great this is a great film that no action fan can do without i also reccomend cutthroat island aside from all the negative publicity it kicks
