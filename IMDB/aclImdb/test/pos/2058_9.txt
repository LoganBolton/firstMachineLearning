i enjoyed this film immensely im really into films where females kick lots of butt so this film already had my hopes up for some decent entertainment my hopes were met and exceeded less than 20 minutes into the film the action humor and wit this film contained easily made it one of my favorite films of all time it had sam jackson and his undeniable screen presence geena davis as ive never seen her before demanding your respect and flat out taking it even if you dont want to give itbr br geena plays samantha caine an amnesiac desperate to remember something about her past but quickly realizing the more she finds out the more she wants to forget and eventually becomes consumed until finally samantha is so more and charly is all thats left but now can charly and sam two completely different women possibly exist in the same body we have characters that pop in and out of the film that nurture each side of samcharly like sam jackson and craig bierko craig is also irresistible as timothy the sexy bad guy with no consciencebr br this film was perfectly casted and perfectly acted over the top and wonderfully entertaining you watch the impossible happen and applaud when it does so worth your time watch it you wont be sorry
