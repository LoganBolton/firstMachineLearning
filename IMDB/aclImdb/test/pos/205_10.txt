i would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie if at one point or another you thought youve seen good camera work be prepared to be amazed by this movie for the record this movie was made in 1957 in russia but the technique used here is probably something that weve seen much later in the western worldabout 20 years later the level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot happiness lovewar despairjoy but in the end you remain with something quite unique the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking the young directors from our time should study more this kind of movies and maybe they will be able to create something similareven though i think movies like this are very hard to come by if youve seen i am cuba  then this movie would appeal to you very much but if not be prepared for a unique experience the russian directors have something in common very small budgets great actors and a joy of creating artand yes they are able to create more masterpieces than all the western world together i am not a big fan of russia actually i hate everything thats communist but the film making in that part of the world manages to create such feelings that are hard to describebr br enjoy itbr br
