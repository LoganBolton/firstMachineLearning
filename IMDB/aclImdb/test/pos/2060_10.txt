i feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film it is apparent that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a film just for enjoyment sake or perhaps their enjoyment is derived from the act of picking films apart looking for any reason at all to dislike thembr br the long kiss goodnight is an action film in every sense of the word sure there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi through but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the film itself i have never been a big geena davis fan but i was impressed with how she was able to create two very different characters samantha cain and charlie baltimore in my opinion it wasnt even necessary to have changed her physical appearance to differentiate between the twoher acting was more than enough to do the trickbr br more than anything else though this film was craig bierkos in anothers hands the character of timothy couldve been just another interchangeable villain his decision to play him with a more casual approach was just the right counterpoint to all of the action scenes it isnt often that you find an actor who can express himself so well with just his facial expressionspoint in case the scene in the freezer with charlie and her daughter where most films wouldve cluttered the moment of revelation with unnecessary dialogue bierkos eyes told the whole storybr br the basic plot thin to be truthful a seemingly average housewife who suffers from amnesia slowly discovers that she had been an assassin as her memory returns so do the people who want the assassin dead is she really samantha the cookie baking housewife or charlie the cold blooded assassin or maybe a little bit of both for me the long kiss goodnight was an enjoyable journey to find out
