i hadnt planned on leaving a review but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie i had to say somethingbr br im not going to give away the ending or anything but i do give away some important plot points in this review so you should be aware of that the short nonspoiler version of my review  samuel l jackson and geena davis both kick butt in this movie and its a lot of fun watch itbr br this movie is one of my favorites of all time geena davis is perfect as the action heroine torn between her existing life as a housewife and mother and the memories that are resurfacing of her former life as a cia assassin her performance is superb as she plays both facets of this relatively complex character perfectlybr br samuel l jacksons performance is as always also excellent as the private investigator that geena davis character hired to look into her forgotten past he does a great job of playing the unwitting sidekick to geena davis tough character some of the lines he utters in this movie are the best hes ever used in any movie hes been inbr br seriously if you havent seen it do its a fantastic story with lots of unexpected twists and turns and its extremely well directed and acted
