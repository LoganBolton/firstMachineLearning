not a box office success noone really knows why it may have failed simply because of its title it looks as though you need a twoword toughguy title to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiot crowd  die hard lethal weapon hard weapon die lethal etc  talking about the long kiss goodnight will get you nowhere but for once renny harlin has made a good action movie a large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character samantha earns our affection and interest early on as she becomes charly again were torn we certainly want charly to thwart the bad guys and all that but we dont want her to lose touch with samantha in order to do so  even though we like charly too geena davis bestows all of her considerable charm on both halves of the central character samuel l jackson plays second fiddle for a change it turns out hes good at it that was a complimentbr br intelligent far superior to anything in the die hard series  if i were more cynical id add its not surprising that it didnt do well but i dont really feel that way it is surprising that it didnt do well
