definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not overthink their movies br br lots of action lots of great dialogue eg fun to quote a little intrigue and stuff blowing up all over the place samuel l jackson and geena davis had great chemistry violent but not gory the fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turnaboutbr br have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every 3 or 4 months i initially rented the movie because samuel l jackson was in the film but was caught up in the events surrounding samanthas quest to regain her memory and have never looked backbr br all you cerebral folks out there  suspend disbelief for once take yourself a little less seriously  you might actually enjoy yourselves
