part of the bbc filming of all of shakespeares classic plays this version of hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of shakespeares most overrated plays and hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character i feel no sympathy for him and i didnt after watching thisbr br even when you have great actors like the great derek jacobi in the role of the dane and patrick stewart as claudius and jonathan hyde as rosencrantz it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline and when a good actor like jacobi injects passion into it he renders the entire role incomprehensible i just could not connect his physicalisation of the character to what he was saying and this killed it for me that said he does get the to be or not to be speech right as his actions with a dagger make clear the characters suicidal intentions at that point in the playbr br the supporting roles to me better written and consequently better played are enjoyable notably lalla wards loopy ophelia and stewarts welldetailed interpretation of claudiusbr br at four and a half hours it is very long and best watched in bitesized chunks check it out if youre interested but be prepared for a long watch
