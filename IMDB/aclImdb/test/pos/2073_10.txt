i was never in the past interested in this play although love shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off i never bothered to try to see hamlet until fairly recently deciding i should at least try to watch it and i borrowed the olivier version from the library well i struggled with it olivier seemed far too old not only in his looks but in his acting of the part the play had been enormously cut to fit a more conventional movie length and i think must have missed out too much as i found it difficult to concentrate on it soon became bored and annoyed by it i still think oliviers henry v is the best version ive seen of that rousing play  tho admit i havent rewatched the beeb version yet and cant recall how it was when first shownbr br i heard of the branagh full length version of hamlet although i enjoyed his much ado i think the beeb version is far better and i wasnt entirely impressed by his henry v but i was off branagh a bit after seeing his disappointing effort at a musical of loves labours lost which is a play i like and was so well made by the beeb br br finally acquiring the complete beeb shakespeare on dvd recently i soon rewatched one of my most favourite shakespeare plays richard ii and was simply enthralled by jacobi in the part so was immediately persuaded to watch his hamlet next what a revelation this play now is for me yes it is splendid but i feel it needs an actor you can emphathise with to play hamlet and this for me is jacobi amazing intriguing to note that although he is older than i understand the character hamlet was it doesnt show whilst in olivier it did now i note hes also in the branagh version and had much to do with training branagh so i shall have to watch that to see what jocobi does with claudius im interested to discover jacobi has trained branagh as yes you can certainly see the influencebr br and now im going to watch it all over again
