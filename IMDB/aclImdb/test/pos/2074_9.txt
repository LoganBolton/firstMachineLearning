lets face it there is no perfect production of hamlet its simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board especially what with the challenges of elizabethan english and shakespeares abstruse dialogue in any staging of it there are bound to be certain moments scenes or intonations that one disagrees with ive seen a lot of filmed hamlet productions olivier gibson branagh scott and now this bbc film with jacobi in terms of faithful fulllength productions this one ranks up there with the very bestbr br most hamlet productions are drastically cut because to perform the entire play takes a stagetime of four to five hours this production appears to be complete  that is all of the original shakespeare dialogue is intact  and so its essential for scholars and shakespearelovers and though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion for those less completely familiar with the text for the most part the script is wellacted wellspoken and wellperformed subtitles are available and very helpful although upon occasion they lag slightly behindbr br jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatres longest and most impossible role i actually cried when hamlet dies and i dont think ive done that before patrick stewart as claudius and claire bloom as gertrude are excellent as are lalla ward ophelia and david robb laertes and the rest of the very onpoint cast sets are minimal so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to nonessentialsbr br at 3 hours and 45 minutes this fulllength hamlet is a long haul to sit through but again if you want the real deal its 100 worth it even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself i highly recommend this production to all shakespeare lovers and scholars
