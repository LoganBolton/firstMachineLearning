ive seen various hamlets and ive taught the play as i watch jacobi im tempted to think that hes every bit as intelligent as hamlet himself so alive is he to every nuance of this characters wit he deepens rather than solves every puzzle regarding hamlets character he illuminates line after line word after word shining light into this sparkling mind at the same time however we cringe at the horror hamlet feels at his betrayalfar more than with any other actorbecause jacobi feels the pain more profoundly than anyone else and we shudder at hamlets own betrayals because jacobi is not afraid of the baseness to which hamlet can descend in short jacobi gives us hamlet in full and hamlet in full is the greatest character in literature thats why im satisfied that jacobis hamlet is the finest performance ive seen by an actor
