caught this film on tcm in the early am it was amazingbr br starting out slow but ominously scott is a shady character who preys on women in this case two women who happen to be due an inheritance in southern californiabr br the sets of the beach and neighborhoods of the 1940s are original and intriguing the title may have been more creative but the theme and nefarious shadows of human nature are intriguingly exposed almost in a hitchcockian versionbr br scott reminded me of the character uncle charley in shadow of a doubt one of hitchs reputed favorite films the audience learnswe truly do not know what lurks in the dark side of the human mindthis film is a displaced gem and wellworth purchasing 1010
