this is a great little movie full of interesting characters and situations while not in the same class as some of the betterknown movies of its time it is still extremely watchable and memorable the scene where zachary scott sitting on a bus casually steals the airman pin from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him is terrific it defines his character beautifully  a guy whos so low hell purloin something of inestimable value to a war veteran to use as a prop in his various charades he lies easily as the situation calls for and captivates the women in the fenchurch household with his irresistible charm and that killer smilebr br i couldnt help wondering if this movie was made to capitalize on the success of mildred pierce scott and bruce bennett were teamed again and faye emerson bears some resemblance to joan crawford with her facial bone structure and large eyes also the mona freeman character is not unlike the odious veda in mildred piercebr br i agree with a previous comment that the ending to the movie was too pat with the convenient tumble over a cliff for ronnie mason zachary scotts character also in one of the final scenes we see bratty mona freeman reunited with the boyfriend she had previously scorned in favor of the older smoother zachary scott i think the script shouldve called for her to be chastened for her behavior and for her cruelty toward her sister instead of treating it as just a typical adolescent episode but these are minor flaws in an otherwise enjoyable and wellmade movie
