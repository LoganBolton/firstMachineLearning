robert florey and james wong howe gave this a frightening expressionistic look scenes are shot at weird angles  especially scenes involving figurative and literal ladykiller zachary scott his sociopathic behavior presages another superb mediumbudget movie the stepfather by more than two decadesbr br the entire cast is excellent though though no fault of her own its hard to think of joyce compton as anyone but the singer in the awful truth scott bennett emerson decamp especially and though playing an older woman looking gorgeous  they couldnt have been toppedbr br setting a creepy lodgerinthehouseof women story against a background of psychiatrists is a risky trick that pays off beautifully nothing corny at allbeautifully nothing corny at allbr br the resolution is a little pat unfortunately not emersons getting together with bennett that makes sense but scott is dispatched too quickly i seem him more as a mr ripley character who could have escaped everything  the botulism the murder rap the jealous sisters  and disappeared into the great world beyond this story that would not have impeded the essentially happy ending of the secretary and her boss finally getting together
