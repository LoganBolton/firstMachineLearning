a great film every moment masterfully conducted by toyoda and his crew the actors give credible performances all aroundthe visuals are hauntingbeautiful and sometimes hauntingly beautiful shots of the japanese country and city landscapesthe soundscourtesy of japanese band dig are never overly edgy as one would expect from bandmade soundtracks its strangely atmospheric and well suited to the scenes theyre on br br all in all they worked everything out perfectlywell if they were to give any justice to the story perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted br br the real greatness of 9 souls is the compelling story the prison break movie maybe something of a lost genre these days and road trip movie losing its appeal due to the way the world is getting smaller but this story easily mixes something fresh to those two genresbr br 9 convicts are given freedom and possibly the opportunity to regain their places in society will society accept them will they be truly free of their dark pasts and can they stick together long enough to stay alive and find out br br each convict has an interesting history their crimes are as varied as their apparent fates a sense of brotherhood among them keeps the story high on drama and supplies it with hilariously comedic situations and due to the nature of their backgrounds violence is always something waiting to happenbr br after all that all i can say is go give it a watch
