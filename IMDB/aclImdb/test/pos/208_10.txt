if youre looking for a typical war movie this is not it so a note to all the testosteronepumped carnagecraving war buffs out there dont bother although the film is about russian characters in wwii dont expect to see any nazis cannons blood gore etc its not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war its a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with itbr br acting cinematography writing all perfect 10s here youll certainly appreciate it if youre russian like me but even if not youll probably love it if you speak no russian look for the ruscico russian cinema council dvd version its got subtitles in about 14 different languages but the english dubbing on this one id say is just as good its of course not as good as the original russian track some stuff is lost in translation but just as good as the english subtitles so go check it out especially if youre studying film in any aspect
