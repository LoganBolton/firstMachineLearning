what i got was something betterbr br just like many movies ive commented on as of recently id been looking forward to this one for a while especially after i saw one of toshiaki toyodas other films blue spring which is easily in my top 20 favorite films i loved the trailer for 9 souls and i thought it sounded very good i didnt hear anything bad about it now i know whybr br this movie starts up as sort of a comedy then during the last half of the film it quickly becomes something else it becomes more dramatic as each of the characters face their own tragedies each character gets just enough screen time and you care about what happens to each of them even though there are 9 characters we have to learn and care about within just two hours toshiaki toyoda pulls it off brilliantlybr br after i saw blue spring i was hoping the soundtrack would be at least a little bit as good as it was in that film i got my wish because the soundtrack to 9 souls was also incredible the music used in each scene more specifically the more dramatic ones is just simply wonderful i loved every second of itbr br i wasnt sure whether or not i wanted to see another toshiaki toyoda film pornostar but after i saw this im going to definitely also because i read the plot for it and i think it sounds really good im looking forward to it on the r1 dvd of 9 souls there are two interviews with toyoda he says hes completed another film and he wants to start writing the screenplay for his next i cant wait for bothbr br i highly recommend this film you must see it now
