like another poster mentioned ch 56 a local boston tv station showed this multiple times over the years on saturday afternoons they paired it with the first sequel return of the ginat majinbr br now i havent seen it since thenbut it never left me aside from the atrocious dubbing and faded color this was a pretty good fantasy technically it isnt horroruntil the statue comes to life at the end its just about a village ruled over by an evil man theres a giant stone statue there that the villagers keep praying to to help themto no avail but things go too far the statute comes to life and destroys the bad guysbut then it starts going after the good guys too welldone with some cool special effects at the end loved how he got rid of the main bad guy also there was an enchanted forest worked in which was kind of interesting toobr br no masterpiece but an unusual combo fantasyhorror film worth catchingbut not if its the dubbed print
