nice combination of the giant monster and samurai genres the giant monster majin god of the mountain is an aloof and forbidding figure that comes across very much like the oldtestament god raining destruction and punishment on those who desecrate his holy ground  but its interesting to note that what finally awakens him is not the suffering of the people but a pointed and personal insult its beautifully photographed with solid acting great miniatures and a wonderful score by the great akira ifukube majin is not a 400 foot monster like godzilla  hes 2 12 times normal size so the evil samurai he stomps into the ground get a good look into his contemptuous eyes as he bears down on their fortress and smashes it to smithereens not much in terms of extras but its nice to see this forgotten minor classic rescued and restored to the digital format
