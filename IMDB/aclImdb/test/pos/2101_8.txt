for those of you whove wondered what an arthouse monster movie might be like wonder no more the daimajin trilogy circa 1966 was just such a series more period samurai epics than anything else these three movies just also happen to feature one of the most literally monstrous deux et machinas ever theres not a single facet of these gems that is unpolished from the scenarios to the performances to the filmmakers craftsmanship even the special effects are handled with wellaboveaverage skill and are integrated in most instances almost seamlessly into the movies if youre a gojira fan or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who just likes a good movie regardless of genre i highly recommend the daimajin trilogy
