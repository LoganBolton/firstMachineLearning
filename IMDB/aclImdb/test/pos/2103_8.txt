with its rerelease by adv films ive had a chance to watch the giant majin for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late night horror chiller theaters guess what its a pretty damn good moviebr br the sets are authentic the acting in subdued and believable and the giant majin is stately powerful and unstopable i loved the subtle fantasy touches the enchanted wood luck charm etc and the potrayal of the god as a little less than goodbr br this movie is begging for a remake in the new century
