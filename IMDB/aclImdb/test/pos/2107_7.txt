alexander lou star of classics such as the super ninja and mafia vs ninja headlines here in this entertaining martial arts festbr br the plot involves the evil abbott white who boasts some humongous and frankly somewhat scary looking white eyebrows enlisting the aid of a ninja clan in order to overthrow the shaolin templebr br this goal he achieves and furthermore wipes out most of its members although needless to say one or two do manage to survive and rather predictably go on to exact eventual revenge upon the miscreant abbottbr br ok so the plot isnt exactly pushing the envelope in terms of creativity but does anyone watching a film with a title like wu tang vs ninja aka the ninja hunter really care much for such an inconsequential factor as a plot of course not  its the fights that matter in these films and by gum  you get your moneys worth here theres some superbly choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute seems to goes by without a fight breaking out for some reasonbr br if your at all into martial arts movies then this is a must see
