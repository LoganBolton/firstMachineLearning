ninja hunter aka wu tang vs ninja is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its outrageous characters nonsensical plot and lack of any pretensions whatsoever the makers of this film have given us a truly ott masterpiece which has to be seen to be believedbr br the plot centres around wu tang villain abbot white who wants to destroy the shaolin monks and become supreme martial artist in order to do so he teams up with a clan of ninjas led by three masters  gold lamé ninja white mustachioed ninja and black ninja  and succeeds in destroying the shaolin temple and most of its inhabitants however there are some survivors it is their job to pass on the knowledge of the shaolin finger jab to a new generation who must defeat the ninjas and abbott white if peace and order is to be restoredbr br unfortunately abbott white is a difficult foe to beat since he is able to make himself virtually indestructible by sucking the life force out of hot naked chicks an excuse for some welcome gratuitous nuditybr br other treats in store for viewers include loads of very impressive fighting despite some of it being speeded up some really amazing outfits the aforementioned gold lamé ninja abbott whites yin yang suits and even some assassins wearing swastika tunics a ninja turning into a flying carpet plus some cheesy gore for good measure and i nearly forgot to mention the really impressive eyebrows on display in this movie  surely a good reason not to pass up on this gem
