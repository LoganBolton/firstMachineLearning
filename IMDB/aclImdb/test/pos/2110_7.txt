first i am a teenager ok and i have to say this movie was pretty good i think any kid ten and under will like it but people my age an up might be a little um a well wed describe the movie as lame but i liked it it may be that i still act like a kid or i visit a cattle farm every weekend but this movie was cute i did like how the actors were like kids not little blonde cutesy pies wearing three layers of clothes a trendy hat and about a thousand assecories like most shows today to name a few drake  josh lizzie mc guire well any kid show and the setting was perfect but there was a flaw the family was in debt right why in the world did their internal house look like something out of a western versace store that was one flawbr br the cameos are great theres about five hundred of them and the only explainable one is julia roberts being the main little girls aunt how in the world did they get everyone else this movie seemed to be on a tight type budgetbr br i liked this movie it was a fun one to watch and i thought some parts were far fetched like a cow selling for 750000 ha my butt a cow sells for that much but otherwise it was good i liked it and i could watch it again but id never buy it theres not even special features on the dvd whats up with that but do rent it especially if you have little kids running around the house
