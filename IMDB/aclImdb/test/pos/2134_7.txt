this great film never showed up in my town so actually i didnt have any opportunity to watch it until the late 80es when i caught it on german television i was expecting something of a disaster and found instead a wellacted grand western with superb location work the tiny tube couldnt really damage it and theres almost not a dull moment in this 4hour film so i hope to see it once again on the big screen what a spectacle that would be dont miss it if you ever have the chance unfortunately the harsh treatment of heavens gate at its opening ruined michael ciminos career and he moved from the passable year of the dragon to the boringly ludicrous the sicilian and the screechingly dumb desperate hours
