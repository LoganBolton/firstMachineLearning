i watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen 219 minutes passed and yet it seemed like only an hour had gone by the characters were very believable and entertaining and the photography was excellent the story pulled me in and held my attention i will definitely watch this again and again this true story telling at its best not hollywoods usual cheap thrills and skin deep glitz ive seen a quite a lot of reviews on this movie most seem to pan the film or give it faint praise basically its a great film that received unfairly harsh reviews watch it for yourself with an open mind if you like westerns historic period pieces albeit historically inaccurate youll enjoy the movie superb 1010
