ive been a fan of heavens gate since its first release ive seen it at least halfadozen times and have long thought of it as a masterpiece so it was with excitement and a sense of anticipation that i took myself off to see the restored directors cutbr br to my surprise i was disappointed on seeing it again and have since revised my estimation of the film heavens gate touches upon greatness in parts but overall lacks the thematic and narrative consistency and the passionate urgency characteristic of a truly great filmbr br firstly two technical problems the sound quality is diffuse throughout the film verging on inaudibility at times some of this perhaps is intentional  a way to mimic the chaos and confusion of history as it is unfolding but at key points one is unable to register what it is the characters are sayingbr br the cinematography is similarly diffuse the images lack sharpness and particularity of detail the result is a certain graininess and lack of pictorial sharpness which succeeds in blurring foreground and backgroundbr br structurally the narrative is offkey throughout as if cimino cant quite make up his mind as to the effect he is after he wanted an epic for sure but a pastoral or dramatic epic the film sits uneasily and unconvincingly between styles and perhaps even genres at times it reminded me of terrence malicks days of heaven or even elvira madigan in its languid pace and elegant scene painting at other times it threatens to turn into a robust western more akin to the wild bunch in fact the latter film offers an instructive reference point for an assessment of heavens gate as it shares the same period concern and employs a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a darker yet more heroic america br br this structural and thematic uncertainty isnt helped by the poorquality script which often sounds forced and jarring to the ear the result is an inauthentic sense of period speech br br the neargreatness of heavens gate resides in its set pieces the roller skating sequence in particular is astoundingly beautiful one of the most evocative scenes ever put to filmbr br another set piece which works very well in terms of unifying theme mood and setting occurs when kristofferson and huppert go riding in the new rig to the lake and she washes herself while he naps in the shade the languid pacing evocative music and monumental scenery combine in this scene to convincingly portray the love story which might just lie at the heart of the film  and which could have been its saving grace if pursued more convincinglybr br some critics have complained about the length of the film this in itself doesnt bother me a good film cant be long enough the restored minutes are critical in restoring the motivation and characterization absent from the cut version and they are full of pictorial interestbr br perhaps the chief glory of heavens gate lies in the achingly evocative soundtrack the repeated waltz motif and its different scorings throughoutfull band guitar solo fiddle etclends a haunting quality to the foreground action and establishes a thematic consistency lacking in the narrative itselfbr br despite its obvious flaws most notably the absence of a compelling narrative there is a sense of grandeur about the film one leaves the cinema with a rueful sense of missed greatness and a wish that cimino could revisit the film with the wisdom of time and hindsight to put right what is so badly amiss
