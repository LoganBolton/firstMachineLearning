i first saw this film when released in 1980 from other sources ive learnt that the only release of the 219minute cut was in new york city after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes so i guess i saw the shorter version first which at the time i thought was a very interesting antiwestern if a trifle confusingbr br so it was with even more interest that i finally obtained a dvd of the fulllength version im glad i did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic and the critical vitriol poured on michael cimino was unwarranted to say the very leastbr br yes its a long movie but so have been many others for example once upon a time in america 1984 at 227 minutes cleopatra 1963 at 320 minutes the ten commandments 1956 at 220 minutes spartacus restored version 1960 at 198 minutes gone with the wind 1939 at 222 minutes and others so it cant be the fact of running time that made so many froth at the mouth way back when heavens gate came on the scenebr br but note this all of those above movies have everything to do with reinforcing myths about history and heroesbr br not so heavens gate in this narrative the american west is shown in all its grim and unrelenting harshness injustice and poverty and thats probably the first reason why so many disliked this film it laid out the circumstances of the johnson county war of 1892 in wyoming showing how the wyoming stock growers association hired 50 assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of european immigrants accused of cattle rustling and all with the assistance and conniving of authorities right up to the president of the united states for an essay on that war with the background and what happened there is a link at wikipedia under johnson county warbr br very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in their countrys history and which fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be had it been a documentary it would have been barely palatable for most as entertainment it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and infamousbr br leaving aside the sociopolitical diatribe for a moment that cimino launched herein what about the narrative  the story of the three main characters well it probably wasnt unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute just as its probably not unusual now its a fairly standard love triangle whereby ella must choose between the two men and ultimately decides upon the younger man nathan who although not above resorting to coldblooded murder when it suits him shows more spirit and commitment than the older james or jim as most people in the film say for some that part of the story threads too slowly perhaps in the context of the wider narrative about the war however it is i think entirely appropriatebr br and that war is depicted graphically viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are exquisitely staged and edited flawlessly  although in the final massacre between the association and the immigrants im certain that some scenes of wagons blowing apart are repeated a minor point and perhaps brought about when the 219minute cut was restored any way you look at it though it hits you in the face with the noise dust chaos and confusion of warbr br which brings me to another criticism by others the noise and dust is such that its often difficult to hear the dialog and even see clearly what is happening ill admit that i found that to be a trifle annoying at first even backtracking to replay parts to try to catch the image or the words  until i realized that really wasnt necessary if you accept the directors intent life is chaotic it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations and in war its the sine qua non of this miseenscene in short its as though you truly are present in and within the scenesbr br and what of the title from shakespeare it refers to a figurative nearness to god and so if you equate god with the natural world the stunning scenery that pervades the movie  and it is stunning hauntingly equal to that of david leans doctor zhivago 1965  is a useful metaphor i tend to think however that cimino had something more to say namely the idea that the brave immigrants  the godfearing salt of the earth  were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that espouses to be freedoms championbr br was that ciminos intent  to gut the myth of the american west to show how in america only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred one way or another throughout history is that anything new not really as we all know where it really hurt however is in showing how america was not and by implication is not the land of the free and the home of the brave instead after absorbing this narrative we are left with an impression that the underpinnings of america have more to do with a land of dispossessed slaves and a home for knaves
