until today i thought there only three people including me who considered heavens gate 1980to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western since the 1970 after little big man 1970 jeremiah johnson 1972 the outlaw josey wales 1976 and the long riders 1980br br  i was stunned and pleased to see that 225 of those voting at imdb rate this movie a 10 as do i a recent book the worst movies of all time includes heavens gate through its production and release it was vilified as no movie since cleopatra almost twenty years before at one time it was considered the most expensive overbudget movie of all time surpassing even cleopatra it was blamed for the downfall of its studio united artists until everyone finally saw all the studios were falling michael cimino fresh from his glory with the deer hunter was hated and despised for his success and movie making excess but clearly that was petty jealousy at its worstbr br  cimino ended up fashioning one of the great expositions of the american experience this film is not to be missed but any serious student of american filmmaking
