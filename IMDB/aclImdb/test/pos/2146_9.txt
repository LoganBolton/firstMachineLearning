heavens gate is not a masterpiece which apparently was what it needed to be upon first release to justify its great cost and more importantly the continued uneasy reliance of hollywood on the auteur model of filmmaking yet heavens gate seen today at last on dvd in a cut of 229 minutes is a superb film it is a touch lethargic in pace but at least it is paced quite apart from the incompetence of construction that marks many films today there have been many films which deliberate in form have been severely damaged by being hacked down with no care for rhythm so the films become shapeless and confusing beyond this the criticisms leveled at the film have become in retrospect quite lame if the good guys and bad guys are too obviously pronounced for a serious film and yes sam waterstons mustachioed furclad villain is comicopera and not in the multileveled manner of bill the butcher from gangs of new york and yes the townsfolk do seem a touch fiddler on the roof on occasions then a few dozen serious films made since then including titanic and the graceless cold mountain which bears certain similarities and is a notable failure in convincing qualities compared to this film can be castigated for exactly the same reason br br also despite accusations the film has a plot quite a wellessayed plot at that it simply does not bow to standardform epic quality by providing titan heroes rafts of subplots and confusion it experiments with telling in a manner more like much smaller modest films by carefullycaught moments of character interaction and welltextured pageantlike explosions of communal action as with the opening at harvard and most specially the wonderful scene where the johnson county folk following the lead of a brilliantly physical fiddler make celebration on rollerskatesbr br the deer hunter was a critical and commercial success but abandoned the first halfs inspired mosaiclike accumulation of detail and i think in a manner similar to criticism of robert penn warrens novel all the kings men and its dictionary of jacobean stunts if cimino had not had such a strong grasp of the conventions of hollywood epics he might have made a special rare work of art based in honest visualisation of people within their milieu in contrast heavens gate succeeds in screwing its narrative momentum and tension upwards in a slowly expanding arc until the finale explodes whilst not abandoning the mosaic approachbr br the central romantic triangle for instance resists standard inflections a decent intelligent but psychically defeated man james averill kris kristofferson competes with a hotshot but identitychallenged young gunman nate champion christopher walken for the hand of a young madame ella watson isabelle huppert there is no selfconscious bedhopping no slaps in the face recriminations or typical sadsack moments but more a sad and distanced decision by ella to choose the younger man whom she loves less because he is ready to make the commitment ella emerges as the films true hero hupperts performance though initially awkward is really quite excellent balancing a dewy emotionalism with a hardhammered spirit attempting first to rescue nate and then mustering the resistance party of immigrants into an enterprising defence subsequently averill is stung into action as friends die indeed in the process of overcoming so many traps of clich√© and style heavens gate successfully and willfully throws off the defeated outsiderheroes grace note of so many 70s westerns and portrays an eventual vigorous cheertheheroes rallying to a compromised but still relished victory br br the social conflict of so many 70s westerns at last hardens into a fullyfledged war where capital attempts a crushing final victory over the miscreants who stand in their way suddenly they find a massed and morepowerful peoples army led by the man who played the thoroughlydestroyed billy the kid a decade before this is what led the film to be described as the first marxist western but really it simply deflowers a theme of the genre extant well before the 60s such various and classic oldschool works as william wylers the westerner and even shane tell awfully similar stories it is simply here that the romantic myth of the gunslinger has been replaced by the romantic myth of the peoples revolt in a spectacular exiting but realistic and thus chaotic finale the marauding cattlemens encampment is attacked ringed by dust clouds punctuated by fallen horses writhing bodies and gunfire averill puts his classical education to work finally by stealing a roman trick and bringing the cattlemen to the brink of annihilation before they are rescued by the cavalry another distinctly seditious touch but surely not so offensive after little big mans unrelenting depiction of native american massacres really its hard to think of a more heroically american vision of grassroots resistance the films only real dead spot stands as an unnecessary coda indicating averills eventual relapse a rather potted piece of tragedy br br despite then certain failings and a slow midsection heavens gate is a supreme piece of work a genuine attempt to create a contemporary western and a new kind of epic if one has to still join the chorus that reckons cimino was absurd in his behaviour on set and expenditure it is regretfully when today flops like the adventures of pluto nash and k19  the widowmaker see nearly a hundred million dollars sink down the drain and yet a tag of infamy still hangs on this film one ponders what exactly its grim death signified the attempt at original style the bawdy sexuality the very hardwon sense of detail the breathtaking rigor of the filmmaking and what is being filmed all throw into contrast what is sorely lacking in so much contemporary hollywood product
