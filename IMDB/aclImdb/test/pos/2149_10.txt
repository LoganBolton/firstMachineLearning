i saw this movie in santa monica on aug 23 and it has stayed with me i want to thank the filmmakers for digging into the details of harrys enigmatic eccentric life and also for showing the flaws and failings of nilsson the man thanks for showing the good and bad the ups and downs and for uncovering that amazing bbc footage the film is also a great showcase of a vast amount of nilssons music really well placed throughout the film i recommend this movie to anyone who likes good documentaries especially if you are interested in harry nilsson or the music scene of the early 70s some reviewer at the aint it cool website wrote that this was the best movie movie they saw at the santa barbara film festival and i believe it the film is informative funny sad touching and full of awesome music it succeeds on all levels really really good
