i remember watching police squad when it first came on abc in 1982 and i thought it was a very funny show thanks to the many sight gags non sequitors and scripts filled with word play in one episode there was a line where a man named once was shot twice br br but unfortunately abc canceled the show after only six episodes i felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode one that i remember was in the opening where the episodes title was different from the one shown on the screen br br leslie nielsens portrayal of frank drebin was deadpan yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of jack webb of dragnet alan north did well and peter lupus in one of his few roles since mission impossible wasnt bad as norberg but the one character that stood out was johnny the shoeshine boy played by william duell after giving advice to drebin there were cameos from dick clark dr joyce brothers and then dodger manager tommy lasorda br br even though police squad had a short life on abc the zucker brothers didnt give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the naked gun movie franchise ill close with a regular closing gag freeze the ending right here
