this toughtosee little picture played at the mods  rockers 2007 festival it is a wonderful and loving look at harry nilsson using many famous faces who sit for interviews rarely seen tv performances and behindthescenes footage of nilsson at work theres even a few shots from son of dracula this movie is the final and fitting tribute to one of the finest voices the most clever songwriter and the funniest man in popular music its a crime that this mans name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote andor performed his friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented hulk with a subconscious wish for selfdestruction as a bonus you even get eric idle performing the song with wrote for nilssons final album during the closing credits its funny its sad its not in general release if this picture plays anywhere near where you live see it
