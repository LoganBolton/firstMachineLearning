i was lucky enough to have seen this film at its seattle film fest screening and was blown away by how great it was this is without a doubt one of the best music documentaries ive ever seen and ive seen a lot this is a loving look back at the life and times music and relationships of one of musics true legends harry nilsson deserves to be up there with the likes of gershwin cole porter and all the other great song writers of 20th century standards he was considered a peer by all four members of the beatles who all called him a 5th beatle and one the same wavelength as themselvesbr br harry refused to tour so many today dont remember him and those born after his heyday are unaware of who he was this is tragic everyone should have the opportunity to be exposed to this wonderful talent this film is a step in the right direction to finally give the man his due unfortunately the film has yet to have wide distribution or even a dvd so for the time being good luck in getting to see itbr br if you are someone with the power to put together a dvd distribution deal please contact the film makers this film needs to be available hey vh1 how about screening it on air then maybe putting it out on dvd harry nilsson deserves nothing less
