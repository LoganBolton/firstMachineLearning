biodoc on the enigmatic singersongwriter who according to friends accounts spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life seemingly on a mission of selfdestruction he died at 52 overweight and dissipated of heart disease after a protracted rampage of virtually nonstop overindulgence in alcohol cigarettes marijuana and cocaine raucous partying and flagrant misuse of his vocal instrument he confided to a friend that he shouted out his lyrics at one performance with such force that spattered blood was left on the microphonebr br all of this despite the fact that he was 1 widely considered to have perhaps the most gifted pop singing ability of his generation 2 successful after years of effort in terms of industry acclaim  a grammy an oscar a decent recording contract with a top label and at least two stellar albums  nilsson schmilsson originals and a little touch of schmilsson in the night standards and 3 very happily married for the third time with a lovely young family that he seemed to adorebr br the films strengths begin with the completeness of its account of nilssons life including fine use of archival film footage and many stills of nilsson the editors do an especially good job of bringing movement to the stills we learn of his close ties to john lennon and later ringo starr lennon often said that nilsson was his favorite american musicianbr br even more impressive are the talking heads often a documentarys weakest aspect here we get people like perry botkin jr ray cooper mickey dolenz terry gilliam mark hudson eric idle rick jarrard randy newman van dyke parks jimmy webb and robin williams all telling amazing stories about nilsson  many uproariously funny others deeply pathetic  and everyone conveying their deep affection for him equally informative and moving are interview segments with nilssons wives  annie and una his son zach and cousin doug hoefer best set of heads i can recall in a biodocbr br the most glaring deficiency of the film is that it crowds out nilssons music even the performance of his greatest hit without you is cut short after about 8 bars arrrrgh there is no excuse for this not given that the movie runs a full two hours as it is lose a few head shots and we could have heard at least that song through and perhaps one or two more like one or his oscar winning cover of everybodys talking the filmmakers are simply too intent on plumbing nilssons psychological mystique and not attentive enough to his music my grades 7510 low b seen at the nwfcs reel music series 010707
