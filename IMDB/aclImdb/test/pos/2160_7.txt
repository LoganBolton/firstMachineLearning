night hunter starts in 1968 as a young jack cutter chris aguilar is unexpectedly handed the family tradition of becoming a vampire hunter when a fellow vampire hunter sid omack sid haim betrays his family  hands them over to the vampires to aid jack on his quest he is given a book that contains the name of every vampire alive or dead whichever way you look at it jump to june 1995  los angeles where the now adult cutter don the dragon wilson also credited as coproducer has but four names left in the book including argento vince murdocco  carmella sophia crawford together they are the last of the american vampires as they all dine in a restaurant cutter crashes the party  kills them job done right wrong as king of the vampires bruno fischer nicholas guest calls in the last four remaining vampires from around the world the french tournier maria ford the asian hashimoto ron yuan ulmer david shark fralick  sangster vincent klyn to track cutter down  kill him meanwhile detectives hooper marcus aurelius  browning cash casey dont have a clue  a nosey reporter named raimy baker melanie smith becomes involved in the battle between cutter  the vampires on which the very fate of earth restsbr br directed by rick jacobson i thought night hunter was quite a fun way to pass 85 odd minutes the script by william c martell mixes martial arts  horror with a fair degree of success it moves along at a nice pace  is at least never boring  thankfully doesnt seem to take itself too seriously the character names that reference other horror film directorsactors are a little tacky though some may be surprised at how closely night hunter resembles blade 1998 yet was made a couple of years prior the lone moody long coat wearing vampire hunter who happens to be an expert in martial arts the scene set in a nightclub  the innocent woman drawn into the world of vampires night hunter doesnt really stick to traditional vampire film law for instance sunlight only irritates their eyes they can only breed on a solar eclipse why stakes through the heart  garlic is no good as the way to kill a vampire in night hunter is to break its neck i could have done with a bit more horror  a bit more blood as it leans more towards the martial arts side of things the dialogue is suitably cheesy  the characters are just about likable enough in a silly waybr br director jacobson does his best to ruin the film the actions scenes are ok but lack a certain something  for some bizarre reason whenever an action sequence takes place he shakes his camera constantly its like the camera is placed upon a washing machine full cycle hey rick mate its not clever or stylish its irritating  annoying the gore is disappointing with a few gory gunshot wounds  a few splashes of blood breaking vampires necks dont involve much blood unfortunatelybr br with a budget that probably didnt amount to much night hunter is competently made throughout the acting was bad most of the time  whats with the dragon thing in don the dragon wilsons name has he legally changed his name does he sign cheques don the dragon wilson does he get mail addressed to him in that name i think i might do something like this from now on i want to be known as paul the killer klown andrewsbr br night hunter is one of those crap films that transcends its limitations  awfulness to become pure golden entertainment if you like your films fun then night hunter might be for you if your looking for bigbudget thrills in a similar vein  vampires veins  blood get it then blade  its sequels would probably be a better choice what the hell i liked it so sue me
