check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense hasnt yet kicked in we get a pretty good look at supersecret los alamos just a few years after the big bomb test that helped end wwii except for the tight security it looks unthreatening enough note how its a tv repairman an obvious regular guy who takes us through security once through its like anytownusa nice homes quiet streets kids going to school and a family tv on the blink later on we see little tommy and little peggy frolicking along streets lined with impressive looking facilities separated by locked gates the movie appears to be saying okay were tough only because we have to be but basically were still just folksbr br now i expect that was a comforting message to cold war audiences still not used to governments doomsday research its a clear effort at popular reassurance the one darker note is when tommys mother clarke worries about her sons mental state he doesnt say when i grow up instead its if i grow up that note of doubt not only reflects a los alamos reality but also a national one that in 1952 had just seen footage of the apocalyptic hbomb note too how professionally fbi agents are portrayed a standard feature of mccarthy era fare when brute force is needed its not they but private citizen gene barry who thrashes out the informationÂ—an early version i suppose of modern era renditionbr br once the kidnapping occurs the suspense doesnt let up the intrigue is nicely handled with colorful la locations that keep us guessing the climactic scenes around the cliff dwellings may not be plausible as a hiding place but the view of northern new mexico is great then too the ancient stone apartments amount to one of the more exotic backdrops of the decade note also the extensive use of the police helicopter just coming into use as a law enforcement tool among an otherwise subdued cast nancy gates remains a sparkling presence as teacher ellen haskell never hollywood glamorous she was still a fine unsung actress and winning personality i also expect this was one of director hoppers more successful movie efforts and though people have since gotten used to the nuclear threat the movie remains a revealing and riveting document of its time
