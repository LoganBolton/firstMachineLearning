just watched this movie and its not bad there are a few tense moments and not a lot of long dialog strings comes off as fairly intelligent fastpaced almost like documentary style this movie will evoke some nostalgia and a bit of cold war paranoia with carsstreet scenesand life in the 50s the acting is fairly solid and at 85 minutes run time it goes by at a good pace an atomic era film buff shouldnt miss this one
