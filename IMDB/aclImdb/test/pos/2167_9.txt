im a sucker for a decent superhero movie im not counting super bug budget no storyline batmans eitherbr br a couple of my favorites are the phantom and a budget movie called the demolitionist the black scorpion can be added to that collectionbr br if youve seen the demolitionist then get this movie its basically a copy of that heroine it even stars the same guy in both moviesbr br if you havent then let me explaina cops father is murdered and she seeks vengeance she laces up the black outfit a sexy catwomanish skimpy outfit that looks absolutely great on joan severance and goes out to kick some bootybr br its a fun action packed movie mind you you may not wish the kids to see itwithout screening it first to see if you approve of the pretty graphic sex scene severance has in it which in my opinion was a bonus alright give it an extra star grin
