this movie will not be considered for an academy award but if you enjoy a movie that doesnt take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment youll enjoy a send up of darth vader for the villain the breather a female batman for the heroine but much cuter with much less costume and a running joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain thats very funny not by any means a great cinematic achievement but if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing god help me i liked it
