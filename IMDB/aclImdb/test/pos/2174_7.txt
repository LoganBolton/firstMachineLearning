first let me confess that i have not read this particular balzac novel so maybe i am directing my cavils unfairly at director and editor still my experience with balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist not an obscurantist this is most certainly a film worth ones while but one is left sorely puzzled at the end was the colonel a fraud used by the lawyer for his own ends or for whose beyond himself or was the colonel not a fraud but used as aforesaid by the lawyer or did the lawyer truly try to serve the honest colonel the director andor the editor appear to me to have deliberately obscured these questions which doesnt seem like balzac the realist at the same time the film does an excellent job of delineating the characters if not their motives and the cast and production is superb that opening battlefield scene is bound to haunt ones dreams still one wonders at the all too common penchant among contemporary film makers to favor ambiguity above all else werent the problems and motives of all these characters complicated enough for yves angelo
