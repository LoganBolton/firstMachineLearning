i recently read the story to see how these two match up and if you can believe it this film improves upon balzac the story is moved around i think to drive home the idea that colonel chabert is a man who has suffered much and yet he comes home not a hero but as an outcastbr br as someone mentioned i was initially confused if chabert was akin to the return of martin guerre no it is firmly established by balzac that chabert is the real deal whats interesting though is not is he isnt he but how his wife and society treats himbr br i think this is a timeless story of men who go off to fight for their country and when they come home time has left them behind chabert is a tragic figure made all the more poignant by the amazing gerard depardieu i dont care that hes been in 1 million films hes captivatingbr br fanny ardant has a horrible character to play once a prostitute rose has used her feminine wiles to climb the social ladder are her emotions true for compte ferraud i think they are and perhaps couple that with her social standing at the time and you start to feel some empathy for herbr br fabrice lucini is slowly worming his way into my heart hes exceptional here as dervillebr br i think if you can get your hands on this gem of a film you wont be sorry french cinema at its finest
