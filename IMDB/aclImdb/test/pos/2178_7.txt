this film certainly wasnt very sophisticated no the humor was in fact pretty dumb now that i think about it but also while i think of it i did laughproving decent comedy doesnt need to be very deepbr br fatty arbuckle is the definite star of this short despite buster keatons appearing in the film as well he is the butcher in an oldtime grocery store a lot of silly stuff occurred in the store and i think i laughed the most at the coffee grinder sequenceyoull just have to see it yourselfbr br anyway later fattys girlfriend is forced to go to a girls school and because he cant stand to part he dresses in drag and infiltrates the school arbuckle is one ugly woman so for silly and unsophisticated fun see this film it wont change your life and is a very slight picture but its also fun
