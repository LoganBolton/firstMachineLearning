when i was young i was a big fan of the naked gun movies but just recently i watched the show police sqaud and i think its great leslie nielsons awesome alan north is cool and who the heck is rex hamilton but anyways its one goofy showbr br one of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits i think my favorite one is when norberg not oj walks in during the scene and he tries to fit in with the freeze frame classicbr br the only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old when drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks cigarette and the person replies yes i know i think they used it too many times by whateverbr br good acting good gags great showbr br 710
