five star final was one of the best films of the early 1930s it starred edward g robinson and was a very gritty story about a sleazy newspaper and their willingness to do anythinganything to sell newspapers in particular an old story of an innocent woman is plastered across the pages and helps to destroy her now happy lifemany years after she was inadvertently involved in a scandal the reason i loved the film so much was that it was unflinching and pulled no punchesshowing just how low the publishers can be to sell papersbr br here in two against the world it is a remake of five star finalwith a few changes instead of robinson this film stars humphrey bogart and he is the head of programming at a radio station not a newspaper otherwise the story is essentially the sameexcept that its a bit less edgy and lacks some of the grit and sensationalism of the original this isnt to say the film is badit just doesnt pack quite as good a punch as the first film in other words if you must see one of these films see the firstthough this film is quite powerful and enjoyable as well as for me i loved the story so much i saw both films and enjoyed them bothbr br two against the world begins with the ubc radio owner complaining to his programming head bogart that all the high brow shows hes put on are getting low ratings the owner demands mucklots of muck in order to get more listeners one way they discuss is to do a multipart dramatization of a famous killing that occurred two decades agoeven though the killer was acquitted and she killed only in selfdefense however they decide to play up the story as if she was guilty and they even go so far as to both send a writer to the ladys home pretending to be a minister as well as broadcasting her current name and whereabouts needless to say this ruins the woman and leads to a horrible tragedy then and only then does bogart feel any real remorse for producing such garbageleading to a dandy finale about journalistic integrity and decencybr br wellacted a great story idea and a message that is just as important today as it was back in the 1930s this is one story you have to see in particular notice the wonderful and very emotional confrontation scene where the daughter attacks the owner and bogartit is one heck of a great example of acting and writing
