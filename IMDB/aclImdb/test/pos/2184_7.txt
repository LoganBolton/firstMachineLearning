this telecast of the classic musical sweeney todd does not do the production justice but is still quite enthrallingbr br firstly the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design from the wheeling multiset to the startling trapdoor then the staging is excellent right down to the slashingbr br the main failing here is in the performances people give oh theyre believable all right but it is quite frustrating when nobody seems to be hitting their cues on time in a song as fastpaced as say kiss me in fact the actress playing johanna is not only offtempo to a dismal degree but also slightly offkey and angela lansburys slightly overdone cockney accent is a bit irritating one more thing too what exactly is so bad about judge turpins performance of johanna that it is banned from the american theatre but not the cannibal anthem a little priestbr br otherwise this is an excellent production its a thrill to watch people do what they love and im not even peripherally talking about meat pies with a twist
