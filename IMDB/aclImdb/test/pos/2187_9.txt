stephen sondheims sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street opened on broadway on 1 march 1979 with len cariou and angela lansbury in the leading roles although it swept virtually every award imaginable the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended its run at 557 performances fortunately however the play then went on tourand along the way was captured on film the result is a remarkable capture of the play featuring george hern who replaced cariou and lansbury in a close approximation of the original broadway stagingbr br there is however a flaw simply stated stage plays do not film very well for a performance that works well on the stage must fill the theatre and is therefore very very largeand when placed on film such performances often seem slightly static oppressively aggressive or both sweeney todd is no exception seen on film it has a stand and sing quality and while both hern and lansbury seem to have modulated their performances for the sake of the camera such is not the case with betsy joslyn as joanna her largerthanlife performance reads on film as unpleasantly frantic and her extremely operatic voice feels out of place when contrasted with the voices of the overall castbr br taking this stageplayonfilm effect into consideration however this really is an exceptional performance of a unique and macabrely comic musical in the operetta style lansbury is astonishing a mixture of silliness stupidity and cunning malice while hern truly owns the role of the psychotic barber whose clients go to their graves impeccably shaved the overall cast is quite fine and although the film does not let us see quite enough of the set there is enough on display for it to be impressive and the music who can argue with what most consider sondheims finest work the story itself is extremely wellknown particularly in england in 1846 thomas peckett prest cobbled together several urban myths for a short story he titled a string of pearls within a year or so it was adapted to the stage as sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet streetand in an era that knew little of copyright law variations of the play were soon playing all over england each one however was more or less the same sweeney todd a barber kills the men who come to him for a shave mrs lovett his associate bakes them up into pies and feeds them to an unsuspecting public the sondheim version is specifically based on a 1973 version by christopher bondbr br the story is very grand guignol with a lot of blood bodies dropping down chutes and grotesque humor at the same time however the music lyrics and subplot of an innocent in the clutches of evil open out the subject to numerous lyric charms one would not expect sondheims lyrics are often ironic but never more so than here he intertwines a great deal of wicked satire re industry and capitalism along the way and certainly one cannot fault the strange yet victorianelegant of his complex musicbr br like the concert version starring hern and patti lupone this particular film also provides us with several selections that were cut from the 2007 tim burton film version most particularly the opening attend the tale of sweeney todd which runs like a thread throughout the play it is also in my opinion considerably more comic than the film which tends to underplay comedy in favor of a still greater show of blood whatever the case if you are a fan of the story this is the legendary broadway show on tour and it is a knockout recommendedbr br gft amazon reviewer
