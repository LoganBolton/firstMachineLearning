well im not the worlds biggest sondheim fan so although i have the cast album and ive listened to it a few times ive never actually seen this show performed and i havent seen the tim burton movie version either i felt like i wanted to see something more faithful before i see the burton one and give it a chance just as a movie this version isnt a movie at all its a filmed play with some of the original members of the cast including most importantly angela lansburys performance as nellie lovett this is one of those performances thats just like a conduit into the heart of the magic of broadway and theater itself she must have had so much fun with this role sweeney todd himself isnt played by len cariou who did it originally but by george hearn hearn does a fantastic job his voice isnt quite as good as carious but he seems to play it a bit broaderbr br the only problem i had really was with the johanna character as played by betsy joslyn and to some extent her lover anthony as played by cris groenendaal joslyns voice cant sustain high notes but i wasnt entirely sure if that was maybe supposed to be the point since im not hugely familiar with this play more importantly im not sure if the story of sweeney todd really holds up enough weight to sustain some of the music but thankfully the whole thing doesnt seem to have been taken too seriously by its creators as a lark and a bit of comedy in the vein of grand guignol its quite enjoyable i dont feel like its as significant a piece of work as company and into the woods or some of his other shows some of the music is quite spectacular but at other points it seems to exist in a world outside of the showbr br i wont say a whole lot about it here because this is a film website and this is really not a film but just a play that has been shot on film there were maybe 3 or 4 scenes where they moved the camera around but that was it people will want to see this because it preserves lansburys legendary performance which deserves its legendary status because its a hilarious and insightful performance george hearn can be proud of his version of sweeney as well this would be a good film to show children over the age of 5 or so to get them interested in musicals because the blood and cannibalism will really surprise them seeing a performance filmed so expertly and so faithfully makes me wish that more efforts like this had been made over the years with musical theater because i prefer shows from the 20s through the 50s to these later era affairs sweeney todd is an exceptional show from its era however miles and miles above the al webber madness
