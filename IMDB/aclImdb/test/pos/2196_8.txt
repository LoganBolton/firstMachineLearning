last year i fell in love with the tim burtons version of sweeney todd so i wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and i found this one at the library though i think burtons is best probably because i like film a lot better than theater this is still a great production of the story i havent seen any of the other versions but i am trying to get my hands on thembr br after seeing johnny depp as todd its hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role but george hearn does a fantastic job angela lansbury is great as always and all of the singing is fantastic i found myself singing along this is a play you wont want to miss but try and see it before you see the film version so you wont have a biased view like me
