the story of sweeney todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like charles dickens and more contemporary writers like edward gory as a musical it naturally becomes more like the musical les miserables both deal with the grim effects of poverty in the industrial revolution and the breakdown of organized society but this musical is different from les mis in one very important aspect stephen sondheim the songwriter who can adapt to any style to be sure hes had his successes and failures but one thing about his shows you can always count on they will be something unique who would have thought someone would write a musical about a barber who slits peoples throats and makes them into meat pies sondheim did and he did it marvelously the entire show is set in a factory to suggest the everpresent catastrophic effects of the misery of those at the bottom of society and this serves the needs of the show perfectly the catwalks and railings are moved throughout to suggest streets and walkways and bridges techniques are borrowed from kabuki and noh with the visual stagehands and set changes then to top it all off cast the great angela lansbury as the gruesomely practical and humorous mrs lovett and george hearn with his operatic baritone voice as the murderous todd and youve got yourself a stellar musical vehicle the rest of the cast moves smoothly through the clich√©s of the love story perfectly except for johanna and pirelli who sound a bit too forced if the johanna and pirelli from the broadway show could be here it would be perfect hearn acts while he sings more than len cariou on the obc album and the accents dont sound as forced here through it all sondheims score never fails to underline the dark seriousness of the story as i said he can adapt to any style in follies he imitates the 30s 40s style of showtunes in pacific overtures he captures the subtle art of asian music into the woods knocks off the 32 bar disney style songs and assassins covers a history of american music here however he does wonders in making his score distinctly english from parlour songs to operatic duets and soliloquies to society waltzes to gilbertsullivan style patter and yet still the show remains deadly serious even though it provokes more laughs than any musical comedy in it still is a grim warning on the evils of taking revenge here is where this movie makes a mistake in cutting the judges solo in which he flagellates himself out of guilt for his crimes without it the judge is just a conventional villain and this movies point is that there are no straight villains both todd and the judge learn too late the horrors of having to accept responsibility for their actions and todd loses everything in his obsession this is well brought out by the chilling reprise of the grim yet rollicking ballad of sweeney todd ending the show with todd and lovett rising from the grave to tell us that the end is the same in a world full of sweeneys vengeance begets only vengeance attend the tale of sweeney todd he served a dark and a vengeful god to seek revenge may lead to hell but everyone does it and seldom as well as sweeney as sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street
