the creative team of jim abrahams david zucker and jerry zucker had their roots in improvisational theatre in madison wisconsin i believe it was they had a group called kentucky fried theatreor something similar they put a bunch of their set pieces onto celluloid askentucky fried movie1977 which was long irreverent sophomoric and really funnybr br they followed up with the very popular airplane 1980 which really put them on the map in it they took some rather well known veteran actors in robert stack and especially leslie nielsen and putting them in prominent roles proceeded to parody every cliché of every aviation film since the days of john waynes batjacproduction of the high and the mighty 1954 pockets stuffed with cash and now having been noticed the trio worked out a deal with pramount television and the american broadcasting company tv network to do a half hour comedy spoof of the nearly countless police crime drama show that have come and gone on our television screens over the years remembering the fine job that mr leslie nielsen had turned in on airplane he was cast in the leadbr br as sgtltcaptain frank drebbin the rank designation switch being one of their comic bitshe presided over a great series of successive puns sight gags non sequitors and overblown policecrime clichésall of these strung together by someseemingly standard scripts added to this is overly dramatic opening narration voiced over information contradicting the visual printed info they always used this in giving the title of the episode titles where voice and printed titles never matchedbr br they had a great musical score which even though being somewhat exaggerated would have passed as theme and incidental music in a straight dramathe musical score the opening titles and format of having the episodes divided into act i act ii epilogue etc were all part of obvious but affectionate ribbing of qm quinn martin productions they even had the same announcer as did the real qmsbr br one thing that this all too short of a series did not have was a technically augmented audience laughter and boy they sure didnt need any phony tract the nature of the spoof was such that it demanded the viewers close almost undivided attention and that proved to be the ultimate reason behind police squads downfallbr br in regards to the series cancellationan abc executive explained that the episodes called for too much attention on the part of the viewer so isnt that what one would wantbr br so after only 6 wonderfully wacky hilarious episodesoff to the afterlife of series cancellation went police squad only to be reborn in the naked gun trilogy made for the big screen in movie houses once again they did quite well at the box office oh well tvs loss is cinemas gain thanks to you mr idiot tv execbr br  the high and mighty was produced by the dukes own batjac productions and released by warner brothers it was unavailable for quite a number of years and finally mr waynes family made arrangements to release it to television and to video
