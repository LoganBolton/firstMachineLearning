even if youre not a theatre person i highly recommend that you see this based off of a play of the same name by christopher bond which in turn had been based off of an old london legend sondheim did a wonderful job bringing it to the musical theatre stage the score is just amazing by far sondheims best and probably one of the best scores written for a musical ever the show was cast extremely well my only complaint being of betsy joscelyns portrayal of johanna its good mind you and shes a very versatile actress but she just doesnt sing greenfinch and linnet bird too well but other than that its all phenomenal angela lansbury made the role of mrs lovette and she just does it so well george hearn was a good replacement for len cariou in the title role and ken jennings gives a great performance as tobias the ending will give you chills top marks for a wonderful show
