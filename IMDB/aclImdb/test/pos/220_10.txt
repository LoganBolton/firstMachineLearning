after reading over all these reviews im very surprised to see that no one has even once noted that this show was based on the 1957 to 1960 nbc cop show m squad starring lee marvin i read reviews comparing it to dragnet and some of the quinn martin police shows but if you watch m squad youll see it was based on it in the late 1958 episodes of m squad onwards youll see lee marvin who plays lieutenant detective frank ballinger get out of his car and then hes shot atand he shoots back the beginning of police squad is basically the same  including the jazz music and then lee marvin narrates what goes on im lieutenant detective frank ballingerm squada special department of the chicago police and in police squad leslie neilsen does the same im detective lieutenant frank drebin police squad a special division of the police department and so on in one of the m squad episodes theres even the johnny the shoeshine guy character and in a m squad episode entitled  more deadly theres a police squad episode entitled a substantial gift the broken promise which is the same story
