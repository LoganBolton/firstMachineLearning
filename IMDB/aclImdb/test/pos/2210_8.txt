i was surprised to like this movie since im from the check your brain at the door and have fun school of film viewing however this film touched my heart i have friends like mentally retarded emily i have friends like unsocialized evie and ive been in evies shoes chasing away opportunity out of fear and out of devotion to othersbr br amy madigans disappointment in her daughters was almost palpable on screen and the awkward moments where she tried to bridge the gap with evie were raw and painful to watch and perhaps i am denser than most but i never saw the twist with evies father coming usually i cotton on to those things rather quicklybr br my reservations are similar to others posted here i thought christopher lloyds wonderful sympathetic character a very different role for him i thought was underused what happened to him once he realized what was going on with the poetry would he like james try again second the ending such as it was didnt seem to resolve or accomplish anything i didnt expect the pieces to be picked up and all the ends tied neatly but i felt that i was left at odds with the characters that there was no real healing taking place here or any real efforts at healing being madebr br otherwise exquisite and lyrical and disturbing and for some very very true
