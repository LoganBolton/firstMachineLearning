we have a character named evie evie just wants to be a good person shes nice friendly smiles often but is strangely brutally honest evie also has a secret her idiotsavant sister has been reciting original poetry which is getting the community excited about the sister writing unfortunately its evies poetry while their mother starts being happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in evie evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to dobr br what to keep in mind while watching this movie is who evie really is for such a brutally honest person who doesnt mind telling ivyleague types that she doesnt respect them it would seem odd that she would be able to pull off a lie for someone so happy and cheerful shes quite emotionless when it comes to certain issues those arent character flaws theyre plot development and they mean a lot more than they at first seembr br mostly this is something of a melodrama a character lies the other characters personalities propel them through drama as relationships are held at risk but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watchbr br the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good theyre acceptable and evies world is wreathed in color and light which makes for some very beautiful images but its not very consistent its not really so much of a flaw as a result of a low production value but within that same value is some genuine storytelling and a real care for the characters so while it isnt a perfect movie its certainly an enjoyable onebr br polarisdib
