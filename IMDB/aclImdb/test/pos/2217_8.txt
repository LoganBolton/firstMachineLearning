half empty is a hilarious musical about the eternal optimist in this case a selfhelp book writer who goes to germany mistakenly thinking hes popular there instead of an adoring audience he finds himself adrift in a world of jaded misanthropes including the woman who is supposed to be his publicist his attempts to make friendsin scenes that are largely improvisedlead to one great encounter after another when he is verbally abused by nihilistic musicians gruff gangsters etc in time he manages to win over his publicistboth her heart and her mindbut his own world view is shaken when his hero a much more popular selfhelp writer turns out to be not quite what he seems the action is punctuated by several musical numbersbr br we saw this at the deadcenter film festival in oklahoma city and were blown away this is a really funny inspired smallscale indie production you could quibble about a few technical things like the lighting which is a bit dark but the piece is funny and inspired enough that you cant care too much if voltaire were writing candide today the character would be a selfhelp writer
