had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called half empty i usually go out to the local cinema with my husband and feel as if we are held captive to the latest sequel or prequel that hollywood throws at us this was different and surprisingly  so much more entertaining than anything hollywood spends millions advertising when my husband and i go the movies we go to be entertained  and half empty did just that and the film did so in a smart manner that made me feel as if my trip to the movie theater was worth it it is a funny human and surprising sometimes musical story that cleverly entertains in its simplicity i especially enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom it is almost like an operetta that particular scene reminded me of a scene in phantom of the opera when 4 of the performers did not just ie they sang against one another in a friendly retort i am not a film maven but this film was more enjoyable than any other major studio film i have seen lately it is silly funny entertaining and amusing completely enjoyable  which is what i expect from movies but rarely do they deliver like half empty
