the funniest show ever on tv albeit the humor is not for everyone i realize it would have been hard to keep the show fresh if it had ran longer but its a shame only six episodes were filmed the gags fly rapidly from the opening credits until the very end when you would see drebin and his boss ed hocken pretending to be in freeze frame as the closing credits rolled during which the criminal still moving would see everyone else motionless and try to escape in another episode the building started collapsing around them as drebin and hocken remained in freeze modebr br leslie nielsen was comedic brilliance as frank drebin and the perfect fit for this show  how he managed to keep a straight face through some of this is beyond me because the jokes and sight gags came so often and quick you can watch the episodes a 2nd and 3rd time and catch things you missed the first time if youre like me you can watch them over and over and still find yourself laughing even the jokes that made no sense nor seemingly had any reason to them such as the rex hamilton as abraham lincoln tagline in the opening announcement somehow worked  perhaps they were thrown in there precisely for that reasonbr br cleverly spoofing the old quinn martin detectivecop shows of the 1970s police squad would return from commercial break with the words act two appearing on the screen which was immediately followed by yankees one or some other quip on the opening credits the episodes title would appear on the screen but the announcer would utter a completely different title my favorite jokes and lines from this series are way too numerous to list but one of my favorites is when drebin asks a downonhisluck boxer who has previously tanked fights do you think you can beat the champ the boxer responds i can take him blindfolded to which drebin responds back but what if hes not blindfolded a minute later in reference to the boxers small dingy apartment drebin tells him im going to help you get out of this sewer the next thing you see drebin is popping up through a manhole cover on the street in another episode drebin and hocken are questioning a bombing suspects flimsy alibi drebin not believing him says alright lets say you did go the movies after a slight pause drebin hocken and the suspect all look at the camera and in unison say you did go the movies a few moments later when drebin is forced to let the suspected bomber walk free due to lack of evidence he storms away and angrily yells tell that bomber to take off whats seen next is a cop giving the thumbsup signal to a wwiistyle plane on a runway right outside the building while there were many classic drebin quotes one particularly memorable one was sorry to bother you mrs twice we would have come earlier but your husband wasnt dead then another classic was im a locksmith  and im a locksmith when a visibly shaken kidnap victims father asks drebin what i do i do  drebin in classic deadpan fashion responds back well as i understand it youre in the textile business as i said the humor is not for everyone  many people simply will not get it during the shows brief run i remember the reaction being very mixed some people thought it was absolutely hysterical and one of the funniest things around while others thought it was the stupid and unfunny for me police squad even 20 years later is the funniest thing ive ever seen on tv for younger viewers who enjoy this type of humor but who have never seen police squad because they were too young when the series initially aired i highly recommend i found the six episodes to be even funnier than the subsequent naked gun movies
