i tivod this on turner classic just because it was precode and sounded interesting when i got around to watching i noticed that the critique gave it one and a half stars on a fourstar scale i started watching with trepidation  even old movies can be bad movies  but i quickly got engaged in the story and mary astors performance as the business brains behind a simple salesmans rise to success not a truly great movie  too predictable  but certainly better than advertised and i would have liked to have seen more of ricardo cortez as the man who appreciates mary but wont give up his wealthy wife id recommend giving it a look just to appreciate astor and what a long way weve come baby
