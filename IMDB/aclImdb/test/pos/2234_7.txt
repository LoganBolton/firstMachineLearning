this is a pretty clever wellacted version of the modern 30s womans fairytale romance in this case she helps the man she loves become head of the company while serving as his secretary and eventually wins his love from a scheming social butterfly interestingly her business sense is shown as subtly parallel to her homemaking prowess and the ladies of the office are depicted as the powers behind the throne lifted way above the average by mrs astors intelligent performance
