is this a good movie no certainly not but for jolie lovers its musthave her nonpolished acting and seminudity scene will please her fans for ages to come the current rating however 32 is too low the movie might lack a good storyline and isnt a great sfmovie altogether but the acting is good enough and like mentioned before jolies acting is nice and raw the movie is shot very direct with a lot of closeups the scenery is bizarre and last but not least leaving van damme out was a very good choice presumably non of the jolie lovers would like to see her having sex with him this movie has all the potential of becoming a cult movie
