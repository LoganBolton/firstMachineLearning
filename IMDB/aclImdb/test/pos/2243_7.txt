beginning where it left off doctor who rose her alternative dad mickey his alternative counterpart ricky and mickeys small gang of rebels find themselves at the mercy of this realities version of the cybermen this second part of the 2 episode cybermen arc feels more like a doctor who episode as opposed to the previous part which honestly felt like more of an episode of the defunct show sliders which granted was a great show in its own right the arc as a whole was enjoyable enough as im one to subscribe to the maxim that any who is good who but at the same time its inevitable that this will be compared to the dalek episode of the previous series and said comparisons would only make this seem like a lesser work as it is i just feel that this story couldve been done in one episode remember in the first part of the review i said that these type of stories dealing with alternative realities usually have no lasting repercussions well thats not the case here but what changes overall feels tagged on and not really in keeping with the characterbr br my grade c
