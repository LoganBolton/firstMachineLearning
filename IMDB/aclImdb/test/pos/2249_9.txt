being an israeli jew of naturally sarcastic nature as well as a lover of different and independent cinema it always gives me pleasure to see a film that takes a view on the holocaust thats sensitive and respectful while also being original and unusual while i havent read the book  or for that matter heard of its existence prior to watching the film  and therefore cannot like some other reviewers comment on how they stack up in comparison everything is illuminated gave me great pleasure and i can certainly comment on thatbr br to label everything is illuminated a holocaust film would be to do it great injustice even though it is undeniably about the holocaust so would labeling it as a comedy or a travel film although its about a journey and is as exceptionally funny as it is moving everything is illuminated is about jonathan safran foer  played to minimalist perfection by elijah wood in the most impressive dramatic performance ive seen him in yet with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals all  a young american jew and an obsessive collector of family heirlooms and historical artifacts who travels to the ukraine on a journey to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis its also about alex his tour guide through the ukraine and alexs grandfather whats fascinating about these characters is that in the beginning of the film they look like comic relief to balance out the melancholy nature of woods character but both alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the film and turn out to be at least as important as jonathan in fact boris leskins as the grumpy selfdeclared blind grandfather turns out to be the finest dramatic performance in the filmbr br aside from the surreal nature of the film and the characters the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and russian folk music the sensitive cinematography and the chilling contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history what made everything is illuminated a powerful and moving experience for me was the fact that from alex and his grandfather we get a very different and original viewpoint on this painful subject several excellent films such as the grey zone and downfall have already given us the point of view of the lowerrank nazis who are presented as human beings who arent necessarily fully aware of the moral implications of their actions but are caught up in the reality of the war everything is illuminated presents a point of view rarely treated before alexs point of view is that of a young man who was born many years after the war who sees it as hardly more than cold historical fact who finds himself having to face up to the horrors his own people  and maybe his own family as well  were capable of the change in alexs attitude  and his grandfathers  towards jonathan towards the holocaust and towards the jewish people in general makes the film a fascinating and original study in character developmentbr br everything is illuminated is a terrific directorial debut for actor liev schreiber and one of the most original and unique films of 2005 its a highly recommended viewing experience especially or anyone interested in the holocaust and world war ii
