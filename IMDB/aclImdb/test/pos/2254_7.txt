the movie everything is illuminated comes from firsttime writerdirector liev schreiber adapting jonathan safran foers first novel the book was ambitious and sprawling its magicalrealist elements and vivid use of language seemingly impossible to represent on screen the movie wisely attempts less while the end result is not as wildly original as the novel its still an accomplished movie about a strange eastern european road trip or as one of the characters would have it a very rigid searchbr br that character is alex eugene hutz a young ukrainian man who loves american pop culture but cant seem to get the english language straight nevertheless his grandfather russian actor boris leskin who runs a tour company catering to american jews convinces him to serve as a translator for jonathan elijah wood jonathan is investigating his family history and specifically trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis more than one family secret gets revealed during their questbr br the movies jonathan not to be confused with the author of the novel is a semi kleptomaniacal weirdo who steals his own grandmothers dentures to add to his collection of family things woods quiet wideeyed earnest manner works very well in this role hutz makes an impressive debut as the looselimbed easygoing alex his malapropisms are hilarious but he is also able to pull off the characters growing selfawareness the dog mikki is very funny as the demented sammy davis jr jr and one of the few movie dogs ive ever seen that isnt cloyingly cute and precociousbr br everything is illuminated eventually puts the holocaust on a human scale asking us to remember it not as a general event but as millions of specific small tragedies reminiscent of a european movie it also ponders the effect of past events on presentday young people like jonathan and alex with its original perspective strong performances and some very striking visuals everything is illuminated is great work for a firsttimer and hopefully schreiber will continue to direct movies
