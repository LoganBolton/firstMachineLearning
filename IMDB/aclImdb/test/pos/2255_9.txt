this movie reminds me of eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and garden state not because of content but because it is one of those movies that you dont hear about except through word of mouth or you read the back of the dvd at the video store and think why not needless to say i was pleasantly surprised like the aforementioned films at how good it was and how much i enjoyed itbr br best seen with little knowledge of the movie and with only intrigue guiding you to actually watch it also best seen with someone else or if you know someone else that has seen it  you will want to talk about it its a beautiful film that stays with you well after you watch it its also an intelligent watch that requires little effort into figuring out parts for yourselfbr br just enjoy
