this is a beautiful yet simple movie about one man driven to find an answer an answer he doesnt necessarily need but has structured his whole life around it is heartrending it is hilarious it is glorious it is tormenting it is delicate and dynamic i say its geniusbr br i have read jonathan safran foers book everything is illuminated mainly because i heard elijah wood was starring in the movie adaptation and i was just enraptured by the characters i laughed out loud more than once and every time someone talks about what its about i hear the same hackneyed response almost like its one big long word itsaboutaguylookingforthewomanwhosavedhisgrandpafromthenazis yet this story is so philosophical it goes deeper than that that conversation about the ring and in case it really gets one thinking suddenly this story merges from a simple quest to an inner metamorphosis and i find myself looking at things a bit differently nowbr br i recommend renting this before if ever reading it because the book had many obscene downright perverted stories that were not included in the movie mainly the history of jonathans family that was not necessary for the film br br a bit of trivia i heard is that woods current girlfriend has a cameo in this flick as the drummer in the band that alex arranges to perform as jonathan steps off the train into ukrainebr br you spend half of the movie trying to figure out what its about exactly and what jonathan is about because his character is so withdrawn like a turtle in a shellbr br it is magnificent and in my opinion one of elijah woods best movies
