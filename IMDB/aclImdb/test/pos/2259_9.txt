i saw this last night and voted it an 8 since then its grown on me and id give it a 9br br the film has at first a seemingly slightly disconnected facade between the first and second halves the first half is a comedy and theres little hint of the ragged truths of eras life wars religious intolerance that will become revealed in the second half while at first it may be a little disconcerting because its a slightly unfamiliar narrative sequence on reflection it worksbr br the acting was good hultz in the role of alex the interpreter was especially greatbr br ive scanned most other user comments and see that some whove read the book are pleased with the movie while there are a few who are not both feelings of course are validbr br for me a retired family therapist and oneworld believer the film was relevant on two different levelsbr br the first as history gave a powerful reminder of how commonly polarizations happen  with demonizing and trying to exterminate any of those with a smidge different moral value system than our own br br the second was that in demonstrating the first it also revealed something in common to each of us all our families  that each of us must go back to our roots to more fully understand ourselvesbr br ts eliot expressed this exquisitely in the 4th of his four quartets when he said  we shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time br br jonathan goes on a fulfilling journey that any of us would find fantastically illuminating  to explore and discover our roots what were those people going through then who were they  really  before when and during the early years before and after we were born etc br br so the film at first gives us the impression of a comedy then shifts to give us a lesson in history and human deficiencies but through all that it also gives us  subliminally  a message about each of ourselves all of us would be abundantly rewarded to go back and understand the place from which we first started
