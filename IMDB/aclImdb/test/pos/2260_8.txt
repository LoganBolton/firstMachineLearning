having not read the book i was more open to the fresh interpretation that each director gives to their medium which is film not to the letter reproductions of literatureon this particular film i was happy that the holocaust that occurred in russia and its neighboring countries finally received some attention the nazis were particularly cruel to russians and russian jews if you read the histories and see the monuments built in smolensk and nearby regions you will understand this movie and why many kept silent when they shouldve spoken upbr br it was certainly time for this to be chronicled and i hope that more stories will come out of this its high time
