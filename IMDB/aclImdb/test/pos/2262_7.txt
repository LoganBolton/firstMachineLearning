everything is illuminated a young jewish american searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape nazi persecution while embarking on a crosseuropean tour with some unlikely associatesbr br liev schreiber makes his directorial debut with a playful angst usually associated with his acting ethos when successful actors decide to sit in the directors chair we usually get a biographical glimpse at the souls beneath the acting mask check we usually get a mishmash of genres check but what we normally do not get is an insightful original film which is credible intelligent and movingbr br elijah wood plays jonathan an inquisitive young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes he is on a mission to find a woman in a photograph the sepia picture bears his grandfather an uncanny resemblance to him and the woman to aid his journey he enlists the help of travel guides that comprise of a hiphop loving breakdancer alex eugene hutz his apathetic and permavexed grandfather boris leskin and his dog sammy davis junior jr what ensues is essentially a comedy there is an unpatronisingly simple introduction with voiceovers alexs is especially funny as he educates his younger brother on the year 1969 proving how popular he is with the chicks and breakdancing thus setting him up as jonathans antithesisbr br schreiber begins to break down the characters as they progress and the comedy acts as an intentional veil to what is a story about three people linked to the holocaust who do not really know themselves all three hold the film with tenderness and authenticity something schreiber was unlikely to get wrong and as enchanting and fantastical as the film is the horrors that are allowed to crack through ie the past are presented in an almost palatable tone incidental music cinematography which make them all the more unsettlingbr br as the unlikely group finally find the town they seek they learn of the true atrocities that occurred and find out a lot about who they really arebr br elijah wood is as authentic as usual bringing his usual innocence and strength to the screen formally a resident good in lord of the rings and a resident evil in sin city he plays jonathan with aplomb as he is bombarded with culture shocks and a quest for truth boris leskin as the grandfather also delivers his angst and frustration at the youths with great humour and conviction as his own past is unravelled however it is eugene hutz as alex that makes the show the director using that old trade of translation misunderstandings to create and maintain a humour that is actually funny and not gimmickybr br schreiber has delivered an enchanting debut that has both heart and soul the continuous score and beautiful photography creates a fairy tale haze around a story about identity truth and family if there was a complaint it would be the speed at which the film changes direction though this could have been intentional it may not sit well with all nevertheless this is a sterling effort that delivers great comedy and bonding between an unlikely group while dissecting another aspect of the horrors of world war 2 in a completely fresh fashionbr br chiojo
