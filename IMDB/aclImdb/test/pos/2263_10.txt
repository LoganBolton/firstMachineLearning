i first saw this movie on an alaska airlines flight and have since seen it twice more it simply is  and is simply  one of the best films in years i found myself having enjoyed it after my first viewing but a little cloudy on what had happened after seeing it again a few weeks later things began to fall into place it wasnt confusing just deep in fact the depth of the movie may not be appreciated for a long time for example it occurred to me only after my third viewing that sammy davis jr jr grandfathers dog is more than just a pet  perhaps shes the standin for his dead wife witness how fiercely he protects her there is symbolism galore and none of it sappy or indulgent just real the adventure of their trip keeps the storyline in perpetual motion and even when they arrive youre not sure if it really was the destination as the movie continues so does the adventure and i got the sense the destination was merely a waypoint the soundtrack is fun the scenery compelling  and both decidedly easternblock i could go on and on about the deeper meanings within the film but im not entirely sure ive discovered all the nuances yet besides its more fun to tease these out yourself as much as any film can be everything is illuminated has proved to be like a fine wine that sweetens with time i highly recommend seeing it  twice
