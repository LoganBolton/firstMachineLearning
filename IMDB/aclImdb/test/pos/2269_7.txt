everything is illuminated is a simplified interpretation of something more than half of the jonathan safran foer novel this version is more about changes in eastern europe from world war ii through postcold war and how the younger generation relates to that history as a family memory br br debut directoradapter liev schreiber retains some of the humor and language clashes of the novel mostly through the marvelous eugene hutz as the usbeguiled ukrainian tour guide he is so eyecatching that the film becomes more his odyssey into his country and his family as he goes from his comfortable milieu in sophisticated odessa to the heart of a cynical isolated land that has been ravaged by conquerors through the communists and now capitalists with both jews and nonjews as detritus as funny as his opening scenes are when he establishes his cheeky bravura we later feel his fishoutofwaterness in his own country when he tries to ask directions of local yokels br br shreiber uses elijah wood as the american tourist as an up tight cog in a visual panoply as his character is less verbal than as one of the narrators in the book he and hutz play off each other well until the conclusion that becomes more sentimental in this streamlined plot once the grandfathers story takes over in the last quarter of the film marvelously and unpredictably enacted by boris leskin the younger generation does not seem to undergo any catharsis as they just tidy up the closurebr br schreiber does a wonderful job visualizing the human urge to document history one of his consultants in the credits is professor yaffa eliach and her style of remembering preholocaust shtetl life through artifacts clearly inspired the look and it is very powerful and effectivebr br the czech republic stands in for the ukraine and the production design staff were able to find memorable symbols of change in the cities towns and countryside as this is now primarily a road movie and the long driving scenes do drag a bit schreiber retains some of the symbolism from the book particularly of the moon and river but having cut out the portions of the book that explain those they just look pretty or ominous for atmosphere and no longer represent time and fate br br as wc fields would have predicted the dog steals most of his scenes for easy laughs in general schreiber does go for more poignancy than the book it is irresistibly touching especially for those who havent read the book but less morally and emotionally messybr br the film is enormously uplifted by its marvelous soundtrack which ranges from songs and instrumentals from hutzs gypsy band to traditional tunes to contemporary tracks to paul cantelons klezmer fusion score br br this is not a holocaust film per se being a kind of mirror image of the train of life train de vie as about memory of a time that is freighted with meaning now but will resonate more with those who have an emotional connection to that history
