i just saw everything is illuminated at the telluride film festival this is a truly remarkable film very emotional funny at times and heartwarming bring your handkerchiefs for those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to your eyes im reminded of the endings of babettes feast and the notebook the stories were completely different but had that same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes just as this film didbr br no spoilers here the summary is as imdb describes a young mans journey to the ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew upbr br the dialog is in english and ukrainian and russian too i believe this allows for some wonderfully linguisticallybased moments as one character interprets more or less faithfully for the english speaker in the group depending on the circumstancesbr br the scenery is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with wonderful eastern european influences be sure you stay through the credits for the final tunebr br this is lieve schreibers directorial debut and is well done i give this film a 9 one of the best films ive seen in a long time i recommend it highly
