not too many people seem to know about this movie which is too bad because i think its pretty good sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline but the presentation of the movie is pretty well done i think the casting is good with likeable actorscharacters tom selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player go figure not too much of a stretch i suppose and ken takakura from black rain plays the chief the coach of the japanese baseball team there isnt too much to complain about its just a light easygoing happy comedy and i recommend it
