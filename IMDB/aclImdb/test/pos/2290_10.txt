redo the oscars from 1992 and this film might get nominated or even win it was so good at capturing its era and dual cultures that it belongs in american and japanese time capsules if you wanted to know what living here or there was like back then this film will show you as an american youll feel like you tagged along for an extended japanese vacation and by the end of the film youll be a diehard dragons fan as you accept the injection of japanese tradition and culture into their baseball much as we have done with our culture in our own gamebr br jack elliot tom selleck is a slumping aging detroit tigers slugger who is traded to the dragons perennial runnersup to the dynastic yomuri giants japans answer to the yankees the giants are admired for their success yet that success also has everyone wanting to surpass them something which is rarely done the dragons manager recruits jack as the final piece of the pennantwinning puzzle and were left with what could have been gung ho on a baseball field but instead was much morebr br the casting was outstanding selleck proved that with a good script and a character that suits him he can carry a film as well as he did his television show and the japanese cast was equally good down to mr takagi from die hard back as the imageconscious owner the other actors including the one who plays the love interest also the managers daughter strong and independent yet simultaneously a believer in japanese traditions beyond what was forced on her she is a proper and supportive girlfriend for jack even her father never tells her not to see him almost sympathizing with jack for what he endures from her and a bit relieved he at least knows the man she has chosen to lovebr br the baseball scenes are great bolstered immensely by a prefame dennis haysbert as another american expatriate and jacks western mentor the usual fishoutofwater elements are there and you can almost feel yourself stumbling right along with jack to fit into a country that doesnt speak our language and doesnt practice our ways yet copies everything we do including our national pastime one of the funnier scenes occurs when jack clutching a magazine informs his manager that he has learned of the tradition in japan where you can get drunk and tell off your boss and it cant be used against you and exercises that right very humorously the plots and subplots are tied up neatly at the end but not too neatly and nothing concludes unrealisticallybr br to call this a comedy is misguided its a pure comedydrama or even a drama with good humor the plot is too deep to dismiss it the way it was by critics as an actor out of his league trying to carry a lightweight film the situations were amusing but in their place against a far more serious profound and precisely detailed backdrop that results in one of the best films ive ever seen the baseball cinematography rivals that of for love of the game for realismbr br some say the film is about baseball or about japan but more than anything it seems to be about the workplace and how people arrive at work from totally different origins with different agendas and somehow have to put their differences aside for the good of the company or the teambr br a truly great film that never should have had to apologize for itself the way it did when it was in theaters
