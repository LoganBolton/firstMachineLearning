i liked this movie not because tom selleck was in it but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semiover dramatized view of some of the issues that a baseball player coming to the end of their time in major league sports must face i also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in american and japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differentlybr br overall it is a good movie to watch on cable tv or rent on a cold winters night and watch about the dog days of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away a good movie for a baseball fan as well as a good date movie Â… trust me on that one wink
