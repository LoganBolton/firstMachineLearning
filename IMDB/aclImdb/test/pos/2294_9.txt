i agree with bigalc  this movie actually prepared me for a lot of the cultural differences and practices before i went to live in japan for a year in 1993 tom selleck does a fantastic job here as always and the movie is greatly humorous and educational im a big fan of tom sellecks and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part bringing the film to life in a way i cant imagine any other actor being able to pull off br br this film featured some firstrate japanese actors and it was highly entertaining to watch them as they interacted with selleck  i can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie  japans an awesome place to go whether you want to party sightsee or just try to take everything in
