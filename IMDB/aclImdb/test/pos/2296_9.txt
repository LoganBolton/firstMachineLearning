a lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie but i feel this is only secondary its really about living in japan and it really succeedsbr br i spent a few years living in japan and i suppose the reason that this movie didnt do too well is that you sort of have to have experienced japan to get it i was watching this with a welltravelled friend whos never been to japan and he noted that many of the events in the movie were so ludicrous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief my reply was that those events were the absolute unvarnished truth about life in japanbr br i think that this movie is definitely worth watching especially if youve lived in japan or are interested in it
