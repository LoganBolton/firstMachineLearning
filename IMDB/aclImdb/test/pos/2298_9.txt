after reading more than my fair share of reviews for a vast number of different movies i have noticed a certain trend people judge to harshly on what the expected to see i figure if you go into a movie openminded not expecting anything certain than you will have better feelings towards it then if you try and watch but have precreated standards you want it to reachbr br since i try not to be hypocritical i watched this movie with a very clean slate and openmind and was very much pleased since it is not a mainstream title or award winning for that matter i did not know quite what to expect but in all truth i enjoyed it a good deal more than ninja scroll lovely animation deep story and the always joyful ninja hacknslashing combined extremely well to one of my personal favorite animes ever madebr br i am not promising that you will enjoy it but just give it a chance and you may come out with a pleasant surprisebr br  before speaking be sure of what you will say will be more beautiful than the silence  chinese proverb
