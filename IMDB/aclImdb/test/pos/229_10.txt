one night i was listening to talk radio and they had leslie nielsen on the program he went on to explain why there were only 6 shows br br with tv shows like mash you could go to the fridge to get a beer and as long as you heard what was going on you didnt miss anything but with police squad you had to watch the show with the sight gags you missed a whole lot if you didnt see them who could forget  the part of town known as little italy with the coliseum in the backgroundbr br even the movies relied heavily on the sight gags but then again being in the theater you were a captive audiencebr br leslie also said the one reason the show movies and other movies like airplane were funny is because they didnt attempt to tell what was funny it was up to the viewer to get the jokesbr br well thats just my 2 cents
