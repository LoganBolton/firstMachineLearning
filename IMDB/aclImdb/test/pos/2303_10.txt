empire of passion starts out deceptively  that is if youre immediately expecting it to be a horror movie its like a riff on james m cains the postman always rings twice at first seki kazuko yoshiyuki is a mother of two and a dutiful hardworking wife to rickshaw driver gisaburo takahiro tamura but when hes not around and shes at home with the baby the feisty and aimless young man toyoji tatsuya fuji comes around to bring some goodies for seki and a little extra theyre soon sleeping together but after he does something to her lets just say a shave he knows that hell find out and immediately proposes that they kill gisaburo they drink him up strangle him and then toss him down a well naturally this will come back to haunt them  but that its literally at least to them at first superterrified seki and then only later on skeptical toyoji changes gears into the kaidan a japanese ghost storybr br this is a film where the horror comes not simply out of oh ghost ah but out of the total dread that builds for the characters in a way theres the mechanics of a filmnoir at work throughout if only loosely translated by way of a 19th century japanese village as opposed to an american city or small town ie the snooping cop the evidence found possibly by another word getting around suspicions aroused etc its compelling because seiko actually was against the plan from the start manipulated by the lustful but illprepared toyoji and her reactions to gisaburos reappearances are staggering to her take the one that comes closest to poetry gisaburos ghost paleblue face and mostly silent chilling stare motions for seiko to get on the rickshaw she does reluctantly and he pushes her around on a road she doesnt know in the wee hours before dawn surrounded by smoke most japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this harrowingly atmosphericbr br while it starts to veer into hysterics towards the end theres so much here that director oshima gets right in making this a distinctive work after hitting it huge in the international cinema world with in the realm of the senses which ironically got banned in his own country he made something that he claimed was even more daring that senses maybe he was right empire of passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor also starring tatsuya fuji a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range but its daring lies in crafting a world of dread you can believe in ghosts in this story but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hells these two wouldbe lovebirds will go the snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries the fate of their very souls is at stakebr br and oshima takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp sadly it wouldnt surprise me if an american remake was already in the works and crafts shot after gorgeous shot with repetition working its way into the misenscene ie the shots of seiko and toyoji walking on that road the camera at a dutch angle the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after i finish typing this ie toyoji throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion or how seikos nude body is revealed after she becomes blind its daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit not to be confused with the spiritual though there may be something with that as well about life and deaths connections to one another inextricably its a classic waiting to be discovered
