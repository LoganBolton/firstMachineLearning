this film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably the misfits pull together to successfully complete their missionbr br hilarity ensuesbr br like the police academy films the humor comes from the kooky characters on the boat i thought it was an engaging film and i will stop to watch it anytime it is on tv no it wont cause you to ponder your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of mankind but it is fun enough entertainment for 90someodd minutes plus lauren holly looks hot in a naval uniform
