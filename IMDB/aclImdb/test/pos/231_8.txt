the most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dances this typical risingstar musical has an overworked plot even for 1944 but because of the actors its still fun to watch hayworth isnt even that much of a dancer but she has a lot of inexperienced charm that fits her character kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role while silvers provides plenty of selfdeprecation and laughs the movie can also be very serious at times not a mustsee but recommended if you like the actors
