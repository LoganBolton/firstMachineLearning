surprisingly good and quickwitted adventure that features kelsey grammer supposedly in his first lead role in a feature as an unconventional navy sub commander who wants to run a nuclear sub of his own however he has earn it by competing against the us navy in a series of wargames with a crew of untested questionable and lovable men and a woman toobr br director david s ward major league and his writers have put together a hysterically clever and upbeat comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand which they do quite well second besides the grammer character most of the crew provide some or plenty of the movies humor which is treated like a doubleedged sword three members of the supporting cast  harland williams toby huss and rob schneider provide the funniest scenes which includes weird gestures impersonations and well their personalitiesbr br down periscope is more than a navy version of police academy or the dirty dozen what the film does is get the job done the right way and i liked it
