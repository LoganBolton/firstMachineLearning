im glad they finally released it on dvd i bought the video tape years ago and watch it at least once or twice a yearbr br grammer has a wry wit about him that really makes this movie a success its formula is certainly not original but its very funny nonetheless i am very surprised that it didnt receive higher in the ratingsbr br it ranks as one of my alltime favorite comedies its just a fun little flick that makes you feel good and sometimes thats all a movie is meant to be
