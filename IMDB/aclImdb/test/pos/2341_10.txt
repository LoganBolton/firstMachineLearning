a truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life it could be set in any town in the uk br br i live in a housing estate in glasgow and can relate to this film very wellbr br sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictablebr br the actors are scarily believable i felt as if i was spying on my neighbours it was an intimate dip into the lives of fragile and hopeless people i was very moved by a few scenesbr br i loved the way this film was shotbr br overall this film is a must see
