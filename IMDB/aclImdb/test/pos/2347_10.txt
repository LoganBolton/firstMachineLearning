im a big fan of naruto even though i havent watched every episode or read every mangabr br i really liked the first naruto movie and to tell you the truth i was a little nervous that this one wouldnt be as good or action packed as the first mainly because this one in australia only had a pg instead of an m which is a pg13 us or 12 uk but i was wrong thankfully the animation was more improved although some drawings of the characters at points looked rushed and was very good especially in the fight scenesbr br speaking of that lets talk about the fight scenes the animation and action in the fight scenes was spectacular and very entertaining i especially enjoyed the genjutsu battle with kankuro and the fight with gaara fighting the shape shifting female warriors all the characters you want are here naruto sakura gaara kankuro and shikamaru if only temari was in the movie shikamaru could save her from the female warriors in dramatic fashion and maybe they could have a passionate kiss in my summary at the top i say that this qualifys more as a piece of cinema than just an extended episode and it does the action is very cinematic and the animation quality looks very fancy especially during the fighting overall this is a excellent anime film that is a mustsee for any naruto fan 55 1010 5050 100100 alright ill stop
