naruto the anime tv series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies and a third one is coming our way this summerbr br the first one which was released in the summer 04 was a fun adventure featuring the main characters of naruto in an exciting adventure however one must be a blind deaf and one legged chicken to deny that films faults whilst the first was most definitely enjoyable there were a lot of things that could be improved on naruto movie 2 however takes all of these aspects and excels upon thembr br the action first of all was incredibly cinematic the lighting setting and style was three fold as effective as in the first movie in the first we were given basic action well animated and choreographed animation but nothing eye popping however this movies cinematography was exceptional the use of shadows and lighting combining together to make the action all that more intense was very effective and added to the force of the fightingbr br the animation was very good it rivalled disney however since this is a movie about tv characters there was nothing exceptionable about the character design or detail to the actual characters however the animation was incredibly fluid and realistic i think they even used twice the amount of cels for each second because there was absolutely nothing jittery about the animation at all it was incredibly fluidbr br the music i think thats where this movie fails the original composerconductor for the tv show was used for the film and i dont really feel that he did that good of a job the music mostly reminded me of a lot of pieces used in old snes games the composer is very good but the synthesisers used for the film couldnt convey the tune very well however they didnt fail the film at all adding as a good accompaniment to the action but except for a few violinstring pieces towards the end and some choral work the music didnt excel any boundaries or act as anything specialbr br the story was fun it was a reasonably typical storyline for naruto and was very similar to the first movies except again it took everything that had been wrong with the first films story and improved upon them the characters were a lot more interesting and the way the story progressed was what kept me watching throughout the entire film it kept making you think the film would be ending any second now but then it would move on but instead of feeling dragged out the action and characters made everything still feel fresh and excitingbr br overall this film is a goodun but however good it might be it is most definitely one for the fans i enjoyed the film but thats because im a fan but i can see just like with final fantasys advent children it doesnt excel as a movie but merely acts as a fantastic serve of fan service for a good hour and a half though i think this film does act as a good introduction to the series for current nonwatchers it wont give a full effect for anyone other than those glued to naruto screens however despite all this it was a fun movie to enjoy during this depressing period of upsetting fillers
