its 1913 a studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become hollywoods next great movie star and hes the director thats going to make it happen after inventing pie throwing and the keystone cops his dream comes true being completely absorbed in his filmmaking however he fails to notice that he is losing his leading lady to another man several overbudget flops later he is known as nothing more than the director who turned down rintintin fortunately for him the loyal and compassionate residents of hollywood are untainted by ambition and ego hell be okay as long as he still has his friendsbr br this movie starts out as a madcap comedy typical of the time period and in the opening scenes it holds its own with the best of them it has a playful lack of selfconsciousness which is sorely missing in most of todays comedies shortly into the film however it moves away from this mode of comedy and instead attempts to entertain us using the films within the film these are silent slapstick comedies well done but nothing out of the ordinary and they go on for much longer than is necessary for any audience which has seen the originals upon returning the film takes a dramatic turn its well written and the cast does an excellent job of making the transition but the movie really should have decided from the beginning what it was going to bebr br by the end of the film it has transformed once again  this time into a paean to the glitter of hollywood the small town of los angeles has grown up into the city which makes the movies that entertain the whole worldbr br in spite of its promising beginnings this film has not aged particularly well nevertheless it does have some strong scenes a certain nostalgic appeal and an entertaining subtext about the people who made it and the audiences it was made for
