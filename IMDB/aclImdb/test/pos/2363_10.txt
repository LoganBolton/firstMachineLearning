i just finished watching this last weekend and found it absolutely hillarious some of the scenes i just couldnt stop laughing at dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes and just says the stoopidest thingsbut at the same time hes just being cool to impress his girlfriend who gets arrested anyway the beach scenery is very tranquiluntil along comes robbie coltrane not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a saturday night when you havent got much else to do like i did you might need to hunt around for it though  i was lucky as my local video store stocks it
