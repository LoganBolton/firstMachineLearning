i taped this on sundance and had no idea that it was a miike film i thought it was just another kung fu moviebr br then i saw things like the dancing sax player br br who sounded like an oriental gato barbieri and i knew this had to be miikebr br i missed the beginning opening credits and had to wait till the very end of the closing credits to see miikes creditsbr br so far he hasnt disappointed me yet audition city of lost souls ichi the killer and the happiness of the katakuries were all good flicks and now ive found out that this was the third in a trilogybr br other than miike and todd solendz theres nobody making interesting films nowadays
