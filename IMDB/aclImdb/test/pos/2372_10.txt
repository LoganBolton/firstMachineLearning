dead or alive final the movie that supposedly brings together the three films in the very loose dead or alive trilogy and connected mostly by its stars riki takeiuchi and sho aikawa and that each film has its share of bizarroworld fixtures and neuroses and heaps of violence is admittedly the weakest of the lot that none of the three films ends up being a disappointment is less a testament to the creativity of the material but to the poundforpound guts that director takashi miike takes with the surroundings and the material here he presents an overtly dystopian future however lowkey where a homosexual mayordictator richard chen has the entire village drugged except for a group of rebels theres also replicants robots in this year of 2346 one of them is ryo aikawa a robot of complete lethal skill but also with the capacity to love and learn and so forth then a cop takeshi takeiuchi happens to be the mayors top guard but things start to unravel on both sides ryo teaming up with the rebels and takeshi with his employer though bloodsoaked mishaps like a hostage tradeoff gone bad and with takeshi finding out his wife and son are robots not done in an alien mood mind you just suddenly as if in a the power went out and that he himself is one as well and it all leads up to one last inexplicable showdown between the two menbr br strange that theres yet another film where miike has peaks and valleys here sometimes finding that middle ground of success where science fiction can have some meaning to it but there really isnt anything to take from this story except that the mayordictator is a dingbat with no backstory who gets his rocks off making sure his drug stops couples from getting pregnant and that everything remains under control he also has along with him his love slave id guess in the hilarious nonspeaking part of a saxophone player who also doubles sometimes as a human fixture when not plugging away the moody blues meanwhile we get the conventional sides to ryo and takeshis stories and theyre never uninteresting just not totally convincing enough to hold interest of course miike isnt above having some fun like when takeshi plops michelle maria chen in to the water to get her to swim after a nearassassination attempt on the mayor or in having the original rebel leader speaking english for no good reason at all theres even a playful homage to old scifi cartoons at the start of the film but theres nothing very compelling substancewise with the exception of takeshis minor turns at becoming good midway through the film helping one couple get by with clearance to have a kid and mostly miikes strengths this time are purely stylistically and in the choice of locations and setsbr br its like a grungy japanese alphaville where everything still has a contemporary feel through all of the special effects and i really liked the yellowgreen tint miike used through the movie as it impacted very well in outdoor scenes and added just enough grittiness in the indoor scenes but as for peaks and valleys one sees this ever more clearly and the scifi movie channel level of visual effects with maybe a few more dollars put into it during the climax this contains some of the funniest material in the most delirious freudian sensibility from the director even if it has to get started by unbearable contrivance the way that ryo and takeshi finally meet up is sort of random and just a means for the producers to try and cheaply tie together the past two films when it wasnt needed on the other hand in terms of the sheer guilty entertainment value of a flick like miikes where one sees something totally unexpected and very crudely sexual it ranks right up there with the best scenes in happiness of the katakuris and visitor q overall dead or alive final is a cheesy 90 minute effort that doesnt take itself too seriously and is better off all the more for its wicked contrivances militaristic decay and cultural hangups put on pulplevel display
