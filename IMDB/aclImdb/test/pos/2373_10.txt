i love those kind of movies blood revenge a lot of action very dark cheesy and more but this one doesnt deliver the genre that you might expect when i saw kite birds and ichi the killer before i had fun watching those but why this one not dead or alive final is a decent anime and its not hardcore and dont even expect nudity in this movieat least add some more action to entertain the audience even the drama wasnt that good well i dont want to spoil the movie nor the plotbut i felt that dead or alive final is a bit nerdy so without further to do i dont recommend this movie to everyone but i recommend for the people who love decent and well directed animebr br dr jacques coulardeau university of paris dauphine  university of paris 1 pantheon sorbonne
