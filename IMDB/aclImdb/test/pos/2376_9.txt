the third part of miikes dead or alive trilogy is as unrelated to the first two parts as they were to each other more or less show aikawa and riki takeuchi are back again for the lead roles but this time the movie thrusts us forward 300 years or so into the future post apocalypsebr br riki plays a tough cop an enforcer for the corrupt citys extreme police policies and show plays a drifter who hooks up with a bunch of the citys oppressed rebels the film must have been shot in hong kong as most of the rest of the cast are cantonese speakers with terence yin and josie ho being the most recognisable faces theres also a hk stunt crew on hand for the films action sequences which are very cool in a hkviamiike stylebr br this could be fodder for a dreadful low budget bmovie but in miikes hands it of course becomes something more interesting its quite a slow thoughtful film that meanders along and doesnt try to force anything down the viewers throat characters are rounded and interesting and the plot an interesting but fairly loose framework for the story to be hung onbr br all in all a fairly low key effort until the action scenes which show miikes increasing prowess at directing and choreographing very nice action watching the short making of with show  riki in wire rigs is really fun  you can tell they were having a great time br br the finale of the film tries to tie together the 3 dead or alive movies which is quite unnecessary because each one is really self contained miikes explanation of the connection is very funny though and caps the series off quite nicelybr br not as deep or well developed as doa2 not as outrageous and intense as doa1 still another good miike movie though
