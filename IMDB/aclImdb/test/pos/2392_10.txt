ive been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now when a writer develops a story he always has a characteractor in mind to bring the story to life last weekend i found a new one in paul vario playing uncle benny in eddie monroe this was a slick film highlighted by varios presence both on and off the screen as his voiceover narration is also heard i also especially liked the actress playing bennys niece and eddies exwife although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the doublecrossing that goes with it a nice job all around  and mr vario shined brightest hes gotta be my tony gangi someday
