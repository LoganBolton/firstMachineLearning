no doubt that the indie flick eddie monroe is one of the better independent films ive seen in a long time the highlight for me was the performance of paul vario i first saw paul or big paulie as he was called in danny provenzanos hit indie this thing of ours thankfully the eddie monroe filmmakers did the same and utilized pauls undeniable skills in a principle principal role out came a performance on camera and voiceover utilization as well that shows worthy of bigbudget studio roles in the very near future its refreshing to see a trained actor who is committed to the trade prove the same to the audience keep up the good work big paulie and well be seeing you in hollywood real soon not bad for a kid from canarsie huh
