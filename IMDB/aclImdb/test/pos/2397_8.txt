i was very impressed with what eddie monroe was able to accomplish in regards to its overall affect on me i say this because i know this independent film had a limited budgetresources but despite this it comes across as a convincing and well crafted piece of workbr br enjoyable from start to finish with several relatively unknown actors which i cant help but believe will make a big noise in the industry in years to come eddie monroe didnt fail to keep my interest engaged and my emotional meter dancing its a well scripted story with a startling ending despite my effort to not be taken off guardbr br many of the cast names listed for this film are names to look out for in the future someone told me that paul regina recently passed and if this is true its a real tragedy since his stoic performance in eddie monroe is remarkablebr br kudos to fred carpenter who has truly pulled out a winner with this one
