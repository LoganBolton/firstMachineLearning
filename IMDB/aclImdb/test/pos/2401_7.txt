i watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively anger surged in me to see the ruin of hanoi after the 12day bombard and by living in the country right now with my parents whos been living in saigon for 50 years i understand that were much better off now and would have been better if the american didnt bring war here watching the movie i learned more of the different kinds of wars that the america planned in vietnam and what disasters they causedbr br the series seems to do well with the interviews with the real people but i dont like it that some people only give generic opinions like the analyst near the end of the series i forgot his namebr br there should also be more documentary images like the life in the army camp of the south vietnam and those of the north if possible theres also a sudden change from the year of 1972 to 1975 im not sure if the inbetween was censored because i watched this series on tv
