ok so this is a complete rip off of the first karate kid however i think there can never be too many movies like the first karate kid theres something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me you get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself in this movie hillary swank is a particular gem as the next karate kid you can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of herbr br not to say this movie is not without its problems unlike the first one mr miyagi appears to be a little to eager to get julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting it almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie also one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks the movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of life and doesnt really explain why they do what they do in the plotline the villains are also a bit questionable even though truly hateable bad guys i also have a suspicion about martial arts movies that end on prom nightbr br so maybe this isnt a perfect movie so maybe this wouldnt be the greatest movie to rent on a friday night however in more ways than one its a guilty pleasure hillary swank is just so loveable and the story even though unoriginal works in a genre of movies that seems to be based around nothing other than action and violence this is a breath of fresh air unlike all those steven seagal and jean claude vandamme this is a movie about the spirit and the heart there are some people that need movies like this and well take whatever we can get my rating 810
