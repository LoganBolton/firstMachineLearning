this film was very different form the previous films and i had to wonder where is ralph macchio he could have been involved in the plot somewhere as myiagis old friend who teaches julie what he already knows then myiagi can come along and add some more macchio couldve been the love interest for julie in this film never mindbr br on a serious level i enjoyed this film because it involved teaching a teenage girl how to do karate and her feelings are very different to what daniels were julie is much more wild than daniel was and needs taming something which myiagi finds very challenging shes quite a troubled girl and a rude obnoxious bratbr br it was very satisfying to watch the transformation in julie as she warms to myiagi and gets to understand more about karate and her life in general we can all learn a thing or two from myiagis witticisms
