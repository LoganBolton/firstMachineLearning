hilary was great as julie and pat was once again magnificent as mr miyagi but there should have been more references towards the other three movies i mean come on first off wheres daniel miyagi makes a very brief mention of him and thats it daniel was his best friend and shouldve at least made an appearance in the movie he couldve helped miyagi train juliesan on the flip side the music stayed true to the movie though with a little more instrumentationfretless bassto accompany the wonderfully played panflute it doesnt feel like a karate kid movie unless you hear that panflute thank you zamfir overall a decent movie though we miss you noriyuki
