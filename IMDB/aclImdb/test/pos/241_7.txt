rita hayworth lights up the screen in this fun fancy and delightful musical starring gene kelly rita plays nightclub dancer rusty parker who has dreams to be a successful broadway star unfortunately her career is getting no where in danny mcguires night club when one of her fellow dancers says shes going to enter a cover girl contest she decides to follow her dreams and enters she reminds the publisher of her grandma who he was deeply in love with many years ago but when she finds this success her boyfriend is not happy about itbr br i had never seen rita before this and i am so glad i did she has such a scene presence and is a very good actress there are some good numbers in here not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to one thing i didnt like was gene kellys character he should have supported his girlfriend but anyway thats perhaps the only criticism i have about this movie cover girl is a glorious fluffy film  perfect escapism not everyones ideal movie but a wonderful movie nonetheless due to rita hayworths star power great movie truly impressed
