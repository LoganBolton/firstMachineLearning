this is another of robert altmans underrated filmslets be honest the only movie hes made that really didnt work was ready to wear and sandy dennis gives a spellbinding performance in itshe is far better here than she was in the out of towners the material i will admit is beneath the great director altman and the extraordinary actress dennis but that hardly matters anywayas long as there allowed to do their thing and do it well just about any story will do
