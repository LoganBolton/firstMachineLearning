this film requires a lot of patience because it focuses on mood and character development the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set  in frances austens the sandy dennis character apartment but the film builds to a disturbing climaxbr br the characters create an atmosphere rife with sexual tension and psychological trickery its very interesting that robert altman directed this considering the style and structure of his other films still the trademark altman audio style is evident here and there i think what really makes this film work is the brilliant performance by sandy dennis its definitely one of her darker characters but she plays it so perfectly and convincingly that its scary michael burns does a good job as the mute young man regular altman player michael murphy has a small part the solemn moody set fits the content of the story very well in short this movie is a powerful study of loneliness sexual repression and desperation be patient soak up the atmosphere and pay attention to the wonderfully written scriptbr br i praise robert altman this is one of his many films that deals with unconventional fascinating subject matter this film is disturbing but its sincere and its sure to elicit a strong emotional response from the viewer if you want to see an unusual film  some might even say bizarre  this is worth the timebr br unfortunately its very difficult to find in video stores you may have to buy it off the internet
