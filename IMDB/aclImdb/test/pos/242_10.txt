i really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it rita hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous although a musical i thought rita hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well as far as her dancing i think she was excellent even betty grable pretty much endorsed ritas dancing in this film as she commented that rita danced rings around her own dancing and lets face it betty grable was an excellent dancer the cinematography and vivid colors are also noted rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but shes also in love with her mentor played by gene kelly does she leave kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever youll have to watch the film to find out
