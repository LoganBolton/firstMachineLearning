its out of question that the real anna anderson was not princess anastasia apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearanceandersons eyes are perceivably larger lips thicker nose larger and turned up at the endetc andersons unable to speak russian was a ridiculous tellthats why i detest anna anderson and her confederates so much not a lot of swindlers have the audacity and endurance to scam for 60 years with such a blatantly untenable schemebr br yet to some extent i have sympathy for anna anderson life must have been hard for a young polish peasant worker in those days and to impersonate another woman for 60 years is an arduous task for anybodyshe had to hold back her fleshy lips all the time to mimic the thin lips of anastasias and had to occasionally go lunatic to make people believe all her chaotic memory was just a result of mental problembr br anna anderson was an awesome woman on a wrong track had she put her goodlooks learned elegance endurance acting skills into proper use she could of made a firstclass actressbr br on a side note some main characters of this twoparter seem to be loosely based on real figures prince erich could be a mixture of gleb botkinbelieved by many the most possible brain behind the whole scheme duke george and dmitri of leuchtenberg and several other figures and darya romanoff seem to be based on the gorgeous princess xenia georgievna romanova but unlike the real confederates prince erich was motiveless in this show and supported anna out of love for and sincere belief in her which is touchingbr br on the whole this is a great show fictionalised a bit but still remains faithful to the reality the power of amy irvings acting lies in that she successfully represented andersons selfassuredness the mixture of impersonating others and being herself is intriguing just as princess xenia said about andersonshe was herself at all times and never gave the slightest impression of acting a part highly recommended
