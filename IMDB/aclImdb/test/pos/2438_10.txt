well i dont know much about anything but i sure liked this film in short it was creative humorous simple and heartwarming in other words it was everything it set out to bebr br the story is set around a girls first love as the title suggests and i certainly should warn you expect nothing challenging or provocative in terms of the subject matter here i mean it is a childrens cartoon its really just a simple story but its told well and it holds your attention wellbr br in the end its short its funny its cute its simple its good
