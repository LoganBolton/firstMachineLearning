a fantastic musical starring gene kelly and rita hayworth he owns a nightclub where she dances shes no star yet but she gets a big break when shes chosen as a cover girl for vanity whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother when he sees the resemblance he picks her right away for a contest his maganzine is running hayworths newfound fame at first works wonders for kellys club but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter this isnt the most original of plots but the two leads really make it work it also helps that the screenplay is great kellys not yet at his peak especially his peak as an actor his dancing however wow hayworth is the star but kelly claims the films most memorable moment as he dances passionately with his own reflection its obviously a takeoff of fred astaires shadow dancing in swing time but i think kelly oneups it which is hardly believable in fact this has got to be the most amazing dance sequence in film history save perhaps the finale of an american in paris several years later the rest of the songs are also excellent and the musical numbers are even better too bad rita didnt sing her own songs well she may have a couple of them as her singing voice seemed to be different sometimes her dancing is wonderful as is the rest of her acting its hard not to love her in anything shes really one of the few truly beautiful women from the classic era not plastic like many of them no you can really see the warmth in that woman her smile is so disarming phil silvers has the role as kellys best friend and he is also very funny the trio of kellyhayworthsilvers is obviously the kernel which became the kellyreynoldsoconnor trio in singin in the rain eight years afterwards one of the biggest musical numbers in the film seems almost completely pilfered with the good morning number in singin i do think singin in the rain is the better film as cover girl is a little rough around the edges this roughness though just adds to the charm there are aspects of this film that beat singin in the rain and even an american in paris for instance the central relationship is more emotionally involving instead of the dominant older man chasing the little girl leslie caron and debbie reynolds were just teenagers after all we have a very nice relationship with two people who seem more like equals there is no chasing around  an aspect that does unfortunately turn a lot of the best musicals a little sour you have to admit kelly and hayworth are a couple from the start and when that begins to fray i really felt it 910
