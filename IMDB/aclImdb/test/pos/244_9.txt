this has got to be one of the better postastaire musicals made by columbia produced by arthur schwartz and directed by vet charles vidor this picture really put gene kelly on the map and cemented rita hayworths reputation as cinemas premier female dance partner she plays a bit of a dual role here since she performs contemporary 1940s numbers with gene and costar phil silvers but also puts her in the role of her grandmother a nightclub performer in the late 19th centrybr br the music should also be singled out because this was i believe the last project that the legendary jerome kern most famous today for old man river and smoke gets in your eyes worked on and his lyricist was the equally legendary ira gershwin they supplied a score that is full of charm and characterization the music for the historical sequences is especially noteworthy because its so perfectly styled in the early 20th century idiom that was kerns original period its a bit like picking up a record from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and hearing them do a song in the original style of that timebr br the story is pretty inconsequential which is fine with me because this film is as close an approximation as you will ever be likely to see of the 1930s40s golden age of broadway musical comedy style on film even the 1940s war propaganda aspects of the films music give it extra charm as the talented trio sing make way for tomorrow and even humorously poke fun at americas enemies and use period slang such as referring to gremlinsbr br probably the most memorable performance in the film is kellys dance to the alterego dance which found him arguing with and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of the conscience this prefigures much of his later work and also stands an effective and memorable scene in and of itselfbr br fans will want to seek this out for various reasons  kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see him outside of the confines of mgm with a different set of costars and music superior to his usual mgm material hayworth fans will want to see rita in glorious color at the peak of her fame and ability and fans of classic broadway musicals will definitely want to hear kerns final score and marvel at the quality of gershwins lyrics and the compatibility of their styles this is a definite gem in the crown of columbias musical program
