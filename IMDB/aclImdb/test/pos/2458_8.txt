an underappreciated unseen gem estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in poignant heartbreaking fashion the tension that arises between a son whos been to hell and back and his parents who cant begin to understand the emotional scarring left behind its not unlike born on the fourth of july in that it deals with a soldiers emotional and mental breakdown after serving in vietnam but while that one focused more on the politics of postvietnam antiwar speeches etc this one deals with a much more personal topic family one mans struggle to return to normalcy after a lifealtering experience and his parents failure to see the change that has occurredbr br estevez delivers a smoldering performance as jeremy collier you can sense the pain and frustration bubbling beneath surface there to match him inch for inch is his reallife father martin sheen its a trip watching these two act off of each other as you get the sense that theyre constantly trying to oneup one another its like the presence of each other inspired the pair to do their best and their performances triumph because of itbr br recommended to anyone who appreciates solid acting writing and directing and to any vietnam war buff br br  810
