this film easily rivals the emotional strength the dramatic impact and the topnotch performances of 12 angry men i rented it on a whim and was amazed that i had not heard of it beforebr br i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eyebr br the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord she is irritating and yet one can empathize with her at the same timebr br there are some moments where i feel the plot slows a touch and the moments between estevez and his exgirlfriend almost seem written for another film estevez comes off as another character all together but those are minor complaintsbr br this film must be based on a true story or must have been written by someone who lived these experiences i rate it 8 out of a difficult 10br br
