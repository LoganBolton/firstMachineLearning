emilio estevez actually directed a good moviewho woulda thought i sat through two previous films estevez directedwisdom with then girlfriend demi moore and men at work with brother charlie sheen they are lousy filmsbadly acted directed stupid and offensive estevez is a good actor but lousy as a director i turned this on in pure curiousityit has a great cast and i had nothing else to do damned if it didnt pull me inbr br it concerns estevez coming home from vietnam permanently scarred by what happened over there his parents kathy bates martin sheen and sister kimberly williams try to reach him but cant something in vietnam has affected him deeplyand hes about to explodebr br a bit overlong but still very good a lot of the material is familar but the cast is so good that they make it seem new estevez is good sheen is terrific and estevezs real life father williams is touching and bates is just extraordinarytrying to hold the family together it all leads up to a powerful ending which really surprised mebr br well worth catchingbr br
