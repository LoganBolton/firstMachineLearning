i caught this movie on tv yesterday i had a certain curiosity about it being that it was directed by emilio estevez and starring him and his reallife dad martin sheen i love to see a movie about a fatherson relationship that involves a reallife father and son naturally theres an instant chemistry between sheen and estevez and their scenes of conflict are even more intense knowing that theyre actually related of course it helps that the two of them are both terrific actors ive seen martin sheen in intense roles before but i think this is emilios most intense rolebeing that i mostly recall him from the mighty ducks seriesand i was very impressed talent really does run in that family and kathy bates steals the movie in an oscarworthy performance she tugged at my heartstrings with every word of dialogue kimberly williamsthe beautiful actress from the father of the bride moviesis also very good holding her own among a group of talented veteran actors br br the movie is a bit stagey with dialogue thats obviously geared for the stage but that didnt bother me this is not meant to be an action movie this is a character study and for a film thats based on a play it never gets too claustrophobic when emilios character jeremy reminisces to his days in vietnam we actually see his harrowing memories brought to life br br the film is extremely powerful and realistic without being sentimental at the end i expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family would become hunkydory but thats not how it turned out the ending made me cry without resorting to standard hollywood melodrama that proves reality is much more gripping than anything hollywood can conjure up br br if youre in the mood for a beautiful powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will knock your socks offplease check out this underrated gem hopefully one day martin and emilio will unite with charlie and they will all make a great film together br br my score 9 out of 10
