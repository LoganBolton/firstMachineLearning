this is a very enjoyable fluffy glamorous musical from the 40s cover girl made rita hayworth formerly the darkhaired latin senorita margarita cansino into a bonafide allamerican star it confirmed gene kellys amazing talent as a dancer singer actor and choreographer it epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genrebr br rita hayworth is great as rusty parker it is her picture and her presence is always at the forefront her singing is dubbed but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with kelly i think that rita was highly underrated as an actress she plays every scene superbly here gene choreographed the dance sequences he was basically given almost complete creative freedom here and his alter ego dance number is amazing such artistry the standout tunes are make way for tomorrow put me to the test and of course long ago and far away the plot is rather thin yet it does have a moral its about the perils of quick fame and fast money and how any happiness with only these factors will ultimately be doomed this will cheer you up lift you up to your feet and make you laughbr br that said cover girl is not the greatest musical ever produced it has a number of flaws that must be addressed one can say that a little bit of phil silvers goes a long way his character gets tedious rather quickly however i was impressed with his dancing ability and how he was able to keep up with gene and rita another major problem is that too many songs are just not that great the cover girl number looks fantastic but im not a fan of the lyrics or the singing poor tom is a huge downer i think its one of the worst numbers ive heard in a 40s50s musical yet it stinks the grandmother subplot borders on being ridiculous but thats only my opinion others may like these elementsbr br still apart from its faults its a very very good film much better than most of the product churned out today the dancing and singing is sublime the production values are excellent and its mood is infectiousbr br 810
