it kicks you in the stomach there are other films with more convincing characters a more realistic story and maybe even more depth concerning political invocations but then again most of these are not directed by peter watkins maybe the one true genius artist of british film to emerge out of the 1960s watkins has made quite a bunch of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the outeraesthetic world  the world of political ongoings social problems and governmental solutions thus his work is probably less filmic than say political which some may call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality then again why shouldnt art allow itself to become engaged watkins dares and succeeds you wont feel well with this one you wont feel happy actually you wont really like the film it is uncompromising honest direct unashamed a smash in your face in short you cant help getting angry you cant resist to let the things you see touch you that is what makes watkins films so rewarding
