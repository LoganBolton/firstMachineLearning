i saw peter watkins culloden and the war game a few months before this and was very impressed the technique is essentially the same or at least very similar in this film detailing on the one hand a trial of dissidents in california in the apparently near future and on the other the attempts of a group of convicted criminals to slog through 50 miles of desert to win their freedom in a governmentrun punishment park as an alternative to prison watkins films everything in a documentary style which causes for more than a little awkwardness or required strong suspension of disbelief how is it that the camera crew is with the group of starving and parched prisoners over 2 days without either offering help or sharing in their misery and thats merely the most obvious example but questionable storytelling aside this packs a punch no question you have to be interested in political filmmaking to really get involved but the film really isnt like anything else of its era it pulls no punches offers no simple solutions the leftist political figures are certainly painted broadly at times but they arent all alike the rightwing government functionaries seem a little more cartoonish but even they are allowed to show at least a little humanity overall the film gives much to think about and leaves an indelible taste810 dvd rental
