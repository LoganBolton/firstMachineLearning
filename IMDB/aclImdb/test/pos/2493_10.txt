you cant watch a film like peter watkins privilege a story of the exploitation of a pop music performer by big business the state and even organized religion without thinking of creatively degenerate commodities like michael jackson or britney spears who hawk corporate giants like pepsi or some other poison for money or any number of entertainers in music or movies who become tools of political parties or commercial religious interests like scientology and kabbalah a film like privilege must have seemed almost like science fiction when released in 1967 so fantastic was its premise today we tend to take celebrity endorsements for granted giving little thought to its more alarming implications watkins vision has not only become reality we tacitly accept this reality as normalbr br now consider punishment park as privilege challenges the viewer to examine what is being sold to us and why punishment park demands that we reckon with what is being taken from us and why br br heaven help america and for that matter the world if contemporary politicians get their hands on this film it is already so close to reality that in viewing it recently i experienced a genuine nauseating feeling of anxietybr br watkins again skillfully employs a documentarystyle narrative whereas in privilege some rough edges to this technique were apparent in punishment park it has been honed to sharp seamless perfection the sense of realism is enhanced by disarmingly unpretentious economical believable portrayals by the entire cast this is the kind of acting hollywood has completely turned its back on to its detriment in favor of cosmetically perfect image projections the cast has firstrate material to work with in watkins screenplay br br many cinematic visionaries have tried to shake the viewer out of their complacent false sense of security no one has ever achieved this result with such stark and chilling accuracy as peter watkins does herebr br what seems quite clear now is that instead of trying to bring the estranged and excluded americans such as these people back into the national community the administration has chosen to accept and exploit the present division within the country and to side with what it considers is the majority instead of the politics of reconciliation it has chosen the politics of polarizationbr br to paraphrase one of the characters we dont have to call them pigs because they know what they are better than we do
