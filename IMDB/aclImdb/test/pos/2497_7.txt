the love letter is a somewhat pleasant very very lowkey romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of a sleepy seaside towns inhabitantsbr br its not for all audiences the love letter i feel benefits from its simple and quiet tone never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies its quaint picturesque and comfy however for these exact same reasons many viewers will be bored and disinterestedbr br the cast is nice its great to see tom selleck again and is such an underplayed role and its hard to believe this is the same kate capshaw we met 15 years ago in indiana jones and the temple of doom shes quite naturally good here improving in every role ive seen her in since grating on indys nerves and is it possible capshaw is just getting lovelier and lovelier with age   what is it about that spielbergbr br it doesnt amount to much but after another noisy summer movie season ill probably look back with brief fondness for this lightasafeather romance
