the love letter is one of my alltime favorite books so naturally i was skeptical when i heard it was to become a movie but i liked it i found myself grinning through the entire movie i admit that it isnt a great movie but definitely a pleasant hour and a half i thought that capshaw and scott were perfect as helen and johnny just as i pictured them and the town and scenery were just right as well i recommend this film but dont expect too much just enjoy it
