so well done the photography sound music and the performances were the best its also an amusing story line that brings a smile to your face with each scenei loved it and im a 60 year old heterosexual guy each character seemed to fit their part to a tee its the best performance that ive seen from ms capshawshes been in more movies than i thought but this was a wonderful achievement i suppose its a plus to have spielberg money behind you allowing for a fat budget and all the best that money can buy technically two of the cast have successful tv shows of their own nowits easy to see why tom selleck does his usual good job
