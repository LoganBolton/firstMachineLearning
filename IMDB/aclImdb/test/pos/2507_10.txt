im a large scarred heterosexual male exbouncer exrugby player and exboxer and i love this moviebr br its no mystic river its a piece of fluff but there is room in life for fluff and when that fluff is engagingly shot wellacted by attractive likable people cleverly plotted and full of good dialogue theres even more room for itbr br im not the biggest tom selleck fan but hes good in this so are julianne nicholson love her bald head and freckles ellen degeneres kate capshaw and even tom everett scott that thing you dobr br the scenery is nice the mood is upbeat theres heartache and wistfulness and farce and even a little redemptionbr br any male reviewer who disses this movie is shall we say not perfectly confident in his masculinity in the meantime ill continue to catch bits and pieces of it without apology whenever it shows up on cable
