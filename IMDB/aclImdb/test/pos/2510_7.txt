although its definitely an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and its always worth a watch this film never quite meets the targets that it should for two reasons firstly after the first fortyfive minutes or so it focuses heavily on helen and johnny who are far less interesting characters than most of the others  janet jennifer george and miss scattergoods are all much more enticing although at first this works since in life we dont always know everything about everyone else and because the point is being made that perhaps helen is slightly selfinvolved it quickly wears thin and we want to see more of the other charactersbr br secondly the film seems to lose its way in terms of plot in the second half the letter itself holds far less significance than it does in the first half and again although this works well in some ways it seems odd to leave so much of the potential displayed in the first half behindbr br overall this film is sweet and goodnatured with some genuinely hilarious moments  for example janet explaining condiments to an avid audience the lazy but quietly desperate atmosphere that helen feels is heavy and the sense of living in a small seaside town is accurately portrayed but the film isnt quite as intelligent as its trying to be it just misses being both a light romantic comedy and being a clever portrait of life however its still good and if you get the chance its definitely worth seeing
