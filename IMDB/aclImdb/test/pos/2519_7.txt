as much as the beginning showed that were still going to get classic xfiles drive showed that the xfiles was going to explore new territory they start by giving us a unique teaser to drive with the news camera footage it was an interesting transition from the the tv to the real events i wouldve liked it even better if they had kept that news footage camera for the entire teaser and not cut to the inside of the car upon viewing this episode live back in 1998 i was thinking am i on the right channel that first autopsy by scully flooded me with big words that i dont understand i think she learned her lesson to always wear a mask before performing an autopsy silly scully what is the deal with the lighting in the autopsy lab its as dark as a tomb in there how are they supposed to see what theyre doing in there assistant director kersh gets his first lines in this episode i have no love lost for that man he is the third recurring character in a row that is introduced that you love to hate the first two being diana fowley and jeffrey spender i guess the producers felt that there was too much love going on for mulder scully and skinner so they needed to add some characters to give our favorite agents some grief and incite our ire as fans i love the quarantine suits worn by scully and her team with the cool helmet light bulbs boy its really smoky or foggy in dry northern nevada at night can we say the word effect drive is a cool episode but looking at route 36 on my us atlas theres no way mulder couldve maintained a speed of 70100 mph on that road if he had been on i80 the freeway maybe but no way on a state road with that many curves all of the filming inside the car looked very authentic excellent job by rob bowman it looks nothing like the old days of the obvious blue screen or clip of passing scenery outside a car window on a stage this was a fun episode but some of the inaccuracies keep it from being a great episode it keeps you on the edge of your seat so hold on for a fast ride
