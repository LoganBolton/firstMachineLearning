to speak relatively if one were only to see now hector babencos pixote 1981 brazilpronounced as pishot after having seen quite a number of films that deal with street children juvenile delinquents kids in trouble truffauts the 400 blows bunuels los olvidados de sicas shoeshine nairs salaam bombay bressons mouchette nugrohos leaf on a pillow etc one might be afraid that the plight of the kid portrayed in the film might not affect one anymore having been desynthesized already after going through the emotional rollercoaster ride put in motion by the previously quoted filmsbr br thankfully that wont be the case for babenco narrates his film in such a matteroffact manner artlessly as one film reviewer put it in a positive light and that his central child performer fernando ramos da silva 13 years old at that time and a street kid himself gives such a nofrills wounded performance raw in its simplicity that hardened face those lonely and longing eyes that one is hard put not to be pierced in any way such a feeling may achieve such a heightened realism when one learns that the child had only lived but a short life having been involved in street crimes after the film and subsequently murderedbr br in about first half of the film pixote and his fellow street kids and delinquents spend their time in a repressive staterun reformatory school where brutalization and humiliation rape and murder are the norm and culturewhere they are forced to confess to their crimes on the flimsy notion that under the brazilian law underage felons are not punishable for their offenses for these kids the dubious freedom offered by the streets is more preferable than the harsh rehabilitation provided by these supposed wellmeaning authorities within the walls of this supposed protective establishment these young souls are soon to discover that love and care from parental figures are likewise nowhere to be found if not to a degree worserbr br for pixote the only form of escape comes from puffing grass and sniffing glue secretly smuggled inside the reformatorybr br when the kids burst themselves into a smallscale revolt to finally express and then fulfill their collective desire to get back to the outside worldtheir homethe intensity and form are of such a kind that one cant avoid thinking of the schoolboys revolt in jean vigos influential zero for conduct its only that in pixote the uprising is made to appear on a gutter levelbr br once pixote and his small group are back on the streets the films second half they engage in robbery pimping and drugdealing to fend for themselves along which they get to meet sueli a battered but kindly prostitute sueli willingly accomodates the four lost souls in such a way that she allows her customers to be robbed by them and that she provides more than motherly care at least to one of the childrenbr br one would have thought that the street kids have at long last found the one person who can provide them the love and warmth that have been sorely lacking in their lives but as dubious as the freedom that these kids believe the streets are providing this newfound maternal figure cannot but stay forever br br jealousy squabbles differences and murder have only set the kids apartand for good and during that defining scene where pixote prompted by the circumstance gets to shoot not just suelis arrogant american customer but also his fellow street urchin ditto more than a son to sueli he thereafter literally goes back to infancy as he sucks from the right breast of the disoriented woman right there and then materializing his lingering desire for parental affection the image itself both sad and unsettlingbr br it is so that sueli in a probable coming back to her senses lamentably pushes back pixote from his nourishing position and rejects him for good thus in a quietly wrenching moment pixote with that youngold face and those sullen eyes not entirely dissimilar though in a different context to the young boys mien in elem klimovs harrowing come and see gets himself up puts on his coat and takes his gun yes a gun and sets off to nowhere walking along the train tracks and with the morning light just beginning to show up with that scene babenco may just be doing an homage amongst many other homages found in different films to the iconoclastic final scene in truffauts the 400 blowsbr br but whereas we got to know what has become of antoine doinel three years later in the short film antoine et colette as well as in three other feature films in the years thereafter we are left grappling in the dark as to what lies ahead for pixote after he finally disappears from the last frame that being the last time that well get to see this reallife street child notwithstanding the fate that eventually befell him in actualitybr br pixote may not be as nearly as whimsical as the 400 blows or as hallucinatory as los olvidados but it still stands out among films of similar theme and texture because of its simple raw power
