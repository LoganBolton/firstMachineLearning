pixote is directed with barely a shred of sentimentality and yet i more than imagine hector babenco owes some of his filmmaking chops with this film to vittorio de sicas neorealist style in particular shoeshine that film as with pixote takes place mostly inside a childrens prison and yet while i might still prefer de sicas film if it came down to deciding between the two its so close because it is no pun intended like choosing between two children theyre both marvelous works of raw drama and with pixote babenco has an extra edge and harrowing quality to deal with in that this isnt filmed in conditions brought on after a world war this is how it was in brazil one would see it with slightly more flair and awe in city of god perhaps in some of the same locations and these children were on the streets before and after the film was made some arent alive some 20 years later for all anyone knowsbr br the star preteen street kid fernando ramos da silva plays the title character a youth without a father or really any family who will look out for him and placed among dozens of other street kids and delinquents in a reformatory for boys the conditions couldnt be much worse and are made even more unbearable as two children are killed one after the other by some cause of the guard duty theres a riot and an escape and halfway through the film we find pixote with a few other youths including lilica a practical transvestite not even 18 and they become pickpockets drug dealers whatever to get by none of this i should repeat is shown with a kind of hamfisted earnestness certainly you would never in a million years see ron howard or paul haggis direct this kind of picture and yet theres an emotional honesty to everything exactly because nothing is trivializedbr br nearly every scene is significant to showing how fragile life is for pixote and how he could be killed or die some way at any turn and so without even reaching puberty yet he has to be on the level of those around him who are a little older though not by much at all and become things that will haunt this person forever despite babencos usage of a tender and mournful musical score and one or two scenes with people crying a lot nothing feels forced as with de sica maybe moreso given the consistent conditions of san paolo and rio street kids hes a natural director of children and coaxs out of ramos da silva and jorge juli√£o and others some really fine work that provides just the right touches of cinematic drama that is not so real that it becomes documentary which isnt a bad thing persay and even subtlety in some scenesbr br pixote may not be as well known as its later 21st century brazilian films that look back on the horrors of rio or even neorealist films but it should be anyone wanting to get a good hard glimpse at what it was like should seek it out at a library or other and soak in what is the best foreign film of 1981
