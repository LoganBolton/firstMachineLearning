this was really a nightmare of a film i saw it about nine years ago on cable tv and havent forgotten it since pixote is a 10year old boy who lives in the streets of sao paulo brazil and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends lilica dito and chico they steal pimp sell drugs and murder in order to survive each dayin the first half of the film pixote is caught by the police and sent to a sadistic foster home where he witnesses every kind of abuse from the older inmates and guards to the rest of the kids one night lilicas boyfriend is killed after a beating so pixote and his friends decide to escape during a riot the rest of the film shows pixotes descent into a criminal life he doesnt show any feelings or remorse after killing someone maybe because he knows that good feelings are of no use in the world in which he livesbut there is however a gentle scene in the middle of the film pixote and his friends are at the beach missing and wishing one of his friends from the reformatory was there i thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the middle of all these horrible eventsthe boys are obviously longing not only for their friend but for a better life director hector babencos pixote is a brave and depressing film that doesnt shy away from showing the harshest reality many people including myself tend to ignore or misunderstand this film will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person
