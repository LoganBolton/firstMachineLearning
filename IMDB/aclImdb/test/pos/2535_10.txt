the film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about brazilain street kids whose families live in poverty and must steal and kill to survive in fact the main character pixote was played by an actual street kid only 11 years old what follows was one of the most brutal depressing and horrifying film ive even seen i saw it about 17 years ago on a double bill with black orpheus and have never forgotten it i dont think i ever want to see it againit was just too much br br spoiler ahead the scene which will not leave me is when pixote meets a prostitute who has to abort her own fetus you dont see her do itbut you get a quick glance at what she got out its almost 20 years later and just recalling that scene upsets me spoiler endbr br the movie gets more brutal as it goes along and ends the only way it can whats all the more harrowing is stories like this really did happen in brazil in 1981and are still happening todaybr br a harrowing brutal filmbut it should be seen if you can handle it im surprised this got an r ratingive seen x rated film that are less graphic a 10
