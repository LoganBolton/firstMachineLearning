three of the things you can say about spalding gray are he certainly marched to the beat of his own drummer he was never at a loss for words and he obviously felt that those watching and listening to him would be interested in every aspect of his life experiences and thoughts  no matter how trivial at timesbr br most of us are not quite as far off the wall as he was most of us arent as interested in sharing the most minute parts of ourselves with others  even oneonone or in small groups let alone on stagebr br but that doesnt make it any lessinteresting to watch and listen to this erudite unusual man and after seeing one of his performances on reflection we can find many of his articulate musings were perhaps more relevant to our own lives and thoughts than we may have first thoughtbr br granted he was a new yorkavantgarde type of personality and undeniably a bit strange there are those who would maintain describing someone as new york and strange was being unnecessarily redundantbr br i give him a 10 for the talent he presents in this genre which is his specialty
