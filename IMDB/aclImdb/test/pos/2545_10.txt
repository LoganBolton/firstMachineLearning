the majesty of ramin bahranis second feature is that like the work of a poet he portrays the very soul of humanity and lets it flourish on the screen beyond the scope of most other indie films out there chop shop is wise exuding the very best of the great cinema of the ages we can look back at the works of bresson and pasolini and compare bahranis work to theirs and yet chop shop is fresh and urgent to modern society we can see the workings of a master here  a certain sense of beauty style and content all merge together in a film that reminds us what it means to be alive instead of focusing on the side of nyc we so often see we live and breathe with our young hero alejandro in the destitute willits point  a fascinating quasisubworld of our culture  and yet its a very very real place trying to stay afloat alejandro has to support himself and his older sister watch this film and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that bahrani leads us toward  all with profound and concise realism
