cant say this wasnt made well at a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes and there isnt the slightest indication he didnt get exactly what he wanted but this is an oddly nonhispanic film in the same way west side story was many years ago both the leads a brothersister team are excellent and memorable in their parts the setting a sort of underground car repair district in queens is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself but theres something unsatisfying about the key issue in the film namely what the sister feels she has to do to get by i can understand the brothers reaction but it just seems a little too easily come by to me the movie seems to suggest that people like these dont need our help that theyll find a way to survive without the usual support systems i wouldnt encourage anyone to believe that there would be far more resistance to the choices made here than depicted other than that as an entertainment it works well as an accurate depiction of a culture not so well i think
