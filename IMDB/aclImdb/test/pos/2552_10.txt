ramin bahrani sets up a scene early on in chop shop that immediately had me identifying with where the character of ale alejandro polanco and his friend were coming from the two of them get on a subway and as soon as the doors close they ask if they could have everyones attention for a moment and that they are selling candy bars or mms or something and then they proceed to sell some bars if you as i have ever been on a subway in new york city at any time this is the kind of situation that happens so often you almost dont notice it often the people on a subway will see kids like these or minorities selling something or announcing and talking about something on a subway and not pay them any mind bahranis focus isnt necessarily just on kids who hock things for sale on subway rides but on survival and the state of being one is in when in the lower class in america it is subsequently in his hands thoughtful and heartbreaking usually at oncebr br to compare it to pixote or the bicycle thief isnt too far of a leap actually in the latter at least the father and son have each other though bahrani is specific in his intentions in his documentary style we care about this character ali no older than eleven and working in a car shop cleaning some cars and helping take apart others and his sister who comes from out of town to stay with him but its not simply because were forcefed any clich√©s aside from you know a brother and sister moreso the brother trying to take care of one another bahrani makes the story accessible through the simple aspiration ali has the kind of goal that is possible attainable in his situation saving up enough to buy a used food truck that ali and isamar can operate themselvesbr br its all ali is working for but what bahrani shows us in brutal detail is this work what ali has to do to make it happen even if its distasteful things like ripping hubcaps off of tires from cars in shea stadium or at one point stealing a purse in a desperate moment this makes it all the more serious an issue when ale sees what his sister does for money on the side at night doing sexual favors for men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road he doesnt mention it and pushes it aside but its always something that adds to the tension something ale wants to protect his sister from it adds to the tragedy when ale finds out the real cost of what it will take to make the food truck into a profitmaker a cost that just further adds to the anguish that he just internalizesbr br one could look immediately at the fact that ale is an orphan in such a neighborhood as the one in the area of queens the film was shot in naturally as with a work of neoneo realism lets just call it realism featuring practically all nonprofessional actors in the parts of the mechanics and workers and people on the streets but bahrani is focused moreso on the here and the now and that is what makes chop shop so immediate and heartfelt not a trace of melodrama is in the film barely even music accompaniment aside from the live latino music coming from the cars and radios sometimes bahrani will focus on a very subtle moment that makes it pronounced in further scenes like the way ale is awake but acts like hes asleep the first night after he witnesses isamars latenight tryst and we see as she slinks into bed she probably knows hes awake but neither can say a word or in a lot of other scenes poetic touches that seem seamless like when the man shows ale how feeding the pigeons workbr br its rough and gritty as you can expect and it doesnt give much hope for its main characters despite the few moments of happiness sprinkled about its also a superbly shot handheld film where the technique as with a lot of movies made in its urbanset tone and approach informs and compliment the subjects on screen and what theyre doing but it also is never recklessly shot or too flashy the filmmaker has a superb reallife cast ale was plucked from a nyc public school without any experience and knows how to not waste a shot while at the same time achieve a brutal artistry with just showing what he shows its not city of god or pixote its its own little masterpiece on a character or characters we usually would just not give a second look to or a first one barely on our way in a city such as new york if youre not moved by ale and his daily struggles i dont know what to do for you
