my girlfriend as we walk in the cold london evening in leicester square after the movie says if they didnt speak english and they didnt show the stadium you could have thought this was the slums of a south american city or some other slum anywhere in the worldnot queens in nycbr br ramin bahrani is  right now my official hero because he seems to have devoted his work to show not the other face of american but the real face of americabr br ramin bahranis movies are like ladri di biciclette or germania anno zero or roma citta aperta chop shop is reality turned into a movie is more realistic than a documentary in fact i think ramin bahranis movies are more realistic than documentaries this is a great movies but dont expect any car chase or shooting this movie is about tragic lives on the margin of the wealthiest  richest country in the world
