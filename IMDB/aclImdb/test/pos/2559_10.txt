where do i begin let me say that  after having watched the entire film and the special features on the dvd  my wife and i watched the whole film again with the directors commentary running i cant remember having ever before endured more than 7 minutes of such commentary for a film its worth hearingbr br im not a southern boy but i spent some time around memphis a long time ago and have a feel for the area this film almost smells of the south its so real samuel jackson one of my alltime favorite actors is magnificent as the emotionally bent lazarus and christina ricci gives the performance of a lifetime as rae a woman whos been wounded severely during her brief life ive always liked ms riccis work but in this performance shes giving 137 of herself every second shes on the screen awards and little statues are not enough to reward her for what she lays before the audience in this film br br there are other places where you can read the essence of the story so im just commenting on the work id heard the name justin timberlake before seeing bsm but had no idea what he looked like or even why hes famous bumping my head on 60 years old im outside his target demographic to say the least after seeing this film i will recognize him he can act he gives a substantial believable performance as the loving soulmate of the county slut br br the director is from memphis and shows reverence for his home region he is also a fine story tellerbr br and i must mention the music i love blues and the soundtrack for black snake moan is a veritable feast for a blues fan br br im writing less coherently than usual because my enthusiasm for this movie is overcoming my sentence structure see this film and i mean now
