better than i expected from a film selling itself on the premise of nymphomania and interracial bondage the music is great and cinematography focuses greatly on turning ricci into a trailer trash betty paige and it works samuel l gets to shout a lot which hes good at as well as play lots of blues guitar which he looks cool doing even justin timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend i get the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s but instead managed to just barley carve out its own odd little transgressive pulp niche while still being an effective drama
