initially i was put off renting this movie due to the jacket art for the dvd in fact this held true with friends of mine who didnt rent it due to the art and the mental images it conjured of being a movie that held little or no interest to me or to my friends but i rented and watched it and was truly amazedbr br i agree with another users comments that this movie is not for everyone due to the blatant sexual inferences so it is definitely not something id want young children to watch and doubt seriously if they would understand it anywaybr br i enjoy movies like this whereby the characters personalities and who they are are genuinely defined in a nononsense direct way with no teasers to indicate they will turn out bad the acting done  was it acting ricci and jackson performed so well i was drawn into this movie not even realizing they were acting same thing with the story  may seem farfetched somewhat but it was done so very very well it reminded me of another movie with mel gibson tim where each character had limitations whether mental or circumstantial so were welldefinedbr br i found much depth in this movie with the characters involved so feel that everyone involved from the cameramen to the actors should be commended on a perfect fitresult after viewing this movie i had talked to a couple of friends who had a negative approach to watching it like i did so after hearing my comments they rented and watched it they too were quite surprised at how good it was it is too bad that the art on the jacket was done the way it was since it is a turn off i can see now how the art applies but id not heard of this movie before and the art was my first impression  art sells or destroys dvd salesrentalsbr br these characters had more depth to them and good timing was allotted to give an audience like me time to absorb the feel for each i felt i could trust the movie to flow well and it did so with the jacket art aside i would recommend watching this movie
