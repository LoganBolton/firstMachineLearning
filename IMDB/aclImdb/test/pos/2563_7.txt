the trailer to this film focused so much on the chain of course because its so sensational that it missed most of the movie which is about a developing although rather simply drawn relationship between lazarus and rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each otherbr br of course with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains its no surprise that theres plenty of implied sex involved however at its core black snake moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along maybe its just me though but i think poor lazarus shouldve had his story focused on more hes a hurting man after his wife leaves him but we never fully see how helping rae resolve her past pains heals him too its just implied that it doesin essence he plays the wizard that helps the young rae overcome her curse through a big ol chain and some bluesbr br i like the story but i wish it were a bit more even and didnt have to rely on the sensational the side characters were fairly decent if simple and i liked the music the acting was good enough although i cant be certain if the rae character is fully believable but that might just be my naivetybr br all in all i liked the film but i wasnt compelled by it maybe its that im too critical but the story seems a little too convenient to be fully believable and so while it all seemed very cool i could never truly buy it the chain thing was a little too farfetched for me still this can provide some entertainment for those looking for dramatic redemption stories with a shot of the blues 710
