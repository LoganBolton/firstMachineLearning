black snake moan is uproarious it is overflowingly rich fantastically orchestrated strange and cumbersome unique and visionary in continuation of hustle  flow brewer paints his portrait of the american south almost as a mythological land one would expect to see in a fantasy or ancient greece epic and yet as far high above us his movies hover they are still rooted rooted in the deepest darkest soil there isbr br as in traditional fairytales brewer paints his portrait in black snake moan using extremes and exaggerations sharp and stark character traits when coupled with such extreme acts as chaining a halfnaked white girl to a radiator in an attempt to redeem her of her sins exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor the same way such extreme visual techniques such as some characters having colour in pleasantville strengthened the metaphor in that fairy tale film but brewer doesnt begin his film with once upon a time in this film and also in hustle  flow brewer presents us with a different fairy tale a dark gothic fable of sex prostitution and ultimately redemption these themes run through the films veins like blood and resonate and bloom in its dark brooding settingbr br but despite these harsh extremes brewer treats his characters like humans and creates extremely wellexecuted threedimensional characterizations in lazarus and rae particularly emphasized with their relationships with lazerus friend at the pharmacy angela and raes motherbr br the acting is allaround quite perfect one gets the feeling that both christina ricci and samuel l jackson were born to play these roles their characterizations are so intense and so severe its even more of a challenge for the actors to keep their heads on and craft realistic characters and they succeed admirably samuel l jackson in particular utterly disappears into his character which serves as a polar opposite to most of the characters hes played before with films like pulp fiction jackie brown shaft and others he has crafted for himself a typecast of the ultimate badass in black snake moan jackson plays an old broken defeated and earthy character quite unlike anything hes done before and frankly its just fantastic what comes as quite a surprise though is the casting of justin timberlake and more specifically the fact that he comes across as quite tolerable sure he doesnt have much screen time but like what brewer did with ludicrous in hustle  flow he actually gets timberlake to act and do what he is meant to do and not come across as totally unconvincing and irritatingbr br but what is really so incredibly great about the movie is the atmosphere brewer creates the rural southern locations work to his advantage in creating a dark dirty grimy crusty rugged kind of texture to the entire film which more than fits in with the films thematic and metaphorical aspects and by utilizing all sorts of elements such as the rising sound of cicadas when rae gets her itch or a raging thunderstorm that increases and intensifies as lazarus plays his black snake moan blues number for rae brewer truly manages to create almost a fantasy world an undermined mythology to the rural southern setting and it works so utterly fantastically to craft brewers unique visionbr br and one cant talk about a craig brewer film without mentioning the music in hustle  flow he utilized a soundtrack of downanddirty streetwise hiphop music to emphasize the atmosphere and the vision in this film the music works even better at polishing off and fully representing the unique atmosphere it is a rural blues soundtrack but its the dirtiest rawest grittiest blues youve ever heard and it sounds just absolutely fantasticbr br in all it can be said that had this movie been a simple tale of an old broken lonely godfearing black blues singer redeeming a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from nymphomania there may have not been very much to write home about but this film is not about the plot and not even about the characters as well as they are crafted in the film regardless no this film is about the vision Â– and what a unique vision it is it is about the atmosphere the mythology the setting it is about anger fear redemption and most importantly the blues and its all wrapped up in a unique entertaining stylized and impeccable ribbon brewer has guaranteed himself a spot on the most promising upandcoming directors list and with such a solid followup to a great debut film hustle  flow he will definitely be on my radar for future projectsbr br it also must be mentioned that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles ive heard yet
