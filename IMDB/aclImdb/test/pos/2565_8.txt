as i was reading through the comments i was surprised to come across one that said this movie was not very profound i have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thoughtprovoking films ive ever seen yes the acting and the music were excellent they have been praised over and over in the reviews however i also praise the heart of the movie it resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption it is about two very different and very flawed characters beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die it is about a man seeing more value in a girl than she saw in herself it reminded me strongly of the book redeeming love by francine rivers which has a similar story of redemption yes the images and themes are messy and sometimes shocking but if you look close enough you may just see yourself in these characters sometimes the truest things in life are not pretty but they are real
