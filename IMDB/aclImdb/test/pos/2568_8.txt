im astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of black snake moan its not about blackwhite relationships or oldyoung relationships though i think director craig brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos its not about sexual abuse or sex addiction though christina riccis character rae typifies those its not about folk religion in the black community though religion plays a large role its not a love story though there are not one but two happy couples at the end and its certainly not about the south where everything is hotter though its set in the south and its undeniably hot holy smokes even the tagline writers didnt get the pointbr br black snake moan is a parable about mississippi delta blues who feels them who writes them who plays them what theyre playing about how it heals thembr br its as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked ok if we were going to help people understand what the blues are really about what would it look like so they set it in the rural south then they dream up two characters one whose wife left him to live with his best friend the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town then we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion they know jesus wants their lives and though they respect him they know they cant give him that some violence between men and women and lots and lots of steamy sexual images including  ready to go over the top  a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a halfnaked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain fill it with authentic delta blues sounds make it about a genuine blues picker use music as the main healing element in the plot slap clips of bluesman son house on both ends and voila  you have a modern parable about what the blues are all about even the films climax is not character conflict but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot raunchy bluesbr br of course theres a bit of a dilemma here rae ricci is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust and is being healed by lazarus jacksons homey religion and steadfastness and dont forget the chain but then were shown the restored rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end is this an expression of a restored healthy life force or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place brewer wants it both ways but blues really is about sex and violence not to mention depression i suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both sex and violence without unleashing either i have my doubtsbr br not for the first time samuel l jackson plays so well that we forget were watching samuel l jackson the man is unbelievably good he even picks some of his own tunes in the film and his playing is authentic dirty and hot christina ricci isnt usually this good either granted half her job is done by the costume that wasnt there and her slinky figure but shes a marvelous combination of cynical lust rebellion and vulnerability bravo to her shes arrived i was impressed by the country preacher john cothran jr i had to check the database to assure myself that hes a professional actor and not a genuine country ministerbr br parents need to be aware of what theyre getting if their kids bring this one home the language is pretty far off the charts the first halfhour is full of graphic sex and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film lazarus means well and is decent but honestly chaining a woman to the radiator plus ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex if youve got teenage boys theyll be licking the screen halfway into the film i dont recommend this for kids of any age adults only pleasebr br that being said black snake moan is informative and accurate about blues folk religion and sexual abuse and tells a tale thats redemptive in lots of ways its unorthodox but well worth the time and my goodness is the sound track hot
