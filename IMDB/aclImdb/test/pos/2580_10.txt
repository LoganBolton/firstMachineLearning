if ever a potential movie mustve sounded like it wouldnt work based on reading the script on paper it would be this one here we have what seemingly looks like a lurid and seedy softporn sm flick complete with the huge intheatre poster depicting a nearnaked christina ricci chained to none other than mr bad ass mf himself samuel jackson but let me tell you if ever a film springs to life on celluloid major big time with soulful power to spare its craig brewers redemptive followup to hustle  flow black snake moanbr br unashamedly over the top from the get go this film sucks you in with the opening scenes and proceeds to dig deeper and deeper in with every subsequent frame its yer basic story of two deeply damaged characters who find in each other the strength and courage to move on in more positive ways with their lives been done before of course this tale but as ive always said its the manner in which a story is told that gives it heart depth meaning and powerbr br riccis damagedbychildhoodabuse wildchild character rae and jacksons equally soulsick musician character lazarus find each other under desperate circumstances and laz takes it upon himself to try to help rae this in itself is relatively unique the idea of a man trying to genuinely help a woman who is in serious pain rather than trying to take further advantage of her and we know from the onset that lazs heart and the films heart is in the right place the movie at its core is about the redemptive healing power of love with music as a very close second and the film resonates profoundly with this truth  soulfully artfully and brilliantlybr br a major reason the film succeeds so profoundly is because of the fierce committed performances from ricci and jackson scenes that would have come off as laughable and pathetic in lesser artists hands are instead powerful as all getout in particular the films arc scene in which jackson sings and plays the song of the title alone in his house with ricci amidst a serious thunderstorm and the abusive demons from raes past running amok inside her head leading her to crawl to lazarus and cling to his leg comes off not ridiculous as technically it should but rather as gutwrenchingly cathartic br br all the supporting performances are fantastic here too justin timberlake is completely believable as raes anxietyridden boyfriend ronnie and the alwayswonderful s epatha merkerson is also perfectly cast as a character who obviously has feelings for lazarus john cothran jr is outstanding as well as lazs reverend friend rl a nod to blues musician r l burnside no doubt everything works about this movie lets face it including the musicsoundtrack which features burnside scott bomar bobby rush son house and most importantly jackson himself whose fantastic version of stackolee i am listening to as i compose this review theres also a really beautiful and moving version of this little light of mine featured in the film sung heartbreakingly tentative and soft by riccibr br samuel jackson has said in recent interviews that he believes his performance in this movie is the best of his career thus far i could not agree with him more this is work that he can be monumentally proud of along with everyone else involved in this audacious supremely wise and deeply heartfelt motherucker of a project
