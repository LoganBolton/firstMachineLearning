craig brewer is now officially a writerdirector for whom i will see any film by no matter how bad it may look his debut hustle and flow was one of my favorites from that year with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic fallible characters i wasnt quite sure what i would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort the cast seemed great the trailer used music effectively however it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity and fast fortunately black snake moan hits all its marks deadon the acting is astonishing the writing superb and the editing style as well as juxtaposed music riveting the whole way brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemptionbr br the first moment i knew i was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning like he did with hustle and flow brewer lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically the 70s aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinemas best from here we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both lazarus and rae each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally cross the editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose raes boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and lazs wife leaves him for his brother each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situationÂ—rae to sex and laz to the bottle only when rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clearbr br samuel l jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with god and that of the flesh and the pain it has brought him there are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with his captivepatient you never really look at the setup as comical or unrealistic because he sells what he is doing so well also the character of rae is not chained up for very long despite what the trailers would have you believe the situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day or two as for that chained girl christina ricci really shines i never really saw her as anything special but this role is a true breakthrough for her this girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and itches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away her nymphomania is not for pleasure but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism mention must also be made of justin timberlake again showing some real acting talent where this guy came from i have no clue but hopefully he will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music he churns outbr br while not as solid and consistent as hustle and flow moan still ranks equally to it in my mind because when it is on it is spectacular towards the end we have a truly enthralling sequence with this little light of mine singing out and earlier the interaction between captive and captor when the chain is first introduced shows some topnotch work the truly magical moment though is when jackson sings yes that is him throughout like it was terrence howard in hustle the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the lights flicker if i dont see a more beautifully shot sequence all year i wont be surprised what these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of one thing i think i really enjoy with brewers work is the fact that he doesnt show sinners becoming redeemed heroes instead he shows us that no matter how bad you have been or how bad life has been everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people we dont have saints here but fallible people looking to right their ship if the course stays true or if it falls back into darkness no one really knows but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could
