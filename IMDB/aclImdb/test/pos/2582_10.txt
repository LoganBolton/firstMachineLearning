i knew as soon as i saw the first trailer for black snake moan that i would have to see it i was not disappointed in the slightest in the film which was written and directed by hustle and flows creator craig brewer it tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he aims to cure not just for her sake but also his ownyet its so much more than that its complex and rich and it manages to steep you in a gritty sticky sultry blue memphis without making you feel like you need a bath afterwardbr br the characters are for the most part multifaceted and very wellwritten and performed the accents and the dialogue were carried off flawlessly however there was one weak link in the chain justin timberlake the best i can say for him is that he can pull off cryingits a rare male actor who can cry convincingly however justins ronnie was flat but as an actor he was trying very hard i would definitely give him another chancebr br lazarus and rae samuel l jackson and christina ricci respectively have a great chemistry and a great respect for each other this is one of those films where it doesnt matter how good one actor is if the other one isnt up to the task and luckily both of the actors were up to the taskbr br the music was very bit as good as you would expect especially when mr samuel l jackson sings the blues phenomenalbr br on the technical side all was brilliance as far as i could see it was welledited well shot and wellmixedeverything was great the character and set designs were just right the casting of the supporting characters even justin timberlake and especially kim richards was spot on loved it
