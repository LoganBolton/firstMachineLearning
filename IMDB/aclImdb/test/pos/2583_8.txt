if youve been looking for a film where a out of control nympho gets chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man then look no further than paramount vantages latest release black snake moan not exactly looking for what i just described you say well then you best get ya wits bout yaself and mosey on down to your local theater and still see it as samuel l jacksons character lazarus would say as long as youre open minded and dont take everything seriously theres no reason you wont leave the theater glad you saw itbr br in the third offering from director craig brewer we are taken into the deep south where as the tagline to the film claims everything is hotter while there were introduced to the godfearing bluesman lazarus as previously said played by jackson and the almost always half naked rae a role bravely taken on by christina ricci in the film this unlikely pair cross paths long enough for their characters to each learn a lesson from one another both lessons ultimately convey the message to us the audience that no matter what we are all human no one is perfect and if everyone would realize that then wed be a lot better off the question of if this will be understood or be accepted by all who see the film is another storybr br one thing not up for debate is how great jackson and ricci both are here youd think with the role of a sexcrazed woman overacting would be a given but no not here ricci breaks through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that also doubles as her best to date then we have jackson who completely disappears and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he even is sadly the third star of the film justin timberlake who plays raes militarybound boyfriend isnt all that great at the start he fails miserably as he appears to be trying too hard later on he steps it up some still hes far from the level he reached in januarys alpha dogbr br the other thing black snake moan boasts is a splendid soundtrack containing tracks from the black keys john doe pieces from the score done by scott bomar  of course four count em four tracks from jackson himself its actually one of his songs the main performance of the film stackolee that is the fuel to the fire of this great collection it alone is worth the ticket price other notable musical delights from the soundtrack are bomars the chain when the lights go out from the black keys  the title track which is also among the most memorable scenes in the film where lazarus sings to rae on a stormy nightbr br the efforts of craig brewer cant go without mention though his last film hustle  flow which ended up surpassing low expectations and gaining critical acclaim put him on the map what he has done with black snake moan will be what sets him apart from other newbies to the industry he not only directed moan but also wrote its screenplay the end result is a story that is surprising and clever as you watch you feel like you know exactly where its headed despite its valiant composure just as you think youve predicted the next move brewer shifts gears and takes an entirely different route there are however some blotches within the screenplay the background characters are drab and flat while the ending is somewhat disappointing it left me craving for something more exciting after so many highs i guess the final scenes were a tad weak compared to the rest of the filmbr br i imagine the majority of people who see black snake moan wont enjoy it due to the fact they wont be able to stop themselves from thinking how unlikely the situations are the depressing part about that is there are many other films with just as unlikely even more outrageous scenarios that are widely well received its the issues of race religious motives  sexuality the film exhibits that will have more effect on opinion than anything the idea of a black man chaining a white woman up in his house is enough to make most people not even consider seeing it simply put its not for everyone like i said to fully enjoy it you have to go in with an open mind or else youre just wasting your money for those of you who can do that i highly recommend it
