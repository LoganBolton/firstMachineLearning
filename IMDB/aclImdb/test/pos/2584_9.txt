i watched this movie at the first showing available in my area and it was quite clear that most people didnt get the movie even if you dont its a good movie with some interesting character development it is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town and really speaks to the root of the blues if you dont know what the black snake moan is by the time you leave the theater you didnt get it and no its not just a song christina ricci does a great job and is thoroughly convincing in her role as is samuel l jackson i think this is his best performance since his role in pulp fiction and probably his best including that because of the range of his character in bsm the rest of the cast is solid with a few shining performances here and there particularly john cothran jr as reverend r l im a very selective movie watcher and this film honestly rates among my favorites because of its candid look at race sex religion and neurosis in a rural southern town along with its cinematic genius in my opinion
