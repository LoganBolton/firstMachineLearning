and there were quite a few of these br br i do not like this cartoon as much as many others partly because it was made in its period i much prefer cartoons with daffy and bugs which are fifteen or so years beforehand many people will like this particularly people who always find violence funny cartoon or notbr br the basic plot is a pretty well known one for looney tunes elmer goes out hunting daffy leads him to bugs and daffy ends up being shot instead also inserted are quite clever and highly entertaining jokes some do not enhance the episode ugly shooting and animation which is slightly mediocre the plot is mainly geared by jokes  each joke keeps the episode going this way of plotgoing is not all that unusual in looney tunes of course if you are pretty much a looney tunes boffin  or an eager one  like me then youll know this alreadybr br for people who love everything about looney tunes and daffy duck and like the sound of what i have said about it enjoy rabbit seasoningbr br 7 and a half out of ten
