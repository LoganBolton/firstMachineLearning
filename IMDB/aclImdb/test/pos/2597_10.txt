there is only one film i can think of that might be as good or better than this one when it comes to bugs bunny and daffy duckali baba bunny however determining which is the best is irrelevantjust watch them both and enjoybr br i compared this to ali baba bunny because both feature daffy at his absolute worstgreedy nasty and very funny in the process however i think i prefer rabbit seasoning simply because bugs is also pretty awful in this onedoing horrible things right back to daffy every time daffy tries a dirty trickbr br the film begins with daffy leaving rabbit tracks right up to bugs hole in the hope that a hunter naturally its elmer will blast the rabbit and leave daffy alone not to be outdone bugs time and again takes all of daffys tricks and turns them aroundand in most cases it involves daffy getting shot in the face its all very very clever and funny and i dont care how old you are this cartoon will make you laugh unless you are a grouch i especially love the great and unexpected ending but i wont say more as i dont want to spoil the surprise
