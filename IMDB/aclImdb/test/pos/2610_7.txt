please dont kill me im just an actor can you play dead its difficult to describe this show its like a crime dramedy where the bad cop is an ass literally whats great about the show is some of assys perfectly awful oneliners cracking out such gems as adios blimp assy mcgee provides some great laughs at points sadly at other times the show seems to drag along at a slow pace making it almost hard to watch this is definitely the kind of show youll love or hate theres essentially no middleman its not the best show on adult swim but it has some strong points its worth looking into just to see if you enjoy it i know i did
