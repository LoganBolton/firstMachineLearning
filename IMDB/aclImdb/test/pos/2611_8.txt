assy mcgee is an outofcontrol hardnosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas the twist here is that assy is literally a walking buttocksbr br the cheap lowbrow facade of the show belies its cleverness and hidden satire that is not to say that assy is devoid of fart jokes just that the toilet humor is used sparingly enough to elicit consistent laughs not groans and eyerolls the title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever subtle humor used throughout the sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme in one photo a police cruiser is shown and the camera zooms in on the front license plate holder which is vacant the meaningless zoomin satirizes the production of the typical 70s80s cop drama and incidentally makes me laugh every timebr br all the typical characters are included the frustrated police chief who cant control assy the loyal minority partner who acts as a foil to assys recklessness the regular cops who detest assys means all are accounted for and all are hilarious satires of the typical police dramabr br the voice acting primarily performed by larry murphy is nothing less than spectacular assys voicebreathy and gruff with a bit of a drunken sluris so clever and unique that it ranks alongside alltime greats like stewie griffin family guy and homer simpson simpsons though the voice is slurred the diction is somehow clear and easy to understand this is a nice change from other adult swim program voices that often require closed captioning to understandbr br besides the fantastic production and voice acting the script is also hilarious assys no nonsense directness fuels most of the humor particularly in his interactions with citizens outside the police forcebr br if you have access to the adult swim comedies assy mcgee is certainly worth the watching each episode clocks in at a mere 89 minutes so you really have little to lose
