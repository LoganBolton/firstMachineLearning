assy mcgee is a show that you really have to be a certain age to appreciate otherwise its likely youll miss the references to 80s cop films and simply think its a running gag about a walking rectum think its brainless infantile poop humor go watch the stallone film cobra and youll see what i mean this show actually has very subtle humor which says a lot both for a show that aired on adult swim and for a show about a walking assbr br all the standard genre clich√©s are in place that made movies like dirt harry and cobra so great and ripe for parody sanchez is assys partner who is  as per the genre  levelheaded and constantly apologizing for his partners homicidal behavior the police chief is of course a firebreathing hard case who lives to scream i want your badge on my desk first thing tomorrow morning the overthetop and sometimes completely nonsensical manner in which the 1980s renegade cop film is parodied suits the subject matter well for instance while breaking up a bus robbery one of the criminals stops to ask assy hey where are you going asshole to which the title character snaps off the oneliner im going to shoot you br br highly recommended for anybody who loves 80s action movies and has actually viewed enough of them to understand the humor
