i was a 20 year old college student living with the folks when i first saw this and ive never forgotten it im a huge joan hackett fan and this film was perfect for her remarkable talent im so glad to see that so many other people have such a fond memory of seeing this naturally its not available on any media it would be perfect to show on lifetime but because of its age they wont you never see anything there before the mideighties i can still remember what made me watch it when it was first run rex reed reviewed it in the new york daily news and he said that it was like a throwback to the great hollywood films of the forties and had it been made then the hackett and grimes parts would have been played by stanwyck and crawford think about that ps so sad that joan hackett left us so tragically young
