for some reason some shows just failsome deservedly some not buddy faro was a clever show with interesting characters and dark humor that was enjoyable to watchmaybe it was never intended to be a big hit but it had a quirkiness about it that made it enjoyable that being said it appears i may have been the only one watchingdennis farina and frank whaley were casted perfectly in their respective rolesproduction quality and writing were great and vegas was the perfect backdrop hopefully the first and only season will be released on dvd as i believe it deserves some notoriety maybe at least make it on tv land cheers
