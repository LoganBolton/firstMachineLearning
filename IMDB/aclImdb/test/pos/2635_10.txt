this movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80s entertainment oh dont get me wrong most of the music back then sucked i only ever liked the metal bands from the 80s bands that had some balls forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that life is horrible and i want to die garbage but the movies from the 80s are the best they were all about nonsense and just having a good time this movie exemplifies that party get naked get laid woooooohooooo
