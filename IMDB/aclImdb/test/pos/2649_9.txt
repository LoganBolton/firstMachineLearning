dear readers 2001 a space odyssey is kubrick at his bestalthough i really cant say that as space odyssey is his only film ive ever watched but still its a good film strange but goodbr br the movie is in three acts much like the novelwhich is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay anyhow we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with also sparach zarathustra blaring on the speakers then comes the boring beyond belief dawn of man sequence then theres the odd finding of the monolith sequence on the moon played to strausss blue danube finally things get good with the spaceship scenes and hal going berserk and killing people after that things die down and we have the entering the monolith sequence which was way too long and the ultrastrange ending even though 2001 a space odyssey is a good film its not star wars stargate terminator or the abyss but it rocks my compliments to the chef mr kubrickbr br signed the constant dvd collector
