rented this out from my local because it was the only new british film available this week never heard of the filmmaker before or his other films thank you imdb about time some one made a good young british comedy that didnt star hugh grant or forty somethings the story is a morality tale but never preachy throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast luke gosss cameo was surprisingly very good but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in blade loved the colour grading especially in the night club sequences great music and a truly original voice at work here nine out of ten and well worth the rental charge
