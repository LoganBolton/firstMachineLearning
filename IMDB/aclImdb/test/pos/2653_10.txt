there is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will and it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated at the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound systembr br i saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968 my senior year in high school i went because i like sciencefiction and wanted to see a space movie remember this film was made before the first moon landingbr br there we sat waiting for it to begin but surprise there was no cartoon no coming attractions the theater owner at the cooper theatre for some reason chose to play the starspangled banner with the lights still up so we all stood never did that at a movie before or since and then sat down again as it ended then the theatre went completely dark and the strange overture began with the blank screen barely visiblebr br the overture ended and my seat began to vibrate as the blue screen with the mgm lion appeared along with the first deep bass notes and then my senses were overwhelmed hearing also sprach zarathustra for the first time in my life the ride had just begunbr br i highly recommend you watch this opening this film in a dark room with your subwoofer turned up as high as possible to get the effect i felt in that theatre of course it took quite awhile before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was anything but a sciencefiction movie intermission came a good thing highly underrated and unused these days and we all looked at each other in wonder caught our breath and then the ride resumed wilder than beforebr br i saw it 7 more times within the next year always in a real full size theater like all theaters were before multiplexes i might have been high once but i didnt go to see it again and again because i was tripping i went because i knew i was seeing a work of art it was so damn beautiful the sound that you could feel in your bones followed by terrifying silence the sights unimagined and unimaginable the affection for hal turning to terror and of course wtf was kubrick really trying to get across to me years and years and many more viewings later i understand it as well i think as i ever will read someone elses comments if youre looking for someone to explain it to you or search around the web youll find explanations thats not my purpose in writing these commentsbr br what i hope to do is encourage you to watch it patiently enjoy its beauty the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of eg gayne ballet suite or the blue danube savor it like you would a wonderful meal sip it like a fine wine look and listen for the clues and the hidden symbols that are there and then draw your own conclusions stanley kubrick wanted to share some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you a human came from and where youre headedbr br if thats too much work for your brain and you cant see and hear and ponder the beauty and mystery of kubricks film then pardon my bluntness but your life is about as meaningful as that of a tapir or a premonolith ape if you want mindless escape this isnt for youbr br but if you like sunsets thunderstorms harmonies in music mysteries and sensuality and can have an open mind this film will add something to your life
