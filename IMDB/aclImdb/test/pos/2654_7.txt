2001 a space odyssey is set in 2001 and the main character is hal a computer thats right a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own this was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke if this was in 3064 a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this there is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion it provokes two reactions and one is called sleep it starts with nothing but a pitch black shot for well over two minutes then the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is the dawn of man sequence so if its in chronological order the blackness prior to this is the birth of the world br br during the dawn of man sequence out of no where a huge monolith comes from out of the ground from the sky well never know where it comes from but for one reason or another its there the monkeys go apesht once they find this monolith that only man could have made but thats the catch man hasnt evolved yet so who made it and where did it come from what is its purpose the monkeys find a tool the monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys the monkeys with the weapons are now the dominating group because they have used their mind to gain an advantage the more advanced monkeys and more importantly smarter and more innovative monkeys are the dominate group as they have taken over the watering holebr br we quickly jump into space millions of years later where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around to classical music we can see the earth the moon the sun the universe and for a film made in 1968 the visual effects are stunning but outdated the score is legendary the cinematography is spectacular the editing is atrocious there are countless shots of boxy looking space ships floating in outer space for what feels like an infinite amount of time once we board the ship there isnt much to talk about for the next hour kubrick shows various shots of life in outer space kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut which is very boring and we completely get the message the spaceships interior and exterior are bulky and outdated looking remember what the first cell phone looked like me neither but thats what the future looks like in 2001 all the characters have clothes and hairdos that resemble 1968 the chairs are decorated in bright red colors and oddly shaped because we all know in the future were going to be sitting in weird looking chairs the computer screens are hideous looking and this is obviously prior to hdtv because the clarity is atrocious all the tv sets look like theyre from 1968 so its not all that futuristic like all films set more than 20 years in advance they look terrible and unconvincing just because this is kubrick we shouldnt say well thats how you would think it looks no i wouldnt just like i wouldnt think a computer would be talking to me in the year 2047 its not going to happen and if someone made a film right now set 30 years in time and had a talking self thinking computer i would laugh at the stupidity of it just like i did with 2001 br br hal is the liveliest person shoot i just called him a person hal is a computer but he has more life than any of the muted characters in the film and he actually thinks hes alive hal is the only thing thats lively and he sees the humans as his maintenance men taking care of him while he does all the work hal reads the lips of one of the very few conversations between dave and frank and he sees that they are planning to turn him off this is where the only dramatic part of the film enters an ensuing battle between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into the bigger spaceship oh the drama once hal thinks he has the upper hand dave makes his way back into the spaceship proving mans ingenuity dave proceeds to terminate hal hal pleads for his life as he slowly fades away which like everything else seems to take foreverbr br the final act is just as tedious as the first two once again the monolith that the apes found appears at the end it comes out of nowhere again then an infant is born in a placentalike shield overlooking the earth from space what is kubrick saying is it about transformation dave to an infant is man evolving again is kubrick saying this is the end of man and the start of whatever that alien looking thing is maybe im going crazy trying figure out what this crazy director is trying to say but the more i think about the more the beginning and the ending make sense there are so many questions left unanswered especially for the purpose of the monolith if you can make it through the film it should spark some thought br br in the end the film struggles with getting to where it wants go the first act and the third acts are strong but the second act meanders around hovering in one place for what seems like eternity there is some intriguing stuff in the film that will provoke some thought if you give it a chance once the start of the film makes sense the ending works much better even if you still dont what kubrick is trying to say which i dont
