2001 a space odyssey br br is it a sermon an account of the history of mankind an exploration of mans futile attempts to advance technology only to have technology destroy him is it about the fragile balance of time and space a lesson in evolution or is it just a spectacular effects show a film kubrick made only to show us the limitless possibilities of the motion picture and present to us the truth that images are exceedingly more powerful than words br br 2001 a space odyssey is all of these things one of the most interpretable films ever created its almost more fun to dissect and discuss the ambiguous plot design and events of the film than it is to actually watch but its left open to discussion intentionally if kubrick had explained the meaning to his wondrous 1968 classic ranked 22 on afis list of the greatest 100 films ever made my personal 21st favorite filmÂ—currently and nominated for 4 academy awards director original screenplay art direction and visual effects which it won for it would have lost half its fascination all of its complexity and a good portion of its cinematic worth we would only be left with the technical ingenuity which in itself is worth praisingbr br because every shot is worth taking the time to look and there is plenty of time 2001 is very elegiac and also coolly distant detached the emotional remoteness and slow pace pay perfect tribute however to the unique visual experience 2001 begins with mankinds ape ancestors who upgrade from scavengers of the planet to hunters and toolmakers after discovering a giant monolith in the midst of their desert home then in one of motion picture historys most inspired jumpcut edits as a bone is tossed into the air and becomes a satellite jumping forward a couple thousand years into space where astronauts have discovered a similar object on the moon and next the film following a crew of space travelers mission as they follow the monoliths signal through space accompanied by their untrustworthy computer hal who attempts to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew before finally the lone survivor is launched through space and time in a flurry of druginduced colors that probably gave hippies an epileptic shock back in the day to grow old die and be reborn a starchild whewbr br this pacing and emotional blankness is also in sharp contrast with the films most ironic scene the destruction of hal as the crews final explorer shuts the machine down bathed in the holy aura of red light kubrick has always used as a repeat motif hal singing a lovely tune it is a strangely emotional experience and its all geniusbr br other notable aspects of kubricks masterpiece is the memorable voice of hal a calm somehow sinister douglas rain the minimal use of dialogue kubrick was wisely trusting of his images to propel the film giving only banal unhelpful lines to his actors the most famous being open the pod bay doors hal satellites dancing around in orbit to unorthodox music and that first aweinspiring shot of earth slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of it played to the sound of blasting triumphant hornsbr br 2001 shall always remain a mystery and will forever be a testament to the cinemas strongest point visuals are more powerful than writing its all from one of film historys most legendary and best directors whose unique vision was always his own 1010 br br open the pod bay doors hal2001 a space odyssey
