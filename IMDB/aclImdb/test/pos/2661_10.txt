mankinds self awakening is the theme of 2001 a space odyssey a process that unfolds along a spacetime continuum we see our primordial past and we infer a cosmic future the powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception in our ongoing collective journeybr br from this transcendental perspective a conventional egocentric plot seems superfluous our frenzied conflicts and selfimportant dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension its a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the films slowness and minimal story for perceptive viewers the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awebr br in this film which is mostly visual geometric symbols guide our intuition circles and arcs represent nature right angles represent conscious intelligence some people think the sleek black monolith is a von neumann probe maybe without doubt the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown mystery is more profound than explanationbr br 2001   is unique among films in content and scope the cinematography is outofthisworld the special and visual effects are breathtaking and the classical music is sublime i rarely use the word masterpiece to describe a movie but stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey is art in the highest sense like leonardo da vincis mona lisa or vincent van goghs the starry night
