for all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film like why does he show spaceships docking for like 15 minutes heres a word you might want to think aboutbr br beautybr br  beauty is an underrated concept sure youll often see nice photography and so on in films but when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it there is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed this is depressing hogwash there is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the films plot a director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so br br  2001 requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films it requires you to relax it requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization dont get me wrong plots and characters are good but theyre not the beall and endall of everything there are different kinds of film and to enjoy 2001 you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty pure beauty unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday filmsbr br  all art is quite useless  oscar wilde
