sometimes reading the user comments on imdb fills me with despair for the species for anybody to dismiss 2001 a space odyssey as boring they must have no interest in science technology philosophy history or the art of filmmaking finally i understand why most hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous  they understand their audiencebr br thankfully those that cannot appreciate kubricks accomplishment are still a minority most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic this is the film that put the science in science fiction and its depiction of space travel and mankinds future remains unsurpassed to this day it was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasnt caught upbr br 2001 is primarily a technical film the reason it is slow and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology and the past in the awe inspiring opening scenes the films greatest strength is in the details remember that when this film was made man still hadnt made it out to the moon but there it is in 2001 and thats just the start of the journey to create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief  i still cant work out how some of the shots were done the films only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankinds technological and social development it is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001 not kubricksbr br besides the incredible special effects camera work and set design kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human and where the human race is going yes the ending is weird and hard to comprehend  but thats the nature of the future kubrick and clarke have started the task of envisioning it now its up to the audience to continue theres no neat resolution no definitive full stop because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel i know thats what most audiences seem to want these days but kubrick isnt going to let us off so lightlybr br im glad to see that this film is in the imdb top 100 films and only wish that it were even higher stanley kubrick is one of the very finest filmmakers the world has known and 2001 his finest accomplishment 1010
