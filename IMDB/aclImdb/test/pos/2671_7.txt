its sometimes difficult to watch such selfavowed message films from an earlier seeminglysimpler era without a certain degree of cynicism the issue of racism and religious tolerance is one that has been drummed into us from an early age and as weve grown teachers and authority figures have sought out less blatant yet equallyeffective means of getting the message across the house i live in 1945 is about as unsubtle as message films come and frank sinatra seems to be treating his audience like a child  indeed perhaps this was the point as the short was no doubt intended primarily to influence younger filmgoers even so i found myself curiously affected when sinatra launched into that sincere patriotic speech about what it really means to be an american and im not even an american released just two months after the end of wwii director mervyn leroy greeted warweary audiences with a message of tolerance togetherness and above all else hope the music aint bad eitherbr br freshfaced frank sinatra  already a star but not yet the superstar hed become  opens the film in a recording studio booming out if you are but a dream with a full orchestral accompaniment when between songs frank goes outside for a smoko he observes a large group of kids bullying a young jewish boy their taunts provoked purely by his differing religion ol blue eyes quickly puts a stop to this childish behaviour delicately branding the bullies nazi werewolves and scolding their irrational prejudice he then earnestly and goodnaturely lectures the group on the plain silliness of racial and religious discrimination assuring them that every american culture however it differs from our own is still american at heart unless of course youre one of those bloody japs theres a hint of hypocrisy in pleading for racial tolerance while presenting one nation as the collective enemy though you could hardly blame hollywood for being less than enthusiastic about the plight of the japanese in 1945br br sinatra drives his point home with a wonderfully heartwarming rendition of the house i live in which was written in 1943 by abel meeropol when the songwriter first heard the song on film he was furious that the filmmakers had completely excluded three of his verses which he considered crucial to the message these omissions were most likely due to time restraints but meeropol understandably didnt take too kindly to them and reportedly had to be ejected from the cinema when it was first released the house i live in was deemed such an important short film that it won a golden globe for best film for promoting international good will and a honorary oscar for all involved in 2007 it was judged to be culturally historically or aesthetically significant and added to the library of congress national film registry which is how i came to hear of it while its approach may seem a little hokey sixty years later this film remains quite watchable thanks to a young fella named frank sinatra
