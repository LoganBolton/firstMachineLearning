this show is amazing i love each and every episode carrie is a spitfire and doug is a lovable and at times a moron arthur spence danny deacon and carries boss add just a nice end touch to the show tying up all of the funny pee in your pants moments in one of the seasons doug tries to get carrie drunk because she is nicer when she is drunk nice husband right carrie isnt much better when her boss needs a ips driver to testify in a small case at her job carrie hesitates because she views doug as a slob and doesnt want him to embarrass her so she hires dougs friend instead wife of the year but who i believe to be funniest is yellatrandom arthur he is dropdead hilarious and angry hey you would be too if you had to live in a basement where the mold has a funny smell and makes you dizzy this show is hilarious and if you havent seen it yet then you havent lived
