the king of queens in my opinion is a pure cbs hit despite the fact that ive never seen every episode i still enjoy it very much for that reason its hard for me to say which episode is my favorite even so i must say that cbs really knows how to make a good sitcom before i wrap this up id like to say that everyone always gives a good performance the production design is spectacular the costumes are welldesigned and the writing is always very strong in conclusion if this show lives on in syndication after it goes off cbs i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
