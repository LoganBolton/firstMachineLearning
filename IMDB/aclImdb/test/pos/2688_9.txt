i think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after seinfeldafter elr and after friends those three sitcoms were the star shows of their timebr br koqs came at the end of this special time in tv br br but dont let that dissuade youbr br king of queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentionedbr br seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic i never laughed so hard than i did at seinfeld but koqs comes real closebr br when it comes to laughing i have to rate koqs second only to seinfeld elr has to be second though as the character creation and interaction is more endearingbr br either way koqs is top ten of the last 20 yearsbr br the only other sitcom worth mentioning now is two and a half men which really doesnt hold a candle to the other four but is all we have left
