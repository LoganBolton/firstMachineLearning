im not really a tv watcher  except between the ages of 6 and 8 and general hospital still had luke and laura  but there are a few exceptions and i definitely think that king of queens is one of them every decade has its classics and i think that this show will or damnwell should be amongst this decades best its comedic timing is awesome and can at times be down right odd on a more serious note the actors more than succeed in conveying subtle  and not so subtle  complexities in their characters without getting too hokey one commenter wrote that it may take a couple of episodes to get into it and i agree its definitely one that kind of grows on you but once youre in youre pretty much hooked and with good reason
