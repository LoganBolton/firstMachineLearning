im surprised that mine so far is the only comment on this tv movieas far as im aware the series itself has had a huge following reviewer pundits and real people alike have praised it to a person anyway let me tell you right away that if like me youre a sucker for gritty police dramas youll like the lost child tennison the heroine throughout the prime suspectseries has been battling the male police establishment throughout the series getting to her present comparatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy through hard workobstinacy and sheer talent for police work she isessentially an ambitious career woman but she has a romantic side and is certainly no manhater unfortunately her relationships are affected by the wicked hours which her career demands and she has never married so when she finds herself pregnant from her latest affair she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother and jeopardising her entire police job let alone future advancement or having an abortion  which she opts for this abortion never looms large in the ensuing drama  its very skilfully dealt with in less than a couple of minutes screentime a marvel of economy in scripting and editing  but its always there as a counterpoint to tennisons desperate efforts to find another lost child  a kidnap victim  before its too late the story takes many twists and turnsbefore the surprise ending and one is fascinated alike by the plot and characters although i found the many villains a little overdrawn the police and especially tennison herself are not always competent nor that likeable which figures given the unpleasant job that they have to do in the sleazy underworld which this series habitually inhabitsbr br mirren herself has said that shell make no more movies in the series but excellent as shes always been in the role of tennison the series itself is as actor proof as is another addiction of mine dick wolfs americanlaw  order  whoever appears therein each could go on forever as is my fervent hope
