i guess my husband and i are a little slow we dont usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life in this case we didnt start watching koqs until almost the 6th season im not sure how it escaped our radar for so long other than the fact that we are not big fans of appointment tv viewing our schedules our such that we dont like to commit to watching series every time they come on and we didnt have a dvr yet so i guess it wasnt until tbs starting running reruns on their daily lineup in the evenings that we started watching consistentlybr br by the time we got hooked there were only a couple more seasons left before the series was canceled but we still watch it almost daily on tbs i almost prefer to see series this way because you can watch multiple episodes day after day and it helps to build continuity and whats going on with the characters without having to wait a whole weekbr br but the episodes stand alone in the since that the stories dont carry over from week to week but that is fine with me because you can watch an episode then miss weeks  and still pick back upbr br my only criticism is the writing wasnt always consistent some episodes would be outrageously hilarious and then some would only be mildly funny so im not sure it had the quality of writers that seinfeld or raymond had but i loved the casting and the characters are all quite believable and realistic kevin james is just plain funny to look at so even if the plot isnt that great james body language and expressions make the show worth watching leah remini is great as the playitstraight wife i think its harder to play the straight character for laughs than the comedic character and she does a great job she has a knack at sarcasm and insults like no one else she is one tough cookie and who can forget arthur as carries dad who lives with them in their basement br br this a great series and i was sorry when it cancelled but a big thanks to tbs for keeping the king alive in reruns
