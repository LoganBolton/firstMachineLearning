i need help identifying an episode of king of queens it begins with a scene where doug is talking to carrie on the phone and he suggests that they agree to stop ending every conversation with i love you however its hard to do and he ends up calling her back only to close with i love you its a very clever moment and one i think says a lot about relationships that have lasted a long timebr br i think but im sure thats its the same episode where doug gets some local construction guys to whistle and throw lurid comments at carrie to perk her spirits upbr br i saw this episode recently but it was probably a repeat dont know what network i saw it on can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode
