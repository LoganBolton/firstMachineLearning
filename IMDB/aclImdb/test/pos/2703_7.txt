yes this is one of the better done television movies and i wouldnt expect less from joe sargent one thing for this reviewer is that i was also a great fan of the carpenters i got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and i got to do much of the solo material of which karen sang lead i thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70s  and being a childteen singing these songs and learning music  the one thing i was looking forward to was meeting this woman i never got to she died three weeks before that was to happen and yes that did effect me for i knew nothing of anorexia  and could not understand completely what happenedbr br when this tv movie got produced i got quite an understanding maybe not everything in karen and richards life is open to the television audience but in opening the parts that were shown i got to understand much from the music industry of that time what upsets me is that i am writing of that time and seeing now no one has learned a darned thing even though this was a very informative and heartfelt look into a familys problems in the music industrybr br these films arent done for fun theyre done to open a door and show us something here was a wonderful woman who got caught up in the whole idea that her talent was based on weight she was fine didnt know it she got mixed messages about her weight from the brother she loved the parents she loved and the music industry that cared more about her looksweight than the talent within with the onset of mtv it got worse with american idol its like a puss festering in an english accentbr br a wonderful tv film i am sure later someone may give it an hbo treatment but either way many lessons to be learned and the absence of another wonderful talent
