there is a clever little scene in the karen carpenter story where both carpenters are in a recording studio and richard makes an impromptu decision to have karen sing for the owner of the studiobr br richard picks the wrong key for karen to sing in so karen is singing above her natural range you can see a look of bemusement on the owners face he figures she really cant sing richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key the next thing you hear is karens amazing beautiful voice and the owner does a priceless double take nicely done for some reason i have never forgotten that scenebr br the karen carpenter story chronicles the meteoric rise of the carpenters and karens struggle to overcome anorexia a lot of things are glossed over this isnt a documentary and the movie left me with a lot of questions very little is mentioned of karens solo venture the cd was released only a few years ago if you buy it you will wonder why they waited its some of karens best work the songs arent as timeless as her work with brother richard but it was a great recording in my opinionbr br i have heard it said that you can be listening to a cheap timeworn little radio in the middle of the third world that would seem to produce more static than anything else but when a carpenter song comes on the radio you would think you were listening to a 1000 hifidelity unitbr br watch this movie
