this is how i interpreted the movie first things first there was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy taylor torturing or nailing bens hands to the wall however the same cannot be told of the gals in the end too u see taylor disappear as he walks looks like the message there was there was no taylor and the whole movie was a figment of imagination of ben also there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as ben it was taylor all the time but in real taylor was ben if they were two different people then why was there no scene showing both of them in one frame during the horrific times but of course before that u do see both of them together and that cud just be bens imagination at work also when ben was out of jail the text on screen clearly says that bens story was unrealistic and there was no such place as he had explained read mine cars etceven after liz hunter leaves kristy and comes back to find ben she doesnt find him why because ben taylor was out looking for the gals instead kristy has all the time in the world to check out taylors ben web cam photos etcbr br somehow everything sums up to just one fact that kristy and liz both of them knew that taylor was ben so my conclusion is that ben was schizophrenic and the movie where you see him and taylor in one frame was nothing but figments of his imagination otherwise if there really was a taylor then they should have found him out given all the detailed explanation coming from ben
