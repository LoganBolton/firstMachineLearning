this is a multifaceted insightful and bold story about the people in the life of a schizophrenic patient their and our perception and realities although the main theme revolves around a delusional young woman the story delightfully flirts with physics medicine religion and even politics as it questions our perceptions about what is true and what is real konkona sensharma beautifully conveys that the world mithi is living in is as real to her as ours is to us within that world she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent not the gibberish that they seem to us in our worldbr br here are a few outstanding scenes to look out for while watching the movie dont worry these are not spoilers i absolutely loved the way aparna sen wove these commentaries into the storybr br  the references to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the witchdoctor ojha in hindi performing his religious rituals that he believes will drive away the ghosts sitting in mithis brain br br  the doctor prescribing shocktreatment as a solution that is believed to work br br  windows of perception  the scene about the review of anus book br br  the allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for maya br br  news footage of george bush telling the whole world that there is no doubt in his mind that there are wmd in iraq now that is not as much about bushs perception who i suspect knew the truth as the gullible publics perception about wmd in iraqbr br  one of the best scenes in the movie is where mithi tells anu charu sent this man to beat me and anu dismisses it as a matter of course konkona did a fantastic job bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenics brain when her world and the real world clashbr br aparna sen was bold but not bold enough to pose one big question is nearly all of mankind delusional to believe in god she could have inserted some scenes about normal healthy people praying to and sacrificing for a being that no one has ever seen or heard from in all of human history the ritualexorcism scene doesnt go far enough that would be the ultimate question what is normal whos reality is right the believers or the atheistsbr br imho this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than a beautiful mind it looks at the minds of not just the sick person but also the healthy and does so from many different angles and illuminates our understanding of our own minds and our world if the former got 4 oscars this deserves more  at least one each for story screenplay direction konkona and shabana azmi it was truly a treat to watch this movie and im glad i bought the dvd for my collection br br this was a story very welltold indeed
