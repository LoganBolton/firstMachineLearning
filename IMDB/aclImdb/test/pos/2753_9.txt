the show is great no words to describe it wonderful music incredible dance the editors couldnt spoil it not because they were not thatbad but because the show is really thatgoodbr br the editors are compulsive cutters you cant see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs its ok to show various angles but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average they manage to film the start of a jump with one camera then cut it in the middle and show the rest of it in another anglebr br no matter how much they tried they couldnt spoil that wonderful show its a must for dance and music lovers
