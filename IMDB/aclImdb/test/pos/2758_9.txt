tony hawks pro skater 2x isnt much different at all from the previous games excluding tony hawk 3 the only thing new that is featured in tony hawks pro skater 2x is the new selection of levels and tweaked out graphics tony hawks pro skater 2x offers a new career mode and that is the 2x career the 2x career is basically tony hawk 1 career because there is only about five challenges per level if you missed tony hawk 1 and 2 i suggest that you buy tony hawks pro skater 2x but if you have played the first two games you should still try this one overall there really isnt anything new but it is still very fun to go through the game hopefully this review benefits your needsbr br graphics 7 out of 10 overall the clean visuals isnt really one of tony hawks pro skater 2xs main characteristics the atmosphere has been changed around a lot from tony hawk 1 and 2 and the character models look a little bit improved when you look back to tony hawks pro skater 1 and 2 on the old ps1 the thought that those old graphics are ugly run through your head in tony hawks pro skater 2x the graphics are rendered a lot better the character models are no longer filled with jaggys the textures are more smooth but not to the farthest extent tony hawks pro skater 2xs visuals do not compare to tony hawk 3s graphics but activision probably didnt want to make tony hawks pro skater 2x have extraordinary graphics overall the graphics deserve an average score of 7 because they did not put the full power of the xbox to use in here graphics are nice and clean thats all i have to saybr br sound 8 out of 10 the sound effects dont deliver much to the imagination but the skateboards popping off of the ground sound great the main reason why i gave the sound factor a rating was because you are not obligated to listen to the below average tony hawk soundtrack because there is a custom soundtrack feature the sound effects sound a lot better than the sounds in tony hawk 1 and 2 mainly because it is more clearer and just the fact that everything sounds great one of the main reasons why i bought this game is because of the custom soundtrack the grind sound effects still sound the same as the first two games did just a little tweaked out one of the major problems of the sound factor is the fact that if the song is over it will not proceed to the next track the song that you have just listened to will just play over again i dont like the ingame soundtrack but like i said you are not obligated to listen to itbr br controls 10 out of 10 the controls are the best part of tony hawks pro skater 2x the control setup is marvelously comfortable and easy to get used to back in the playstation days people thought that the controls were the best ever but it looks like 2x has done a better job with the xbox control surprisingly it is very easy to use the control stick to execute tricks activision has done great work with tony hawks pro skater 2xs controls they have made the xbox controller the best for tony hawk games you will not be disappointed with the control style and that is a guaranteebr br game play 10 out of 10 excluding the fact that tony hawks pro skater 2x is basically tony hawk 1 and 2 put together the game play is still unbelievably fun the game play factor has been changed around a bit this time you get a lot more air than in the first two games and it is a lot easier to perform tricks in tony hawks pro skater 2x each character has three career modes consisting of tony hawk 1 career tony hawk 2 career and the 2x career tony hawk 1 career is rather easy because in the first game you get nothing for air the tony hawk 2 career delivers the same amount of difficulty as the playstation version did the only amount of difficulty that applies to the 2x career is finding out where all items are but after youve done that 2x career is no hard at all in the 2x career there is a total of 3 levels and the first two levels consist of finding the secret tapes collecting skate and doing whatever else is required for that particular level the third level out of the three is the competition level where you have to get a certain amount of points to get the gold in the first two levels the secret tapes and collecting the letters skate are featured in both of them overall tony hawks pro skater 2x still maintains the old tony hawks pro skater vibebr br story br br fun factor 10 out of 10 tony hawks pro skater 2x is by far the most funnest game on xbox today i have played tony hawks pro skater 1 and 2 and back then i didnt like them but for some reason tony hawks pro skater 2x is really fun there really isnt much to say except that tony hawks pro skater 2x is by far the best game on xbox today one problem is that if youve already gone through the game once you will play it a couple more times but it will be repetitivebr br replay value 10 out of 10 tony hawks pro skater 2x delivers a high amount of replay value there is a lot of cheats to unlock and a lot of character videos overall tony hawks pro skater 2x has lots of replay value mainly because it is so funbr br best feature you are not obligated to listen to the crappy ingame soundtrack worst feature the custom soundtrack is a bit messed upbr br final statement lots of people have complained in the past that they didnt like tony hawks pro skater 2x because there is nothing new but they should stop complaining because your getting a lot of game for 5000br br graphics 7 out of 10 sound 8 out of 10 control 10 out of 10 game play 10 out of 10 story na fun factor 10 out of
