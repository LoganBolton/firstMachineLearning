this game is very good for the n64 you can skate as tony hawk bob burnquist steve caballero kareem campell eric koston bucky lasek rune glifberg andrew reynolds elissa steamer jamie thomas rodney mullen chad muska and maybe some more skaters the game doesnt have mike v or bam margera dang well anyway the gameplay is awesome the level school ii is a great level with so much to skate in career mode you collect skate get money get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes theres create a skater which is pretty cool i created a skater named butt mulligan a black guy with an afro and a girl board theres park editor some cool premade parks free skate and theres single session where you skate for 2 minutes and get a score you can watch replays which is always cool each skater has 2 styles a and b the graphics arent that good well theyre good for an n64 game i wish i had a controller pack so i could save my data overall this game is awesome i give it an 810 for n64 but with the gba version its just as fun as the n64 version but kinda hard to control i give it a 710 for gba so go out to a place that still sells n64 games and pick up a copy theres also versions for ps1
