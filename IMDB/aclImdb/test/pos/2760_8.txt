graphically it is the same game as the first one just different levels and some new features added for funbr br the ps1 version still has an issue with giving skaters enough air for some ground tricks the dreamcast version which is rarely seen anymore was the best version of the 4 versions xbox eventually came out with a 5th with 2x it had the clearer resolution and the skaters looked better and more detailed the ps1 and n64 could handlebr br the levels are really amazingly done from start to finish like the first one the school was my favorite i enjoyed that level so much not only for the golf cart that would sometimes run you over but for the length thats what i liked about the first two games they dont make these games graphically enhanced they just focused on length of levels which is coolbr br overall just as good as the first one and well worth playing
