i have seen so many bad reviews on supervivientes de los andes that i felt compelled to stand for it or at least ill try first of all of course that it looks dated it was made in the seventies with very low budget but thats part of its charm i like contemporary films but also dig the old ones for what they worth im not the one to feel the urge to only see or like movies with modern treatments and effects besides almost every movie buff likes old fashioned motion pictures who doesnt like films from el santo or plan 9 from outer space no matter its overall quality in the aspect of pace is just a tool for covering again its low cost and i think the constant dialogs are in order of a better character and situations development sure alive has better fx but i wont despise the old one just because of that and i dont feel quite attracted to english speakers in an event involving people from uruguay and for me that gives a plus to supervivientes de los andes its like even if canoa from the seventies and based on a true event too would have a better remake now due to the advance of technology but i think i would stick to that one based on the emotions that offers regardless its production datebr br all of this is based in the impact that had on me because the first time i saw it was on tv and nowadays i dont think it has lost some of its primal force of course its been a long time and ive seen tons of better movies in every aspect of cinema but that doesnt diminish its true value its not a bad film and i place it above alive without hesitation just give it a break
