this movie used to be played constantly on the disney channel when i was a bit younger and i really remember liking it however i didnt have great taste back then not to say that i do now so i cant vouch for my nineyearold self too well the movie was probably a 710 but it had some good music so i gave it an extra point yeah worth watching i know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is  the one that appears when she is in the car crash the song is play a love song by the jaguars and it is very hard to find and obtain in fact this movie is too i cant find it anywhere online or on dvd or on vhs id like to see it again so i can gauge if it was actually a good movie oh well
