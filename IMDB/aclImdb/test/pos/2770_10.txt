im absolutely disgusted this movie isnt being sold all who love this movie should email disney and increase the demand for it theyd eventually have to sell it then id buy copies for everybody i know everything and everybody in this movie did a good job and i havent figured out why disney hasnt put this movie on dvd or on vhs in rental stores at least i havent seen any copies this is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all the kids in the new generation dont get to see it and i think they should it should at least be put back on the channel this movie doesnt deserve a cheap download it deserves the real thing im emailing them now this movie will be on dvd
