susie q is one of those rare and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling its bittersweet but wholesome and its characters are fun and captivating at first i thought the movie would be the clich√© cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes but was i wrong it made me tear up at times and its plot was enticing making me root for the good guys i loved the movie and still remember it today 9 years later i recommend it highly to anyone and the movie is family oriented so you wont have to worry about unsuitable content truly if disney would show more movies that are up to par as susie q it would be the most popular family oriented channel in the world now if only disney would show it just one more time go susie q
