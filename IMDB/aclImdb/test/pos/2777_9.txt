although not the most technically advanced film i have seen this was a fun and enjoyable couple of hours the main characters are sweet and you really get to like them and feel something when susie q has to go but feel good again when she returns as maggiebr br lots of stock dialogue and a contrived plotline but most of all lots of fun
