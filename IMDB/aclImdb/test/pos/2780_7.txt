i forsee many students now signing up for student exchange to barcelona and being disappointed when they dont have quite such an exciting timebr br the movie was enjoyable its of course always a pleasure to see audrey tatoubr br however i have a very strong issue with part of the movie the lesbian roommate tells xavier that women like to be physically dominated which i take issue with and shows him some sort of buttgrabbing move thats guaranteed to get a woman xavier then tries out the butt grab on a shy married friend  who starts out saying no no im married im married but then somehow succumbs to the butt grab all of a sudden shes moaning yes yes and theyre going at it on the benches in parc guell i found this really really offensive furthermore it is very stereotyped how often have we seen scenes where the woman says no but obviously doesnt mean it no means no grabbing buttsphysical domination isnt going to make it right it just totally supported the stereotypical rape mythsbr br i wasnt even sure how to read the next scene where he gloats to the lesbian about how it worked and how next time he was just going to demand suck it slut or something like that did he really think forcing himself onto a woman with no respect for her feelings was the way to gobr br this section really ruined the movie for me
