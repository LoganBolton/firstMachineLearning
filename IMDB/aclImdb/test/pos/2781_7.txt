so we saw this on dvd at our apartment here in paris were all here on an exchange program we all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us i mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clich√©d but still true know what im sayingbr br i think i related more to the quiet guy the italian than xavier because im more of the observer in our group anyway i wish i had a hot roommate like cecile de france she seems like a cool chick in the movie and for real after i saw her hosting the cannes festival last monthbr br now im thinking i wanna go to barcelona next summer after seeing this movie i gotta check out the sequel too which just came out here in france
