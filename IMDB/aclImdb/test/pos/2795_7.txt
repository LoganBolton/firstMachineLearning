spoilers aheadbr br it is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to bebr br such a disappointment i thought this was full of silly clichés andbr br that it basically tried to hard br br to the american guys out there how many of you spend yourbr br time jumping on your girlfriends bed and making monkeybr br sounds to the married girls how many of you have suddenlybr br gone from prudes to nymphos overnightbut not with yourbr br husband to the french would you really ask about someonebr br being à la fac when you know they dont speak french wouldntbr br you use a more common word like université br br i lived in france for a while and i sort of do know and understandbr br europe and i love it but my german roommate and i found thisbr br pretty insulting overall it looked like a movie funded by thebr br european parliament and it tried too hard basically it had allbr br sorts of differences that it tried to tie together not a bad thing inbr br itself but the result is at best awkward but in fact ridiculoustoobr br many clashes that wouldnt really happen then the end of thebr br moviethe last 10 minutesruined all the rest why doesnt xavierbr br talk to the erasmus students he meets back in paris why doesbr br he just walk off why does he just run away from his job is thatbr br freedom and in the end is the new europe supposed to rest onbr br a bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day is this whatbr br its made up of br br besides the acting was pretty horrible i cant believe judithbr br godrèches role and acting why was she made to look likebr br emanuelle béart so much at first i thought xavier was ok butbr br with retrospect i think he was pretty bad br br and thats all really too bad because technically opening creditsbr br scenes when hes asking what papers he needs it was reallybr br good except for sound editing around the british siblings and thebr br soundtrack was great too so the form was good but the contentbr br pretty horrible
