as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different klapisch the director went to the new york film school from 198285 so one would think that he is drawing on this experiencebr br it is interesting how the film balances the message that one should not generalize with the notion that for every stereotype there is some underlying truth for example the italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any wellknown italian stereotype the german character features a few more tried and tested stereotypes but the most stereotypical aspect about the movie is not a character but the central theme of infidelity as a critic observed infidelity is as crucial to french film as class is to british filmbr br both the main character and his girlfriend are played as not entirely likable which i think is deliberate and greatbr br it may be unintentional but some of the nationals have elements that could be taken as a metaphor for their countries perceived role in the eu the british woman has a fling with an american who is an entertainer  like a 1980s us president while the frenchman shows himself as the natural leader when the landlord shows upbr br although europe is not as diverse as new york it is striking that we see only two nonwhite characters one is a chilean woman with indigenous features who despite appearing the age of our main character is not portrayed as a potential object of interest another is a gambianspanish or rather gambiancatalan male who appears a bit inventedbr br one might ask why klapisch chose protagonists who were all from longestablished eu member countries in western europe while these nationalities reflect what he and i would meet as students in the 1980s i believe exchange programs in contemporary europe are much more diverse the erasmus program encompasses some 30 countries from iceland to eastern europe many of which are not eu members i do understand however that the choice of nationalities that are more familiar to the majority of the viewership may have been deemed necessary not to distract from the contrast klapisch wants to create between the peoples europe and the bureaucratic europebr br despite minor gripes a great movie that made me consider going back to europe to live a french friend of mine also an expatriate in the us captured our shared feelings in this piece of contradiction if europe was more like the us i would leave in a heartbeat
