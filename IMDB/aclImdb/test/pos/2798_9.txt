clichéavoidance is one of this films main achievements when you hear a vague outline of the story  erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in barcelona  you predict a collection of eurostereotypes in a farcical tangle pas du tout in fact its a finely judged comedy about a young frenchman xavier trying to make sense of human relationships there are some excellently observed minor roles the arrogant french neurologist the insufferably irrepressible brother of the english girl xaviers forlorn mother and some fine visual humour especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure so what does xavier learn about relationships nothing positive in place of a conventionally happy ending there is a regrettably portentous finale about identity  xavier has become all the friends he made nevertheless this highly enjoyable film deserves its great success i saw it in luxembourg with a mixed euroaudience who enjoyed themselves hugely and even applauded at the end
