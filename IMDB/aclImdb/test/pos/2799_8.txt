the first thing i wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again because id missed lots with all the laughing i did im european and ive studied abroad and ive as good as lived with spanish french italian and german people the film was full of stereotypes which more often than not p people off and reading some of the other reviews i see that it did p people off but this film gets the stereotypes so right i cannot fault it except for maybe the way the french guy became a drunken party animal the english guy was the perfect geezer stereotype drunk annoying insulting but shines through in the end as well as the stereotypes the film also got the emotional aspect of studying abroad correct at first hes shy doesnt know anybody misses home doesnt know his way around as time progresses it becomes his home and when the time comes to leave it is extremely difficult a feeling people can only understand if theyve experienced it i highly recommend this film
