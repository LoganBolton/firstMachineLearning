this film is about xavier an erasmus exchange student from paris who spends one year in barcelona during that time under the influence of all the new impressions he changes and grows upon return he has a much clearer view on his life and finally takes it into his own handsbr br this is one of the most moving films ive ever seen and the reason is probably that ive been in a very similar situation im from germany not from france and for me it was madrid not barcelona but i can assure you that this film is a completely accurate depiction of what an erasmus semester in spain will do to you from what i hear the story is autobiographic and thats probably why it is so realisticbr br let me give some examples mild spoiler alert  xavier shares a flat with other students from italy denmark germany belgium spain and england the flat looks exactly like all the erasmus shared flats ive seen in madrid the main characters are nicely developed and some funny scenes arise from the usual stereotypes the spanish landlord is also 100 accurate  the story of xavier and his girlfriend martine who remained in paris is also very typical about 90 of all relationships break up during an erasmus semester or shortly thereafter  theres a wonderful scene in which xavier tries to convince wendy his flatmate from england who is kind of uncool to go out with all the others he finally succeeds and wendy probably has the night of her lifebr br another great thing in this film is that its truly trilingual the students in the flat speak spanish or english and xavier speaks french with his mother and girlfriend there are subtitles so that everyone can understand whats being said i surely hope that this film never gets dubbed anywherebr br i can imagine that for nonerasmus people this is simply an entertaining comedy but for all my fellow erasmus i can only say this is your film if you havent seen it do so but be prepared for some feelings of nostalgiabr br 1010
