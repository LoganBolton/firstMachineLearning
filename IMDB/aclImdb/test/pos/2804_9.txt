there are a few things in life that we cant experience more than once and the college experience is one of them especially if were living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in paris his exhippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy he falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently when wendys brother wendy is one of the room mates comes from england the film starts to become a lot funnier well anyway xavier starts to see things differently with all his new friends and he probably lives something he will never forget and will change his life forever overall a very nice nostalgic film which becomes even more interesting because of the multinational cast i thought it was very interesting that you could see all these kids from different countries all of them speaking different languages and having different cultures get along with each other and fun i gave it a 9 out of 10 because i left the theatre with a smile on my face and thinking about things i havent done yet while im still in college and would want to do before its too late
