this is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their erasmus year in barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in europe and is an ideal location br br the idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere there are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true the characters could not better represent their different countriesbr br having experienced erasmus on myself during my exchang semester in italy i can say that is movie is incredibly authentic i had many experiences which were similar to the characters except i didnt get laid as often the movie is also quite funny yet not like all those stupid american college moviesbr br finally the movie touches also some important issues like the change from student to work lifebr br 910 i may not be very objective though
