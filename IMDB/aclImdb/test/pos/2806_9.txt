i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film i enjoyed it its a sci fi film if you want a thriller watch another channel this is what the scifi lovers want excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver  ok the special effects werent excellent but what a great cast some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects stop complaining and change the channel if you dont like these type of films films like mission impossible and braveheart are great but these arent sci fi films sci fi produces excellent films like sabretooth  alien hunters etc  well done  keep them churning out
