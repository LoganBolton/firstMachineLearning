surprisingly good made for tv thriller i wasnt expecting too much from this one but im glad to say that this is one of the best of its kind its fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events br br the story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits you cant help but find the movie very interestingbr br the background story of thiessens character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friends step fatherbr br the stranger concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society a serial rapist does not respect society or even his own family and this movie displays the sickness and crime in a perfect way br br my beef with the movie was the non sense situation when thiessens character returns home with her deranged husband after hes released on bail by that moment she knew what he did to his young relative played by the cute allyson hannigan but thats just the typical hollywood scene that provokes more trouble br br the climax scene shows thiessen following her husband when hes about to commit another rape then she calls the cops who come in time just to capture him the ending tells us that the husband was sentenced for 99 years in prison in real life br br the acting is also pretty good and tiffany is great and gorgeous as always the direction is also very good
