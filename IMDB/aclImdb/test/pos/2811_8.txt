hmm is it right to compare tiffani thiessen and markpaul gosselaars post saved by the bell acting of course its not right its ridiculous and is right to give this movie a 10 rating hahahahahaha thats funny this movie wasnt so horrible though better than i expected it to be madefortv movies are often so so so similar so many of them have the same feel to them this one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife whos gotta get the bstard in the end story before it started i had envisioned ms thiessen as a vixen type 90210 seductress but here she was as innocent as kelly kapowski which was refreshing eric close surprised me by playing his part really well with some decent writing the director got a pretty good convincing performance out of him without being at all cheesy all in all it was somewhat interesting definitely better than most tv movies my grade b
