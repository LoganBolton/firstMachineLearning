when i saw the preview for this movie i figured to myself heres another dumb tv movie thats written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera but when i saw it i was surprised tiffanyamber thiessen stars and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man now and agains eric close but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community at first she is blinded by his assurances that he is innocent and her love for him but as time passes she continues to be suspicious of himbr br while this sounds like the setup for another boring melodramatic tvmovie it is really much better than that because the characters are wellacted by thiessen and close and the movies script allows them to be much more complicated and intelligent than youd expect these arent just caricatures or cardboard characters that exist only to move the plot along but real threedimensional people and we find ourselves really caring about them and the movie is smart enough that it is able to provide an exciting involving climax to the story without resorting to dumb action scenes mindless cliches or cheap melodrama instead we share in the main characters inner conflicts and fears and are given a realistic portrayal of how she might be able to resolve them and do the right thingbr br if you get a chance to give this one a look please do so its production values are not exactly topnotch it is a tv movie after all but if you can look past that there is an excellent story to enjoy
