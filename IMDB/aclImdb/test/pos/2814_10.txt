at initial thought the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a gag just for stan lees amusement i expected nothing more than a sleazy animated version of barb wire with low production values much like those short pieces of crap you see on adult swim for short term amusement but can never taken too seriously boy was i wrongbr br stripperella has even better production values than similar marvel toons the animation is very good and it seems that theyve taken this series very seriously and given it a full effort to make it a professional production as possiblebr br the humor is good too on the sexy suggestive and sleazy side it is very similar if not exactly like the simpsons style you may encounter clich√©s and a lot of predictable humor but its still fun nevertheless if this were running today id surely see it regularly its surprisingly one of the better toons ever made
