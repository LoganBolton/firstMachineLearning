okay where to begin did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team shields and arnez bet ya didnt but they turned it down complaining about robot makeup then they faded off into obscurity now this movie has everything a crazed killer robot who thinks hes dirty harry lots of cool robots its funny its touching its the perfect date movie for people who love scifi and romantic comedies its the first robot romantic comedy now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues but there are very minor and can be overlooked i think couples will enjoy this movie and will want to watch it over and over again 9 stars
