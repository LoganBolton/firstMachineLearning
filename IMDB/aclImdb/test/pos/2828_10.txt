the film had no help at all promotionwise if there was an advertising promo on tv or radio i didnt seehear it the only newspaper ad i saw was on its opening weekend a dingy sludgy b  w headshot photo of andy as valcom behind jail bars with headline wanted runaway robot  which was also the poster in front of the 3 movie theaters i saw it at not the nice little color poster on this site with headshots of all the cast and cartoon of crimebuster which really wasnt that goodthey ought to have used an action scene from the film itselfdidnt they have an onset photographer a poster is supposed to help a prospective audience decide if they want to see the moviethere were so many people who couldnt get into their soldout choice and wanted to know what heartbeeps was aboutand that poster didnt help that dingy pic and the only other photos supplied to papers were so indistinguishable in b  w that they were worthless  there was no trailer for the film only a slide at one theater consisting of the word heartbeeps inside a heartshape with a cupids arrow through it and one that was a totally black picture just andy and bernadettes voices saying valcom my pleasure center is malfunctioning so is mine do you think we ought to tell our owners that is no help to people who hadnt been aware of the moviebr br during the filming andy told reporters that he couldnt eat once his plastic lips were applied so he would load up on breakfast and fast during the days shoot i dont know what bernadette did but at the time id wondered why they didnt just sip protein drinks through long straws or eat astronautstyle pur√©ed food via tubes br br philco the baby robot seemed to have been the precurser to short circuits johnnyfive with the same eyes similar face ive been trying to find if they had the same designer but no help i have vintage magazine articles about the film and the design team was immensely proud of their work and were going for a special award for their innovative device to create stenchless smoke for catskills cigars just shortly thereafter lucasfilm did not use that device though they ought to have for return of the jedis scenes with jabba the hut a man created steam around jabba by blowing cigar smoke into a tube joking that all he needed was a glass of brandy and hed be a happy man i thought that lucasfilms using of real tobacco products was insensitive to people who were upset by smoke br br john williams who had then recently succeeded the late great arthur fielder as the maestro of the boston pops  which was then a ratings hitbut it never recovered from fielders death and is now a shadow of its former glory  was using the show to promote films with which he supplied the music hed premiered the empire strikes back score there and you would think hed have helped heartbeeps along by playing a few numbers there the one thing that critics had liked of this film was williams scoreyet it was not available for purchase i saw one vinyl album in 1982 with half heartbeeps half another filmbut it disappeared i only just tonight saw the cd listed on this site and have ordered it if i can ever get a scanner and time to type out the articles id like to create a heartbeeps tribute site i liked the movie and dont care what dissenters say br br the only trouble with the film was that near the end it was messed up logicwise the robots ran away from the factory to have the freedom to decide their own fate make their own choices yet when the junkyard owners tell them that phil needs to go to the factory to have a purpose programmed into him they dont even question it they just glance meaningfully at each other and they go along the way each of the adults lose battery power and die they arent really dead as they are robots and only need new batteries yet it is treated as death with little phil crying over them and rolling away so what was the point of this phil never gets back to the factory and gets a purpose and of course the junkyard owners couldve driven them or given them all battery recharges with backup batteries but the real point was to have this poignant scene where the robots all wore down and phil is left to cry br br at the end valcom is a golf instructor and aquacom is im not sure what catskill is an entertainerwhat else is he supposed to be im not sure that they made it clear the junkyard owners seem to be taking it easy lying on chaise lounges drinking lemonade from phil their bartender vals and aquas new daughter philsiai think the name ismaybe its sylvaniadoesnt seem to be much more than a table lamp br br there is missing footage which is sadfrom photos i surmise that the stuff missing includes a sweet scene where phil is having a christmas with val gifting him with a cars steering wheel aqua is supplying a horn catskill has taken the firefighter helmet to give to phil as we saw and they have christmas trees i dont know if any missing footage supplies better logic or if the writers just couldnt think of a better crisisresolution the film was trimmed to 7275 minutes to pair it with other failing films no other reason than that for a dvd i would love to be in on creating as i want to see interviews with the castcrew and john williams and the merv griffin interview the makingof footage and reediting and restoring the missing footage to make it better
