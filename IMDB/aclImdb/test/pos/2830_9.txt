i would suggest that only the valiant is one of the most original and intriguing and in some ways weird movies that peck ever did daring  surprising and one of his few best westerns no no of course not a western really but a military chronicle which sometimes is better its quite lowbudget but oh very original and striking its one of those treats a true buff sometimes gets movies that no one yet told you they exist you saythat sounds intriguing or interestingand it surpasses your expectationsbr br all in all the script shows a level of maturity unusual for the westernsand it somehow reminded me obliquely of ulzana its also straight nononsense suspensebr br peck looked dashing as a young and tough somewhat gloomy and stoic officer and there are many unexpected toucheslike the blonde babe kissing and flirting with the one shes decided not to marry perhaps a feeling of hers for justice and retribution br br even genrewise only  is so much more than a military taleit is as well an action drama a suspense movie a commando action thrillerthe weirdest combo imaginable a bunch of soldiers in a special mission to counteract and stop a possible natives attack the insane decision not to take all the available troops to the place where those natives could be stoppedbut only a handful of people and this plot never takes a crap routeas most would and did  the interest for humans for people and their reasons and actions never faltersbr br a due word about peck himself he performs with brio and though i usually find his famous movies to be rather insipid and boring in such small outings i find intact all pecks somber and even chilling glamor he was an unusual starbr br i gladly recommend this extraordinary movie
