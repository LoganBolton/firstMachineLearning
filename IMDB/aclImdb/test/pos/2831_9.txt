only the valiant qualifies as a gritty good western this gregory peck cavalry versus the indians oater is a solemn suicide mission without a trace of humor veteran director gordon douglas has helmed a grim harrowing outdoors epic with an ideal cast of tough guys under considerable pressure even lon chaney jr registers superbly as a powerful arab trooper ostensibly colorado territory scenarist edmund h north  a place in the sun scribe harry brown drew their screenplay from western film maker charles marquis warrens taut novel about a group of diehard cavalrymen cut off from any escape route who must prevent murderous redskins from launching a devastating raid against helpless white settlers north and brown stick to warrens novel for the most part and the last minute revelationwhen it seems that there is no way that our heroes can survive another onslaught of native americansis a corker this turnofthecentury tale develops an effective claustrophobic feeling in the second half of the action douglas and company take studio bound sets and make them look convincing during the nocturnal hours the crisp black  white photography of going my way cinematographer lionel linden imbues this western a grim look that accentuates its tension and atmosphere actor michael ansara who later played the chief villain in guns of the magnificent seven is extremely effective in a small role as the hated indian leader tucsosbr br only the valiant opens with overvoice narration by army scout joe harmony this is my stamping ground im a scout for the army had my work cut out for me for a long time behind that pass there is the whole pache nation there is a graphic of the territory with the flinthead mountains stretching across the screen with a bottleneck pass they used to come swarming out of the pass killing everything in sights then we built a fortfort invincible it plugged up the pass just like a cork in a bottle things was fine for a while but them paches is pretty smart one day the bottle blew the cork plum apart we are shown the burning remains of fort invincible with a dead man pinned to a stockade wall and a lance sticking out of his belly captain richard lance gregory peck of 12 oclock high and his men boil in on horseback and capture tucsos michael ansara and joe harmony jeff corey of true grit wants to shoot him on the spot harmony points out tucsos is the fella that started this whole business captain lance intervenes the army doesnt shoot prisoners joe predictably harmony is aghast at this prospect hes no common injun hes just as near to a god as a fella can get if you shoot him now things will quiet down without tucsos stirring them up the rest of those indians will get reasonable just as fast as they can you take him in alive youll have every pache in the territory coming after him we have had three years of this you can stop it now just as predictably captain lance refuses to kill tucsos and lances decision to take the indian back sets things into actionbr br colonel drum herbert heyes of union station surprises lance when he tells him he should have shot tucsos as it is they need to get tucsos to another post everybody from the troopers to joe harmony knows that taking tucsos to fort grant is asking to die the apaches are poised in the mountains and the fort is under strength meantime we are introduced to the daughter of captain eversham cathy eversham barbara payton of kiss tomorrow goodbye and young lieutenant william holloway gig young of they shoot horses dont they and they play a part in a major narrative complication you see lance and holloway both want to marry cathy clearly cathy wants lance colonel drum refuses to let lance take tucsos to fort grant because drum cannot spare lance drum changes the orders and holloway is given the mission at the last minute and everybody is shocked lance has never changed an order furthermore lance saw cathy and holloway kissing in public and everybody thinks lance has reassigned holloway out of jealousy indeed one officer observes that rewriting orders is about a possible as rewriting the bible predictably tucsos escapes and the surviving troopers and harmony bring back a dead hollowaybr br although drum expects a relief column of 400 troopers to arrive any day harmony points out to lance that tucsos will attack tucsos has seen the fort and knows their lack of strength lance requests to take 6 or 7 men of his choosing to man fort invincible and prevent tucsos from assembling a war party the bottleneck in the mountains keeps the indians from riding through in strength instead they must come through oneatatime lance believes his men can thwart them until the relief column arrives drum gives him permission and lance picks the worst men all of them hate him and would willingly kill himbr br only the valiant exemplifies the new breed of military western after world war ii this is not a gungho john ford cavalry western indeed lances own men want to kill him and this foreshadows the attitude of troops during the vietnam war when they fragged their own officers lance bears the onus of allexcept the few who know about the circumstances that brought about the change of orders putting holloway in charge of the detail the black  white photography enhances the dire nature of this western only the valiant amounts to a last stand western until the last minute reprieve reportedly peck hated this movie but then this is not a spitandpolish western in technicolor if anything only the valiant lives up to its warner brothers origins it is small but significant and it is grubby with loads of drama and unsavory characters virtually a dirty dozen western
