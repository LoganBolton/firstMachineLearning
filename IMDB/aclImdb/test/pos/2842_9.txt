a question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film who are the crazy peoplebr br the answer become less clear as the film goes onbr br renee zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and while her voice is still high she is incredibly effective as the shellshocked betty in fact she is so effective i almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believablebr br this is the first time ms zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the taskbr br chris rock  though as foulmouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as wesley he is able to sublimate his manic energy and it only occasionally surfaces and always when it is needed mostbr br there are some interesting allusions the first time you see betty she is dressed almost exactly like dorothy gale from the wizard of oz  then later in the film she is compared to dorothy when she says she has never been out of kansas before at one point the song that doris day was best known for que sera sera is on the soundtrack and then later charlie morgan freeman describes her as having a whole doris day thing going onbr br this is an extremely quirky film with good performances by everyone including the supporting castbr br it has a surprising ending that as contrary as it sounds is actually fairly predictablebr br if for no other reason see this film just to listen to the master of the human voice morgan freeman
