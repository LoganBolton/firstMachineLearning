ive seen nurse betty twice in september 2000 on the international film festival films by the sea in vlissingen the netherlands it impressed me so much that i kept on smiling the whole day after i watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when i took the movie as the final taste of the festival what i knew about nurse betty was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soapoperastar but what i saw was much more than that splendid roles for morgan freeman chris rock ànd renée zellweger a strange mix of romance violence and roadmovie and for all a story that takes other directions every moment you think youre on the track many soapoperalovers will love nurse betty  the movie as well as the character  but they can bring all there nonsoap friends cause they will enjoy the story even more for the hard and humorous lines  freeman and rock  for the cruel scenes the thrilleraspects and for the beautiful pictures and im quite sure that at the end everyone will love nurse betty for her captivating and innocent charm
