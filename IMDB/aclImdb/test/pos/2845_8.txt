nurse betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent uneaseinducing plot with extraordinary characters in the same way i loathed fargo on first viewing then realized i was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow i liked nurse betty a lot more the day after i saw it hard to understand harder to explain as others have said its quite forced in many ways but that seems to be part of what makes it so strikingbr br fair job by greg kinnear great work from morgan freeman although i worry that hes being stereotyped as the principled villain chris rock was good but not a standout rene z is so natural its unnerving  ie unnerving to be natural playing someone not well in the head also liked the sort of abrasive sparkle performance from allison janney in a small partbr br dont go expecting as much of a road movie as you might assume from some synopses there is road but its only barely relevant rated 810
