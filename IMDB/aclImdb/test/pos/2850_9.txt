i was mighty impressed with nurse betty all the way through it has a great ensemble of characters an origional plot and an ending i shoulda seen coming but didnt and pulls at your heart stringsbr br if theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was morgan freeman and chris rocks interaction these two are great and it warms my heart to see rock isnt going to do crappy big hollywood fare like lethal weapon 4 for the rest of his life freeman is as always the man really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore hell kiss the girls was watchable with him in itbr br renee zellwegger does the best she can with her role and kinnear is good as her obessionbr br sweet movie with a nice touch of gratuitous violence in it to satisfy the bloodlust of the male 9 outa 10br br
