if id only seen the poster for nurse betty i probably wouldnt have touched it with a tenfoot pole but after i heard some positive buzz and knowing it made some noise at cannes i decided to give it a try what i got is a truly enjoyable movie based on a very entertaining plot rene zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse betty a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience i also liked morgan freeman no surprise and was pleasantly surprised by foulmouthed comedian chris rock br br the film bounces continuously between comedy drama romance and thriller yet despite this apparent identity crisis it holds up quite well i found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end always waiting for the next twist in the story the entire cast is strong if not spectacular br br my only real complaint is that director neil labute who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark in the company of men relied much too heavily on many cliched hollywood conventions the moodcreating musical effects he crammed down our throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable and he did the standard old lets take some of the minor characters and pair them up at the end in an illogical and unnecessary romance trick just to make absolutely certain everyone goes home with a smile on their face why must directors and writers treat their audiences like idiotsbr br but the movie is still much too enjoyable to be dragged down very far by these annoying irritations in a very subpar year for movies nurse betty ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of 2000 8 out of 10
