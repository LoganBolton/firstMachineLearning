im not sure why i picked for a borrow from mom for nurse betty i think just because i had heard a little bit of this movie but im glad i did nurse betty is an original and clever movie that has humor and a darker side br br this was one of renees first big ones before hitting it major in hollywood i can see why she is an incredible actress the scene where she finally realizes what had happened and shes on the set of her favorite soap opera you can see pain confusion fear and embarrassment on her face just to let you in on the movie she plays betty a shy and insecure woman who stands by her abusive husband shes a waitress and is in love with soap operas especially one where a certain cute doctor dr dave revell when she happens to see her husbands murder accidentally in separate room the murders she notices are two customers she just had morgan freeman and chris rock she then just looses her mind and leaves town after talking to he police and says she needs to find her former fianc√©e dr dave revell so she travels along the country to california to find dr revell and wants a job as a nurse to work with dave shes seen the show so many times somehow shes just awesome at being a nurse when she saves a womans brother despite everyone telling her that she is delusional she just looks at them like as if they were the crazy ones when she meets the actor who plays dave revell georgehis real name thinks shes just a crazy fan trying to get on the show she just looks at him with confusion and believes that he and her belong togetherbr br renee was terrific she was so believable on loosing her mind in the movie she has come such a long way and wither you want to admit it or not shes adorable and a great actressbr br morgan freeman plays one of the assassins charlie who is the father of the two he is so charmed and smittened by betty and while chasing her around the country he becomes almost just infatuated with betty to the point where he almost falls in love with her he and his son wesley must find betty when they find out she was there at the murder scene and could give away their identities when charlie sees betty and catches her finally shes scarred at first but calms down and they know they have a real connection it was a beautifully played scene my opinion is that morgan gave a stronger performance hes just greatbr br a surprisingly decent performance by chris rock the son wesley he is so gunho about just getting the job done in a rush and taking care of business i loved his comedic performance at the end where he and the gang hes holding hostage by gun point are just watching the soap operas together classic nurse betty is a great movie that id recommend for a good laugh and just in all a nice honest little movie i think anyone could enjoybr br 910
