with nurse betty 2000 acclaimed indie filmmaker neil labute in the company of men your friends  neighbors makes his breakthrough into the bigbudgeted bettys 24 million as opposed to companys measly 25000 mainstream realm  and yet remains true to his roots while his cast is now composed of alist hollywood names renee zellweger morgan freeman and standup comedian chris rock his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features proving that he just may be the next big thing nurse betty is one of the darkest comedies to be advertised towards a mainstream audience in years and considering its moderate box office and critical success perhaps moviegoers werent as dumb and brainwashed as we though they were the story follows both figuratively and literally a naive waitress zellweger who has fallen in love from afar with a handsome soap star as good as it getss greg kinnear but is trapped in a loveless marriage to a slimy car dealer aaron eckhart who made his bigscreen debut in company when her husband is gruesomely murdered by two hitmen freeman and rock shes sent into shock and obliviously sets out for hollywood to meet her object of affection  unaware that hes only an actor when freeman and rock discover that the car she took contains 10 kilos of cocaine they hit the road as well and outrageousness ensues fans of labutes previous work might have a hard time figuring out how this could possibly be the same guy who directed in the company of men  a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs who play a practical joke on a deaf coworker  but when you think about it the connection is rather clear in company a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is being ruthlessly taken advantage of in betty a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man shes chasing thinks her genuine adoration is nothing more than a joke some might begin to wonder if labute is really some sort of misogynist himself  considering that his recurring theme involves the downfall of innocent women but personally i think hes coming to the defense of the fair sex and dealing far more harshly with the abusers in his pictures than the abused one of the many charms of this film is that its absurdity is fullfledged most directors when handling a script such as this one would leave the story at two hitmen chasing a woman chasing a dream but labute knows better and has one of the hitmen freeman fall obsessively for betty as well this was an interesting role for freeman to take because it allowed him to play off of his trademark thisisthelasttime character see unforgiven se7en and 1998s stinker hard rain the supporting cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo crispin glover back to the future allison janney and mad about yous kathleen wilhoite the script written by firsttimers john c richards and james flamberg is deliriously overthetop honestly have you ever seen a comedy  or any movie for that matter  in which a man is scalped in his own dining room you could argue that the ending is a little too perfect but its really not worth denying everything thats great about the film for one trivial complaint if nurse betty is any sign of what labute has in store for us next you can bet that ill be lining up for whatever he decides to follow it up withbr br grade a
