my taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and i have a weak spot for crazy horror slasher flicks and see no evil happens to be exactly that and more i think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a wwe film and starring kane wwe might have a big following but its a very very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and sorry folks kind of trailer park sport and those who dont love it haattte it it would make them steer clear of an otherwise typical gory slasher flick that people would come out in droves to see see no evil doesnt break any new horror ground its exactly play by play typical horror with some over the top horrific bloody scenes that honestly make your screen crawl they really drive it home and go for gratuitous violence just cause there is no psychological aspect exactly although being chased by this monster has some fear elements to itbr br kane the wrestler also known as glen jacobs plays religiously and physically tortured man jacob goodnight hes the ultimate cross between leatherface and jason voorhees hes not an original killer and even his kills dont really go for the unique or original with the major exception of choking a girl to death by forcing her to swallower her cell phoneyeeeeah he does a good job and the man is legitimately enormous he stands at 7 feet tall and without any special effects is monstrous tiffany lamb penny mcnamee samantha noble michael j pagan luke pegler christina vidal rachael taylor all play the typical group of think they are invincible partying teens who will unwillingly become victim to the serial killer the story is that in exchange for a month off their detention sentence for petty crimes ranging from theft to drug possession they are sent to an old hotel to do community service  by fixing it up turns out a serial killer lives upstairs and hes removing his victims eyes to cleanse them of their sins luke pegler stands out as a scum bag who in the end becomes a hero of sorts even saving his exgirlfriend who he used to beat up on the rest of them all play their perspective roles quite well but it isnt a great stretch of acting abilitybr br sadly porn directoryes porngregory dark does a good job putting together the modern day slasher flick he even goes into a bit of history with the killer and although his back story is not unique either in fact its a little stale its still interesting enough and in the few shots where the film goer is actually seeing through the killers eyes its interesting to hear the voices and see things distorted like he does he throws in the obligatory soft core nude shot and the grotesque blood soaked scenes and turns everything up a notch it fits nicely and for a horror fan like myself its entertaining kanes serial killer is horrifying and he stalks them all down with brutal intelligence and a silent horror the film is being panned and crapped on and i dont blame anyone because its pretty crappy but isnt that the point its a horror film and i thought it was exactly what it should be it made me jump it made me cringe it even made me turn away at several partsimpressive by any standards its entertaining with a decent story and plenty of set up to serialize see no evil until the 15th installment if they wanted to and i say bring it on its true the film is full of plot holes laughable details but the deadly gore and horror over rides it all it all comes down to do you love horror films really love them if yes then youll think this is a terrific slasherif notyoull hate itplain and simple 8510
