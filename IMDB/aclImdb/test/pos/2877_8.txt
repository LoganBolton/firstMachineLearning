so the wwe has done it they have poured over into filmtheir first one being see no evil starring their very own kane i caught this movie and went in not expecting it to be a great filmit just seemed to clich√© and looked like nothing new to my surprise it actually wasnt half bad a viewer stated above that it is good bhorror movie fun and honestly thats the best way to describe it now the question i was asking myself was how was kane going to hold upwell lets just say he made an absolute bad ass out of the jacob goodnight character he sold the role really well and really did look menacing but what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs around 320 in solid muscle the acting was decent and the story was nothing new of course but we all know that the directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel backdrop really looked dilapidated and well done considering this was directed by a porn movie director i was quite surprised id recommend this movie if youre looking for mindless gore and killing and just some overall fun think of this movie as a modern day latter friday the 13th film and save room for the ending too cuz its a good one and stick around after the credits too
