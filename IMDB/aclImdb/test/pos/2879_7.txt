this ladies and gentlemen is truly a modern bmovie the dialog is stilted and delivered with wooden rigidity the premise is predictable there are a few decent twists and characters remain 2d for most of it and yet there is a certaincharm wwe wrestler kane brings to life the sick twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos though it is somewhat like his character that hes been playing around ten years and so ill find it quite amusing when people say its not much of a reach for him but glen jacobs is apparently quite the nice guy so actually it is in any event hes cast perfectly as the hulking brute and the deaths are suitably over the top jason would be proud but i heard at least four applause breaks for four different kills scenes frankly go into this movie thinking that youll have some fun and a gorefest oh it is quite the gorefest the rrating is richly deserved and i actually got a little nauseous during some of the more graphic times in any event a very very fun but fairly bad movie
