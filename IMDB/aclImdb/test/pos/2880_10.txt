the problem with other actors cast in the rôle of dorian gray is that they either looked too old for the part hurd hatfield helmut berger josh duhamel david gallagher ben barnes or that they were unable to pull off the english aristocratic manner without being stilted dorian is the perpetual 19yearold or so all milky skin and honeyd locks as described by wilde so the challenge is finding an actor that has the maturity and range for the part ie who can portray the naivité callousness and manipulativeness but at the same time looks like someone in his late teens and peter firth pulls it all off in this excellent british tv adaptationbr br gielgud as henry wotton while considerably older than what wilde had in mind does wonders with his sceneswildes aphorisms have never sounded so natural and unforced especially george sanders in the 1945 version was pretty feeble by comparison and his costume didnt fitbr br finally jeremy bratt plays basil as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay of the trio again a fitting interpretation in general the film includes enough gay subtext without turning dorian himself gayhes all things to all people and supposedly theres no drug or sexual perversion he hasnt tried in the 18 years covered by the story but that makes him more narcist than homosexual he seems to equally wreak havoc on both sexes here as he should according to the novelbr br of course the budget of this production was not very large so everything feels a little stagey particularly dorians encounter with sybils brother suffers from the obvious studio look also the final shot of dorian a puppet i suppose in his white toadlike makeup is more hilarious than convincing and basils death scene is inadvertently funny also as far as i recall basil should have been killed seated at the tablebr br but all in all this is a very worthy adaptation im sure wilde would have liked it the only thing missing is the sensual side not so much sex scenes but wildes decadent world of fragrant flowers luxurious cloths and precious gems isnt really explored here ie the aestheticism is completely missing but like i claudius the excellent acting makes one easily forget these shortcomings of production values
