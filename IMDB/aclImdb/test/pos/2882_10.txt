i will always think of mr firth as dorian gray if i live to be 100br br perfectly acted and directed bringing oscar wildes insight wit and humor alive with an absolute and utter perfection unusual in televisionbr br more proof that the bbc more than makes up in talent what it doesnt always have in moneybr br a must have for all wilde fansand indeed for everyone else inspired and perfected every one of the actors looked exactly right for the role and every shot was well donebr br by the end i found that i loved every single character in a way that no other movie of the type had ever inspired watch it then try to watch another version its just not the same is it
