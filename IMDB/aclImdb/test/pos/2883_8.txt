i enjoyed this film and after it finished it still makes you think about it i believe jeremy brett is brilliant in this role although his death acting was a little over the top but as its jeremy brett i didnt mindbr br this is a good piece of drama and does follow oscar wildes novel very closely if you enjoy this film then i recommend you also watch an ideal husband with jeremy brett as lord goringbr br this film gives a great insight into oscar wildes way of thinkingand while watching it the viewer is reminded of how in a way dorian grey is lord alfred bosie douglas and basil halward is oscar wilde
