in dramatising wildes novel john osborne has condensed events eliminated a number of characters and generally implied rather than shown dorians essential wickedness if you want a more explicit rendering see the 1945 film wilde and robert louis stevenson lived in about the same time frame but were certainly vastly different men and writers this story really treats of a theme similar to stevensons dr jekyll and mr hyde but note that wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy whereas rls took the scientific route both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil with evil winning in the endbr br the actors in this bbc movie take a different route too from those in the 1945 film john gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as george sanders in his role really projecting wilde himself but with a subtle difference youll suspect that sanders really believed what he was saying but gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes peter firth too shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion but then we dont get to see as many of his escapades as hurd hatfield had a chance to displaybr br its a very good production with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel if not all of its ramifications
