onstage john osbornes adaptation of picture of dorian gray is a fine tribute to oscar wildes talents as both novelist and playwrighton screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play one being an important scene between basil and henry showing that time has passedthe acting however is brilliant sir john gielgud returns to his wilde roots as lord henryand although about a decade too old for the rolehe totally becomes the enigmaticlife loving cad and cynic that wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella jeremy brett is also strongoffering a touching portrait of the anguished artist basil hallwardpeter firthwhile not originally my vision of dorian handles the role with style and graceand later with a convincing strain of cruelty the supporting cast is equally fine gielguds former importance of being earnest costar gwen francondavies plays his philanthropic aunt agatha with dignity and judi bowker makes a touching sybil vane the witpathos and tension of wildes work have been remarkably transferred to the screen my only other qualm is with the hair styles many of them seemed out of placelooking more like 1970s versions of victorian hairdos rather than the actual style overall howeverthe acting and writing elevates this production to a high level of small screen excellence
