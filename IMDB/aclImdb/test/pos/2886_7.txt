this is a great concert which featured the best songs of the bands 30 year career lee lifeson and peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show that being said i think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console andor through the miking process this is not the fault of the boys however they even mentioned that the show was setup lastminute so the band and their crew obviously did their best they just shouldnt have put the show out for public consumption neils snare sounds distant and geddys bass has good harmonic content but no bottom end at all they should have held out on this concert and waited for a better occasion only buy this dvd if you are a hardcore rushian the quality is lacking in the audio department
