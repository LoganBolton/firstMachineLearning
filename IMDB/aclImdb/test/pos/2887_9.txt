admittedly alex has become a little podgey but they are still for me the greatest rock trio ever i wholeheartedly recommend this dvd to any fanbr br i was very disappointed that they canceled their planned recent munich gig logistics and regret not making an effort to see them elsewhere the dvd is a small consolation  the greatest incentive to acquire a proper dvd playback setupbr br naive perhaps but i still dont understand the significance of the tumbledriers onstage i would be grateful for any clarificationbr br cheers iain
