after searching for 6 months i finally found this dvd all i can say is it was damn well worth the wait rush in rio may very well be the greatest rock dvd in existence im not joking its incredible all the fuss about the sound being crappy is true however it doesnt make the concert unwatchable i find it makes you feel like youre actually in rio watching the concert from the audience thats one of the reasons i love this dvd it makes you feel like youre actually there also geddy alex and neil have never been in better form geddys vocals are flawless alexs guitar playing is still incredible and neil  absolutely no words to say the camera work on this concert was very good i must say they gave us a good look at everything that was going on onstage and in the audience kudos to the cameramen anyways enough of my raving go watch rush in rio for yourself you will be amazed i guarantee itbr br 1010
