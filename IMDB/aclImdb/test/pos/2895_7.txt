a long overdue concert release rushinrio dvd is both compelling and disappointing this slick twodisc set shows rush at their finest after 30 years of honing their unique sound its great to have this record of one of the most talented rock bands everbr br the concert features over two dozen songs a documentary and three songs that feature multiangle viewing packaged in a bifold holder with sleeve and a small insert its priced very well for the amount of material it containsbr br im a rush fan of the late seventies to early eighties period and this dvd comes through big with half of the show highlighting songs from that era i wont list the songs in case you want to be surprised if you attended the vapor trails tour then youll know what theyll be playingbr br playing in rio to their biggest crowd ever rush is a huge crowd pleaser here in fact that was one of the first things i noticed that was peculiar about this show throughout most of this two hour concert you hear and see the crowd actively chanting and dancing wildly to the music at first its heartening to see the fans give rush a well deserved response but after several songs i was ready to hear and see more of the band and less of the crowd this is in no way a slam of the crowd of rio more power to them its a critique of the final editing of the dvdbr br which brings me to my second and main reason i hate it the video editing is terrible in my opinion save for the multiangle view bonus cuts the entire show is a frenzy of visual chaos its like the director wanted to see how spastic he could make it i count changing camera angles on average between every one and four seconds constantly after about three or four songs my head and eyes were ready for a break which is too bad because i would have liked to have sat through the whole show like i was able to at the concert last year maybe this fastcut editing is the latest craze for concert dvds but i really think its an annoyance and detraction from the overall experience as stated before i wouldnt mind it for a song or two but the whole visual aspect of this disc is hurried or rushed its really ironic because all the previous concert clips ive seen of rush mainly from moving pictures are strictly straightfilmed with little switching back and forth its almost boring visually speaking this dvd has taken it to the other extreme i know a lot of dyedinthewool rush fans will vehemently disagree with my statements but thats just my impression of itbr br the bottom line if youre a rush fan youll buy this dvd regardless of my review or any other i still would have bought it after i had read my review just dont get expect a normal concert who knows the things mentioned above might not bother you
