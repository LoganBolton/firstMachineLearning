personally i regard the egyptian in an extremely favourable lightbr br it was introduced to me by a wellknown australian movie commenter  critic named bill who was renowned for his insight  broad vision of people  places  particularly of films this movie fitted the bill perfectly  i came to appreciate his commentary  enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as i watched it as i was literally drawn into it minute by minute beyond his introductory comments on my initial viewing many years agobr br to me it was propelled layer upon layer within half an hour into an intriguing  fascinating production yes i am aware of its flaws but it was so enticing  the young man of idealism learning from  inspired by his father  the peasant treated like rubbish in his suffering  the opportunistic friend however flawed but nonetheless loved by his friend the central character sinute  and to be sure a flawed hero too like so many across humanity of all societies  across all timebut lovable  worthy of love too yes i believe in a christian god but too i acknowledge the rights  respect that should be due any human being of good heart who would not or will not disrespect the rights of his fellowman without just cause as such i endorse this film  its presentation of a man of good heart  conviction in his belief in the sungod he was devoted to such people will always be welcome in my world vision and hopefully in many more beyondbr br so too the drama in the ensuing movie i have watched often as surely as it has touched my heart  soul as surely as it seems to have infuriated critics in its era it is captivating watching the struggles  grief  loves of sinute the physician when i watch it again i am always reminded of my friend in heart bill the film critic who dared to oppose all the critics long ago who rubbished it he added criticism of too many critics  that they make statues to honour stars on the screen or in history but they do not make statues to honour critics and beyond all this i am reminded with each viewing of a superb  touching spectacle of a beautiful  wellpresented drama that was not just relevant to the 1950s or some bygone era it was meant for you  me across time  place to every man  woman  child  to their personal aspirations for love  freedom  overcoming obstacles to misunderstanding  gross injustice  tragedy appealing to those of simple faith of many religions that it seems too many regard as cause for war take a night off from invitations or unjust violence from bigotry  judgemental attacks on others injustly executed  consider the merits of this offering not to the sun god or to power that proves time  again to be so transcient  let this outstanding movie wash over you like waves onto a beach like the passing hands of time  like life was meant to be and maybe you will find yourself carried into its world of possibilities lost offerings no more 99 out of 10
