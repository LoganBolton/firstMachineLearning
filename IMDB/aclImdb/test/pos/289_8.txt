i have to admit that i had low expectations for this movie but i was surprised to find it entertaining interesting and funny its an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror film there were moments that made my hairs stand up even better though were the highly amusing occasionally hysterical comedic moments in the film youll know which ones im talking about there also are a few great special effects and the humor and the special effects arent necessarily separatebr br the acting on the whole is very goodway better than a typical low budget horror film the lead jackie in particular and many of the smaller supporting roles like the lawyer the couple living next door the pizza man are well acted if they hadnt been the film wouldnt have kept my interest and i would have lost my belief in the story this is a good interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth a rental
