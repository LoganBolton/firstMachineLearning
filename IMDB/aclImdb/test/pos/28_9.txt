a fantastic cinema experience i really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out there is nothing to add except that is a terrible shame that sir albert finney still isnt accepted by the ampas american academy after roles in such films as tom jones murder on the orient express under the volcano to name only few  for these he was nominated for the oscar the dresser is arguably his highlight yetbr br i know oscars are just popularity contest but if americans like british actors and actresses and the oscar goes to jeremy irons daniel daylewis anthony hopkins emma thompson glenda jackson etc  and they all deserved the award why they always left sir finney with empty handsbr br on the other hand they gave it to john wayne and marisa tomei in cousin vinny i dont know should i laugh or crybr br if you have seen the two leads in the dresser you wont forget what is the art of acting watch this film and enjoy i recommend it to everyone who loves artbr br i give 910 for this excellent film 1 point missing for noncinematic material after all it is just a theaterbr br note my criteria is much stronger than this on imdb 10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that shouldcould last forever
