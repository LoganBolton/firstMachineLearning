ill bet i watch this film 4 or 5 times a year and will do so more often now that the hollyweird moguls have seen fit to put it on dvd because its a classic with a capital c this film is timeless how can people pay 1000 nowadays to see the junk that comes out of hollyweird with movies like the egyptian the ten commandments ben hur captain newman md on tape dvd and cable movie channels i could go on forever but this film is so great and for a relative unknown edmund purdom carries the movie like atlas carried the world the story is wonderful the acting is firstrate and the graphics at the end are so powerful you sit in your seat for a few minutes just trying to let the words sink in really a knockout of a film id give this one 15 stars if theyd let me they dont make them like this anymore but they should
