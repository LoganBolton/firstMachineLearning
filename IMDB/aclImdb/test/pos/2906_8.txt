i was on my way out one morning when i was checking something on the tv and came across this film i dont ever remember seeing this or hearing of it what a fun and interesting one to watch well my meeting was pushed back because i couldnt get out of this film it had some real interesting things in it that marked its time in history and some fun things that they dont have people do in todays film because its not pretty well there was a lot of realism in it the acting was good for a 1954 film subtle and genuine actions on the part of the characters that had me watching what they were going to do next that is why i ended up watching it i dont know why they dont show it more often i would rather watch this than some films they play more than necessary for history buffs people who like period films and those that are in the film appreciation groups will like this one the egyptian has a variety of flavors dealing with a lot of things to look at in human nature that has not changed since its time what does that say about us those that dont like movies that take their time to unfold and tell a good storyare not into filmbr br i havent had the time to rent it if it is available but if i get a chance to see it again i would probably vote it a 10
