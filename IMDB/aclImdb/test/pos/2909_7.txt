one cannot help but be impressed with the intelligence and scale of this film and simultaneously disappointed by the lost opportunitiesbr br i found the script to be excellent and the vocal talent of edmund purdom quite impressive however as an artifact of its time the film suffers from too many hollywoodisms especially poor casting too much lushness of the sets and too much pretentiousness edmund purdom who plays the title character is so obviously awkward with physical acting i suspect he had primarily been in shakespearean theater before thisbr br so if movie people are reading this i propose this as an excellent candidate for a remake especially if you cast real egyptians as egyptians
