i had the pleasure to view this film when i was 10 years oldhaving an existing interest in egyptology i know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming but over all this is the best film to date with the look of the 18th dynastybr br the film only approximates mika walteris the egyptian in plot a good portion of the text never made it to film as we have to consider the running lengthbr br the music score by b hermann and alfred newman is beautiful performances as follows the late edmond purdom gave an excellent performance as an orphaned child adopted by parents past their child bearing years he states that he keeps to himselfhas the best education available and lets face it is a rather emotionally distant person given his upbringing and high intellectbr br jean simmons is fine as a humble tavern maid honest loving and sincere bella darvi people complained about her accent well she is a babylonian it is not that apparent in the film as to why sinhue is so insanely obsessed with nefer nefer nefer her correct name in the book sinhue is enjoying her carnal fruits and gets his revenge early in the plot by leaving nefer nefer nefers drugged body with the house of the deads  workersbr br gene tierney as baketaten is brilliant when she tells sinhue that he is pharoah she looks like she could devour him in his weakness she is intense brilliant and coldly beautifulbr br michael wilding is heartbreakingly tragic in his mission to bring all people to know his one god i believe that we are viewing ankhnaten thru the lens of egyptologist a weigall a view at the time that had a premessiah feeling about ankhnatens vocation did his monotheism influence the jewish people note psalm 104 and other egyption imagery in the psalmsbr br mr peter ustinov provided the alter ego to sinhue he is street wise and cunning a survivor excellent acting as alwaysbr br mature never thought much of his acting personally his horemheb is fine as an ambitious super patriot who ultimately has sinhue murder more than one person in his quest for power walteris bookbr br i felt that the ending to the egyptian was confusing as sinhues personality changes too easily he has a living son toth dies in the novel power is handed to him through is half sister baketaten he world savvy now and has a grip on international affairs so he became enlightened he could have modified the amon priesthood as he was capablebr br but no sinhue gives everything up everything including his sons future to become a ragged beggar preaching monotheistic lovebr br this change was too immediate and the major flaw in the scriptbr br again the look of the filmcolour most of the costumesnefer nefer nefers gold dress was too over the top as she is more richly dressed than the royal family music is beautifulbr br i will watch this film again easilybr br ps i know that you porbably know that horemheb did not directly succceed ankhnaten but i could not resist stating this fact
