this is not what one would term a happy tale the titled leading character edmund purdom as the egyptian does not get the gal  although he does  evidently get the last word the otherwise principal tragic figure michael wilding as the politically myopic pharaoh ends up tragically and the wrong guy  even if it is victor mature winds up winningall the marbles peter ustinov possibly had gotten the best part kafka and arguably may have stolen some if not most of the movie except for topbilled jean simmons as the somewhat brighterthanaverage barmaid merit whom just possibly has more on the ball  intellectually and spiritually than all of the rest of them put togetherbr br the brooding and pessimistic sinuhe the physician thats purdom is portrayed as a dark cynical tortured soul whom spends the entire plot  his lifetime seeking the meaning of life btw and to paraphrase john lennon life is what happens while youre making other plans pardon the lack of philosophical depth in the prior parenthetic comment but eventually the plot unfolds to reveal just that  br br and speaking philosophically as if things arent morose and negative enough john carradine as the unnamed grave robber popsup in a cameo role in the middle of the flick espousing that life basically is meaningless and is only worth living as a poor alternative to the eventual ultimate disappointmentbr br so here we are over 200 words in and i havent really had a kind word so why the heck did i rate it so high  well there is a lot of shakespherian tragedy and bunch of moral worth in it theres ethical contrasts true friendships true  unrequited almost love and  despite limitations of 50s production capabilities it is very well sound staged pleasing both the eye and ear and very wellevenly paced  the acting is for the most part uniformly very good  given its a 50s costume drama and the interactions are believable right down to the characters fatal flaws  which abound and in that doing justice to the best of greek tragedybr br there is some redemption sinuhe does discover and embrace his son  played by tommy retigg whom despite ustinovs best efforts really needed lassie to pull it off a couple of other misguided souls get their just desserts  the foreign fleshpot nefer bella darvi  apparently in egypt on a carnal exploitation workstudy visa whom earlier cruelly even mercilessly spurned sinuhe and the dykeish princess baketamon gene tierney as pharoah wildings sister whom knew a deep dark secret about sinuhes ancestry and then tried to use it to set him against his friend her brother the pharaoh  nice people huhbr br purdoms performance is actually something to behold he carries off the dirge well enough that somewhere before the end of the pix you want to smack him across the puss grab him by the lapels and say look dummy pull yourself together the glass aint half empty its half full  and then finding that youre personally disappointed in horemheb  truly sinuhes best friend victor mature as pharoahs top soldier for himself having that flaw in his character that prevents him succeeding at doing something positivebr br i wonder if the secret to the whole movie is that it very quickly achieves and then sustains the necessary suspension of disbelief and early on gets you understanding and worrying about the characters caring to the point that you really feel sorry for them and their missed chances at happiness a happiness that otherwise wasnt all that far from their graspbr br cant understand why this one isnt already out on dvd and hope that gets corrected soon
