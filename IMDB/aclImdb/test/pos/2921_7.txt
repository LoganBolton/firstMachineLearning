maybe its just a personal affection for this screen version of the mika waltari novel or a fondness for things egyptian i grew up loving to visit the mummies in bostons museum of fine arts but i think maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film the production values are great regarding color and cinematography and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity much of it from the novel im sure purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role but one can accept this as part of sinuhes character victor mature is well victor mature peter ustinov is a delight to watch in this type of role which he always did so well and so wittily bella darvis performance as nefer is classically camp and i find even michael wildings rather dry portrayal of akenaten to have its own appealbr br the historical oddity of akenatens monotheism a brief detour in ancient egypts theological history is interesting as is akenaten himself and well worth reading about the religious wars portrayed here have a basis in factbr br an interesting footnote regarding darvi whose birth name was bayla wegier she was a polish emigre who producer darryl zanuck and his wife violet took under their wing i believe they may even have adopted her her screen name darvi is formed from zannucks and his wifes first names she continued her acting career in france but never achieved great success and after a rather unhappy life died at her own hand in 1971br br altogether this is an interesting film and enjoyable to watch for the visual values alone american movie classics shows this occasionally in letterbox which is essential to capturing the scope and sweep of the story
