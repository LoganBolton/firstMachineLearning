this is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the season 11 episodes with the exception of the imaginationland trilogy this is the one that made laugh the most definitely is my favourite so far of season 11 so basically cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the tourettes syndrome and a new idea comes to cartman you can imagine now cartman has tourettes syndrome and is great since kyle once he knows about this is like hes faking cartman is certainly on fire saying whatever he wants to the teachers to the principal to anybody on the other hand we have kyle who now is the intolerant one basically for saying that cartman was faking he was taken to meet children with tourettes syndrome just to let him see that tourettes syndrome is for real and is great since kyle is like well maybe someone is faking to have tourettes for fun in short kyle could not explain that cartman was faking probably my favourite scene of this episode is when cartman is with kyles family but right after this scene another kid fins that cartman is simply faking the kid with tourettes who was at the toy store cartman basically said to that kid this isnt having tourettes awesome but to be saying whatever he wants and be for everybody a brave boy is sort of just the beginning for cartman his master plan going on national tv to say anything he wants people will call it brilliant tv theyll probably give me an emmy fantastic in this episode the word s is used 26 times and certainly thats not all south park won an emmy like a month or so before this episode aired but here theres a twist cartman basically removed all the bricks of the wall he says now everything without thinking so we hear from cartman that he wet his bed last night now is not fun for cartman and he is like i cant control what i say and certainly the person who was with him is like well of course you cant control what you say you have tourettes so cartman is like my tourettes has gotten worse before i just blurted out cool stuff about jews being lame and stuff but now its gotten really bad there is also stuff about chris hansen and to catch a predator actually what happened with a pervert here happens with a lot more perverts kyle and thomas were behind that to stop cartman kyle ends being cartmans saviour fantasticbr br tsa voices concern over south park october 3rd episode br br on wednesday october 3 the cable network comedy central will air an episode of the animated series south park in which one of the young characters cartman gets tourette syndrome given the nature of this program we fully expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with ts and garner numerous calls and emails from our members and the ts communitybr br we have already taken some preemptive strikes such as requesting that comedy central air our public service announcement featuring comedian richard lewis during or after the show in addition once the episode airs and we are able to see exactly how ts is portrayed we will be able to respond with specific issues and problems we have with the show to the writersbr br we are actually surprised it took the creators so long to use ts as comedy fodder in this program since no disability illness or controversial topic is off limits to them said judit ungar president tsabr br we always see portrayals of ts good and bad as an opportunity for awareness and education and a show of this magnitude and popularity is certainly no exception and provides a way for tsa to spread factual information about the disorder said tracy colletti flynn manager of public relations and communications tsabr br we will be posting an official statement on this site with tsas reaction to the program after the show airsbr br tsa responds to south park episode br br unfortunately as has been the case with far too many media portrayals of people with tourette syndrome ts the season opener of south park le petit tourette 10307 served to perpetuate even further the outright myth that most of those affected by ts have involuntary outbursts of foul language in point of fact fully 8590 of people with ts never experience this tragically socially stigmatizing symptom medically termed coprolalia for viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder the misleading take away message couldnt have been clearer Â– unless you curse you dont have ts br br despite our preairing trepidations we do concede that the episode was surprisingly well researched the highly exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia notwithstanding for the attentive viewer there was a surprising amount of accurate information conveyed the scripted input from parents a neurologist peers and the therapy session with the ts childrens support group all served as a clever device for providing these facts to the public no doubt this south park episode did generate increased national awareness about ts nevertheless we are very concerned that school children with ts will be mocked and even bullied by insensitive peers who may have seen the program said judit ungar tsa president we realize that for over a decade the writers satirical parodies have spared no group be they celebrities the disabled or political figures the fact that ts was the subject of a popular tv show attests to the fact that the public is so much more aware of the disorder obviously this increased awareness weve worked too hard to accomplish can at times prove to be a doubleedged sword br br tsa contacted the programs executives prior to the airing and we will be in touch with them again perhaps well succeed in turning this into an opportunity for positive ts awareness
