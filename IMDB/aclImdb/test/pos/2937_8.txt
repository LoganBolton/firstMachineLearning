yes i watch this show because my girlfriend watches it of course well at least thats what i tell my friends but as nobody here ever known me i can say this i love it thats excellent trash tv br br first theres the panel tyra herself who doesnt miss a single opportunity to talk about herself yet she is to be taken seriously as she is quite the businesswoman then theres jay manuel a sober gay guy very serious and amazingly professional and miss jay an extroverted one queen of the catwalk and a damn funny guy and nigel selfstyled as the only man on the panelbr br second the show is an indepth look at a shallow industry and weve got to give it to the producers for showing us the inside view which can be informative as well as entertainingbr br finally the edition is great there is just the right mix of everything the girls living together in the egohouse their impressions on sets the competitions themselves and the judging all of this slides smoothly with just the right beat there are no lenghtsbr br of course there must be other factors that led to eliminations that we dont see in the shows the panel is made up of capricious divas extroverted and quick on the bitching woe to those who offends them but that being said as long as one contestant does not step on their toes their judgment is usually fair  i thinkbr br so give your brain a break if you cant beat them join them and have a good time watching this bit of reality tv with your loved ones it will make crave for more somehow
