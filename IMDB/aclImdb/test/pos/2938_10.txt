as if reality shows like american idol werent enough in which judges like simon cowell shoot razorsharp barbs to contestants trying to make their mark on the music world  barbs that many a time has reduced even outstanding singers to tears after what was deemed a bad performance now americas next top model has for the past three years invaded the boob tube with its own version of looking for the next big thing in a business that values superficiality concepts of beauty and body dysmorphiabr br a concept created by tyra banks who is also a judge in the show it gathers some fifteen contestants from all walks of life and has them submit themselves to innumerable tasks in which they must prove their talent in front of the camera and subject themselves not only to the now departed janice dickinson selfdubbed americans first supermodel but the equally catty jay manuel and nore marin who may at one point focus on one girl not performing well and blithely rip her to shreds like it was bad morning coffee like in many other realitybased shows each week one contestant is voted off and must pack her bags and immediately leave a thing that they are reminded by tyra at every turn of course there is the bitchy tension between several of the more typea females female bonding tears dramatic swells of music in key moments and some truly breathtaking pictures that transform erstwhile ordinary pretty girls into unattainable goddessesbr br ill have to admit the show is a guilty pleasure maybe its the state of mind im in but i kept wondering where the vomitorium was in cases when the already thin girls would need to hurl to make the cut and look the way the judges and photographers and many fickle designers would feel was correct for the moment even so its drawn me in despite my previous paragraph possibly because ive always had an interest in the fashion world and have always loved watching stunning women being made even more unworldly with make up and perfect lighting but i wonder where are they going with these increasingly difficult photo shoots its as if they were competing with fear factor shoots that look like reenactments of fight scenes in crouching tiger hidden dragon shoots where the models have to pose underwater or in almost impossible situations whats next posing while tied to train tracks as an oncoming amtrak roars upon them at 70 miles an hour or a shoot where they are underwater chained trying to set themselves free in record time while at the same time looking smashing in chiffon and never ever forgetting to smile their pearly whites at that camera how about a pit and the pendulum version of a photo shootbr br in one thing the show has to be given some kudos and its in a way akin to american idol with this im probably going to justify the harshness of both shows and its abrasive judges  and essentially go against my initial paragraph americas next top model is a show that is an extended audition like american idol and in it the girls will get the sort of test treatment they will receive in the real world where prospective designers and photographers as monstrously fickle as they can be will crush them to bits at the drop of a hat if they cant sell themselves the way theyre expected to and where one is asked to leave another will supplant her with the necessary requirements which makes it a wonder that any girl would want to get into such a difficult media but thats what dreams are made ofbr br going into its fifth season its been a major disappointment with the departure of janice dickinson during her run she was a pretty tough barometer as to how the girls should walk talk emote express themselves and ultimately present themselves as a walking living product that sells with the cold addition of twiggy i wonder where it will go from here  twiggy just cant replace the overthetop temperament of dickinson so with janices absence the show has lost some of its edge and may even have signaled its slow demise but in the meantime its still a catchy pleasure to watch mindless entertainment on weeknights if at all for the gorgeous visuals if at all its the show that launched adrienne curry into the spotlight curry has made a name for herself due to facts that have less to do with modeling as much as her theatric loveaffair with one time child actor christopher knight in their very own reality soap opera
