americas next top model is a great reality show in every sense it has a great hostess has great guests a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadnt achieved yet present a true americas next top model of course this is not something easy to do therefore usa and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel worldbr br but its obvious that its intention is not to present the americas next top model but yes the americas next pop model the show gets together a bunch of models without any experience with different personalities and big personal professional and financial problems giving them a chance for bringing to life a dream or to make their lives something worthy its obvious that tyra banks uses all that for her advantage she gives the dream but in exchange for that she gains audience and more popularity anyway she deserves it because she is intelligent and if i might say that a pioneer to this kind of show tyra also is a great observer and knows how to give based opinions differing herself of other models and hostess of foreign versions of the next top model franchise in brazil as an example fernanda motta is its hostess and onceuponatimetop model she doesnt have even 110 of tyras professional skills which keeps tyra banks on the top tyra have professional and personal knowledge about what she says and shes a great mentor because she not only criticizes but she points the mistake and teaches the right way with wisdombr br the show doesnt suffer from big problems it does and fulfills what it promises during the cycles the models chosen to work on the show in fact are not the best unknown models of entire country because tyra banks bets with the difference and she is right because she and also good part of her audience believes that its time for the modeling world to change some straight parameters during the cycles she and her team really makes fair deliberations where the weakest go away and the promising ones have new chances to prove their capacities but must be fast to do that otherwise they lose itbr br other very interesting thing is that tyra also knows to decide who should or shouldnt win even when shes against peoples opinion she knows that whoever wins will be famous but has a very few possibilities to truly be a worldwide recognized top model at the same way she knows that some times the second place is more valuable than the first because 1st place wins the title but second doesnt gets the title stigma hardly she makes mistakes when she decides the future of any model during the showbr br after 9 cycles the show is getting a little tired with some old ideas its time for tyra to change some things and lines because its getting boring and comparing to the firsts cycles we can see that shes getting bored too so she needs to do that if she wants the show to live a little longerbr br anyway the show explores the fashion and modeling world but its also entertaining for those ones that live outside all of that it gives the opportunity for some girls and also the market and also gives great tips for those ones from the audience who shares the same dream
