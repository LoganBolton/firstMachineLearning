this show is my guilty pleasure all the way when i first tuned in to americas next top model i expected to be bored and to find it very very stupid i didnt this show is actually serious fun i read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be americas next top model and it so does who doesnt love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model on antm you get to see what its really like and who doesnt love hearing the girls bitch about each other and get into fights or enjoy wanting to throw something at that janice ladybr br give this a chance dont expect something intelligent or a show you can look to for a life lesson just enjoy it for what it is serious fun
