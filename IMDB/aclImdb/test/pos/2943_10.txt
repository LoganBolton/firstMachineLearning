i dont usually like to see movies while theyre still in theaters because of high ticket prices but i saw a poster for some things that stay and i thought that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious not like the usual blonde teenybopper bs so i decided to take the plunge and see this movie on its opening night br br i must tell you i was happily surprised i went to this film with no expectations i didnt really know what it would be about but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by katie boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision alberta watson also did a fantastic job as the role of tamaras diseasestricken mother and i must also add that i was quite impressed with the comedic stylings of megan park as tamaras friend brenda br br the film was wonderfully directed by gail harvey and pulled together in the kind of kitschy 50s way that leaves you feeling warm and happy even if the storyline tended not to be so uplifting i also thought that the film was wellshot many beautiful images of a 1950s countryside will remain in my mind for weeks to come br br this film as a whole was quirky and great i found it to be unpredictable and although the story ends in a somewhat openended way i was still left satisfied whether you are looking for a fun yet powerful comingofage story or simply want to reminisce about life in the 1950s i guarantee this film is for you even if you have no expectations it is still quite likely that you will be most impressed give this one a shot
