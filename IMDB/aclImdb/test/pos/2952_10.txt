for those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships 51 birch street is a must seebr br by training the spotlight on his own family block covers terrain that is offlimits for most filmmakers he explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism in fact the film is deceptively low key at the outset br br in addition to providing a probing look at one family  and by extension every family  block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history i dont know if this was intentional but unavoidable due to archival contentbr br highly recommended
