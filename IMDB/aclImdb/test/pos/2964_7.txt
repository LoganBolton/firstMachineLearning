the make orbreak of a love story for me is whether or not i like the characters and also if they click with each other matt is pretty unlikeable aloof braggart seemingly lazy and a misogynist hes been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable he overcompensates by bragging that hel nail amy he acts so cool around amy that he strikes out twice when they do talk he cant show her who he really is she empathizes and then stonewalls him at just the right moments she seems so mature and strong that the traits of hers that come out later didnt seem to fit for me i found her to be incredibly sexy and pretty    girl next door pretty i call it so i was going to like this movie unless it really screwed upbr br funny things happen with the coach but matts relationship with the other coach was inspiring the football scenes at the end were perplexing matt doesnt carry the ball but seems to be a blocking back folks he isnt the right size hes fifty pounds too light for that position but i thought his acting was skilled i measure that by the way i wanted to wring his neck a couple of times during his scenes with meredith monroe the film was all right meredith m was better than all right
