i was drawn to friends by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous elton john whom i had see in a club in nearby houston i had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make recently i was brought back to the movie by a song that heart did called seasons then i found the elton john song friends thinking it was the same songits been 35 years of so anyway the flood of the emotions of friends came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love i have more recall of the way the movie hit me than i do of the actual details of the production plot etc so forgive me for a rather poor review i remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and tearyeyed at the end as i was im both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now so many movies which seemed so important to me back then ie the graduate easy rider now just seem silly and i dont want this to fall into the same category but i will find it and if it turns out silly then at least ill be able to turn my wife onto a greatnooutstanding soundtrack when we met we went through this with last tango in paris the youngsters i work with im 56 respect my opinions but its hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little aged now i just cant figure out if the the aging process is the movies or me friends is a very special sensitive and wonderful movie it will bring back a lot of special feelings im sure by all means rent or buy a copy indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today
