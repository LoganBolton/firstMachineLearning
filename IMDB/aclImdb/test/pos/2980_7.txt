i havent seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater and i have been searching for it since at the time i was 12 and the story excited me and now the ending eludes me it was young love that engrossed me the most not to mention johns vocals and taupins lyrics the story at the time hit home to my psyche i am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years it is that good place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run if this movie didnt excite your curiosity then you were just too old i look forward to seeing it again even at my age if nostalgia is in your venue im sure this is an interesting movie to see its innocence is simply astounding and its simplicity is so easy and enjoyable
