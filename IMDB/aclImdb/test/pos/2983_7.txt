i was in my mid teens when i saw this movie and i was struck by the beauty of the young stars as well as the loving cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story it amazes me to learn that alvina has recently died that bury apparently has not worked in the film business for almost 30 years and that both would be in their 50sbr br the elton john soundtrack is amazingly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence the characters experience in seclusion i have seen the movie poster billing it as deux enfants quisaiment which apparently means something like two children who like each otherthe english language distributors were wise to abbreviate the titlebr br paul the ignored 15yearold son of an english businessman living in paris meets michelle an orphan at the zoo the two take what they intend as a daylong holiday to michelles late fathers rural cottage but end up staying there for a year isolated from the outside world they fall in love michelle gets pregnant and they have the baby alone at home after the babys birth the police come to pauls work place and take him awaybr br blue lagoon comes to mind as another film that almost captures the theme of innocence protected in an isolated paradise so sad that friends has never been released on dvd
