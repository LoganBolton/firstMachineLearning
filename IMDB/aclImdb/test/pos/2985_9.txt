im certain that people from usa dont know anything about the rest of the world but i think they mustnt talk about what they dont know and they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the usa the only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the usa and islamic nations in france for instance the age of consent is 15 in brazil its 14 in spain its 12 so the teenagers actors 16 and 17 years old by the time of production arent doing anything illegal nudity isnt considered big deal in almost all civilized countries and only a freak could consider a teenagers love as child molestation
