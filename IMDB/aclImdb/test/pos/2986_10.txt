a remarkable film bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings i had when i was much much younger i loved it and the elton john music i remember seeing in in the movies when i was a kid and for some reason limited release ive never known anyone else who saw this film when it was releasedbr br the dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back i confess however that my kids in their 20s have not experienced a similar emotional rush a generational thingbr br why is it not on dvd
