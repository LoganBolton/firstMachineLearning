most of these reviews are dead on so ill cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions ive seen on herebr br while the characters seem and look young hence the controversy the actoractress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier here in the usa thats still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset itbr br im sorry not to have seen more by sean in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious you know exactly what the character is feeling whether hes angry afraid or confused anicee had a healthy career whos life was cut unfortunately short by cancer in late 2006 she was a beautiful and talented actressbr br vhs tapes of friends can be found at amazoncom occasionally but usually for a significant price ive seen it as low as 60 or so and as high as 152 as of this comment there were two for that price the sequel video paul  michelle is not quite as pricey and can be obtained when available on amazon for between 16 and 70 on average
