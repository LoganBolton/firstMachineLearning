with all the dreck out there this is a gentle movie about young love yes its true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves but why arent people down on romeo and juliet paul and michelle are models of good behave compared to thembr br yes they run away and set up an ideal life but this is a movie not real life paul is more sexually interested than michelle who has been come onto in a bad way eventually they have sex but no one is forced into it the movie does let kids know that sex can cause babiesbr br one thing there is nudity in the movies the camera does not focus on it but it is therebr br the ending of the movie has paul in good chance of being found out in paul and michelle they separate for a time if you dont like the ending of a movie think one up yourself alternative endings are not just for dvds
