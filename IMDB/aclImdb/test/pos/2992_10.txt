i loved this movie oh my gosh this movie rocked so hard i found it amongst some old tapes and didnt know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it which btw mentioned the fact that elton john covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about i thought it sounded interesting and i was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older filmbr br what controversy i thought to myself as i put the tape in the player i was curious i get and my expectations were certainly met i loved it i guess it is a really girly kind of movie but it was so sweet and adorable it was a beautiful romance although at times the directing reminded me of the camera work in the graduate which i thought at the time of seeing it the director must have been on acid with some of the close ups they didbr br ok so it wasnt entirely conceivable for these two kids to run off and live on their ownbut it could happenin a fantasybr br but the ending just sincerely ticked me off i was so mad with how they ended itit sort of leaves you hanging and i suppose they may address what actually happens to them in the sequelbut at the same time im almost hesitant to see that since sequels are almost never as good as the firstbr br i totally recommend this movie to anyone sixteen and over its an awesome movieawesome
