first of all  im not one to go all sappy over movies i saw friends in the 70s when it was first released i was about 17 years old at the time even now at age 50 i still can remember some of the scenes the movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but i loved it the story is about innocence the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home at the time it was pretty risky to have a movie about a couple of young runaways who successfully setup house and have a baby on their own im not surprised the movie and elton johns soundtrack are almost unknown today the music is beautiful it was unforgettable
