i dont go for that many heist comedies and i might not care for this one if it werent for the actors when it was made and when i first saw it just a few years later its almost too similar to the happening even though its obviously a much less serious comedy than that one  mafia figure takes over his own kidnapping or rather turns it in a different direction altogether of course raquel welch didnt play the kind of sharp character faye dunaway did in the happening but that doesnt make it a sexist film either  she was practically playing a stock character almost her version of a moll but im completely biased  its among the first films i ever saw with her and at the time i saw it you couldnt turn around without seeing a poster of her luckily i think robert wagner was really just right as the neither thoroughly likable nor dislikable leader of the group as were edward g robinson naturally and vittoria de sica and godfrey cambridge an actor who always managed to be funny
