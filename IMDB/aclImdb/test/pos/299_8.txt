its that film that loads of people hail as a classic  apocalypse now now a recut reup redux 22 years after its original releasebr br the film is loosely based on conrads heart of darkness its main plot if it has one being capt willards journey on a naval boat through the vietnam conflict on his way to terminate a rogue colonel colonel kurtz we see the characters and situations he meets and he tells the colonels story along the waybr br my initial feelings towards the film is that its not particularly gripping at times especially early on but at least a good dose of comedy is put in in the form of surfing fanatic col kilgore as the film progresses however a good deal of tension is built up with willards reading through various reports on col kurtz until the end is in sight when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the endbr br the usual aspects everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional and i found the performances of martin sheen marlon brando robert duvall and frederic forrest to all be worthy of a special mention the score i found initially sounded out of place but as the film progressed im not entirely sure if it did actually get better or it fitted better or if it had just grown on me but by the end of the film i was thoroughly enjoying itbr br this is the second time i have seen the redux version i have seen the original around four times ill say now that the first time i saw it i was disappointed i was expecting a classic film with lots of war the fact that willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and didnt carry it out until the end had me bored because all of the character interaction on the way that is the film seemed unnecessary this is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined as the focus is more on the character and the journey more than the plot in most cases a second viewing is needed to appreciate the film fully as with all films that are more character than plot based as the second time around you know where the plot is going i had a similar experience with its a wonderful life which is now one of my favourite filmsbr br with the big four vietnam films apocalypse now wins over the rest on atmosphere but lacks the action and involvement of platoon the emotional intensity of the deer hunter and cannot really be compared to full metal jacket probably my favourite of the four apocalypse now is a great piece of work especially towards the end where it becomes staggering and is to be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character based film and doesnt mind some casual violence
