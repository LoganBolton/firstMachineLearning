i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real one could tell that from the two main actresses ms toussaint  ms potts that their relationship on  off camera was genuine it didnt just end when you hear those familiar words cut at the end of a take the show has thought me a lot about life for eg historical struggles tragedies and triumphsrelationshipsevery day situations every household have same situations no matter who the members are it really came down to just being a wonderful family show that at the end of every episode you can just sit on your living room couch and say to yourself now what did i learn from this particular episodebr br i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over againbr br now you know why i gave it a 10
