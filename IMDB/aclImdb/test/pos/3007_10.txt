i just started watching the show around july i found it by mistake i was channel surfing during a vacation it is a great show i just wish it wasnt on so late at night its on at 1230 am as a working person it makes it hard to watch all the timebr br i read some comments i did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60s and not believing that this stuff can happenbr br i grew up in the 60s im hispanic and i had a white boyfriend plus we had black friends in high school i believe people get along because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a certain race or colorbr br i cant wait till the show goes on dvd so i can buy it this way i can see it from the beginning
