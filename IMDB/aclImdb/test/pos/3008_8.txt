i give this film 810 overall visually a great deal of it is nothing short of stunning an art directors dream mix of hieryonomous bosch salvador dali frieda kahlo and georgia okeeffeand a valid testament to the power of film as a serious art form beautiful use of color form imagery environmentand fabulous set decoration combine with stateoftheart computer graphics so 1010 for that wowbr br the plot line is well more predictable you know theyll save the girl and get the killer in the end but the story is still interesting and pacy enough to pull you in and keep you there 610 for thatbr br squirm factori wont give this a rating but the film certainly made me squirm and i was watching it on video on a tv screen it would of course have a great deal more impact on a big screen graphic violence of a twisted erotic nature in a surreal landscapeeven if beautifulis highly unpredictable the world inside the killers head is notthank goodnessmy world because i watched this film on video i was able to replay a couple of sequences and found much to admire the second time around when i wasnt so nervous about where the scene might be going and i suspect the whole film would be worth seeing a second time just for the visual artbr br general suggestion dont take the kids or conservative grandparents to this one but if youre keen on the visual look of films like surrealist art dont mind a bit of kinky gore and just want to take a bit of a mind trip this ones a winner oh and if youre keen on babes jennifer lopez is pretty hotbr br
