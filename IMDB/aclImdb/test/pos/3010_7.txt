this one started excellently the photography and audio are the best ive experienced in years okay months especially the use of warm and cold colours in single sequences is astonishing also making jennifer lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself but im not sure what singh wants to accomplish with thatbr br now for the minuses the screenplay was awful lopezs part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot she seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic the three beds seemed just too obvious the baptizing of the child carl was a psychologically too underlined way to embark the motive which carl worked under and so onbr br anyway the movie had great way of showing where singh comes from why is it that the most talented directors seem to emerge from india nowadays
