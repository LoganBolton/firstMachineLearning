i do not want to go into a criticism of the movie which i think is  for a big budget movie  quite exceptional and daringbr br i just wanted to remark that i am really fed up with the studios policies and the laws of different states which treat their viewers like children in the database we find at least 4 different versions of the movie according to running time but of course it is likely that there are much more different cutsbr br the result is complete confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie unless you live in argentina where the movie runs 115 minutes which sounds quite completebr br later on dvd and video the studios try to rob us further by selling us a presumable directors cut in germany there is already such a version around running approx 110 minutesbr br it would be nice if the studios would not only think of the cash they make with their movies but also think of their products as a work of art even at the risk of an unfavourable rating so that i as a viewer dont have to feel cheated and am taken seriously not only as a resource of money
