i remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool i never got the chance to see it though when i went to blockbuster to rent some videos i figured i should watch it after all i did love silence of the lambs and se7en and if you enjoyed those movies you might get a kick out of the cell the whole story concept is very interesting going physically into the mind of a killer i cant imagine the world they live in the acting is actually pretty decent jennifer lopez is the only one i have to say that wasnt that great but she does a believable job i would recommend for a scary thrillerbr br 710
