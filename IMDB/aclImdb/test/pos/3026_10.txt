the cell is an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations this is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent this is the best movie of the year to datebr br ive read numerous complaints about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point this movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow the cell has just opened the door to another world of imagination so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director tarsem singh that we dont want any more personally i would more than welcome another movie by tarsem and would love to see someone try to challenge himbr br weve all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer and yes i do agree that the genre is a bit overworked the 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick some of them worked but most failed but the cell does not blaze down the same trail we are given a new twist we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studiedbr br i like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another instead she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity the cell wants to let you see what its all about and not how its all about and i guess thats what some people dont like true i do like explanations with my movies but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it inbr br i noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another nonetheless the set design was simply astonishing i wouldnt be surprised if this film took home a few oscars in cinematography best costumes best director and the like if it were up to me itd at least get nominated for best picturebr br ive noticed that ive kind of been repeating myself not because theres nothing else to say but because i cant stress enough how fantastic i thought the cell was if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eyepopping feast then you are assured a good time i guess this film was just a little too much for some people writing it off as weird or crazy i am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it was right down my alley leaving the theater i heard one audience member say whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs if so i want what he was smokingbr br  out of 4
