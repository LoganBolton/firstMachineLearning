this movie is definitely a case of style over substance but the style is good and certainly more than unique on its own to make the cell a memorable and above average moviebr br the cell is beautifully looking with impressive sets costumes and makeup yes its real eye candy to watch all the movie has some perfectly dreamy sequences that are certainly odd but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at this movie is a perfect mix of an arthouse type of movie and a typical hollywoodthriller that is accessible to both fans of the genrebr br the story itself is pretty far fetched and doesnt always make sense because of that the movie isnt always pleasant and likable to watch but like i mentioned before the style compensates for this the style makes you keep watching till the end and provides the best moments of the moviebr br vincent donofrio is unforgettable as the serialkiller with a twisted mind vincent donofrio is really underused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once more im not particularly happy about the casting of jennifer lopez i know that she can act in some of her movies but she really wasnt suitable to play the main character in this movie her character wasnt strong enough and she was overshadowed by vincent donofrio and vince vaughn still i felt that vince vaughn was also miscast in this movie he didnt fit the role well enough and no im not saying that because im used of seeing him only in comedies now days the rest of the supporting cast is good and still give the movie a certain degree of credibilitybr br the musical score by howard shore was also surprising good and was sort of se7en like at times it suited the movie well and gave some of the scenes some extra mood and atmospherebr br its a far from perfect movie and the concept is far fetched and not always handled in the right way still the cell is a perfectly watchable movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see due to its style originality and creativitybr br 710
