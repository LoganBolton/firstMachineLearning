im going to make this short and sweet its not surprising that you had no use for this film this is a story about the power beauty and possibilities inherent in a meaningful education based on your pathetically composed comments i can see that your own education has been woefully neglected or worse completely wasted your comments are those of a truly ignorant person i would advise you to do something about this condition but in your case i feel its probably too late my hope is that you yourself dont intend to go into the teaching profession  especially in film studies because you could only do damage oh one last bit of advice in the future if you intend to write more opinion pieces you should really proofread your work it will make people take you more seriously
