our america is multicultural with so many subcultures this movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these subcultures it is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world generally a good movie it entertained provoked thought and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise right in our own back yard should be seen by all having lived in the us all my life i had no idea that there were citizens here that didnt know they were citizens this movie helps illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state the obvious conclusion if this is really for real then what else is out there that we know nothing of
