pat conroys autobiographical book the water is wide proves to be something of a southern up the down staircase yet despite the teachergoingagainsttheodds formula conrack really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash these students uneducated black kids on an island off south carolina are actually shown learning and their collective wideeyed innocence is remarkably sweet the one actual actress in the bunch tina andrews an amazing performer plays the tough nut conrack has to crack and once she falls under his charms it all seems a breeze but the story is not readymade for a happy ending and i wasnt prepared for the quiet simplicity of the finale its beautifully done the script veers off course every now and then but director martin ritt is very smart to always fall back on jon voights solid presence scenes such as the one where he drives around in his van venting his frustrations over a loudspeaker dont add up to much but the whole film is filled with episodes which spark emotion and the actual ending is their payoff 12 out of
