martin ritt seems to be a director who was always interested in social issues as the son of immigrants he had every incentive to be so especially since he was blacklisted in the 50s conrack is based on pat conroys novel the water is wide about his own experience in 1969 teaching a school of impoverished black children about the outside world much to the chagrin of the rightwing superintendent hume cronyn what added to the movies strength was the cultural and historical context conroy jon voight frustratedly tells another teacher how many of the children dont know about paul newman sidney poitier the vietnam war or even where vietnam is he proceeds to enlighten them about all these factorsbr br somewhere i read a complaint that when conroy played music for the children he only played white music the truth is you cant blame the movie for that it was based on conroys real experience either way the movies a real gem
