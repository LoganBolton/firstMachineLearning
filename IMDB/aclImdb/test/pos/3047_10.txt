this film launched my theory about films based on books instead of following the cliche youve read the book now see the film if you are looking for a good book to read try one upon which a movie you like was based because itll be 10 times betterbr br i saw this film on its initial release at the national theater in downtown eugene and liked it so much that i stayed to see it again its a perfect merger of the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors jon voight with what became my favorite book the water is wide by pat conroybr br i can think of no better movie about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life two tiny caveatsbr br 1 the video suffers severely from panandscan and deserves a letterbox version 2 the title should be restored to the name of the book a reference to one of the most touching enigmatic songs ever written
