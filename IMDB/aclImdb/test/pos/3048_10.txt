all i can say is that each time i see conrack dir martin ritt dp john alonzo i feel an utmost sense of inspiration and enlightment in what the power of cinema is possible in such a simple filmbr br the motion picture conrack is set in 1969 it is based on a true story it is a story about a white man jon voight who teaches a group of young black children how incredible the world is outside of their little south carolina islandbr br the story places the job of a teacher as noble cause in changing childrens livesbr br i highly recommend it
