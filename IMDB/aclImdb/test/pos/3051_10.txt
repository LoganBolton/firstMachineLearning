if you are a fan of early duke movies this lone star oldie is a good one what more could you ask for than duke yak and gabby lots of good ridin and shootin i found it amazing that dukes singing voice was bill bradbury who is none other than bob steeles twin brother it has been reported that bob steele was a high school classmate and friend of duke so twin brother bill may have been too anyway if you like good clean early western movies dont miss this one we dont have to wonder about hidden meanings or try to figure out underlying themes just sit back relax and enjoy a western movie from a simpler day and time its called entertainment folks
