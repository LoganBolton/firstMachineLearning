not since bette daviss 1933 vehicle exlady have i seen a film that was so much better than its star said it was most of the bum rap atoll k aka utopia aka robinson crusoeland aka escapade has got over the years has come from the horror stories stan laurel told of its production given that he suffered a stroke during filming looked like death warmed over through much of it from the opening twoshot of them together youd never guess that laurel survived hardy by eight years and was subsequently diagnosed with diabetes once he adjusted his diet accordingly he restored himself to health one can understand why laurel didnt think this film was the most pleasant experience of his life yes its flawed the cheapness of the production shows through the dubbing is awful and laurel and hardy were too old to do the energetic slapstick of their greatest films but its still genuinely funny and l√©o joannons story introduces elements of political satire sometimes libertarian sometimes communalist one would expect to see from more socially conscious comedians like chaplin or the marx brothers but never from laurel and hardy the film deserves credit for being different though its debt to the ealing studios classic passport to pimlico made just a year earlier is pretty obvious and for integrating the laurel and hardy comedy into a rather edgy context completely different from anything theyd used before this isnt a great movie but its certainly better than the eight dreary ones for fox and mgm theyd made in the early 1940s i suspect only the films technical crudity kept it from earning the cult following among antiestablishment babyboomer youth the marx brothers duck soup acquired in the late 1960searly 1970s
