unfortunately ive never seen the full version of this movie i did see the 87minute version twice back in the 1950s even more floridly directed than is the norm with julien duvivier this is a wonderfully outoftheordinary piece replete with sweeping tracking shots through over and into andrejews magnificently atmospheric sets beautifully lit too by photographer andr√© thomas black jack is nothing if not a connoisseurs delight reinforcing this imaginative visual style is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors including agnes moorehead and marcel dalio some brilliantly bizarre fullblooded characterizations george sanders gives a polished performance whilst an eccentric millionairess who turns out to be a rival racketeer is admirably played by agnes moorehead also realizing the most from her role patricia roc the film was made on locations in spain in 1949
