how can anyone dare say anything bad about this film pardon mel brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch itbr br the first time i saw this i cried from laughing so hard everything about it is funnybr br while robin hood men in tights is not my favorite comedy that spot is taken by real genius it ranks way up there in my book so go see it if you dont spend the whole time laughing then at least youll spend the whole time drooling over cary elwes
