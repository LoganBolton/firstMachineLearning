captain willard martin sheen has been sent on a classified mission into cambodia during the vietnam war to assassinate colonel kurtz marlon brando as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders and since kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces it is hard for capt willard to understand how col kurtz could go off the deep end as he has killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands what possibly could have pushed this great man over the top through willards long journey through the jungle to find his target he tries with some success to understand why but what will he decide to do once he finds himbr br any movie that can start out with the doors the end is a great movie in my book especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song apocalypse now does this perfectly i cant think of anything better for it to be set to the vietnam war and the insanity in the soliders minds that it created an is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in vietnam the ultimate destination of which is murder through its use of music and score alone we are thrown into a dark world of mystery violence and insanity a perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here br br an overall great cast with the exception of laurence fishburne of which sheen and brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread i just dont like fishburne ever since i found out he was cowboy curtis in peewees playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold i realize the pettiness of this but i simply do not care we need to sick gary oldman on him brando is excellent as col kurtz and i cant think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence sheen is also fun to watch as willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general my favorite character in the movie has to be robert duvalls lt colonel kilgore before this film i never pictured duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly its my favorite of his parts to date he simply nailed his character which is one of the best in the entire film as the gungho air cavalry commander who loves to surf maybe a little over the top but still brilliant i also love the smell of napalm in the morningbr br the plot is a fairly simple one and it doesnt take too much brainpower to figure out whats going on willards mission is to kill kurtz plain and simple but its the journey of the film that is really its heart and also the dire situations of war itself in the redux version we are forced to sit through the extended french plantation scene and the playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the films entirety other than it makes it a longer journey i dont feel they take away anything though its just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original through this journey the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in itin fact thats the entire point on top of that the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like kurtz to go completely mad br br a big war movie lover this one is up there with platoon and the deer hunter all of them classics i sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as i have had to go back on what ive said all three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the vietnam warso to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointlesseven if after having most recently view an i think its a tad better in the end apocalypse now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status its been given as a fellow reviewer has previously stated an is one of the most ambitious films ever made
