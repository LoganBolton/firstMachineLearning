if you dont like mel brooks you wont like this film thats a given why anyone wouldnt like his films is unknown to me but for those who cant see the light just avoid itbr br everyone else this is a classic the entire cast is perfect carey elwes is a dashing clever british robin hood amy yasbeck overacts appropriately as marion richard lewis is his usual distracted annoyed self roger rees is a brilliant combination of fluster and violence as mervyn the sheriff of rottingham and dave chapelle eric allan kramer mark blankfield and the sadly underused matthew poretta are the perfect merry menbr br there are similarities to spaceballs blazing saddlesand every other mel brooks movie but why would you want him to change his style when it works so damn well the pop culture references in this movie are old enough to be funny againfrom the view of a 16 year old at least its complete and utter parody every second a play for a laugh some of them dont work but most do and well i discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time i watched the filmbr br of course if being barraged by constant visual and verbal gags isnt your style you wouldnt like this this isnt an academy award winner its mel brooks you know what it is when youre getting into it if you want nonstop laughter surprisingly welldeveloped characters and catchphrases to last a lifetime watch this
