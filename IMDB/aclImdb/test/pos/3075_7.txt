might contain spoilersbr br this is just a good movie lots of good silly stuff to laugh at however do not watch the tv version they cut to much out dom deluise is rather awesome as the mafia don who is hired to kill robin all i can say about his ten minutes its a long drive from jersey also you gotta love them checking the script to make sure robin gets another shot also 12th century foxbr br any bad stuff the rappers at the beginning and the end seem rather out dated the songs were rather lame one time while watching this movie i could think out a few more times when they could have thrown in another joke or 2 br br on the whole however an enjoyable movie experience a must watch for comedy fans
