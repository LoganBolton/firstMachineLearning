i thought this film was amazing and i laughed so much that i had to see it twice to catch the bits i missed whilst bending over holding my stomach the critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an iq over their shoe size to find this film funny well my iq is approx135i challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words this film is brilliant and if the critic above wasnt such a boring idiot he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as theyre meantbr br the musical numbers were so imaginative everyone when watching any film about that period of time will notice men in tights and realise how different it is to todays attire and how funny we would find todays male population if they wore tights day in day out the idea of dedicating a song to butch men dancing in tights was so fresh how can anyone not laugh plus also seeing hiphop rappers doing ballet is always hystericalas a dancer also ive done ballet and hip hop and danced with men whove had to do bothit still cracks me up each timebr br i love this film if anyone hasnt seen it yet dont listen to the critic abovewatch it and then decide for yourself
