robin hood men in tights is worth watching i recently watched it because ive just become a cary elwes fan and this is one of of his leadroles some moments really made me crack up so hard i didnt expect them you know it was so funny even the 2nd time around youd still fall off your chair the cast is great of course especially robin of locksley himselfcary but blinkin and the sheriff and little john dont let the name fool you its veryy big lol and everyone elsebr br there were some moments of course the film tried to make a comedic scene out of but you dont necessarily laugh at it but okbr br this is the second time cary elwes and patrick stewart appeared in a film together by the way they both worked on lady jane in 1986 and it was fun to see them 7 years later older awwwwbr br its definitely worth watching quite hilarious indeed
