like many a child born in the 1980s i grew up on the mel brooks films that werent necessarily the racier ones like blazing saddles and history of the world part 1 i saw those of course though not as frequently as now but the ones meant for the whole family spaceballs and this film i knew at the time i wasnt seeing great art but just a campy goofy though always laughworthy take on robin hood andor adventure movies but calling it a family movie in quotes means that a adults really can enjoy it as much as kids if not more because of the little injokes and silly vulgarities and b once a kid sees it when he revisits it as i have a few times its still as fresh but with some things not quite understood the first time around its a comedy that is not only filled with jokes at robin hood movies and other movies godfather of course as well as little mentions for other movies of modern times but one that references brookss own movies as well this is a filmmaker who isnt above poking fun at even his own stylebr br basic story robin hood cary elwes in one of his best turns returns home from the crusades to see things are in peril with king richard gone and so goes forth to reclaim his land and to naturally rob the rich to feed the poor along the way he meets achoo dave chappelle butts heads with prince john richard lewis and the sheriff and of course still pines for the love of maid marian this of course is the usual clothesline for brooks to let the comedy run off into the scenes and while sometimes a joke may not work or might become stale on a repeat viewing so much of it sticks that its hard not to chuckle it also helps that a couple of bits are some of the best in any brooksfilm such as the godfather bit dom delouise at his very best brookss own cameo as the rabbbi lewis and chappelles acting turns and an endless slew of quotable lines and a couple of tongueincheek songs some of it is obvious yes some of it just takes right from the pages of blazing saddles sure but is it a good time for the right crowd definitely and for parents who grew up on the 70s brooks work it is a fantastic way to introduce the young ones to his work through this even the suggestive sex jokes and such are not rrated all in good fun
