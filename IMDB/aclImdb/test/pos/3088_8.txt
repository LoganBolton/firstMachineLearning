after ive seen this movie i find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie im not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times but in its genre it is a great movie i know not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like robin hood is turned into a comedy many people still seem to believe that some things shouldnt be laughed with  they are wrong br br mel brooks has done an excellent job with robin hood men in tights i have seen the original robin hood movies as well but i never had such a good time when watching them as i had with this one its just one continuation of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and movies winston churchil the godfatherbr br i recommend everyone who wants to have a good laugh to watch this movie to those who think robin hood shouldnt be messed with youre wrong but you better dont watch it because youll probably be offended by it i give this movie an 810
