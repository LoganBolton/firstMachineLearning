fata morgana the 1971 documentarylike film by german filmmaker extraordinaire werner herzog filmed over several years in the late 1960s is one of those rare dvds that should be listened to with the commentary turned on it is a visual feast of north african mostly saharan imagery that is timeless you simply could not tell that it was made over thirtyfive years ago the soundtrack to the film including german classical music mozart and handel and rock music by blind faith and leonard cohen also lends its timeless quality the narration by three different german narrators german film historian lotte eisner eugen des montagnes and wolfgang von ungernsternberg is solid and herzog goes on and on of eisners import to this project himself and film history but the english speaker of the translation james william gledhill has a voice that seems downright deific which lends itself far more perfectly to this project even though much of the text in either language is rather superfluous yes the faux biblical sounds of the popul vuh mayan creation myth in the films first part creation is interesting but the text herzog wrote for the remaining two parts paradise and the golden age along with quotes from a german poet herzog names as manfred eigendorf almost seems a satire of the first parts somber tone the film it seems was pieced together during the shooting of several other herzog projects concurrently the fictive even dwarfs started small and the documentaries the land of silence and darkness and the flying doctors of east africa but these projects rejected material only add to the beauty of this film such as aerial scenes of a flamingo mating lake from afar that give one an eerie unearthly sense one which herzog crows about in his commentary this unearthly feel is present right from the films start of several airplanes landing on a desert runway with their images getting successively blurrier as the heat from the ground rises and increases the distorting waves that mar the images that this film was influential in the quatsi films of godfrey reggio is an understatement but whereas reggio is content to just toss images at you herzog has an ability that only american filmmaker terrence malick also has to make a wholly selfcontained vocabulary out of the juxtaposition of images and words and one dependent upon an emotionfirst thrust analysis can fail when brought to such endeavors herzog often does not understand even why his art is great the best he does often is wholly unconscious and mesmeric this is why his contempt for the lowest common denominator pap of hollywood is openly stated on the commentarybr br perhaps the best illustration of this comes in a scene that on the commentary herzog tells us followed a severe drought in cameroon it shows the jerkied carcasses of cattle and herzog describes the unbearable stench yet the viewer can sense this all from the images the blackness of the sun dried portions of animals and the blanched bones yet even in that commentary herzog focuses on the stench not any deeper meaning he is content to let you imbue and interpret what you will into and of his work such as the almost erotically feminized shapes of sand dunes which recalls a scene from ingmar bergmans hour of the wolf where max von sydow runs his hand over ingrid thulins beautiful nude bodys curves but the archetypal image in this film which symbolizes much of herzogs career is of a mirage of a faraway car driving back and forth on the surface of what appears to be a lake it is deep hypnotic illusive elusive supernatural yet real just as herzog the believer who came from a family of militant atheists is but then like everything else it ends
