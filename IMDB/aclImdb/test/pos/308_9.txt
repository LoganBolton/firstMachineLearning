well ive watched this movie for over 25 years now and its still almost as interesting as when i first saw it it is definitely one of the most unique films ever madebr br i still think martin sheen got dissed bigtime in the billing too he dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than marlon brando who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours 17 minutes film theatrical version how unfair is thatbr br sheen is fantastic in here especially his narration which runs throughout its one of the best narrations if not the best i have ever heard in a movie his voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible nightmarelike adventure i never fail to appreciate his work in this moviebr br the other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes ones i have never forgotten such asbr br sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movies first scene robert duvall and the totally outofplace surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with wagners dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters the playboy bunny entertaining the troops frederic forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride the appearance of hippie journalist dennis hopper greeting the crew in cambodia and then brandos bizarre character it goes on and on with strange scenesbr br thats not to say i enjoyed everything no there are a few very unpleasant scenes such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half cant watch that anymore an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by sheens young stonedout crew and the crew is a little too goofy at times then there is the huge amount of profanity led by way too many fwordsbr br so there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this one thing for sure it is a film you will remember
