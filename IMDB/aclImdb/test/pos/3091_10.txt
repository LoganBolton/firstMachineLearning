it would be something to try and tell someone what fata morgana is very simply about or maybe it isnt herzog goes to the sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals but this is just the broadest stroke its a feat that you either surrender yourself to or you dont he gets into the form of the world around him entirely without a story bound only to certain aspects of written poetry as his camera shooting on supposedly discarded film stock wanders like in a pure travelogue one might even jump to that easy conclusion as he puts up these immense landscapes then moving to more rough civilized culture though not the actual normal culture itself and to a point levels too abstract to be able to convey properly here sometimes it takes a while to get along close to a purity through the creation section but a purity in how parts are manipulated either by nature or by brokendown machines soon the narration readings from the popol vuh who by the way does the music for most of his films with the gradual procession of actually highly stylized shots adds a whole different level to it its a hybrid film and its not easy but the rewards are what best comes closest to herzogs idea of ecstatic truth images hes been out for his whole careerbr br one wonders if the images end up by the time the second section paradise leading along the words spoken or if its the other way around youre eyes are moving along with the stills and pans and the wording is close to being religious writing but theres also the music choices how the bizarrely spare singing and lowkey classical music goes together with leonard cohen and blind faith i think each side ends up complimenting the other and its something that still seems like it shouldnt work perhaps thats the draw to it the chances taken in going through desolate wastelands and the smallest run sections of any kind of civilized life in this case the shacks of the desert that make it so fascinating if only for the cinematographic sense its a marvel too indescribable for the casual photography fan because of molds of technique and some of the strangest images of any herzog film theres pans theres longshots theres handheld while driving by the towns theres a bus dozens of miles away that via mirage seems only a couple theres fullon closeups of fire and a man holding a reptile and talking about its radar truly classic gonzo comedy theres people holding still in fake poses and a man and woman playing inane music but most importantly it ends up feeling at least for me natural for the personal nature of the approachbr br im sure only herzog would know for certain why he made this film as opposed to the simple how he was already filming even dwarfs started small and he ended up going through many perils to finish it yet this is what makes fata morgana such an amazing feat it will appeal to one depending on what someone brings to it in actually watching it its definitely unsettling but theres the temptation to want to see it again very soon after just to experience all of the ideas and realities turned abstracted strange vibes yes the word vibes applies here its one of the truly spectacular artfilms ever made
