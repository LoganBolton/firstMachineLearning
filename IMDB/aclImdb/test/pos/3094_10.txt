fata morgana is an absolute masterpiece its werner herzogs most unconventional film it doesnt have a plot or story instead of a story were given a collection of images words and music that work so wonderfully together its not a documentary either some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read it has some of the most beautiful and haunting images herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who arent actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror the use of music in this movie is so brilliant  from leonard cohen mozart and the third ear band imagine stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey in the desert thats what this movie is like this film is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel as though your spirit has left your body a must see it will change the way you view films rating 10 out of 10
