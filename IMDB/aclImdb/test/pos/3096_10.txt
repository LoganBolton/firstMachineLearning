successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare but fata morgana is a good case you can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth but herzog does an amazingly good job the movies point is to show human beings and even the world from a nonhuman point of viewbr br the movie is in three parts creation paradise and the golden age the imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voiceover although the text of the creation from the popol vuh a mayan myth refers to the primordial wasteland the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth it dwells on the waste and on various specimens of destruction fire smoke wrecked vehicles the images from paradise are anything but that and the golden age is darkly comic Â– the highest culture is the strange roadside musical actbr br the popol vuh suggests that mankind is the central object of creation but the movie does everything it can to undo this notion its mythological framework has no referent in human historical time there are no human characters to speak of when a boy stands with a dog in an extended shot the initial suggestion is of the boys point of view by the end it is much more the dogs likewise the lizard is a stronger character than the human who introduces it and the turtles partner barely looks human with his big flippersbr br animal stories and nature documentaries always anthropomorphize but fata morgana has none of that certainly the dunes look like a female body but the simile cuts both ways presumably only humans can distinguish easily between their creation and nature and here airplanes and factories are presented alongside mountains lakes and waterfalls people and civilization are all part of a broader natural landscapebr br in 1979 herzog put a new twist on the idea when he remade nosferatu from the vampires point of view
