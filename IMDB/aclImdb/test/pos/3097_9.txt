famed filmmaker werner herzogs fata morgana is breathtakingly unorthodox although characters appear in the film from time to time there is no actual story the film is also not an educational or historical documentary its a film without an accompanying screenplaybr br the film consists of curious background music and a somewhat illogical narrative vo the combination of which overlays a long string of images from mostly though not exclusively the sahara desert some of the images are wonderfully odd and out of the ordinary the camera captures ghostly images or mirages optical illusions that tantalize and mesmerizebr br this general cinematic trend is punctuated by occasional observational asides on serendipitous topics for example in one sequence a man wearing goggles gives us a minitutorial on lizards and in what for me was the most captivating and bizarre sequence a small inset room contains a man with dark goggles who sings in a voice that is totally distorted by the microphone hes using accompanied by an old lady who plays a punchy tune on an old piano neither the man nor the old lady seems to enjoy what theyre doing how baroquebr br fata morgana does have an underlying concept one that unites the wide assortment of strange images and eclectic sounds but that concept is so subtle so opaque that youll never figure it out without help from this subtle theme the film does indeed make sense without that point of reference however the film can seem tedious and unending a pointless parade of random earthy images and esoteric narrative gibberishbr br unapologetically redundant thematically baffling and cinematically heretical fata morgana will likely either make you swoon with delight or cause you to throw up youll either latch on to the films zenlike qualities or be tempted to smash the dvd into a thousand pieces one thing that most viewers will agree on fata morgana is  different
