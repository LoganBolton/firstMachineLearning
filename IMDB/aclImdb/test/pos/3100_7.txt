the ma  pa kettle characters were highly popular and controversial the films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula one obvious reference is the beverly hillbillies where the new home was bought with oil money not having been won in a contest you could even say the 1980s sitcom newhart borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series still i wonder if betty macdonald the washingtonbased author who created these characters didnt do more harm than good her portrayal of hillbilly characters makes them the butt of many jokes in terms of their alleged sloppiness and laziness the real life family that macdonald based the kettles upon successfully suedclaiming they had been ridiculed and humiliated with these lessthanflattering references sure its comedy and the situations bring us a great many laughs and fun momentsand political correctness as we know it today did not exist in the 1940s and 1950s but i think macdonald couldve still written these characters more sensibly and universal international couldve had its scriptwriters show them on screen with more dignity theres such a thing as good taste the more realistic moments are when the oldest son tom is ashamed of his rural heritage but learns to accept his parents and siblings for who they are for their part the kettles have to realize that they dont exactly fit into a modern world thats not a jokethats a sober truth
