i have this movie on a collection of inexpensive bmovies its not restored in fact the audio was difficult to discern for the first few minutesbr br at first it seemed like a typical haunted house film and feels very much like the forerunner of clue murder by death house on haunted hill etcbr br about a half hour into the film the storyline takes a really interesting twistand it goes from being a clich√© melodrama to something entirely different and far more entertaining than i had initially thoughtbr br check it out its a great deal of fun even if the long clips and wider shots and near lack of music score make it feel a bit creaky by todays standards
