gosh i am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view  primarily because in 20 years you learn more for example i had no idea who george cukor was  how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly all i can say isi really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life lifelong friendship between two women can that ever exist well in certain doses yesand this film let out in a bit on  howbr br being a youngster with not a lot of life experience at the first time i saw this so i focused more on the rich and famous part between the two at the time i had no idea there was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered there wasand how that would effect their friendship through their men their career the decades that defined them and coming to realize one thing remained stronger than anything elsetheir friendship and knowing each other more than anyone else could havebr br then i got older studied film a bit and watched this film again with my best friend from high school we do understand the rich and famous angle  and we are still the best of friendsbut this film is not a cinematic masterpieceit can be seen as a bit campy at timesa little over the top at points kinda on a dynasty and dallas level to me and honestly i can identify with the teddy bear scene for we do share a bear that means a lot more than a stuffed fun toy through our trials and tribulations with mencareers et also its not as over the top as it seems as many already said seeing meg ryan and matt latanzzi and dack rambo and david selby are great in this 1981 piece this is a nice chick flick
