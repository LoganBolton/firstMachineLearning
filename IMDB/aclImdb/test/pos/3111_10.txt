i loved this film because of the dialog and superb acting by candace and jacqueline however i never knew until now watching a bette david marathon on tnt that this film is a remake of a 1943 bette davis classic called old acquaintance bette costars with miriam hopkins who she was in a terrible feud with during the making of the movie because bette had had an affair with miriams husband who directed her in a film before they made old acquaintancebr br anyway both are worth every minute spent watching i highly recommend this film if you like a lot of dialog and drama its a study in the psychology of women and their relationships with each other in my opinion
