for my money probably the best film  or at least the most purely cinematic film  director ford ever made the dialog is swift clipped to the pointl the story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits ford uses a relatively small cast but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions grimly realistic warmly amusing brilliantly acted hard to believe johnsonj couldnt become a leading man after this with the best photography and editing in any american blackandwhite film owes an awful lot to sergei eisensteins editing technique but never as coolly detached or scientific as eisenstein could frequently get and a great musical score a magnificent panorama of an important and poorly understood episode in american historybr br one little quibble its not clear why the film involves the mormons who as far as i know were never the pacifists the quakers and amish were this confusion leaves a slightly bitter aftertastebr br however the rest of the film is such a feast this is easy to ignore in all other ways a true masterpiece of american cinema that needs to be revived and looked at again and again and again
