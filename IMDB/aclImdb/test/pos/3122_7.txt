by 1950 john ford had already fullydeveloped the ideas and motifs that would form the core of his most successful westerns always present for example is a strong sense of community most poignantly captured in the joad family of steinbecks the grapes of wrath 1940 within these communities even amid fords loftier themes of racism and the pioneer spirit theres always room for the smaller human interactions the minor friendships and romances that make life worth living wagon master 1950 came after ford had released the first two films in his cavalry trilogy  fort apache 1948 and she wore a yellow ribbon 1949  and it covers similar territory only without the military perspective and more damningly the strong lead of john wayne ben johnson and harry cary jr are fine actors but they feel as though they should be playing secondfiddle to somebody and ward bonds cursing mormon elder while potentially a candidate for such a role isnt given quite enough focus to satisfactorily fit the billbr br in wagon master ford seems so comfortable with his triedandtested western formula that any character development is largely glossed over ben johnsons romance with joanne dru is treated as an obligation more than anything else and harry cary jrs charming of a mormon girl is so perfunctory as to be almost nonexistent in the final film leaving one to ponder the survival of deleted scenes only in charles kempers charismatic and shamelesslyvillainous uncle shiloh does ford try some different and it works even with his being surrounded by a troop of insufferably hammy slackjawed yokels where ford does succeed is in orchestrating the conglomeration of three distinct races of americans  the valuesorientated mormoms the easygoing horsetraders the eccentric travelling showmen  into a cohesive community of pioneers looking towards a bright future this apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of uncle shilohs guntoting outlaws who exploit the lawlessness of the western frontier but ultimately lose out to the noble cowboys who only ever drew on snakesbr br ford reportedly considered wagon master among the favourite of his films and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like john wayne or henry fonda armed only with his stock selection of usual players ford is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding placing focus on any one character though most of the mormom travellers still remain completely anonymous despite being undoubtedly wellmade i cant help feeling that this film only does well what other ford pictures did even better the terrific majesty of the the western frontier was presented more beautifully in she wore a yellow ribbon the romances and friendly squabbles among community members took greater prominence in fort apache the early relations with native americans only hinted at here were more thoroughly examined in the searchers 1956 the bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored more movingly albeit by henry hathaway and george marshall in how the west was won 1962 wagon master is pure john ford but it isnt a landmark
