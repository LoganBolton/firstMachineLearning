i dont think i really have any spoilers in here but since i do describe a couple of funny scenes ill check the box saying might contain spoilers just to be on the safe side nowbr br i hardly know where to start by now you know the basic outline of the story  horse traders travis ben johnson and sandy harry carey jr take the job of guiding a mormon wagon train west to their promised land and along the way encounter a variety of trials and interesting characters most notably the outlaw clegg familybr br anyone can enjoy this movie you dont have to be a fan of westerns to like this one for one thing johnson and carey are two of the most quickly likable characters youll see in any movie carey in particular is animated and outgoing almost like a big kid  while johnson is a little calmer and wiser kind of like an olderbrother figure i get a kick out of the scene where they sell the sheriff one of their gentle horses for ten dollars then inform him that the horse has some peculiarities  you might say failings travis elbows sandy who lets loose with a shrill whistle sending the sheriffs new horse off on a wild bucking fit with him in the saddle the look on his face as the horse finally dumps him and gallops away is pricelessbr br pay attention to the music even if you never thought youd be a fan of the sons of the pioneers listen to shadows in the dust as the wagon train is shown in motion with some of the people walking along between the wagons its a truly beautiful song too bad only half a minute or so of it is in the movie i want to hear the whole thing sometimebr br one thing that impressed me greatly about this movie is that much of it must have been almost as hard to make as the real situation it portrays teams of six horses pulling wagons up steep mountain trails straining to make the top  this was no simple and easy film it must have been risky for the actors the stunt people and the animals as well fording rivers too this movie has plenty of authenticlooking action involving the movement of the wagon train it should be mentioned that both harry carey jr and ben johnson were extremely competent riders both with many years experience riding roping and doing all manner of cowboytype things carey grew up on a ranch where his family employed many navaho indians and in fact he learned to speak navaho before he learned to speak english no rhinestone cowboys in this movie  travis and sandy were the real thing through and throughbr br watch for the scene when miss denver throws out the pan of water from her wagon hitting traviss horse in the face the horse starts bucking eventually throwing him off it watch the look on sandys face when denver tells travis im sorry you fell off your horse another favorite scene of mine is when harry carey jr sandy gets into a bit of a tiff with one of the mormons theyre working back to back getting their gear ready and after sandy gets disgusted with the other fellow the two of them get into a rearend bumping match that quickly turns into a rollingaroundontheground fist fight even after the elder ward bond stands them up and separates them the two combatants continue trying to get at each other the mormon named jackson in the film gets one final kick in at sandy so high it hits his shoulder its a really funny scene from start to finish br br i dont know what else i can say about this movie other than that it has a good story very engaging characters beautiful scenery and plenty of action balanced with humor and a bit of drama oh it has been colorized at least in the version i saw not the most beautiful color film youll ever see but i think i prefer it to black and white i give this one a ten and i dont give out many 10s one of my favorite movies without a doubt and judging by the other comments i have plenty of company in that assessment
