this film is about two horse traders who agree to escort a small group of mormons across the desert along the way they encounter a murderous family of thugs who menace the peaceful folks and put their pilgrimage in jeopardybr br wagon master is what i would term a little john ford film as it obviously did not have the budget or scope of some of his other westerns in particular this film lacks the bigname stars like john wayne but allows some of the usual supporting characters to take center stage longtime ford stock character actors ben johnson harry carey jr and ward bond have been elevated to starring roles and perhaps the one who came of as the lead was probably johnsonthough the other two got nearly as much screen time and focus this is not a bad thing as the film worked just fine without the big starand is well worth seeingbr br now this isnt to say i loved the movie it was very good but certainly not perfect in particular as far as the music goes youll probably either love it or hate it i found the sons of the pioneers music a bit schmaltzy at times it did evoke a nice mood but seemed to occasionally dominate the scenes i think a little would have worked much better plus with their incessant singing in the background i kept expecting roy rogers to pop out at any moment another minor problem is that the plot was amazingly simple and the ending was pretty much a foregone conclusionbr br however and i am glad to say there is a however despite this being rather formulaic and sentimental the film still worked well this was primarily due to john fords nice as usual direction as well as ben johnsons exceptional performance he was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film another plus for me is that i saw this in the same week as brigham young another film about the mormon migration while brigham young was a bit silly and overly saintly in its portrayals here the mormons were less perfect and more like real peoplewith foibles and personalities oh and speaking of brigham young it seems as if jane darwell was the go to girl for mormonthemed films during this era as she was a major supporting character in both films considering that she died in brigham young and it was set about 20 years before wagon master this is some stuntbr br also if youd like to catch a glimpse of the famous jim thorpe hes in a tiny role where he plays the impassive indian dancing next to jane darwell around the camp fire
