although i liked this westerni do have to sayits not one of my favourite john ford westernsfor meit just lacks a certain something that most of his other filmsthe ones i have seen anywaypossessim nit sure what that something isits not something tangibleanywaythe gist of the story is about a mormon wagon train which is being used by a band of outlaws as a hideout from a pursuing posseford employs a lot of his regulars herethere are some interesting characterssome nice scenerya bit of actionand excitementit all adds up to a watchable experienceits certainly not boringjust not quite up to the usual john ford standardfor mewagon master is a 710
