the reader is a perfect example of what a short film should be a poignant story told simply through well written dialog beautifully painted images a score that seamlessly weaves its way through the narrative and characters portrayed with thoughtfulness and gracebr br i saw this film at a festival where other interesting films and ideas were screened but none of the other shorts had all the elements of great filmmaking coming together in one film as the reader did the reader commanded the attention of every festivalgoer in the room and for 10 minutes took us into the emotional lives of the charactersbr br duncan rogers has created a beautiful film and i hope to see more from this director be it more shorts or perhaps a feature length film
