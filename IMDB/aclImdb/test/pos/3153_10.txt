i have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one i really cant come up with one i think its because most of the films that take on this topic war peace violence are in a fixed documentary stylethere are some terrific ones out there all of them better known than usa tm im sure but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means this dvd in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isnt it is philosophical maybe but it bypasses the information mode and goes directly to the same place that a piece of music does it makes you feel but sometimes you dont even know why you are just taken somewhere on a wave of feeling when you watch it notice how well it is put together it may not be for everyone but it is for everyone who look for a rare cinematic creation that respects you
