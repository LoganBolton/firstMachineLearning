a lot about usa the movie can be summed up in its title it draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of hollywoodlike falseness that glorifies things that shouldnt be glorified im not sure i agree with the filmmakers take on recent events although truthfully i cant always tell exactly where he stands but i admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across audio tracks of speeches radio interviews poetry etc play as large a role here as visuals most of the time the visuals of the story are accompanied by these audio elements to good effect im kind of a radio buff so it was satisfying to hear the way that radio was integrated into the pace of the movie in fact most of the dialog takes place over the story rather than having characters talk to one another thats not to say that there arent characters real people but except for jim the protagonist  a kind of 60s drop out with an erratic state of mind the others come and go pretty quickly a few make a very powerful impression especially a gurulike taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom itself when he breaks out into a spontaneous song of prayer while driving jim to the subway it is a very powerful moment on the cover of the dvd is the quote the danger is clear which is taken from president bushs speech that paved the way to our incursion into iraq in retrospect hearing that speech at a climactic moment in the film brought home how we are living in a historically charged moment which will always be remembered
