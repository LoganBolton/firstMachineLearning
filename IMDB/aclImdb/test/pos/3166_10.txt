almost four years after the iraq war started and were in a bigger hole than ever thats right so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the american way are now chasing their tails isnt that true you bet it is this movie said so from the beginning it is kind of freaky how much the filmor should i say filmmaker knew what was coming it is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future there was a point when i felt the hairs standing up on the back of my neck as gw announced that major combat operations are over on top of a visual of a broken down rv being towed away with the american flag waving in the rearview mirror you have to see it to understand what i mean but even if you are apolitical or even if you are prowar this movie will have some kind of impact on you because it is so embedded in history
