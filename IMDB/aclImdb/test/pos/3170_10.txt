an amazing film ive only just seen it and i already want to see it again id never heard of derek jarman before i saw this film but now i am i cant wait to see his others the film takes a whole new perspective of shakespeares the tempest im sure hed have appreciated it for jarmans use of the the plays themes of love magic darkness and atmospheric tension ok ok there may have been a bit of nudity in the film which i hadnt really anticipated but it didnt offend me it just surprised me and made the film more unpredictable one spoiler for those of a nervous disposition fast forward the flashback scene with sycorax  caliban and ariel as their slave its pretty graphic overall if you are starting to find kenneth branaghs shakespeare performances flaccid and monotonous then you need to see this film fantastic and surreal itll blow you away but only if you let it have an open mind  and then let this film work its magic on you
