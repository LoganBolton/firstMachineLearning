the honkers is probably slim pickens best performance of all time when we were shooting everyone connected with the production figured that slim was academy award material unfortunately united artists had a james bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to the honkers i personally feel this film was underrated by most critics sam peckinpaws junior bonner was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film also cliff robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us too the picture is worth watching if just for the rodeo footagesome of the best ever filmedshot by james crabbe the director and my cowriter steve ianat died a few weeks after the pictures release cutting short a promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife sally his daughter gaby and newborn son stefan please give this movie a shot im betting that youll say it was well worth while i thank anyone who has taken the time to read this stephen lodge
