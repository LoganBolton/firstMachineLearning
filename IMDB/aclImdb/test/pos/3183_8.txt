having seen the uncut version i thought this film was beautifully made it captured my attention from beginning to end the tension was wonderfully conveyed nasaan ka man portrays the typical filipino family with accuracy in its presentation of secrets and lies even the religious culture the human tendency to keep up appearances and maintain a pure reputation is shown with stark vividness in gloria diazs character there is not a little scene in this film that does not have a purpose the cinematography is excellent and the writing brilliantbr br although the plot is great i personally found that the twist at the end the revelation to do with jerichos character was not as much of a shock as it should be but then maybe thats just me because otherwise nasaan ka man is a very cleverly made filmbr br the casting was good to begin with but deither and claudines acting were the icing on the cake not one to miss if youre looking for a filipino film that will surprise and surpass expectations thumbs up to the director
