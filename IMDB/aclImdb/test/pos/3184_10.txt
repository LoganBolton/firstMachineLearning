theres only so much that i can take of filipino films especially nowadays where the trend is sex action and slapstick comedywhich i hate the fact that nasaan ka man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus its got good cinematic scenes and editing was great especially the cinematography i think that claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie milan the fact that theres only so few filipino movies that i really like i think cholo laurel did such a great job in this movie i truly truly loved this movie technically and character development wise the plot was complex and thats what made it terrific
