i first saw this short when i bought a random dvd of short films a while ago this is the only short on the dvd i liked but i dont just like it i love it if you spend any amount of time with me you will see it it is beautiful simple and passionate no bells no whistles  it could have been done with a sharpie but dont get me wrong the animation is elegant and insightful  this person clearly spent plenty of time with cats  but it is simply black and white and then there is writing and the music it is simply beautifulbr br i eat chocolate drink wine and watch it over and over againbr br nothing else matters i wait for pedro serrazina to come up with something else
