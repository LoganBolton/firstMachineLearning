this short film and the poem which is behind it is one of the greatest metaphors ive ever seen br br the poem is beautiful it describes exactly the feeling of a person that chases a dream and cant realize itÂ… but it also tells how to fulfil it i see the story of the cat and the moon as one beautiful metaphor to the human relationships passion and love br br technically its done a good work too in spite of being very simple the animation in black and white gives a tone of allegory to the movie and to its message but also of tenderness and nostalgia br br in addiction the music also contributes to this poetic feeling br br nothing else matters i will wait she will come when she can or when she wants to
