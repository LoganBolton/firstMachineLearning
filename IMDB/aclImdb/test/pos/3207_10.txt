im not the type of person to watch tv shows because the acting normally sucks or its unrealistic or too dramatic but this show is perfect everyone can act and you can relate to the characters and their situations everyone has their own personality and lorelai gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny rory gilmore is a good role model for all girls she takes pride in wanting to attend harvard and boysboyfriends always come second in her book shes a loyal friend and always the peace maker theres subtle romance which is what i like personally not the mushy gushy romance that not many people get to have in their lives but a realistic type of romance every character eventually gets it and they dont find their prince charming at first glance and they dont just fall in love with every guy that comes their way its a realistic show but when you watch it you better brush up on your movies pop culture and random facts because lorelai gilmore is always making references i fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance so will you
