gilmore girls is one of the funniest most clever sharpwitted sarcastic and heartwarming television shows ive ever watched second only to my most favorite television show of all time friends the quick pace and many popculture references can leave some viewers confused but once you catch on to the ways of the gilmores youll be hooked for life just some random comments i recently finally began watching season 6 and wow its one of my favorite seasons so far i love the lukelorelai thing and all the drama in the various episodes is as always exhilarating the only thing im not so fond of is the surprising bad attitude and reckless actions rory has suddenly adopted unfortunately i dont find this very realistic and hope its not just a way to stir up some more drama to keep the season going strong all in all great season though and i cant wait for the nextbr br  ashly aka tookie clothespin
