touching bollywood epic melodrama about a 10 yearold girl who finds out that shes adopted and is determined to find her birth mother the films major success is the performance of ps keerthana who plays the girl the first half of the film is very good there are a few really good songs too especially the number that introduces the protagonist unfortunately the films second half which takes place in wartorn sri lanka feels like an entirely different and disappointing movie its big on explosions and special effects with sri lankan soldiers and rebels dodging grenades running from fireballs and being yanked by stunt wires all the film can offer as insight are cheap platitudes like some day there must come peace and perhaps the children will find a way the final sequence where the daughter and mother are reunited is good but so overthetop with the music and a welltimed downpour that it feels like a cheat i know i know its all in the style of bollywood but this is a story where big moments simply detract from the simple powerful central story bollywood could certainly use a little restraint at times too
