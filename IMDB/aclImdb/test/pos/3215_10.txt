wow i just have to say this show is super cool i fell in love with the show from the beginning the idea of the show is very original and very soothing its also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give lauren graham and alexis bledel theyre simply wonderful im especially a big admirer of lauren graham shes not just a pretty face shes a monster of an actress as well im not saying that alexis isnt a wonderful actress as well i just happen to like lauren better anyway its a real delight seeing them on screen sparing with words in the words of the immortal jim carrey beautiful
