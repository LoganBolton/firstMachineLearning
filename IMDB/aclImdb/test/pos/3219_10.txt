i love this show it is amazingi can never miss an episode even if ive already seen it the actors are perfect for the partsi love gilmore girls ive gotten all my friends to watch it even their parents watch it now i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day i wish my mom was like lorelei my friends say that i talk and act like lorelei lorelei and rory have a wonderful motherdaughter relationship it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it my vocabulary has widened from watching gilmore girls lauren graham and alexis bled el are perfect for the parts of lorelei and rory i think luke and lorelai should get married because chris has left lorelei and rory way too many times and has broken loreleis heart too many times too
