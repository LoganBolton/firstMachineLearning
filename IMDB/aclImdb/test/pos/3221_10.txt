i didnt catch gilmore girls when it first came out so still doing some catchup on the first season i read through most of the users comments and for the negative ones i have to ask what show are you watchingbr br this show is a classic great lines characters and good acting and best of all not your standard formula show always with an occasional twist to the story there are probably more women who see themselves reflected in the lorelaiemily relationship then in the lorelairory relationship the people and storylines are not pc but they are realbr br if you find the dialogue annoying i suggest you tape the show so you can rewatch the parts dont understand
