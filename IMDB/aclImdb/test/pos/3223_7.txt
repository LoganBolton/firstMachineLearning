every time i watch this show i just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week the dialogs or monologues rather as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing are just becoming so tedious for example the episode i watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish i forgot what it was pasta with meatballs perhaps always manages to turn the gilmore family dinner into allout war and these were just the few seconds or sobr br so it seems every time lots of lines with absolutely zero content the scripts they use must be enormousbr br but then every once in a while something happens the babbling stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent emotional moments for example this week it was lorelais breakdown at the estate agents i just thought it was the best piece of tv i have seen for a long whilebr br almost makes everything worthwhile
