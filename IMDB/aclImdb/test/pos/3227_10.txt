gilmore girls is my favorite tv show of all times they only aired the first 2 seasons in india but ive watched the rest on dvd or read it online its very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist isnt sneaking around her mothers back but has an open relationship with her the chemistry between lauren graham and alexis bledel who play lorelai and her daughter rory is really great all the acting is excellent and the characters though extremely quirky are still believable the residents of stars hollow show all the amusing bizarreness of small town life which is contrasted by the endless snobbishness and social norms that make up the high society life of lorelais parents on one hand there are danceathons and firelight festivals while on the hand you have cotillions dar meetings and cocktail parties all the characters develop a lot and theres a happy ending for more or less everybody there are dramatic elements but also a lot of very witty humor rorys boyfriends are all incredibly hot as are her friend lanes basically its a cool funny very satisfying show which encompasses all the aspects of life and gives you a feeling of if you work hard enough and wait patiently youll get what you want even if it wasnt what you intended
