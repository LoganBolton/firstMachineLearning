fuckland is an interesting film i personally love the dogma movement i wish it had lasted longer it seems to have already died many critics tried their damndest to shut it down i dont know why its the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the french new wave besides fuckland ive seen the first three in the series festen idioterne and mifune they were all great festen being a masterpiece in my opinion fuckland isnt up to those others i was just fascinated with the filmmaking its played as if it were a real documentary with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to put it down at a few points in the film it becomes clear that it is a work of complete fiction but that illusion was protracted for an amazing amount of time i wish that the filmmakers would have come up with something a bit more interesting to put onscreen it is basically about this guy fabian who is an argentinian visiting the faulkland islands argentinians were only in the last couple of months allowed onto the islands and fabian plans to impregnate the women with argentinian children he sets his eyes on one and most of the movie is spent on her seduction the two actors are very natural camilla heany only kind of hints that she is an actress fabian stratas seems completely real the politics of the film are somewhat confusing to me since i have only an inkling of the situation surrounding the island and its recent history i was 3 i think when the faulklands were invaded the final bit of the film doesnt work at all i dont get what the filmmakers were going for there still fuckland is an interesting dogma experiment it does break some dogma rules though notably the no extradiagetic music rule there is a lot of that 710
