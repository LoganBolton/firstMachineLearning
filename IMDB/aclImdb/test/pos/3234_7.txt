i think this film version of northanger abbey is actually quite good it certainly is amusing well its not a masterpiece as pride and prejudice 95 but theres very good stuff in it especially the city of bath setting the royal crescent the roman baths the fascinating georgian atmosphere that is excellent if you are a bath fan like myself youll love watching this film the performances may sound a bit too melodramatic but ive got the impression that this film like the novel itself is deliberately making fun of the popular tales of romance and terror and of the society of the period the only drawback is probably the female lead as i personally have another idea of catherine morlands physical appearance the music is also a bit unusual but i strangely find it acceptable despite its got nothing to do with the historical period portrayed im wondering what would dear old jane think
