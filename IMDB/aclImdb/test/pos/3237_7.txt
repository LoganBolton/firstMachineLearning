ive just watched this again on the bbc channel 4 its not jane austens best novel by any means but the film is a reasonable interpretation i suspect the assembly rooms at bath would have been rather more crowded than shown perhaps they couldnt afford the extras also why does everyone shut up so that the dancing couple can have an audible conversation ive never heard anything anyone has ever said to me when ive been dancing and i suspect it would have been the same in the 1819th century in bathbr br i cannot believe the uscanada reviews they completely miss the ironic element that is in the film throughout the gothic scenes are quite cleverly presented but you need to read them properly im sure jane a would be mildly amused by those reviews a propos of nothing does anyone else think that peter firth gets to look more like colin baker a former doctor who or viceversa the older they both get
