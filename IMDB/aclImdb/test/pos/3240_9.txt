i got this movie with my bbc jane austen collection 5 dvds of old bbc adaptations and didnt like it at first its completely different from the others and it lacks or so i thought one of the qualities that i enjoy in all other austen movies cheerful common sense the nightmare scene in which mrs richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsettingbr br i still dont like to watch the fingersewing scene but i do love hearing mrs r saying dreamily while she sews my only acquaintancetore my gown this movie is now my current austen favorite ive watched it 7 or 8 times so far the acting to my mind is incredible the way i notice good acting is when i find myself looking up from whatever im doing sewing though not my fingers together hopefully or boondoggling or whatever in order to watch the character deliver his lines its the turn of expression the cast of posture that make the words come alive  thats what makes good acting as far as im concernedbr br well i watch almost every part of northanger abbey because almost all the actors play their roles with such charisma peter firth is amazing as mr tilney the perfect blend of bathian fop and real masculine hero  youre not sure until the end whether hes after catherines money or not i love his touch of welsh accent mr and mrs richards are charming the combination of their behaviors  especially mr richards high voice lending counterpoint to his wit and wisdom  makes them so real general tilney as the hardhearted father who may possibly be a murderer is fascinating too and captain tilney the grinning rake who is so clearly enjoying himself and the moneygrubbing sister and brother whose names i cant currently remember  the two of them are so perfectly at once smart and smarmybr br the other reason i love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all the jane austen adaptations i know this was one of austens weak points well it is as far as i am concerned even though all her novels are love stories its hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end and if theyre arent really in love then whats the point all the other adaptations ive seen other than the early oliviergarson one have pretty coldfish kisses at the end if they kiss at all i dont at all like sex in movies but it really is necessary to have a heartfelt kiss in the end and the ending kiss in northanger is a doozybr br the overthetop approach to costumes music and lighting work very well as far as im concerned and the script is extremely clever  the way we are educated about gothic romance highlife in bath cathys normal country upbringing etc is very well done as they usually are in bbc productions also i like the part when the little black page does the cartwheels and the marchionesse i think was an entirely appropriate and very clever expository devicebr br some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what jane austen intended to do in northanger abbey  she meant to make fun of gothic romance not promote it but i dont think she meant to put mysteries of udolpho etc down she was just making the point that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction and this point is made when mr tilney chides catherine in his mothers room besides general tilney was a villain albeit a prosaic one that point was meant to be made surely
