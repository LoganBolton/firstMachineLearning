im a fan of independent film dialogue driven character study pieces are where its at for me some of the other posts are right wannabes isnt going to rival the godfather for best mob film ever on the other hand wannabes is a wellwritten and welldirected picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actoractress my problem with one of the other reviewsbr br  conor dubin stands out as the only irishman in a cast of italiansbr br  dubin is a jewish last name and as such has a dark complexion not a traditional ruddy one of an irishman he doesnt stand out at all rather delivers a great performancebr br this didnt win many awards but it is deserving of a saturday night with a bowl of popcorn i found it for 7 bucks at blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised to say the least highly recommended
