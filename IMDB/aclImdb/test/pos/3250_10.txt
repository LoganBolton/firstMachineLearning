i saw two hands back in sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my alltime favourite films its got action adventure comedy and romance all rolled up into one and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure like much australian film the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging and jordan should justly feel proud of his workbr br anyway it was on tv just now on channel 4 in london and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie but indeed any movie had been cut out so if you watch this movie make sure its the original version
