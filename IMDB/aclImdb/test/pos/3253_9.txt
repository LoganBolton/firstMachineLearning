two hands is a highly enjoyable aussie crime caper which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments with very funny characters and situations to give the film the right balance and feel the comedy of the film occurs naturally and the laughs havent been set up too elaborately  havent been too worked at it really is very funny thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast and that each actoractress recognises and can relate to the aussie humor they portray it very well and very realistically of course theyre helped out immensely by a fantastic script by writerdirector gregor jordan i was reading another review of this film by an american who had seen it and he heavily criticised it basically passing it off as a pulp fiction clone i think that thats just rubbish this film isnt trying to be pulp fiction the feel and style of each of this excellent films are totally opposite without wanting to sound superior or arrogant i think to fully understand this film the humor the sincerity the characters etcyou have to be australian or at least understand the culture which the other guy obviously didnt have the faintest clue about some americans whose reviews of certain nonamerican films seem ignorant to and have trouble comprehending anything that isnt an american product its a real shame because this is a really great film the love story featured between the main character and the girl is also portrayed in a very real sincere and sweet way im very proud to have this film in my collection 45 out of 5
