having seen and loved this film in australia i was very keen to get me paws on a copy i got one on dvd back in the uk only to find that its a very different editbr br the domestic australain edit i saw is snappier the uk and i presume european edits spends a lot longer on the narrator played by jimmys dead brotherand in truth belabours that and few other points to no real benefitbr br it is not a serious criticism but the oz edit is just brisker and i think more assuredbr br i cant say why they felt it needed expansion for the overseas marketbr br so careful about which one you go forbr br i went for both
