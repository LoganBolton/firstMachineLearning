so i turned on the tv today at 100 pm on a sunday expecting to see crap and infomercials and this great movie was just starting didnt know what it was but drew me in almost immediately the movie was excellentbr br there were a couple of things that didnt make sense for one i dont get why the dead guy was talking about doing stuff to get yourself out of your bad situation but then jimmy doesnt really do anything except the basic stuff to survive that anyone would do in his situation in other words it wasnt his initiative that got him out of his bad situation it was just luck second i dont get the thing about the girl killing the the gangsters at the end because the whole thing was partly casued by the thief people stealing pandas money and then the other thief kills panda at the end so they steal his money twice and kill him how is that good
