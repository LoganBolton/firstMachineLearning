i had never heard of this movie but i like heath ledger and bryan brown and the story sounded interesting so i figured id give it a shot i found it to be very enjoyable heath ledger plays a 19 year old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious dough so he goes and asks for work from mobster bryan brown i wont go into details but things go very bad for ledger and gets into big trouble with bryan brown from their on the movie just gets better and better with one scene involving ledger hooking up with a pair of bank robbers and lets not forget the beautiful rose byrne who plays ledgers love interest i would definitely recommend this movie
