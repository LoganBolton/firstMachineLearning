based on its current imdb rating as well as several plot summaries i didnt expect much from two hands but how wrong i was br br from start to finish youre kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while even in terms of miseenscene and cinematography the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination if youre looking for a film which is not only entertaining but also provocative compelling and genuinely extraordinary then make this the next film you watch br br im hoping heath ledgers tragic death will have lead to more people picking up this film he was an incredible talent and his performance in this is one not to be missed dont make the mistake of judging and discarding this amazing film before youve seen it
