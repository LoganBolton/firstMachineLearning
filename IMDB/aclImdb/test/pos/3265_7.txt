its hard to know what to make of this weird little aussie crime flick  on the one hand its an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour but on the other it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above its boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely interesting territory that being said two hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring the absurdity of the goingson the thick australian accents and the bizarre set of characters all help to ensure that the film entertains also the plot follows the story of a young doorman who thinks hell go on to bigger things after accepting a job from the local kingpin he doesnt the job only lands him in trouble when he fancies a swim and stupidly leaves ten grand on the beach which is promptly stolen by a couple of kids who have the time of their lives on a shopping spree however all is not rosy for our hero who must find the money or face the consequencesbr br the film is made up of a cast of unknowns at least it was back in 1999 as nowadays heath ledger is something of a name he doesnt impress too much here however as his performance is mostly of the onenote variety and he doesnt make for a very compelling lead he fits the movie in that hes australian and looks naive but beyond that hes not the best lead ive ever seen in a movie if you ask me bryan brown gave the best performance here he might not have a great deal of screen time but he steals every scene hes in and its him that provides the movie with a lot of its humour hes got nothing to do with the best sequence however which takes place in the form of probably the most hilarious bank robbery ever caught on film on the whole i can recommend this film to people that enjoy quirky crime films as the weirdness is plentiful and the way that events take a turn for the bizarre is enjoyable but if youre not a fan of this sort of film i cant really say that two hands will float your boat its not a must see but if its your thing and you get a chance to see ityou probably wont completely regret it
