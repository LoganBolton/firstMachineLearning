i remember catching this film on a c4 screening a year ago and i was completely blown away by the whole thing i thought the film managed to represent such a diversity of genres the supernatural a love story the intrigue of crime and so many morebr br i was hooked on the whole thing after a minute or so and was really concerned about the characters it made me feel terrified at one second for jimmy and then had me laughing away at the gangsters in the next and all the time i had my fingers crossed that things would work out for jimbobr br heath ledger and rose bryne are superb bryan brown is absolute quality and had me creasing up along with david field who was funny as well as being an evil gitbr br since i saw this film i managed to order it on dvd and as a result every person i show it to has been hooked in much the same waybr br this film is perfect for a sunday afternoon or a lazy evening and its one that you can really appreciate with your mates around
