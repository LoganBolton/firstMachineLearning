ok maybe posse cant compare to other popular cowboywestern movies but thats because it didnt have the funding those movies had obviously whenever you want to produce a story such as this one focusing on african american historical involvement and no servants and mammies are not historical involvement hollywood isnt going to be too supportive and believe me they werent the producers and actors sacrificed a lot of out of pocket expenses to make posse just so that the story could be told i think that alone is commendable posse may not be oscar material and they dont like black media too much either but it is a start it is entertaining and it introduces us to the black cowboy a character most of us are unfamiliar with
