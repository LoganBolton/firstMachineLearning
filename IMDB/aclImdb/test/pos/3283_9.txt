alright so this episode makes fun of al gore im sure it pisses a few liberals off the thing is south park makes fun of everybody much like the simpsons did if you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously with that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best al gores portrayal is hilarious cartmans scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing it is basically everything you would ever want out of a south park episode and it is easily one of my favorites ill wont comment too much further on the plot because i dont want to give anything away
