this was a pretty good episode though no trapped in the closet or cartoon wars it had a lot of things going for it the character of al gore and that bizarreashell super cereal thing was pretty darn funny but the scene that made me adore this episode was one im sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest cartmankyle moments ever when cartman is superstitious of kyle that hell be stealing his goldwhich of course is fake and he comes within inches of his face suddenly kyle wakes up and they have that crazy conversation where cartman tries to act like everything is completely fine cartman crapping out the treasure at the end though predictable was pretty funny
