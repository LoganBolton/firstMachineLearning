challenge to be free was one of the first films i saw as a child it was also one of the first vhs tapes that i owned i hadnt seen the movie in years so yesterday i decided to stick the tape in and watch it wow the story is as powerful now as it was the first time i saw it i think now that i am older i can better apreciate the values that are implanted in the movie selfreliance the value of freedom and the love of nature it is a b movie to be sure but its one that youll remember for years especially if you see it as a child
