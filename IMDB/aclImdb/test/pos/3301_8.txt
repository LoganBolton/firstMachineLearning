watching this hilariously retro but very entertaining career girl tale i was floored by joan crawfords first appearance all i could think initially was my god its the same face as michael jackson in his notorious booking photo br br about 34 minutes into the movie diane baker and hope lange get out of a cab in greenwich village as they walk down the street you can see part of a sign in back of them for the stonewall bar  scene of the epochal riots that are considered the trigger for the modern gay rights movementbr br speaking of baker and taxis i had to laugh when she gets into one and tells the cabbie 56th and sutton place please  and be careful of the bumps can you imagine the reaction to that from a driver in todays manhattan she says that of course because shes pregnant and doesnt want to hurt the fetus but that doesnt stop her from jumping out of a moving car when she finds out bob evans wants her to have an abortion well they had to find a way for her to lose the baby 1959 and allbr br sue carson is delightful as mary agnes why was this her only movie there is no biographical information on her in imdb
