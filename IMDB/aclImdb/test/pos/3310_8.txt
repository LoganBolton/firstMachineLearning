its interesting to watch how late 1950s society is depicted in this film men are lecherous chainsmoking boozers with one thing on their minds time hasnt changed men all that much but sexual harassment has  women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband  settle down some of the dialog is cringeworthy but yet its charming in an innocent pass√© way i love the opening credits that show a romantic exciting view of manhattan with johnny mathis singing the best of everything on the soundtrack i want to jump right into some scenes filmed on ny streets circa 1959  experience a time ive only seen on film  in photographs some scenes in this movie reminded me of melanie griffiths working girl especially when hope lange whos a cross between grace kelly  dolores hart gets bombed in handsome stephen boyds apartment he tucks her in  just watches her sleep like melanie she wants to know if anything happened between them the following day joan crawford is definitely comparable to sigourney weavers horrible female boss except she was outwardly nasty with a soft core but sigourneys character was sweet on the outside  horrible on the inside i found it distressing how the suzy parker character gregg started out as an independent woman with career goals to be an actress who supposedly didnt need a man to complete her ended up she becomes a stalkerlunaticnutjob when she lets the man she falls in love with drive her bananas after hes done with her i loved the character mary agnes the office gossip with her thick new yawk accent if you enjoy films like valley of the dolls youll like this one too
