this is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest in many ways its like a 50s version of valley of the dollswith much of the excesses and sleaziness of valley polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959 like this later film both are about three young ladies who are on the fasttrack to successthough this time its in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry though one of the ladies in the best of everything does have aspirations of broadwaybr br the film begins with hope lange coming into the company for her first day of work shes assigned to toughasnails boss joan crawford who is appearing in her first supporting role in decades despite how nasty crawford seems lange is determined not to give into make it in this job and over time she quickly moves up the ranks from secretary to editor at the same time her two new roommates also try to move up the ranksone through the stage and one through a relationship with a rich playboy like valley of the dolls all of them have their ups and downs mostly downs but by the end of the film there is some hope that at least some of them will make itbattered and bruised neverthelessbr br in this film men are mostly pigs the only guy who seems decent is played by stephen boyd so naturally hope lange neglects him for a neer do well exboyfriend as for the guys played by veteran character actor brian ahern and the rest they are sexist scum and eventually you understand how crawford became so bitter and nastybr br this film has it alladultery premarital sex abortion etc and is certainly not an artistic triumph however thanks to excellent production values and a juicy script this one is a joy to watch just dont expect shakespeare
