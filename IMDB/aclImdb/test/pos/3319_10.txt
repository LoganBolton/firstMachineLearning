if this is not my favorite movie of all time it definitely is in the top five i love this everything about this is perfectthe clothes the set the linesyes theyre not how normal people talk but right down to the small scenes especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes picking a wedgie watering the office ivy plant putting lunch in the fridge identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005 i think all the minor characters are wonderful if someone like joan crawford is over the top its all part of the package if you pick out many things in the movie it is very evident that this was the beginning of the sixties as women were starting to not take it lying down at least not if they didnt want to as far as characters being contradictory for instance suzy parkers character acting like shes all for flings but then getting too attached to louis jourdans character isnt that what many people are likecontradictory they mix in real stuff with scenes like diane bakers character finding the love of her life after miscarrying her illegitimate baby in an accidentlying in the hospital with a big old bandage around her head this is part of the package too its charmglossy escapism i like the mix of real stories pertinent today the stereotypical career woman who only has affairs with married men therefore doesnt have a family when she is older with ones that make you wish ah if only i could fall in love with a doctor and hell love me even though he knows my sordid past and saw me all messed up after the scandalous accident also i just got the dvd widescreen its yet even more beautiful than full screen yay
