you dont have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a moviei dont know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to meunderstanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but i could make out the story because the lead actors and actressesemoted really welland the little girl was really cute she wasnt irritating like child actors in most hindi moviesthe story is really touching and hats off to mr ratnam for trying something differentthe relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realisticallyi could identify with the characters in the movieit was alltogether a movie that will remain in my heart forever and i wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to my friendsalso the songs are just out of this worldthey were beautifully and meaningfully picturisedif only i could understand the right meaning of the lyrics
