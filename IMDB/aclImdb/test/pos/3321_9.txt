a classic late 50s film the superannuated headliners joan crawford and louis jordan are not at their best but the direction cinematography and acting of the younger cast are compelling in a 50s sense which i lovebr br the look and feel of the artsy overartsy contemporary film far from heaven reflects exactly this sort of film and i suspect this film may be one of the models a silly plot of course hey its 1959 but as a film glorious as a reflection of the society extremely interesting and as witness to how hollywood breaks away from the idealistic portrayal of american sexual mores fascinating
