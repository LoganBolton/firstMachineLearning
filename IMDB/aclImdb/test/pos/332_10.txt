i think this is one of the best tamil movies ive seen in a while i love the fact that it doesnt revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly the cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl she was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother best of all are the songs beautiful music and moving lyrics there are some great songs in this move yall especially kannathil mutthamittal and velai pookal great songs both of them i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting and superb songs  cheers simran
