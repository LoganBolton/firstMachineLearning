i first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend it was a fun romp with some cool music kristine was on the playboy cover and the centerfold as i recall shes really cute and perky and has lots of charm the movie made me want to see more of her and so i kept a look out for her in other stuff shes in steven spielbergs i wanna hold your hand and barbara streisands the main event and bill murrays meatballs plus lots of tv shows like night court and tv movies me and my friends really enjoy her but her starring role in alice in wonderland puts the focus right where it ought to be right on kristine as the center of attention probably the prettiest hottest girl ive ever seen in movies
