i remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in anaheim california in october 1976 while driving the tourist laden city streets  we saw a movie marquee advertising alice in wonderland xxx so before even checking out disneylands version of the lewis carroll classic a half mile away our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold i remember even before the movie began how surprised i was to see this kind of film appearing in staid ultraconservative orange countybr br thirty two years later i came across alice in wonderland at a local video store i wondered to myself if this was the same film until i looked at the back of the jacket and saw a picture of lovely kristine debell in the starring role and decided to rekindle some fond memories subversive video to their credit has released two versions x and xxx in the same package as it turns out the version my friend and i saw in anaheim was rated x in spite of the original xxx advertising at the there seeing it the second time around makes me realize what a delightful romp director bud townsend brought to the screen as an example of this mans scope behind the camera in his salad days he directed two episodes of tvs death valley daysbr br miss debell appearing in the april 1976 cover of playboy is ideal as alice she brings a fresh all american innocence to the role as a librarian in her early twenties yearning for a better life when her boyfriend is rebuffed from taking their relationship to the next level alice reaches her turning point this is a musical comedy yet the melodies are quite catchy with appropriate strings and brass to offset the generally suggestive lyrics miss debell has a pleasant singing voice as she trills about wanting to be free thats when the magic begins the pacing of this movie is surprisingly fluid given the genre and the supporting cast of wonderland are there to enable alice as she blossoms into womanhood special mention goes to tv veteran larry gelman as the white rabbit who seems to be the only character not obsessed with sex as he is always running late for an appointmentÂ…or somethingbr br special features include comments from noted feminist advocate lena ramone who imparts how viewing this movie while attending college influenced her in choosing a career as an adult film actress after graduationbr br what makes alice in wonderland such a delightful jaunt is its garden like setting partly filmed in the lush natural splendor of vancouver bcs stanley park the movie belies its pornographic roots you dont come away feeling youve watched a sleazy skin flick at this writing i havent viewed the triple xxx version the extra sex footage tacked on afterward would in all probability disrupt the overall flow and remove the light breezy atmosphere evident throughoutbr br naturally the lewis carroll version is the best way to curl up and explore alices adventures in wonderland however for a time capsule representing 1970s adult film archives alice in wonderland is worth following that white rabbit for a ribald ride full of mirthful mayhem
