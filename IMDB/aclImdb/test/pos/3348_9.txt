i only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really dont approve of pornography all that much pornography has a useful purpose in societycant say i can always think of onebut it probably doesbr br personal viewpoints set aside i really thought this film was pretty funny i didnt buy this movie because it was pornography i bought it because i am one of those alice obsessives who will watch anything about alice in wonderland i own just about every version there is on dvd so it was an obvious choice to complete my dvd collection with this i must admit i was scandalized beyond my expectations and the whole thing would have been thoroughly offensive if it hadnt been so damned funny besides the music is really good and i like musicalsbr br not everyone can make a good nudie musical anyone that has seen the first nudie musical knows what a stinkbomb that was considering what a low budget bill osco worked with alice is pretty remarkable as a musicalits better than some musicals made on costly budgetsbr br the film cant totally escape the dirtiness of porn i usually watch the xxx version for full shock effect and some of those scenes are scandalizingscandalizing because we are talking about lewis carroll i found myself feeling very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene where alicekristine debell starts masturbating it made me feel like a voyeur and the gratuitous lesbian scenes with alice and the kittycats were a bit too raceybr br the film has a great sense of humor about everything however there is one especially funny moment during the queens orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says who do i have to fk to get out of this movie hilariousbr br im not sure i buy the whole sex is good for you ball your brains out philosophy here but sex is human and nothing human disgust mei dont know if i really feel that way but i couldnt resist saying itsome people think everything should be about sex i dunno jeez just show some frickin responsibility and decorum this movie definitely scores points for the sexminded but i wouldnt push your luck next time you might really freak someone out i mean we are dealing with childrens literature here
