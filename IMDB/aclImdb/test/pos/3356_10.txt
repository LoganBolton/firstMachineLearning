when i was engaged my fiance and i would frequent the adult bookstores he would look for his favorite mags and on occasion a video that caught the eye as much as i enjoyed the oneonone with him that the media caused there was never a video that i really enjoyed i had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called xxx it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable all the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot theres only so many times you can watch a blonde bimbo faking itbr br this movie caught my eye and i migrated to it allowing him to wander the shop he noticed how hard was it not too grins i was actually interested in something lol in the video section and came over buying the slightly used copy for me we took it home and i loved it here was a porno with a plot i wasnt sure it even classified as porno but i use the word looselybr br the librarian was a character i could identify with alice rejected her boyfriends advances she was not comfortable with her own sexuality and prudish in her comments bill went away and she continued to check in books the white rabbit ran through the library one book if you notice closely i believe its been ten years since i saw the movie was by lewis c and alice for that same reason that propels teenagers to run into the woods when a chainsaw wielding maniac is behind them rather than towards populated areas follows its the best way to get the plot forward alice finds herself in wonderlandbr br i barely recall all the details but i do remember clearly the swim in the lake and how she was dried off i liked how they got humpty dumpty up again the mad hatters size of member being on his hat to wear it proudly and the brother sister team of dum and dee which did disturb me slightlythen again they could have been husband wife but i never could tell no matter how many times i watched it the woman on the knight who told alice go away and find your own knight whats a a nice girl like you doing on a knight like thisbr br the part that really caught my attention when i watched it about a year or so later was one of the cards 3 of hearts i think who resembled my exs current wife exactly we couldnt help but tease her about being in the movie the king of hearts was interesting and the queen was even more so due to the openness of the forum i cant go into details just say it was orgy based and well leave it at thatbr br when we split up i was allowed to take the videohe knew i liked itbut in the time since its been lost in borrowing someday ill find another copybr br btw if anyone could tell me offlist what scene was cut from the amazon version id really appreciate itbr br i heartily recommend this movie for the over 18 crowd it was soft sweet and really 70s but i liked it immenselybr br  out of 5 d
