overall the dads army movie is very funny although the humour isnt quite as catchy and sparkly as in the tv and radio series so where does this leave us the viewers if youve never seen dads army then the movie is a good way of bringing yourself up to speed and getting hooked on the mad world of walmington os the downside is that you might not get it because as i said the humour in the movie is a bit on the stolid sidebr br for dads army buffs the movie holds nothing new as the story is more or less a cutup of the tv series but its a unique chance of seeing your favourites in high def as compared to the shitty quality of the bbc video recordingsbr br the movie also features what must be the lamest holdup sequence in the history of the universe i cant make up my mind if thats a positive or a negative though
