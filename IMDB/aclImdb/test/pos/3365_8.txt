the second in director cohens trilogy of second world war comedies the others being Â‘till death do us part and adolf hitler  my part in his downfall is a film version of the bbcs long running and much loved situation comedy like most transfers of television shows this movie suffers from an absence of plot and is more a collection of sketches some of which work better than others for example the scene where a high ranking army officer floats down a river is a memorable surreal momentbr br the joy of this movie is its representation of a past that probably never existed and an england which is defined by picturesque countryside and the chance it offers to see veteran scenestealers such as john le mesurier given their biggest film roles arthur lowe is superb as captain mainwaring a bungler who when the chips are down displays great courage and saves the day the climax is probably the characters greatest momentbr br episodes of the television series are of course funnier but as an introduction to a british legend you cannot find anything better
