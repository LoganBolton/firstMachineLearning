the trailer goes nowhere near and only scratches the surface of the film and rightly so too not because it has that obligation to keep its real narrative under wraps but because what actually transpires will provoke entirely different lines of questioning some of which are frustratingly not answered in the film leaving you to your own devices to interpret the series of events which of course means plenty of material for an aftershow discussionbr br metaphorically the box refers to how us humans tend to subconsciously hole ourselves into situations or things in everyday life and how our enclosed thoughts tend to see things from a certain perspective seldom out of the box theres a speech made near the end by one of the characters that will leave you pondering over this fact which governs the basis of the entire film and even threading on existentialism where our bodies are mere vessels for the soul and from cradle to the grave we put ourselves in more boxes in a way of life fashionbr br what i disliked about the film is how it tried to sound intelligent through the frequent name dropping of covert government agencies like the cia and nsa as though theres something overtly clandestine about these agencies that we should be aware of they serve little purpose other than to put every action and every person under scrutiny that nobody can be trusted wrecking havoc in a sense to both the characters and the audience as we try to keep up with trust issues to aid in the interpretation of the narrative having it set in 1976 against a nasa backdrop of manned space missions and in langley virginia also provided that heightened sense of wary that will sap your energies as you sit through it patientlybr br based upon the short story button button written by richard matheson and made into an episode of the twilight zone the story follows the lewis family where husband arthur james marsden works at nasa and develops a prosthetic foot for his teacher wife norma cameron diaz and youd think its all happy family with their son walter sam oz stone until one day a mysterious man called arlington steward frank langella in a twoface inspired facial effect whom we are preempted of in the opening comes knocking and giving them a deal or no deal button in a box plunge the button and theyll get a million bucks were talking in dollar terms of the 70s here although a stranger out there will die if they dont well the deals got an expiry datebr br the story would dictate a deal be made which of course sparks off a mysterious sequence of events that unfold with even more shady characters who nosebleed appearing some whom are inexplicably zombie like apparently all under the influence or employment or arlington steward whether or not steward is death a clandestine government employee a messenger from god or a representative of aliens after an anal probe remains unanswered so whichever way you look at it its as if hes delivering something expected just begging that mankind will shake off its innate greed so that his work can be cut short and to return to wherever he came frombr br if you need a little distraction from the disparate scenes which make up the narrative the production sets and art direction are gorgeous in recreating the 70s look as you try to figure out the mystery of the consequences that stem from a result of not fully understanding the fine print its full circle this examination of human nature of our greed for immediate gratification manifesting its result in longer term pain confusion and further choices that well make based on real sacrifices nifty special effects come into play as well though it just leaves more room open as to the genre of the filmbr br so is it horror science fiction or a mystery thriller its everything rolled into one actually together with a sprinkling of the philosophical just dont go expecting a straight narrative film with clean and easy answers at the end Â– this is like an xfiles episode on steroids
