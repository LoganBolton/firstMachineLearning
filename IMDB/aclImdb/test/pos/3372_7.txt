the creator of donnie darko brings you a twilight zone themed tale of the oddest fashion the film centers on a middle aged young couple living paycheck to paycheck in 1976 one day a mysterious box appears with a red button later on that day a spooky gentleman shows up and tells them that they have the choice to press the button and receive a million dollars but someone they dont know will die its a disturbing and provocative question suspensefully outlined in the trailer and tv spots but let it be known that you just dont know what your in for until you see it at times pretentious and a bit melodramatic the film is ultimately effective because of its good performances and intriguing subject matter it would be unfair to ruin any of the plot twists for you but lets just say the film will deliver on the aspects you expect it to and not completely fulfill others it begins to outline theres a lot of apparent symbolism and subtext in the film which is both interesting and annoying as it wasnt so evident in his other superior film donnie darko there isnt too much more to say without ruining the film for you its meant to inspire lots of cafe chatter afterwards however id also like to say its shot well and has an appropriately aged look to it and its worth a watch check it out
