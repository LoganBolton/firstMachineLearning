id honestly give this movie a solid 75 but i clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic unjustified 1star reviews this is an interesting story all of the acting is good to very good even ms diaz who is totally out of her usual grinningbimbo role here yet plays it well the sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy its a fine morality play and there is no reason to explain the origin of the godsupernatural beingalienwhatever thats running the show so im glad the movie doesnt try its really irrelevant to the story which is relatively long but quite compelling and summed up quite satisfyingly in the ending br br before you decide this movie is terrible or really anything under a 75 read some of the dozens of 1star hated it reviews that are rife with misspellings lack of punctuation and capitalization and juvenile criticisms maybe the trailer was misleading or something  i didnt see it  but some of these reviewers were apparently expecting terminator 4 or saw 5 one reviewer actually compared this movie to saw how utterly inappropriate and unrelated br br seriously most of these reviews read like youtube comments  according to these critics this movie is too confusing yet too predictable not enough action yet theres too much going on too smart yet too dumb explains too much yet leaves too much unexplained oh  and its apparently a waist sic of time do consider the quality and source of the reviews before taking them to heart im afraid these 1star kids failed to understand the phrase altruism coefficient and were therefore utterly incapable of understanding the movies premise despite adamantly claiming that they get it right before explaining how confusing it was if you know what those two words mean you will have no trouble understanding and enjoying this moviebr br i really wish there were a reviewer reputation system here so i could be sure to ignore the rating of everyone who gave this movie 1 star foreverbr br see it for yourself and enjoy the fine presentation of an interesting couple taking an interesting moral test and facing the consequences its a good time in my opinion
