im not gonna lie to say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really and if youve seen cult director richard kellys previous films donnie darko and southland tales you know thats gotta mean something when i went to see this movie there were about 50 people in the theater before an hour into the film about half of the audience had already walked out by the end there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see i for one could only comprehend roughly 40 of what i saw on screen and even then it can only be called interpretation so why did i give this movie a generous seven stars because for one we get some spectacular performances marsdens great and langella returns as a familiar creepy character and most importantly two because its entirely original and richard kelly undoubtedly one of the bravest directors alive uses his creative vision to tell a story that dares to be different quite frankly its the only way  only through kellys unique style could this story be told the way its intendedbr br in the end if youre not willing to spend some serious thought into an intelligent movie and even then it may all amount to nothing stay far away from this one but if you want to watch a deep rich complex and thoughtprovoking piece on spirituality existentialism and the predictability of human nature go see this be prepared for lengthy discussions with your partner howeverbr br note if by chance youve read this review taken my recommendation have actually seen the movie and still believe youve wasted 2 hours of your life id be happy to share my views on the whole meaning and plot of the film see thats why i liked it so much  it promotes discussion as hard as it is though ill try summing it up by paraphrasing a rather depressing quote by langellas character who explains the significance of the simple box to an employee your house is a box which you live in the car that you drove to work is a box on wheels when you return home from work you sit in front of a box with moving images you watch until the mind and soul rots and the box that is your body deteriorates when finally you are placed into the ultimate box to rest under the soil and earth
