the premise is rather original and well thoughtof but unfortunately siding a good story is very low budget that doesnt even allow for decent special effects jeff fahey does his best amongst a poor cast as does the always beautiful linda hoffman they should make more movies together the movie while not worth much praise warrants at least one viewing
