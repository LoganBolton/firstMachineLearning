i wanted to watch this to get a inside look at the show it told the story more of robin williams then mork  mindy still thought it was great we got to see robin always being on no matter what the performance of diamontopolous was awesomebr br the introductions of the main players seem so real to me roebuck as garry marshall was wonderful he was so charming in this which helped me get through all the williams energy the little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows happy days and laverne  shirley was enlightening i also thought richmondpecks harvey was also a nice rock in the pond this is a good thingbr br this movie told the age old story of hollywood folks going through the ups and downs of stardom it kept me glued to my tv and i learned to love robin well hell mostly everybody seem to be the super people i sometimes think hollywood is go figurebr br i sometimes wonder why the network people are always played to be idiots we never saw the head of abc just heard him like charlie from charlie angels i wonder if this way planed it seems so sad that a show at number 1 could be so destroy by their own networkbr br i think this story could be told about anyones life as they climb the ladder of any job movie and tv stars are always loved or hated by so many people that you grew up with you just want to reach back in their past to remember your own past i remember watching the show and always wondering what does happen in their personal livesbr br mork and mindy will always be part of me and i got to see part of them it may not all be the truth its also all not a lie but in the end it told me a wonderful sad happy story
