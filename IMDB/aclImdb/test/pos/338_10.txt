the director of kannathil muthamittal directed the first indian film i had seen dil se which led me down the path of buying well over 122 hindi dvds in thebr br course of four months i can say i understood the total attraction i wasbr br somehow confused as to why the film would stop for music videos it was an excellent movie i didnt know what to make of the dancing and the femalebr br vocals were a bit shrill for my western ears but somehow i found ar rahmens score hypnotic i bought the soundtrack the following day and then lagan kuch kuch hota hai and k3g the following week and with the exception of ichi thebr br killer a few other korean films  i cant be bothered to watch much else kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of hong kong horrorbr br and actionscience fiction films for the past 30 yearsbr br but i should get back to kannathil muthamittal it is one of the mani ratmans latest efforts and i laughed cried got totally mad terrified and most of all i didnt feel manipulated the acting was superb the photography was beautiful i think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting the music fit the movie perfectly and after thebr br credits rolled i wanted to watch again so i didbr br it would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop this is what great film is all about i stood and applauded in my home theater when it was overbr br my wife is watching now and i cant wait for her reaction i cant expect it will be anything less than mine
