for me north and south books iii is the ultimate tv series of the 80s just spotting all those cameo appearances was highly entertaininggene kelly james stewart elisabeth taylor olivia de havilland robert mitchum even johny cashÂ¡ no series has come close to this achievementhave you ever seen anyone looking like lincoln dick smiths prosthetics made hal holbrocks powerful performance even more so the crafted costumes the jaw dropping locations everything its clear that nowadays there are excellent and bright tv series desperate housewives lost24 but north  south was and still is one of its kind dont miss it only david carradines portrayal of the ultimate villain you may call him just violent husband worths the viewing maybe some characters and situations are too stereotyped i admit it but the positive sides clearly cast a shadow over them im so glad that finally is available on dvd in spain
