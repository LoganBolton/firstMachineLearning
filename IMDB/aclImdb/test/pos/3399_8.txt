sweeping drama with great sets costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling rhett scarlett melanie and even lady macbeth patrick swayze and james read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location splendid villains  youll want them all to come to a very bad end lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad secondary story lines also are well developed several cameos by major stars of past eras good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics br br curl up on a rainy day with your dvd or vhs player and drink of choice with this one a lap rug and a cat would be optional
