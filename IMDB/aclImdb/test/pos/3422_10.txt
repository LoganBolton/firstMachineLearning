i havent seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way that i couldnt take my eyes off the screen i was busting for the loo and i didnt even want to pause it because i was drawn right in emotive powerful very moving horrific and heartbreaking it gives you an amazing insight to south africa their struggles and their lives the acting by the leads were mindblowing and the script was incredible despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is i was captivated i dont want to even try and explain the story its way too complex and i wouldnt do it justice please see this youll understand why when you do cheers hol
