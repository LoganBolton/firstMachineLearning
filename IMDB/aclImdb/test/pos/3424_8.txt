not knowing a great deal about the truth and reconciliation commission i can only look at this as a piece of entertainment i started watching it too late in the evening recorded from bbc2 earlier this year but once id started i had to watch to the endbr br the downside is that its effectively a courtroom drama  never my favourite genre  but its stunningly photographed largely in supersaturated ochres and well acted like a good novel i couldnt put it down all the way through i wished i was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice what happened to its release in theatres im an admirer of chiwetel ejiofor since i saw him in dirty pretty things and hilary swank looks terrific in this  very female and sexy for a change possibly out of place but she adds to the visual attractiveness of the filmbr br this picture deserves a wider audience than it seems to be getting
