jaded should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like indecent behavior or friend of the family br br jaded is not an easy watch as its story is difficult to conceive and its not that common in society from the beginning of the movie with the first scene you expect more strong scenes br br the raping scene wasnt in my opinion a well created scene i think that the director didnt use proper camera techniques overall in the movie thats why it looks sometimes dull and becomes boring almost near the endbr br the performances are extremely good from all the five female characters these women gave strong intense but believable performances that demonstrate the actresses dramatic abilities br br the legal concepts helped a lot to understand the plots difficulty because the legal term of sodomy is different from a simple raping from the point of view of megs defense sodomy needs to be penalized as a raping a huge crime grade b although its a different crime pat and alexs defense claims that meg enjoyed and asked for it this is where the movie turns interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth the only thing for sure is that the sex scene fits into a legal definition of a crime br br watch jaded if you like legal issues that arent very common in your society if not give it a try because its a very good and strong drama
