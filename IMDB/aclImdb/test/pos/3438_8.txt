it has carla gugino yay and a crappy ending boo br br jaded is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun but one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down she is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital after that we spend the rest of the movie watching her attempting to bring down the two girls and at the same time learn some new info about who she is and where she comes from and a bit about her pastbr br director and cowriter caryn krooth does an excellent job with this movie considering its uber low budget it handheld and sometimes looks like 16mm but it fits the movie since the story demands a harsh look to it the actors all do okay jobs with what is given to them and theres not really anything to complain about it the standout feature in the movie is of course carla gugino who bares it all in this movie she is actually more nude in this movie than she is in sin city christopher mcdonald is also in the movie but his character is really kinda pointless but he is fun to watch i didnt really pay much attention to the music since it doesnt really draw attention to itself but it gets the job done with what its got the movie is r rated and its that for a very good reason its very sexual and very graphic at times its essentially borders on soft core at times but the sex scenes are necessary for the movie so it doesnt feel like its just there for the sake of being there although there is one pointless scene where we see chris mcdonald getting it on that scene was a tad pointless but its not really much of a problem i guess the only fault with the movie is that we dont get to see the court trial after all that we go through in the movie its like having sex and not having an orgasm or something br br its a shame that the talented caryn krooth has never made a feature film since this this is a highly gifted woman can do great things with a very little budget i really hope that she gets back in the game soon because she is an amazing director jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema instead what we have is an enjoyable movie that shows a great director in the makingbr br hide the kids and close the curtains you dont want people to think youre watching porn whiles watching this movie
