jaded takes on the complex question of abuse the perpetrators and the victims in lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for directtovideo this director however has managed to pull off a textured multilayered study with a decidedly different point of viewbr br given the fact that the directorwriter is a woman and the main detective and da are also women this could have turned into a very antimale film it is not to be a sexual predator is gender neutral the nudity of this film is not erotic the rape is brutal not sexual we are looking at victims and not titillationbr br the gifted cast rings true for a film that is so little known i was surprised at the quality of the performances they are good carla gugino and rya kihlstedt are incrediblebr br somehow this film got lost perhaps it is too smart for its own good it is a should see highly recommend a thinking persons sexual thriller
