ive just finished seeing the film for the first time in its entirety although i watched some parts when it was first shown in britain in the mid90s i truly believe it to be a masterpiece of late twentieth century cinema undoubtledly a film of this scope raises lots of questions like why are there some narrative differences between the 60s hermann in heimat and hermann in this film for example in the first film hermann has a fairly significant relationship with his stepfather he funds hermanns electronic music whereas in die zweite there is little mention of his dad until the final episodebr br one other point does interest me reading up on edgar reitz im struck by historical similarities between him and the stefan character spoiler coming in the last episode it is revealed that stefan has won a prize at the venice film festival reitz won an award for best debut work there for his film mahlzeiten reitzs film company is called edgar reitz filmproduktion and stefans is also eponymously named im interested in stefan being an autobiographical character because aside from helga he is probably the least likable of the friends br br maybe stefans a red herring i dont know what i do know is that i loved this film and wish that more were made like it with the exception of michael hanekes cache and werner herzogs grizzly man theres not enough ambition audacity and passion of this sort in modern cinema i cant wait to see number 3 now
