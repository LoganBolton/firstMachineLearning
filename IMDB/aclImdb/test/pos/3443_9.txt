absolutely i agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a rivetingfascinating and certainly beautiful film its not necessary to see all the episodessince the first ones are the bestwhile the last ones are abit tiresomebut for any person who likes germans and their goodnatured waysall episodes are worth seeingin typical german fashion values are constantly questionedeven its murderous nazi past is confronted in the last episodes the rich dialogues are particularly interesting these episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in germanypreferably in original languagebr br
