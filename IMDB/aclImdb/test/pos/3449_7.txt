this movie has a lot to recommend it the paintings the music and david hewletts naked butt are all gorgeous the plot a story of redemption forgiveness and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching  and its not predictable which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age but the acting is mediocre the direction is confusing and the script is just odd it often felt like it was trying to be a parody but i never figured out what it was trying to be parody of and if its not a parody well it remains a movie with great potential that it didnt live up to
