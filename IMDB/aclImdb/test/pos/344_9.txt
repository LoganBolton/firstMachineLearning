i saw this film at the 2002 toronto international film festivalbr br this is the first indian film ive seen in the tamil language and while it does share some similarities with other indian films wonderful music and choreography sweeping storyline the director attempts more than just to entertain the film tells the story of amudha a precocious nineyear old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from india to wartorn sri lanka gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point though it is a simplistic one amudha is played by ps keerthana and she is one of the few child actors ive seen who can be precocious and yet not annoying her charm and beauty held the film together
