pity the poor reviewer who disliked  didnt understand this wonderful film what a sad life he must leadbr br this movie has more to say about life and relationships than most ive ever seen yet its not dark or preachy like the ordinary people type of film it is mostly humorous though not technically a comedybr br the whole thing feels a little like a fantasy perhaps shakespears midsummer nights dream beautiful intelligent women abound with wonderful cinematography and a noninsulting screenplay that doesnt miss a beatbr br i look forward to seeing it every time this film is rerun on cable its like rereading a favorite treasured book
