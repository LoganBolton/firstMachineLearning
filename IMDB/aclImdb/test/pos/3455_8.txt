i watched this film during a special advanced preview in reading berkshirebr br the two main characters michael and rory strike up a friendship when rory is introduced to the care home that michael already resides michael is amazed to find someone who can finally understand him as until now his cerebal palsey made people think that he couldnt communicate br br rory introduces michael to the life that hes missing rory is a feisty character who doesnt let his condition muscular dystrophy get to himbr br they bond and apply for independent living and find a lovely flat and assistant and have all the fun that they could ever dream ofbr br dont go to see this film if you are after some entertainment do go see this film if youre willing to see something a little differentbr br the storyline is strong the actors are fantastic and despite the sadness that comes with the film the mood is upliftingbr br i thoroughly recommend it though if you are anything like me and prone to crying  take tissues as youll need them
