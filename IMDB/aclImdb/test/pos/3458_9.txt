a stunning film which brought into the open so much about disability that generally makes people afraid it showed how minds can be captured by less than willing bodies and how difficult it must be to witness things happening to others that are wanted for the disabled individualbr br love friendship fear frustration joy humour and so many others things were so well captured the 2 lead characters were very well played by the 2 able bodied actors and invited your laughter tears concern joy and dismaybr br i approached this film with a mixture of interest and trepidation worrying that it might be too much a play for sympathy or dwell only on negatives it was however a beautifully crafted story of 2 friendsbr br i loved it
