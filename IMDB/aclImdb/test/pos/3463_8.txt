its rare that i get the opportunity to review a film for imdb that relates to my own life in such a close way however as someone living with cerebral palsy albeit less severe than michael one of the main characters in the film i dont wish to give this film a free pass just because it tackles a subject thats rarely approached and when it is is normally treated with pofaced seriousness there were minor problems i had with the film and id like to address those first so that people are clear that it isnt my situation which has clouded my judgement of this overall excellent film br br  parts of it i felt were unashamedly crowdpleasing at the expense of realism if i had a pound for every time a wellmeaning member of the public has mentioned electricwheelchair racing to me id be much the richer man but speaking personally that fits more into the public perception of how we deal with our disadvantages rather than the reality of what actually goes on same thing with spending time watching disabled people go to the pub  its not a big deal to those of us who actually do it as much as it might be admirable for outsiders looking in i appreciate that this is from the previously sheltered perspective of michael but i still think hed be concentrating more on enjoying the experience rather than reflecting on what a big deal it was that he was actually there in the first place as such the amount of time we spend seeing them have fun felt like a bit too muchbr br  i felt that the terminal nature of rorys illness was brought to our attention far too late meaning that it was just used as a cheap sentimental device to come between the pair rather than something everybody knew all along was going to have to be dealt withbr br to balance those criticisms i have to dish out a heap of praise as well although i thought some scenes showing them getting to grips with normal life were a touch overdone the script also ventured into some tricky places i wouldnt have expected and comes out with a lot of credit for doing so for instance raising the issue of love and relationships and showing the daily apparatus often used to aid and assist the lives of non ablebodied people also despite the blunt emotional shock tactic of death being sprung upon us the movie as a whole is far less sappy than anyone has a right to expect these type of films to bebr br brenda fricker can and has been performing variations of her role capably on autopilot for what seems like years but robertson and mcavoy share a special interaction that must be noted inside im doing cartwheels that a group of people somewhere have finally made a film doing justice to the lust for life of many disabled persons
