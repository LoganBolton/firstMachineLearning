i got some free tickets via the times to see this little know irish movie called inside im dancing i didnt know a thing about it so had no preconceptions before i went inbr br the film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs and live in a home michael steven robertson suffers from cerabal palsy and rory james mcavoy suffers from muscular dystrophy please excuse any spelling mistakes they form a bond as rory seems to be the only person who can understand what michael is saying they eventually leave the home to live in a flat in carrigmore by themselves they immediately employ the help of an attractive girl romola garai to look after them the two friends eventually both fall in love with the same woman thats the story in a nutshell but there are lots of laughs and tears along the way in fact being unprepared as i was i found the tears were flowing way too often in fact i dont think ive cried so much watching a movie since the elephant man this film is a huge drain on the emotions both in the fun stuff and the sad stuff the acting is absolutely spot on james mcavoy is my tip for greatness hes a great irish actor and i think he has a great future ahead of him steven robertson who plays michael was superb too and it wasnt until today that i found out that he doesnt suffer from cerabal palsy and it was just some superb acting brenda fricker is also in this film and plays the part of the homes manager very well the other great part has to be romola garai she was wonderful as the love interest and i reckon well be seeing more of her on the big screen in the near futurebr br the thing that makes this film work is not only the synergies between the two leads but the script which is just so  witty it literally is on fire i still cant help repeating some of the lines in my head even nowbr br the photography is good although very bleak but then it is capturing a certain type of area of ireland the music is great in this film too as well as the choice in songs the use of the johnny cash cover of the nine inch nails track hurt is inspired br br if i had to sum this film up in one word it would be emotional this film is very very funny and then on the turn of a coin its very very sad i still cant believe that still two days after seeing the film looking back on it i both laugh and almost cry this film is amazing and i hope it goes far although i cant see that as its advertising budget is probably very small br br so go see it i urge you you wont regret it
