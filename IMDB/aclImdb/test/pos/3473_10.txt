i knew nothing about this film until i watched it my brother in fact suggested i take a look normally his suggestions arent much cop however but i was stuck for something to watch so i watched itbr br well to cut a long story short i give it 1010br br the film centers around two people that meet whilst lodging at the same place one is initially very dependant upon the institution around him the other is a rebel one does what he likes the other as hes toldbr br from the first moments of the film we quickly see the friendship between the two building and see how they rub off a little on each other its a remarkable piece of work that manages to tell a good story without twist upon twist people leaping out of bath tubs or superheros coming to save the daybr br theres a fair amount of grit and reality in there not everything can ever go just right  not all gulfs can ever be spanned  and this film delightfully shows the lotbr br if you watch this film and are not impressed id suggest that you dont watch anything again
