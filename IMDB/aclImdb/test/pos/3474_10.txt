damien odonnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalzbr br this is a fantastic film its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently tell everyone you know to go see it now fantasticbr br the acting is excellent and dublin plays a starring role this film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema i cant wait til it comes out on dvd
