inside im dancing rory oshea was hereis the story of two handicapped young men rory oshea who is almost completely immobilized and confined to wheelchair and michael connelly who is debilitated by ms and also confined to a wheelchairbr br set in ireland the film opens with rory arriving at a assisted living center he eventually befriends michael but only after a few tense scenes where rory rebels against the staff and other patients in the usual movie way playing loud metal music using profanity and general obnoxiousness his budding friendship with michael is cemented by the fact that rory seems to be the only one who understands michael or is at least willing to trybr br eventually through some trial and tribulation the pair petition and are granted the right to live own their own in specially adapted apartment the apartment is paid for by michaels father who had essentially abandoned him do to his disability the two also hire an attractive assistant named siobhan played by romola garaito help them with their day to day living this is essentially where the crux of the film develops as both develop feelings for her michael is struck particularly hard unfortunately for both but michael especially siobhan does not feel the same and it results in her having to leave as michael temporarily regresses and wants to return to the asst living center rory convinces him to continue to live on his own the film ends on a sad note that many viewers may have seen coming but ultimately we are left feeling that michael has truly become independent and the future is his as rory pointed out to him towards the end of moviebr br you know i cant say that ive seen a lot of handicapped films and i dont know if they could be considered a specific genre but there is a type of formula to them one person is unwilling to live beyond his illness until some liberating force compels himher to do so and inside im dancing is really know different what works however is it probably is more subtle about the peaks and valleys the two men go through then what you might expect there are no intentionally gratuitous moments and no stand up and cheer manipulations the sad parts are sad and the funny parts are funny some viewers might recoil a bit that rory is the spiky haired punk type with the earing in his nose as the too perfect rebel clich√© but the actor james mcavoy somehow makes it real the same can be said for steven robertson who plays michael when michaels heart is broken it doesnt seem to be invoked by a poor script trying to get the audience worked up but rather a young man genuinely in pain over unrequited love the kind of pain many can relate to whatever their physical condition again these are the types of things that make the film work and make it poignant without being overbearing and enjoyable on many levelsbr br recommended
