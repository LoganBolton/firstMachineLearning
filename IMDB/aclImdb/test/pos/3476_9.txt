okay you saw the film and i saw the film true if not there are plenty of plot summaries out there and there is absolutely no reason for us to waste time on any feeble attempts of mine to create anotherbr br the most stunning aspect of the film is unquestionably the performances by the two young men and the young lady in the leads their emotional honesty was as compelling if not more so than any performances ive seen in recent months i found i laughed cried and cringed right along with them and thats saying a great deal because im often called a jaded and cynical jerkbr br as one would expect the story is rife with clich√©s and i suppose thats the achilles heel of the picture its a story weve all seen many times before we all know how it will end from the moment they introduce rory though you may not know exact mechanics you know there will be a transformative friendship a bittersweet romance and a gutwrenching conclusion if it werent for the strong cast and directing this film would be nothing more than the soporific swill that comprises eighty percent of the hallmark channels program schedule
