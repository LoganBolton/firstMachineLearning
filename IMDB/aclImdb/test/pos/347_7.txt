i love just about everything the late al adamson directed in his long and varied career but the possession of nurse sherri stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly gradez schlockfests like horror of the blood monsters and dracula vs frankenstein this film is actually scary am i saying that youre going to jump out of your seat when you watch nurse sherri no of course not but this pastiche of elements from the exorcist ruby and carrie is one of those nice eerie little horror movies common to the seventies you cant put your finger on whats so spooky about it but the film drips with atmosphere and what an ending dont worry i wont spoil it for you adamson and producer sam sherman really nailed it with this one and it doesnt matter whether nurse sherri was a calculated success or a happy accident jill jacobson is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader bill roy who shines in his brief role geoffrey land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend there are some blaxploitative elements here profit was the bottom line with these cheap drivein flicks after all but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing nurse sherri was a poverty row production and it shows at times sets special effects etc still the film has heart mostly decent acting and direction and some genuine chills sam sherman also saw fit to use harry lubins theme music for the late 50searly 60s television series one step beyond in this film which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere the dvd contains two significantly different cuts of the movie the early version features a lot of ta that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff as well as the theatrical trailer the tv spot and a great commentary by sherman does anybody know whatever happened to bill roy by the way next to john carradine hes the best actor ive ever seen in an al adamson film and he plays the cult leader like he means it
