i just witnessed a movie that by all rights should have been fodder for a second rate mow on lifetimebut trust the irish to keep it from being anything but saccharine the setup all but screams heres a message concerning whats truly important in life but the execution was way into the lets see just what we can get away with herebr br it helps to have two fantastic actors in the leads  james mcavoy as rory and stephen robertson as michael while rory is offered up as the near saintly one  never mind the language and attitude hes the life force in this piece and could easily have been insufferable in his ultimately caring attitude  mcavoy keeps him sharp enough to keep him from being too sweet but the revelation is stephen robertson as michael not since leonardo di caprio in gilbert grape has anyone so perfectly captured a person with an affliction that i began to believe he really was an actor with cerebral palsy and his eyesmy god he can rip you apart with thembr br this movie is to paraphrase rory fn amazing go see it take a box of kleenex and enjoy every wellearned tearand laugh
