due to its predictable secondrate title the one it was distributed under in italy at least i didnt expect much from this movie thought itd be another cheap flick about a haunted house la casa maledetta means the cursed house well i had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene the constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres reminded me a bit of the exorcist and some of its decent italian ripoffs but this was going to be something completely different this is more like hitchcock meets italian thriller very well written and directed good actors interesting plot ok ive tried not to spoil the viewing of 7 hyden park for you which id highly recommend to everyone br br ps am i wrong or when joanna crawls or tries hard to stand shes paralyzed from the waist down her feet and legs move a little too much  and im not talking of the bad dream sequence
