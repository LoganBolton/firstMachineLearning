the last film by underrated director alberto de martino the antichrist the killer is on the phone is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans there are some very disturbing themes child abuse phony priests loads of creepy moments plot twists left  right outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes especially the opening sequence which is some kind of prologue is a powerful piece of horror what is it about ordinary child dolls that make them so creepy when the anonymous man dressed up like a priest assaulted a little girl and the broken head of her doll bounced down a flight of stairs it really sent cold shivers through my spine years later the young girl from the prologue is an adult woman bound to a wheelchair she inherited a lot of money but uses her fortune to stimulate fellow handicapped people to practice sports and to remain positiveminded she  joanna  falls in love with her personal coach and they get married right away naturally hes only after her money and starts terrorizing joanna by making her relive the childhood trauma that crippled her the repeated images of a sinister looking priest guided by eerie tunes and a nursery rhyme provide formula for a murder with a ton of genuine scares and alberto de martinos directing is very resolute the acting is quite competent with david warbeck the beyond the black cat in a glorious greedy villain role due some plot holes and a lack of originality this movie might not be able to compete with italys best horror efforts but it definitely deserves more attention many formerly obscure and unknown italian gialli received marvelous dvdreleases and hopefully formula for a murder will be given the same treatment really soon in the meantime good luck tracking this baby down
