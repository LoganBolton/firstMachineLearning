no real plot no character development no scorceselevel direction but seriously were you really expecting any of this the only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious nearly on the same level as borat sure the ending drags a bit but if borats cameo didnt crack you up you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys sacha baron cohen is possibly the greatest comedian alive and here he gets more laughs than jude law on a nude beach i dare you not to laughbr br if you can pull the tenfoot pole out of your behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character see this stupid movie youll be glad you did keep it real
