the ali g show was really something amazing  he was so stupid wannabe rapper but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending sasha cohen is actually very intelligent guy who pretends to be stupid so he could get really honest answers from people and it is very funny so i didnt expect movie to be good cause it was all acted  no real people or interviews so the basic point of all show was lost but i was wrong  i laughed all the time it was one of the funniest films i ever saw sure it was stupid but who cares if you cant actually brake in to safe with a car battery like someone said it wasnt supposed to be a realistic documentary and it isnt like the show it goes in totally different way but that doesnt mean it is bad when i finished watching i was totally impressed but now when some time passed i realized that it was not that special anyway but it still deserves a nine  well at least for what it is supposed to be
