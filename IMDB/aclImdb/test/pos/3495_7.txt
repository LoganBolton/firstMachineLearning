anyone who has seen ali g before should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is ali g indahouse br br although i prefer ali g when he is interviewing the rich and famous his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen toobr br ridiculous plot ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script that all make this film a riot for fans of ali gbr br if youve seen him and didnt like him then avoid this film like the plague because its definitely just more of the same for everybody else  watch it aiiii 710
