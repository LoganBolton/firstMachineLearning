the ali g character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show but as a movie it doesnt work in the same waybr br dont get me wrong  this is a very funny movie full of biting witty dialogue that caricatures the modern british chav wonderfully well whilst providing the viewer with a hilarious if unrealistic storybr br one problem with this film is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant or its embarrassing to watch when i say embarrassing i dont mean funny embarrassing a la office or extras but rather youll wish they hadnt included it in the final cut one example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film has ended to the tune of this is how we do it whenever i watch the film i stop the dvd when it says the end and leave it at thatbr br overall ali g indahouse is a good film worth watching a couple of times the script is enjoyable to an extent and there are no issues as far as acting goes however refinement is the key word herebr br ali g is a better television programme borat is a better film
