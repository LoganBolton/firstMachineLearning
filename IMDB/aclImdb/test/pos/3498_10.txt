i dont see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor you need to get your head out of your uptight ass if you dont find this movie hilarious if this isnt your cup of tea so to speak then look at it for what it truly is a damn funny movie maybe they did set out to make yet another drugsta movie but in this case theyve truly hit the spot its especially funny for the ali g fans because he delivers everything weve come to love and expect from him so i say big ups to ali g and if its not your thing dont whine batty boy
