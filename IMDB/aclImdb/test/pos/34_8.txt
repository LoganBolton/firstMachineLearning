lackawanna blues is a touching story about nanny a woman who gives all of herself to help those in need its told from the viewpoint of a boy taken in by nanny when his own mother isnt quite up to the taskbr br i have respect for this movie for three main reasons 1 it is touching but not sappy its told in a very real fashion without a lot of the aggravating hollywood storytelling baggage and the ending is quite good teary but not overthetopbr br 2 although its clearly an africanamerican film being set in the postsegregation black community of lackawanna new york it doesnt wear its ethnicity on its sleeve the story stands on the strength of the characters and the dramas and comedies surrounding their lives its not preachy its simply goodbr br 3 it has a great soundtrack cant beat oldschool rb and chicago bluesbr br generally the acting is strong but not universally so some of the performances simply dont hold up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray but considering it was a madefortv movie thats to be expectedbr br 8 out of 10 imperfect but likable good film for a rainy day
