ali g earned his fame on the small screen  though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either ali g indahouse is a hilarious laughasecond fun fest  just like on the small screen he has lost none of his character or stupidity at all and behind all that  none of the film is brainless fluff either a human side to ali is revealed during the film the idea of ali g running for pm is a brilliant fresh and funny one  and the incessant stupidity of staines gangster man is mixed well with the stern harsh world that is politics the film is also full of brilliant new characters  and instead of just interview after interview we get a proper comedy film that never gets repetitive or boring so why didnt i give it ten stars well the ending was funny but also botched and failed  none of it made sense and in parts the film became offensive in trying to be funny  but thats ali g for you  if it isnt offensive it isnt itself and it is totally and utterly ruined ali gs big screen debut was a success in my belief and should have got into the 67 average rating range on imdb but it could have got worse as well and people are bound to have mixed opinions especially on a film such as thisbr br on the whole ali g indahouse is hilarious british comedy at its best  and funniest and most clever a great job 910
