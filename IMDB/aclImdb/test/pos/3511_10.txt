i first saw this one afternoon in the 80s on network tv i think i was like 9picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television anyway ive seen it again years later and its like i rememberedits really goodscary flick i think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasnt followed by a load of sequels ie friday the 13th but its one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better even though this is a killer in the woods flick like fridayit has more in common with the original texas chainsaw massacrethats because the movie lays down a certain atmosphere and feeling of dreadeven in broad daylight and the killers feel more threatening than in friday theres also a good amount of suspense i recommend seeing it now that its being released on dvd in late july
