just before dawn is an excellent horror movie it is atmospheric filled with tension made of wonderful shots of wild nature in which few young people meet their doom in the shape of two crazed fat bastardswho slaughter them jeff lieberman is very talented and intelligent directorwho is unfortunately underrated he achieved to built tension not with gorebut with showing menacing nature environment lieberman succeeds to built a tension in a very linear simplistic way which is also the best way not to show to the viewer the gore but to let him to imagine the worst thing that happen to characters br br just before dawn was always compared to texas chainsaw massacre deliverance and hills have eyes it is as good looking as deliverance better than hills i mean scarier and better craftedand it is creepy as the texas chainsaw massacrebr br jbd is one of the best horrors of past few decades who finally lives on dvd
