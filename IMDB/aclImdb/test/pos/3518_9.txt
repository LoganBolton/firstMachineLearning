for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s its shocking how not a lot of people know about itbr br this movie is definitely worth a look it has all the things you need for a horror movie especially the good old chillsbr br i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago but i couldnt remember the name of it so i came to imdb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title i eventually got the name of the title and bought the movie i still love it as much as i did all those years agobr br buy this movie
