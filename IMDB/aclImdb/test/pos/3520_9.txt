just before dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film the backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like friday the 13th the burning and madman just before dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick the cinematography is gorgeous the acting is top notch the heroine of the film is not your typical final girlbr br constance is a woods girl but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival shes a step behind not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend does the primal notion of survival kick in theres a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the final girls hidden sexuality  coinciding that alongside her will to survivebr br just before dawn isnt for everyone but for the slasher fan its as close to perfect as you can get the killers are very menacing  almost like its a game to maim and murder anyone who crosses their territory the end scene is a bit off kilter for the first time viewer it may be a little shocking id recommend this to anyone whos a fan of the backwoods slasher even nonslasher fans will find something to like about it the setting is eerie and makes one feel uneasy the death sequences arent particularly gory but im not sure the film needed gore see it
