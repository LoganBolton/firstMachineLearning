ignore the bad reviews on here this film is awesome just before dawn is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew decent script and a cool idea for a film its a hell of a lot of funbr br i enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80s slashers because the killer is so unique wrong turn ripped this movie off something fierce theres plenty of blood and scares my girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesnt flinch its got that creepiness to itbr br id say that just before dawn is the best early 80s slasher out there i really enjoyed itbr br 8 out of 10 kids
