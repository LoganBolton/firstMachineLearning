five teens set out to do some camping in the oregon wilderness and despite being warned by the park ranger they soon realize that something is lurking around in the backwoods waiting to strikebr br when it comes to old horror movies the only one that keeps popping up in every conversation is friday the 13th so i took it upon myself to find those good old horror movies that fell short for simply being compared to friday the 13th just before dawn just so happened to be among the ones i found and was really very impressive it wasnt as bland as some of the stuff you find today it was very sharp in terms of character development as it had quite a few likable ones and it has this very casual pace its not in a hurry to get to the hack and slash bits it takes its time to set the proper mood and tone and is very atmospheric and builds some killer suspense by letting you always have that sense of dread like somethings out there but you dont know where it is or when it will strikebr br where i live its definitely an overlooked gem simply because people never heard of it or wont give it a chance but ill state that it is not a friday the 13th rip off the two concepts dont even go near each other but in my mind it is overall one of the more impressive slashers ive seen in a while
