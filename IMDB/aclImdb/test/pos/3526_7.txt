well sadly i cant help but feeling a little bit disappointed after my much much muchanticipated viewing of just before dawn jeff lieberman is a terrific filmmaker and he can undoubtedly do great things with a tiny budget but i nevertheless expected to see a far more sadistic and gruesome early 80s slasher but actually im beginning to think that lieberman isnt the one to blame for this but we gorehounds are its more than obvious that lieberman intended to make his take on the backwoodsslasher look like deliverance and absolutely not like friday the 13th which immensely popularized the sub genre one year earlier the horror and constant sensation of menace doesnt mainly come from the demented maniacs with their machetes but from the genuinely ominous and isolated oregon forests where this movie was shot in case the film seems slow and uneventful this is only because lieberman takes his time to introduce the dark woods and eerie mountains as extra characters in his film we hardly ever see the killers in person but there always appears to be someone luring from behind the trees or from underneath the mountain lakes bearing this in mind just before dawn becomes a highly admirable horror effort and actually a lot better than its contemporary bloodsoaked colleagues amidst a nearly endless selection of gory and sickening slashers lieberman successfully puts the emphasis back on tension and character development the plot revolves on five twentysomething friends heading for a camping vacation in the oregon woods where one of them owns a small piece of land the woods are deserted and naturally the campers ignore forest ranger roys george kennedy advise to return back to civilization shortly after they brutally encounter an inbred family of which the twin sons have murderous tendencies all five main characters are surprisingly likable and convincing no irritating stereotypes for which you dont feel sympathy anyway like slutty girls or football jocks as a result of this natural character you automatically cheer for them even when they eventually almost turn into savages themselves the sublime camerawork supplies the film with an at times unbearable tension level and brad fiedels chilling electronic score only adds to this effect just before dawn is a fine slice of early 80s horror as long as you dont desire blood to drip from your tvset
