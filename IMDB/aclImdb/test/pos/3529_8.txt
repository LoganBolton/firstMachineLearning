one of the many backwoods horrors that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones yes it has a cheesy plot but i was pleasantly surprised at this film because i thought it was really good and really entertaining although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slobbr br first of all we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous but when the teens arrive it doesnt seem very dangerous at all well according to me anyway its a shame that we dont get movies like this any longer and if we do its usually some boring terrible filmbr br this movie more relies on tension and being scary than gore because the gore factor is really low in this movie which i wasnt pleased with but other than that its still a great moviebr br all in all youll have to search long and hard to find this movie and if you do find it you will like it and also watch out for ending with the final girl and the killer its totally not what youd expect
