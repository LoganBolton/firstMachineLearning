29 sept 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my appreciation of horror flicks this was the date that bbc1 broadcast for the only time im aware of jeff liebermans supercreepy 1981 shocker just before dawn and it made a huge impression on me nearly twenty years later im delighted to report that ive finally got my hands on the twodisc shriek show  media blasters special edition and its just as eerie and unsettling as i remember it if not more sobr br the plot as is usual for genre flicks and this was liebermans first film as a director for hire though he did at least remove all the religious cult snakehandling mumbojumbo from the screenplay is a bit thin  five likable twentysomethings including chris lemmon son of jack in a pair of uncomfortably tight white strides venture into the dense oregon woodlands to do a spot of camping and to check out a patch of land thats been bequeathed to one of their number but just before dawn stands out from a crowd of imitators because lieberman wastes no time in showing us just how deranged things are on this particular patch of mountain with a complete innocent skewered and a drunk preachers truck shoved down a hill and engulfed in flames within minutes of the film beginning the youngsters come rolling into the picture in a snappy winnebago blondies heart of glass pounding on the soundtrack and before you can say texas chainsaw massacre theyve clobbered an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first taste of aggro from the heavyset maniac responsible for the opening catastrophes forest ranger roy george kennedy warns them that things are likely to go awry if they go any further but they go ahead with the trip anyway refusing to give the sozzled preacher a ride even though hes understandably scared witless and finally pitching camp miles from anywhere needless to say things go downhill from herebr br although this films not short on bloody horror and wellhandled action scenes the standout moments for me are those where lieberman lets his camera zoom out long and slow from apparently innocuous shots of the funloving kids larking around in the wilderness or just lets it settle for a while on the dense imposing peopledwarfing woodlands he makes the oregon exteriors as threatening and as ominous as kubrick made the overlook hotels spacious interiors in the shining and brad fiedels score discounting the horribly distorted racket that runs over the titles stays the right side of intrusive underscoring the slowly escalating menace with subtlety and flair there are plenty of surprises along the way nods to deliverance with the discovery of a backwoods babe and her freaky disturbing family and a truly bizarre kill technique deployed shortly before the films end i wont spoil it for you ive said enoughbr br quite why this undervalued horror gem fell through the cracks and became a cult item instead of a breakout hit is hard to ascertain but hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years to come  it deserves to be
