it may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of slasher movies in the early 1980s that a few good ones might slip through the cracks this is a great rare film from jeff lieberman who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970s films squirm and blue sunshinebr br five young people head into the oregon mountains this movie was actually shot on location to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired before long they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laughbr br just before dawn is noticeably more ambitious arty and intelligent than some slasher films lieberman actually fleshes out the characters  well two of them anyway  as much as a 90minutelong film will allow him the film has genuine moments of suspense and tension and actually refrains from graphic gore save for one killing right at the beginningbr br there is an aboveaverage cast here including oscar winner george kennedy as a forest ranger whos understandably gone a little flaky from having been alone in the wilderness for too long jack lemmons son chris future brian de palma regular gregg henry blonde lead deborah benson its too bad she hasnt become a more wellknown performer judging by her work here ralph seymour ghoulies mike kellin sleepaway camp and jamie rose chopper chicks in zombietown round out the castbr br some of the shots are interesting and the early music score by brad feidel now best known for his terminator theme is haunting and atmosphericbr br this is worth catching for the important plot twist at about the one hour mark although a moment at about 75 minutes in involving the heroine and a tree and the killer is almost comical it may actually remind a viewer of a cartoon one of the most clever touches is the final dispatching of the killer which id never seen before in a horror film and probably wont see againbr br i didnt give it 10 out of 10 because i cant honestly that i was that frightened still its an interesting slasher that is worthy of rediscoverybr br that deed dont mean nothing son those mountains cant readbr br 910
