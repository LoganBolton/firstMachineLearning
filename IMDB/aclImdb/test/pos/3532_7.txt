id been postponing purchasing this one ever since its dvd release  for one thing because id been somewhat underwhelmed by this directors two other horror titles squirm 1976 and blue sunshine 1977 but also the fact that the film itself is said to have been slightly trimmed for gore on the media blastersshriek show 2disc set i now chanced upon it as a rental and am glad i did  because not only is it superior to the earlier efforts at least on this preliminary assessment but i also found the film to be one of the better imitations of the texas chain saw massacre 1974 this factor however only helped remind me that ive yet to check out another such example  wes cravens classic the hills have eyes 1977 whose 2disc r1 edition from anchor bay i purchased some time ago but after all halloweentime is fast approaching br br anyway the film manages an effortlessly unsettling backwoods atmosphere it was shot in the forest and mountain regions of oregon  with plenty of effective frissons throughout but thankfully not too much violence even if the last of the villains is dispatched in quite an outrageous fashion the principal young cast here one of them played by jack lemmons son chris isnt quite as obnoxious as those we usually encounter in this type of genre offering  despite freely indulging in the shenanigans one associates with teenoriented flicks and which by and large persist to this day george kennedy appears as a sympathetic ranger though he doesnt have a lot to do his characterization is decidedly enhanced by making him a lover of plant and animal life also notable among the locals is familiar character actor mike kellin in a nice role as the drunkard who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the narrative  his warning to the teenagers naturally goes unheeded but hes later able to lead kennedy to thembr br the hermetic family the teens come across in the woods then is eventually revealed to be hiding a skeleton in their closet while one of the girls displays genuine curiosity at the intruders presence the rest are openly hostile to them  and in the case of the burly and uncouth twins appropriately creepy one of them is even prone to maniacal laughter during his rampages at a certain point in the narrative the ranger even offers an interesting explanation as to the nature of their aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior
