i saw messiah 2 a few months ago and didnt get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel  okay its not a million miles away from the plot of seven but its still compelling  much of my praise has to do with ken stotts performance as dci red metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret  itd be easy for stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way  likewise the murders are very shocking but  unlike the sequel where the murders are carried out onscreen in a rather ott manner  theres actually little violence shown br br my only criticisms are that the red herring was too obviously a red herring which meant i wasnt taken in by the shock twist  and you would probably see the shock twist coming so i wont bother with a spoiler alert  and that when the real murderer was revealed it seemed both slightly far fetched and caused a few plot holes to appear in the story  if i remember correctly the sequel had similar problems once the murderer was revealed so maybe itd be a good idea not to make messiah 3
