what can i say you expect only the best in drama from the bbc and messiah is not an exception to the rulebr br messiah is a great thriller a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims tongues and replaces them with silver spoons police officer red metcalfe ken stott and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events before more lives are lostbr br but be warned  despite its 15 rating in the uk messiah is a bit of a gruesome film some of the murder scenes are similar to those in se7en and one or two can be really stomachchurning but if you can withstand that sit back in your chair and enjoy although youll most likely be on the edge of it or hiding behind itbr br rated 15 by the bbfc for moderate violence and strong horror
