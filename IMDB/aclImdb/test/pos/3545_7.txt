i saw this movie in the early 1990s when it had been out on vhs for a little while at the time i found it to be interesting and was especially struck by the ken russell segment with the visions of the accident victim in triage and surgerybr br last night at a 2ndrun showing of the latest indiana jones movie the vision of john hurt prompted an unexpected flashback to aria which i had not thought of in years and the sudden memory of the russell piece itself was enough to cause an outbreak of tears for a little bitbr br if i can make this observation i note with interest the lovehate reaction that people have expressed to the russell segment and i have found this interesting difference in other movies that delve into deep trauma and its aftereffects some get it others do not interestingbr br i see by the comments and the rating that the overall work hit people in various ways this is how it affected and affects me
