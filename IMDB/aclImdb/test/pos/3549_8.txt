im an opera buff and operas are full of sex blood and death it may help to know the librettos of the operas the arias are from to really appreciate this film  my mileage is very different than tug3 i am a classical music lover and i liked this filmbr br i loved ken russells nessun dorma segment and would actually like to see him produce turandot because opera is supposed to be overwhelming truly multimedia experience  but then i loved lisztomania i love turandot and knowing the libretto so well may be why i dont find this segment the travesty that tug3 didbr br the buck henry rigoletto segment is probably the most approachable for the average viewer  they are likely to recognize the tunes and its a classic bedroom farce i like bedroom farces so the silliness didnt upset mebr br the liebestod segment is so outstanding that i recommend people watch this for that piece alone depuis la jour was for me beautifully spiritual and the caruso recording of vesti la giubba aka i pagliacci with john hurt as the clown was wonderful but people just wanting naked women may feel there is too much music and not enough bare flesh and sex
