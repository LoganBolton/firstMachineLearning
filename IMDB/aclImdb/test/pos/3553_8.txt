believe it or not the mona lisa actually got stolen once and was missing for nearly two years in 1911 leonardo da vincis la gioconda better known as the mona lisa was taken from the louvre by a petty thief and former louvre employee who allegedly sought to return the worlds most famous piece of art to its native italy his actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit of course he had no hope of finding a buyer the mona lisa was quietly returned to the louvre on the very last day of 1913 remaining there ever since except for occasional loanouts when arsène lupin was released in 1932 twenty years after the theft most moviegoers would have recalled that 1911 crime and their knowledge would have lent some plausibility to this movie arsène lupin is quite enjoyable with mgms usual high production standards and jack conways usual briskly efficient direction this movie does not lack for pleasure what it lacks is plausibilitybr br john barrymore is the master criminal of the title he specialises in perpetrating impossible crimes which he makes even more difficult by announcing them in advance  but of course he always commits the crime and fools the gendarmes tully marshall has a good scene as one of barrymores victims lupin has a penchant for elaborate disguises which enables barrymore a us grade a ham to indulge his own penchant for tomfoolery johns older brother lionel barrymore is guerchard the javertlike surete detective sworn to catch lupinbr br karen morley was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was filled with populist political activities on screen she was most impressive in workingclass roles that fitted her own political beliefs such as her fine performance in our daily bread in arséne lupin morleys naturally dark hair is bleached a horrid blonde tone and shes all tarted up in posh outfits that make her look uncomfortable rather than sexybr br spoilers coming eventually lupin decides to steal the mona lisa from the louvre he slits the painting from its frame rolls up the canvas and then smuggles it out in a flower basket we see john barrymore casually brandishing a tightlyrolled piece of cloth which is allegedly the greatest work of art in all human history i had to laugh at the filmmakers error in real life but not in this movie da vinci painted the mona lisa on a plank of poplar wood so a thief would have difficulty rolling it upbr br eventually guerchard captures lupin and hauls him off to le calaboose the scene between john and lionel barrymore in the police car is sheer delight as their genuine affection for each other spills out into their characters dialogue i would have found this scene implausible with any two other actors as it is i cant imagine anyone but the barrymore brothers playing these roles well maybe dennis and randy quaid but just barelybr br dont look for a good plot line here but arsène lupin is a delightful example of oldstyle moviemaking ill rate this movie 8 points out of 10
