i very nearly did not see hidehi i think it must have been the title that put me off in those days the welsh language editions of the radio times only used to print titles of certain shows without imparting a scrap of information as to what they were actually about hidehi suggested to me a bad quiz show hosted by leslie crowther or worse an inane us import but i managed to catch a later episode and was surprised to find it written by jimmy perry and david croftbr br as was the case with dads army and it aint half hot mum perry based it on personal experiences in this case his time at a butlins holiday camp before cheap air travel came along in the 60s these camps sprang up along british coastlines providing entertainment for working class families and earning millions for their ownersbr br  as a matter of interest i worked in one such camp in the 80s as a chef  barry island south wales  known to all and sundry as shag land for reasons i wont go into br br set in the late 50s it began with university academic jeffrey fairbrother  simon cadell  taking over as the entertainments manager of maplins a job he was ill equipped to handle his staff included resident comic ted bovis  paul shane  his sidekick spike  jeffrey holland  miserable punch and judy man mrpartridge  leslie dwyer  snobby ballroom dancers barry  barry howard  and yvonne stuarthargreaves  diane holland  and the unforgettable gladys pugh  ruth madoc  who lusted after fairbrother at every opportunity bubbly su pollard stole the show though as cleaner peggy ollerenshaw whose driving ambition was to be a yellowcoat  all the important staff members wore them  a number of sexy girls occupied these coats too most notably nikki kellys sylvia and statuesque rikki howards betty we never saw joe maplin the owner he communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical missives which poor jeffrey was forced to read aloud hidehi was the campers greeting usually met with the equally inane hodeho br br one fan was the late sir fred pontin who told perry and croft that he recognised most of the characters from real lifebr br i always found bovis the most convincing of these as well as the most tragic like archie rice he was the comedian whose big break never came reduced to cracking corny gags for the amusement of drunken latenight audiences he took advantage of his position to indulge in a few perks and in one memorable episode fairbrothers patience snapped and he sounded him out lies ted all liesbr br as with every other perrycroft series the cast were excellent particularly cadell and shane ruth madocs prissy gladys got on my nerves  no wonder anne robinson hates the welsh  but leslie dwyers misanthropic mrpartridge and felix bowness jockey fred qulley more than compensated br br the visual gag everyone remembers is drunken mrpartridge spotting a pantomime horse riding a real one along the beach looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand he decides to stick with it and instead throws away the banana he had been eating br br with its frothy blend of 50s nostalgia and saucy gags hidehi was a big hit for bbc1 in the 80s resulting in a massive increase in bookings for butlins and pontins it went downhill when cadell left to return to the theatre though i never took to his replacement squadron leader clive dempster  david griffin  worse leslie dwyers death robbed the show of one of its best characters kenneth connor was brought in to replace him as uncle sammybr br the period setting occasionally caused problems in one episode sylvia and betty had to dive into the pool to rescue peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark the revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that era still they looked great in them so whos complaining in another ted sang the tom jones hit delilah to campers it was not composed  by les reed and barry mason incidentally  until 1968br br maplins closed its doors in 1988 and the last shot was that of peggy  now a yellowcoat  all alone in the camp jumping into the air and shouting  what else  hidehi br br i dont rate it as highly as perry and crofts other shows but its popularity is undeniable it was probably one of the last british sitcoms to generate tremendous public affection mainly because it featured likable characters in a recognisable setting goodnight campers
