based to some extent on writers david croft and jimmy perrys own experiences as butlins holiday camp entertainers in the uk during the same timescale the programme follows hidehi epitomises the slapstick postcard humour of postwar britain set in the fictitious seaside town of crimptononsea hidehi chronicles the comedic goings on within the maplins holiday camp  one of many dotted along the british coast owned by the megarich but never seen on screen joe maplinbr br although the actual show began in 1980 with the pilot episode and ran until 1988 when the bbc deemed it too tame for its cutting edge comedy department seasons 15 focused on 1959 while seasons 69 spotlighted 1960  a time when the old style british holiday camp began to fall into decline during the first 5 seasons jeffrey fairbrother played brilliantly by the late great simon cadell was the camps entertainment manager a well meaning yet slightly pensive exuniversity professor breaking free of his upper class background and venturing into the real world to head his team of entertainment staff who were in stark contrast to his own laidback personality from season 6 onwards fairbrother was replaced by clive dempster played by david griffin when cadell quit the show at the height of its popularity an exraf war hero who in many ways was similar to cadells character in background but more a scoundrel than a gentlemanbr br however the real stars of hidehi throughout the nine seasons were ted bovis played superbly by paul shane a stereotypical working class ale drinking bawdy comic  someone who could never resist an opportunity to fiddle the campers gladys pugh played by ruth madoc whos currently experiencing a career comeback with appearances in the hit bbc comedy little britain chief yellowcoat what the entertainment staff were called because of their bright yellow jackets and sports organiser  but more importantly the one person who saved jeffrey fairbrother and clive dempster from embarrassment by covering up their inexperience in running a holiday camp peggy ollerenshaw su pollard the slightly dopey yet lovable lowly chalet maid with a burning ambition to become a yellowcoat and spike dixon jeffrey holland teds innocent protégé learning more about show business than he hoped forbr br as usual with a croft  perry production the assembled cast of characters were a bunch of misfits played superbly by the actors involved mr partridge played by the late leslie dwyer who was in his 70s by the time he left the show the alcoholic childhating childrens entertainer fred quilly felix bowness a former champion jockey with a dubious past yvonne  barry stuarthargreaves dianne holland  barry howard the snobbish former ballroom dancing champions who were in the twilight of their careers and sylvia and betty nikki kelly and rikki howard the two main girl yellowcoats who were always looking for the type of fun joe maplin would never allow in one of his campsbr br hidehi typified the slapstick era of the late 50s with its saucy and to a certain degree vulgar tongueincheek humour jokes about people sitting on toilets and anecdotes about women with big knockers were the order of the day but despite its whiff of carry on funniness it was always so innocent and became something of recommended family viewing back in the 80s of course the critics of the show remarked that the show had outstayed its welcome by a good couple of years but i disagree while the early seasons focused mainly on bawdiness and slapstick humour the latter series of hidehi saw more thought put into the scripts and the main characters especially spike dixon  gladys pugh were able to grow with more sensitive story lines that said there were a few criticisms of the show clive dempster was no jeffrey fairbrother and the former didnt quite have the onscreen chemistry with gladys as jeffrey did i personally think it wouldve been more believable if gladys had married jeff five seasons dedicated to 1959 and four to 1960 caused more than just a few continuity errors the disappearance of old faces and introductions of new characters werent explained properly especially with the yellowcoats who came and went with much regularity and the character of gladys pugh who in the pilot episode was made out to be a freeloving maneater that was suddenly transformed into a naive virgin like character also to mention quite pedantically most of the 1959 holiday season was covered in season one so to stretch the rest of the year out in five further series was something bordering unbelievable still the show wasnt meant to be meticulously looked upon and the comedy more than outweighed its flawsbr br all in all hidehi was probably one of the last comedies from the bbcs golden period and even if it never managed to rival such british comedic mainstays as only fools  horses porridge or even last of the summer wine hi de hi will be best remembered as a comedy the whole family could enjoy if you havent already checked it out for yourself i implore you to do so
