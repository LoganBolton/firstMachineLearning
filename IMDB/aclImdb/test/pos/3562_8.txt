this enjoyable eurowestern opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that sergio leone wanted to shoot for once upon a time in the west but couldnt persuade clint eastwood to appear in three toughlooking gunfighters ride into a town one is dressed like the man with no name in a poncho another is dressed like colonel mortimer from for a few dollars more and the third is garbed like django except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it our hero meets them in main street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins any gun can play is a spaghetti western with an injoke on spaghetti westerns since the hero here wipes out the three killers aside from a little too much comedy especially in the acrobatic fight sequences this is an aboveaverage oaterbr br the notorious mexican outlaw montero gilbert roland of barbarosa and his gang of triggerhappy pistoleros rob an army train transporting 300thousand dollars in gold coins across the frontier director enzo g castellari of inglorious bastards stages the hold up from a variety of camera angles that thrust you into the forefront of the action the bandits seize the locomotive along with the coach carrying the gold and separate it from the rest of the train that houses the us cavalry while montero and his gunmen keep the cavalry pinned down pajondo pedro sanchez of sabata commandeers the locomotive kills the engineer and his crew and trundles it away leaving the other pistoleros behind to fend for themselves essentially pajondo doublecrosses montero and steals the gold for himself later montero catches up with pajondo at the rio grande before the bandit can reveal the whereabouts of the loot to montero however a cavalry sergeant shoots pajondo dead before he dies pajondo tells montero about a medallion that serves as a clue about where he stashed the treasure the irate cavalry captain ivano staccioli of commandos imprisons montero but he cannot loosen the bandits tongue even after he uses his whip on him infuriated by monteros reticence the captain threatens to have the mexican shot if he doesnt talk meanwhile the jailers let a priest speak to montero but he really isnt a priest the sixgun toting stranger george hilton of the ruthless four masquerades as a man of the cloth and rescues montero from a firing squad unfortunately before montero is rescued clayton edd byrnes of tvs 77 sunset strip takes the medallion away from him and keeps it for himself clayton is the bank representative that was sent to safeguard the gold he is horrified that the captain wants to shoot montero claytons career at the bank hinges on his ability to recover the gold the stranger stages a fire at the fort to distract the firing squad and montero takes the captain as hostage and tries to escape but the stranger shoots him off the horse before the authorities can verify that montero is dead the stranger claims the body for the handsome reward he will receive and he rides out with the captains gracious thanks no sooner have they left the fort than monteros men show up to rescue him from the stranger from this point on the stranger montero and clayton forge shortlived alliances among each other as they search for the gold castellari and scenarist tito carpi who has penned a number of spaghetti westerns such as a few dollars for django and another castellari oater seven winchesters for a massacre rely on clever humor and surprise reversals to keep the action fresh and fastpaced one cool scene has clayton seated at a table about to eat his meal when he hears some suspicious sounds from behind him clayton pours his drink on the table and sees the gunmen behind him with holstered sixgunsbr br any gun can play lives up to its title in fact many guns do play and at least twenty or more corpses pile up before fadeout this western isnt so much a parody as it is a knockoff of sergio leones the good the bad and the ugly mind you bad guys and good guys fall as frequently as tenpins in a bowling alley but their deaths arent depicted in the brutal fashion of a leone western any gun can play doesnt take itself as seriously as the aforementioned leone masterpiece the three leads jockey back and forth for supremacy each has a piece of the puzzle that will lead them to the treasure but they refuse to share their information until the shootem up finale lenser giovanni bergaminis colorful widescreen photography is spectacular especially the opening shots of the train chuffing along railway tracks with distant mountain peaks rearing up dramatically in the background another great shot occurs when montero tests the strangers imperturbable calm this scene happens after the stranger has rescued montero and the mexicans minions arrive to save their chieftains bacon confiscating the strangers sixgun montero takes aim at the ponchoclad tough guy and empties the revolver placing his wellaimed bullets harmlessly in and around the unflinching gunslinger bergamini who photographed castellaris world war ii thriller inglorious bastards frames the scene with the stranger in the background and his pistol in monteros hand in the foreground for a pleasing threedimensional style shot meanwhile francesco de masis lively orchestral soundtrack is as memorable for its own idiosyncratic melodies as ennio morricones soundtracks were for the leone westerns the opening song is reminiscent of a 1950s hollywood western with its catchy lyrics and guitar riffs although it isnt a major spaghetti western any gun can play is always entertaining nonsense with interesting plot twists and good performances especially the indefatigable gilbert roland who was 62 years old at the time
