bluff has been showing for a good few months at movie theatres in bogota and today i finally got round to seeing it i didnt really know what to expect at all but was very happily surprised it is a crime comedy of the same ilk as snatch etc and it manages to nicely balance elements of suspense with comedy the style of the film is established early on with cheerful music and the argentinean narrator who makes asides direct to camera  odd the first time but subsequently fitting naturallybr br with my lessthanperfect spanish i still found the plot and dialogue easy enough to follow and plenty of the comedy is situational my colombian girlfriend was laughing a lot at the various portrayals of people from different regions and social classes which did pass me by somewhat but for instance a wellacted portrayal of a pompous idiot in a position of power is funny in any languagebr br i think it is to this films credit that it has something of a global flavour i wasnt often reminded that this was colombia that i was watching yet it is important to note that many wealthy bogotanos do live like some of the characters in this film and it is not a misportrayal of bogota or colombian society in any way just a selective portrayal  as is any film supposedly portraying a real situationculturebr br i dont know how much of the comedy would be lost in subtitles but if it comes to your country definitely go check it out it is a very slick and enjoyable movie with great elements of black humour and all in a tightly packaged 90 minutes
