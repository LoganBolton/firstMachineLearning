im seen this documentary in its featureform in a movie theatre and wouah the pictures are astonishing one really wonder how by jove did they manage to film those waves those animals those is that a plant  a predator  a creature from the movie abbyss  anyway its remarkable sure weve seen a lot of such documentary on tv with weird animals and so on but none with such a beauty a precision a deep emotion the only downside is the commentary in french its narrated by fran√ßois perrin usually good and familiar with beautiful documentaries but the text is not good at all not enough informative of too much innapropriatly anthropoid
