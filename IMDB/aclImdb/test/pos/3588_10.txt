this series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet being a staggering five years in the making one would be hardpressed to expect any less i did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones which is naturally only a minor gripebr br david attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative leaving enough room for ones imagination and well spaced out so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery if you get the opportunity try not to watch a translated version of this seriesbr br a definite mustsee for anyone interested in the intricacies of our blue continents and easily the best documentary on this subject ive ever seen
