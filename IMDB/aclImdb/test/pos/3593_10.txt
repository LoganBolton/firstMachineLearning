david attenborough brings his fascination of wild life this time the creatures under the sea in this extraordinary 8episode trip to all the animals under the seabr br the cinematography is astounding bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales but the best thing about it as well as seeing each episode is how they made it whether it is making models of creatures or those impressive shots of the whales they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did itbr br 2001 had some great tv shows to our screen but in contrast to this documentary gem they make them pretty lame but to even boast this documentary series as the best tv series of 2001 just does not sum up the sheer brilliance that this series provides in quality entertainmentbr br overall this is the best tv series of 2001 with no competition and maybe the best tv series of 2000s
