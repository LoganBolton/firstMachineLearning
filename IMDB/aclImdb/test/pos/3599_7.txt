once you can get over nic cage playing an italian soldier who loves opera and believes in making love not war you can get down to enjoying this beautifullooking film this could be used as an advert for tourism in the mediterranean john hurt is great and penelope cruz isnt bad as you might expect christian bales character is somewhat onedimensional which is a shamebr br the main drawback of this film is the adaptation from the book  having been told subsequently the differences between the book and film plots i feel cheated out of a much better and more convincing storyline
