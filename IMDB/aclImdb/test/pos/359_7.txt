being the second last of chaplins essanay films carmen is a parody of cecil b demilles drama with the same title it stands as quite obvious that demilles acknowledged film didnt impress the comedy king that much which he later admitted in his autobiographybr br parodies were not a new experiment for chaplin he had done several of them already namely his prehistoric past and his new job and would continue to do so until the very end of his career in films for instance in a king in new yorkbr br chaplin does a very good portrayal of don josé and edna purviances is very as good as carmen neither act as we are used to charlie is not the lovable tramp and edna is far from an innocent little woman but that was not chaplins intentions either a burlesque on carmen is a somewhat odd chaplinfilm very different but includes good material nonethelessbr br the main story is although very differently structured as in the original drama don josé is very much in love with carmen but is not alone in that field carmen carmen the beautiful carmen is loved by all men under 96 but he has the big advantage that he is an officer and there we are this is the famous story about rivalry love greed and honor seen from a humorous perspective thanks to chaplins and purviances performances and to the wonderful wonderful music by george bizet which i highly admire this could actually have been a nearcomedy masterpiece its time taken into consideration it could have been but unfortunately although it is a good pretty good comedy i dont feel its fair to blame people who claim that a burlesque of carmen is far from being a masterpiece but its important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with any lack of talent but rather a result of conflicts concerning business when chaplin refused to resign essanay contract after completing his last film for the company police they took revenge by editing back all the scenes chaplin originally had edited out from carmen thanks to this the film is somewhat confusing and has several pointless scenes which are more annoying than funny and the film turned out to be rather a ben turpinfeature turpin played remendados than a chaplinshort naturally chaplin was in despair when he discovered what essanay had done and had to stay in bed for several daysbr br despite its obvious flaws a burlesque of carmen is highly recommended to chaplinfans and to admirers of beautiful music
