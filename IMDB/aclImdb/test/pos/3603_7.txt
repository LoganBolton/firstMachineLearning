just exactly how director john madden come to settle with nicolas cage and penelope cruz playing the roles of an italian officer and a greek villager in an honourable story captain correli´s mandolin just escapes me witness a wobbly inconsistent accent by cage amid horrendous overacting with cruz  more adequately cast as a spoiled latino opposite johnny depp in blow  in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a greek nurse ay it was painful but there were saving gracesbr br the story itself is thrillingtotragic and cage does have some  redeeming this is  musical ability next a superb performance by john hurt cruz´s father the village doctor of oscar callibre as well as by irene papas each as village elders as well as by christian bale papas´ son among the village freedom fighters go far towards counterbalancing awkward performances especially at the beginning by cruz and cage nicely the last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses but it´s teethgnashing early on finally the scenery itself and the photography could garner a technical award and such provides pleasant distractions when most needed br br john hurt already has two oscar nominations and this would be a third i hope he gets it as his performance as the doctor makes this film worth seeing the true test of a supporting actoractress is whether or not the film would be the same without the personage in question and in this case it would most certainly not be not even closebr br entertainment value but for the aformentioned plus factors which do help raise the bar see it if you haven´t rating  35 stars of five
