to say the truth i went to see this movie only because nicolas cage is my favorite actor folks may not agree but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies i havent seen a movie with penelope crus before so i was anxious to see whether she is a good actress so heres what i thinkbr br the movie is good i havent read the novel however some moments were really thrilling and unexpected altogether youll find the plot pretty simple so the only thing that could save the movie which an experienced viewer will know that from the beginning would either end tragically or happily was the performance of both cage and crus and it was great great great in the latter part of the movie i even liked a rather broad accent of the actress spanish but for those who dont speak greek thats ok and she even looks like a greek girl overall the movie is highly enjoyable and has a good deal of irony fans of classical music will surely have fun at some momentsbr br i give it 910 you should see it
