i just rewatched this thriller one i had previously believed to be one of hitchs lesser efforts how wrong can you be maybe because im older or maybe because the film gets better with every viewing but now i think its amazing every bit of suspense is wrung out of the tiniest detail and that final scene on the merrygoround is just breathtaking perfect in every way highly recommended
