its a great movie for the whole family i dont think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that theyve never heard of it before sophie heyman is my aunts sister in law my favorite scene is the whole movie i cant even pick a favorite scene my favorite character is hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog if someone hasnt seen it they are missing out on a great adventure ive only seen it cause my aunt is related to sophie and she got a copy from her if someone is reading this i suggest buy the movie and i guaranteed it wont be a bad decision ive seen this movie about five times and every time it gives me the same message dogs are as smart as people just give them a chance
