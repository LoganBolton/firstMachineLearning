the duke is a very silly filma dog becoming a duke but its a very fun movie it has some of those corny pranks that many kids movies have but thankfully no bodily function jokes as so many animal movies feel compelled to have mostly its just dogs being dogs and people being   well people the good guys are likeable and appealing the bad guys are ridiculous and of course the pun of many jokes but there is something dignified about this movie for even though it is silly its not out for every cheap laugh like home alone and othersbr br crocket simon and copper do an excellent job playing black and tan coonhound hubert who becomes the duke after his beloved owner a real duke dies for the most part they just act like dogs no talking or humanlike emotions and attitudes however they do stereotype poodles and hubert does fall for her just because shes a poodle come on these are dogsthey have a different view of beautybr br overall charming fun and enjoyable
