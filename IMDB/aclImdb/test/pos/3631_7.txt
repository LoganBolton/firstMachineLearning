lets be fair there are no rules for scriptwriting so i wont say the movie should be something other than it is ill just state my opinion ok i really liked the script the way things are told and characters are introduced however i think when a play is adapted to the silver screen it could maybe try and fit this other media since this movie was directed by joão falcão the same man who directed the play its not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical its the mans first movie for cryin outloud what im saying is there are parts in the film  like the city of nordestina which slightly resembles the set of hoje é dia de maria  that feel like were not at a movie theater were at the theater lines are spoken too formally characters are moving choreographically and the lightening is clearly meant for a stage sure maybe that was the intention but thats been done on stage wonderful things have been made when adapting a play into a movie  the beautiful closer for instance when i went to see this one though i didnt feel like i was watching a movie but overall it was a good one worth watching its a nice love story funny at times and sad at others my vote is a 7
