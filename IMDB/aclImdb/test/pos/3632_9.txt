very touching film a great surprise to come up from brazil a country that usually exports features about social themes violence sex magical realism is a very hard task and i believe joão falcão has made it wonderfully it seems that he really didnt intend to make a realistic film far from that although many people think the film was adapted from the play he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book another mistake is to think that falcão has been influenced by the series hoje é dia de maria the tv series produced by globo was made after the film but aired before unfortunatelybr br the negative point is the photography by walter carvalho it seems that he didnt capture or understand the concept falcão has created the story is captivating and universal in spite of taking place in a tiny little city in brazil that could take place anywhere in the world a great movie i strongly recommend
