years ago i read the book a máquina the machine as i reread this little book again and again i could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the brazilian culturebr br when i knew about the movie i was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books well happily my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of artbr br i cant recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text also i cant recall such a powerful performance like gustavo falcãosbr br you can see and feel how colossal his love for karina is you can realize that hell move mountains and do anything for this lovebr br do see this movie watch it thru the eyes of the kid that lives inside you enchant yourself
