i know gerrit he presently lives in the us this film is based on events in the lives of both gerrit and celeste wolfaardt its a remarkable story it inspired me to read cry beloved country the film is wellproduced the music is beautifulbr br the story is told in flashbacks you learn the stories of a white racist south african gerrit and a black south african moses their lives intersect violently the ending is not typical hollywood  its unusually realistic and ends on a note that encourages you to think about the characters and the themesbr br be sure to watch through the credits  youll get to see footage of gerrit in real life
