the animation quality here is decidedly below par imo regardless of the age of the oav the plot itself makes sense but the characters dontbr br this might sound picky but considering that the city of olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines would you feel comfortable there as a human would any machine ever emulate human arrogance shortsightedness and greed quite so effectively i doubt it there are some pointers towards this in the movie but only when the team can be bothered to put them in by and large the bioroids or whatever they are are interchangeable with human characters seems sloppy to mebr br the main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement though no light is shed on this little light is shed on the backstory at all a great pity the short length of the film coupled with the focus on mecha and the crime means that we dont see any character depth the groundworks all down yet were left with no finished product a cropped version of this oav would have made a great tv episode once some character subplots had been establishedbr br the highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and the actionespionagebr br the flaws really start to show through once youve had a chance to digest all the goingson so i couldnt recommend this for owning but its certainly worth a watch or two whilst this review is mostly negative i really do think its worth your time to watch this but its not something to rush out and buy br br in a nutshell a watchable wasted opportunity
