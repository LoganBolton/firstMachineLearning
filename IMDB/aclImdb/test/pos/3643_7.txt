based on the manga comic of wellknown artist masamune shirow this animated feature was a slight disappointment to mebr br the story is good but the animation is merely ok while it couldshould have been mindblowing the movie is imo adequate but seems somehow flat  uninspired if you know what i mean a wasted opportunity if you consider that another work by shirow ghost in the shell is considered a classic in many respects it set new standards for japanese animation and spawned among other things a brilliant series called gits stand alone complexbr br i consider this worth a rental unless youre a fan of shirow and want it all do check out the original manga which comes highly recommended
