as i have said before i am not a fan of tweety hes just so aggravating i wish sylvester would just eat him and get it over withbr br in this cartoon sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans he spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys tweety is one of the passengers br br the ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness if only for once hes succeed by chewing and swallowing thus finishing of the irritating canary forever but as cartoons starring tweety go this one is quite good but its all thanks to that brilliant cat
