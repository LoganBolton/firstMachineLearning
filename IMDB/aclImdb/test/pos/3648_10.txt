people who say that some of what the looney tunes cartoons show is inappropriate for children have apparently forgotten something they werent originally intended for children they were produced for the cinema to be shown before feature films and so they could show anything that they wanted tweetys sos has that bad puddy tat sylvester finding tweety aboard an ocean liner and boarding the ship to try and get him but two things work against sylvester granny is vehemently protecting the canary and sylvester easily gets seasick we dont see him throwing up but with his green face they make it perfectly clear that he was doing just that and then of course the seemingly cute tweety has a badass streakbr br its just great to see how these cartoons werent afraid to go all out whatever they thought about showing they showed we need to understand that cartoons werent always supposed to be cute entertainment for children really funny
