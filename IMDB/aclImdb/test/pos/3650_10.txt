before i forget let me say the artwork in here is outstanding from garbage cans to the huge cruise ship the drawings are beautifully done if this wasnt animated critics would be lauding the direction in here because its really goodbr br to the story sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins are slim while brooding at the dock next to a big ship in a porthole he spots tweety in his cage tweety spots him too and you know his first comment  the same one he always makes when he spots the cat anyway sylvester runs over opens the porthole and says hello breakfast tweety slams the porthole window on his face and says you bad old peeping tomcat the cat falls into the waterbr br the undaunted sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard ship tiptoes into tweetys cabin grabs him and is ready to leave when  wham  theres granny at the door with her umbrella sylvester takes a beating as the old lady protects her pet bird once again but flippety gibbet says granny ive dropped my glasses i cant see a thing without em heavens to betsey where are those cheatersbr br now sylvester has the upper handand the normal cattryingtocatchbird shenanigans are on again like grannys glasses sylvesters most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of tweety on them so when she woke up and put them on shed see the bird and think it was okaybr br overall a very entertaining animated short that was a lot of fun to watch as you can tell by the quotes i love the dialog in some of these old cartoons
