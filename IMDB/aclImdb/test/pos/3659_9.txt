the opening night for the south asian international film festival saiff in new york was an event a lot of us were waiting forbr br i would finally get to watch hari om  i was tired of watching the promo on a loop and the lingering taste of the song angel by nitin sawhney in the promo left me begging to hear the rest of it i was impressed by the visuals and tremendously curious about how the rugged looking auto rickshaw driver would win the hearts of the stunning sophisticated looking french tourist i remember being rather intrigued by the theme when id read a line or two about it in the papers ages ago especially so since id personally been very fascinated a few years ago by how flamboyant the rickshaws in jodhpur were the snow and the crowds outside the theater only set my anxiety risingbr br once inside the theater i found that the saiff organizers only presented disaster i was uncomfortable and embarrassed by how poorly the event was organized and found myself in a difficult spot trying to explain and offer excuses to my friends of mixed nationalities whom id invited on the vip guest list i was hoping to prove to them that indian cinema was not always about bollywood eventually and finally the movie began sending some fresh air our way or so i thought hari om  started with chaos and noise autorickshaws honking traffic and a whole lot of chaos i found myself smiling as i felt a sense of home filling up inside mebr br thus began the journey of hari om an auto rickshaw driver in jaipur  the director couldnt have made a better casting call with this character from monsoon wedding to hari om  vijay raaz despite his nonhero looks carries this movie solely on his acting skills and his take on the character replete with all the nuances of a rickshaw driver in rajasthan hes a winner all the way but how and where he learnt to speak english even that fluently is the question however his character portrays beautiful shades of humor and sensitivity i love his innocent portrayal of a simple guy from a village who has big aspirations of being famous some day and yet knows when to cut away to realitybr br camille on the other hand enters the movie wearing clothes that anyone wouldnt dare to wear in a place like that its funny however that no one seems to really care too much about her dressed like that she looks very very dazzling though especially in the latter half of the movie when she changes to indian attire her relationship with her boyfriend however seems very vague it probably adds to the touch of reality of certain kinds of relationshipsbr br the movie takes us through the most beautiful parts of rajasthan  the surprising part is that none of the places have been portrayed anything other than what they really are you see the dirt you see the primitive houses you see rajasthan exactly the way it is yet  theres only one adjective that it leaves you with  beautifulbr br this is the first director who probably knows how to portray india exactly the way it is with the dirt and the noise and all the negatives that india is attached to yet making it look like one of the most beautiful places to be inbr br kudos to him for thatbr br the only downside of the movie that i could possibly see is the pace i found it rather slow at certain parts  but rest assured that you will never be boredbr br nitin sawhneys background scores add a classy international yet very indian flavor to the movie the song angel which plays at a very crucial time in the movie blends beautifully with the visualsbr br ive also heard that besides the main characters all the other actors are actually just normal people whod never ever faced a camera before thats commendable considering most of our so called established actors  still cant portray realistic characters on screenbr br all in all watching this movie was a beautiful experience  it is a pot pourri of emotions its got romance humour realism beautiful visuals and locations  great music a great cast  a package deal when i walked out of the theater  i felt proud to be indian a few days later i asked one of my bulgarian friends who had watched the movie with me if hed want to watch another indian movie  and his response was   is it better than hari om if it is then ill go if not i think ill pass from now on hari om will be the benchmark for every indian movie that i see mr bala are you reading
