the film isnt perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch i am the first one to agree that victor fox isnt really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy i also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes dont work well so what if it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares does every film have to make sense does every film have to be perfect no a person could get razed admitting that they love this film again so what its got lovable characters its well shot the acting is mostly good it never becomes too maudlin or dramatic its quirky look at how many people love i dream of jeannie is it perfect heck no and while this is very different i say check it out and youll be in a good mood after you see it
