too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters i had never heard of it when it appeared on cable after the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since bringing up baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it not until its over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant alienation denial wishfulfillment for a start cathy bates owns this movie shes never been better the whole cast has the feel of the plot and knows what theyre doing without laying on gratuitous hamming except where its called for as with julie andrews bits or jonathan pryces camp videos if youre not openminded you wont get it see mark adnums bizarre review which he devotes to adulation of stephanie beacham her career and her brothers obe for introducing vegetable oil or something to island natives taking that as a cue i might as well spend time eulogizing amo gulinellos stellar cameo as a tv station intern or jack noseworthys shower scene so cast aside all previous concepts of film comedy and have a good time i loved it
