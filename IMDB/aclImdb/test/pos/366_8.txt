this is a wellcrafted piece from everyones favorite master of suspense as usual the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding especially for the films time i did not find the first part of the film very exciting but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after anotherbr br the only thing i did not like about this movie was the choice of farley granger for the part of guy haines somehow i didnt find him very believable on the other hand robert walker shines as sinister bad guy bruno anthonybr br overall i would highly recommend this
