when i first bought this movie i had my doubts about it even though the cast was pretty impressive but after seeing it i really do not regret spending the money in fact id love to spend it again and again and again on movies like this an absurd combination of humor drama thrill and the big questions this is exactly what makes it a great movie okay some might not enjoy what they see and some might even turn it off after a little while your loss its got a wonderful way of dealing with the issues weve all been through in one way or the other and the characters you think you wont enjoy the company of throughout the movie turns out to be the ones you really come to love after a short while for anyone with an open mind and a sense of humor and living  watch this movie i promise you you wont be disappointed
