man i had my doubts i love kathy bates but i thought how good can this be i had never even heard of this thing you know it was one of those things we gave it 20 minutes and well turn it off if it sucks and we were locked in from the getgo this is a very winsome fun movie its quirky you know i mean youve got a lounge singer a murderer and a believable one you have farce then kathy bates in all her acting splendor rupert everett finally acting to his real potential dan ackroyd and a dwarf that will make you laugh out loud i tell ya youll laughyoull cry br br maybe i had a weird week but i think this film is on the level of fried green tomatoes if you dont like that movie maybe you wont like this but i think it was a great movie i went out and bought the dvd
