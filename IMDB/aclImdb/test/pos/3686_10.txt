i wonder why i havent heard of this movie before its truly a magnificent comedy id say farce but its too well acted and id hate to denigrate its quality a comedic character study about the travails of midlife crises the inequity for gays who cant have their longtime unions recognized and the general differences of people who cant fit nicely into society that pairs kathy bates and rupert everett to a wonderful effect forget julia roberts and rupert kathy bates and rupert should do another movie together the anxietyridden acerbic and outrageous daughterinlaw maudie meredith eaton is a truly wonderful character if you liked the tales of the city films youd like this quirky charmer
