i am a huge rupert everett fan i adore kathy bates so when i saw it available i decided to check it out the synopsis didnt really tell you much in parts it was silly  touching and in others some parts were down right hystericalbr br any person that is a huge fan of a personality of any type will find some small identifying traits with the main character of course there are many they wont but that is the pointbr br if you like any of the actors give it a watch but dont look for any thing too dramatic its good funbr br i might also mention you can see how darn tall rupert is i mean i knew he was 64 but he seems even more in this film he even seemed to stoop a bit due to the other characters height in this he is tall i mean tall and for you rupert fans there is a bare chest scenewonderful
