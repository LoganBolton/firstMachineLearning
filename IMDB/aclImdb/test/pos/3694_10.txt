you know people who make comedies so often forget its really ok to be outrageous well not this time unconditional love has it all barry manilow and a dwarf in a movie with cathy bates as the romantic leadand it works not only does it work it works very very well in fact i think its perfect i laughed so hard i think i hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human so honest and so very real but isnt that where great comedies come from dont characters need real feelings real emotions and the ability to feel real pain well they do in this movie unconditional love is a movie you shouldnt miss especially if you need a seriously good laugh or youre at all curious about seeing the psychotic dwarf in the red raincoat
