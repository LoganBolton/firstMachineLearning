without going into any details of a goodif a somewhat provocativetv movie there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is no one to blame herebr br i disagree yes the young male lover of beverly dangelo played by rob estes may be young and horny and good looking because hes not getting as much as he wants from mom that doesnt mean he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter ok he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch tv with her but i dont buy it people have to take responsibility for their actions not only did he cross the line by having sex with a very vulnerable teen when he was supposedly the responsible adulthe said your mom must never know about this how responsible was he then yes its a good flick but he got what was coming to him dont kid yourselves folks that what happened was no ones fault
