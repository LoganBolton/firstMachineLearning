this movie is excellent the passion between jade  billy is memorable and the acting was great this is why you dont leave a 16 year old and a young man like that alone together it shows why a single mother shouldnt date a younger man with a teen aged daughter in the house cause he looked young enough to be jessys sonbr br i give it ten out of ten the acting was wonderful and the movements between the actors was correctbr br the age difference between jenny and rob was good too because they were similar in agebr br overall its a fun movie but i think nobody under 13 should watch this movie because of the sexual scenes
