much about this movie was beautiful the acting the scenery and without a doubt aarons cinematography background showed through on the beautiful shots definitely worth watching as your attention will be captivated the entire time and it ends on just the right notebr br the acting by newcomer jonathan furr was superb as one would think he was a pro acting since he was born he has gone on to act in other feature films but this starring role will always be rememberedbr br the film does have that academy award feel to it at times where its slow and scenic and quiet so its not a movie that add kids can sit through however the rustic feel of east bend and yadkinville played out well as a 1940s era film
