pierre jolivet plays a don quixote character unable to speak living in a world incompatible with modern life he trusts to his homemade weaponry  helmet sleeves and spear  made out of hubcaps seat cushions and discarded office furniture just as don quixote rode rocicante the man rides his contraption literally transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world  soaring above the earth away from the plight of modern man both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world both characters are guardian knights of values unfamiliar to most of the other characters in the storybr br unlike cervantess tale in this movie we identify more directly with the anachronistic ideals of the main character we can only compare this alien and forbidding landscape to the lush and beautiful world we live in our frame of reference is the fantasy realm which the lone knight perhaps remembers our vision would be one which expects the main character to triumph to vanquish to change his world for the better back into a world of plenty that no longer existsbr br we look at this movie and see a true knight among a world of humansasanimals don quixote considered himself a true knight among animalsbr br with cervantess tale we can only see the dreamer without really understanding the scope of his anachronistic displacement in bessons and jolivets tale we see the new world from the eyes of don quixote because we value the same visions and ideals as the crusading main character
