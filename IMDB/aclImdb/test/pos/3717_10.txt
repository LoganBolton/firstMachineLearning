remember that this came out before gulf war i which gave us werner herzogs lessons of darknessbr br le dernier combat is not sci fi its more like judgment ive watched it at least a dozen times it really is a fitting companion to herzogs lessons of darkness and in that time men will seek death but they will not find it for death will flee from thembr br that someday alas may be today in iraq br br but back to le dernier combat make sure to watch thru the very last second of the film i wouldnt call it a surprise ending but it is something youll miss if you just assume the end wont be anything more than what you will already have seen
