this is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie it follows all the rules short scenes to the point cheap to shoot guerillafilmmaking no sets just disused buildings and possibly an empty hospital wing also even the blackwhite filmstock was a stroke of genius probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect but it workedbr br reno was amazing as the brute everyones acting was brilliant the plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you a tight wellcrafted costeffective budget moviebr br released in 1983 this wouldve been made just before the art of bigbudget action spectaculars became refined by the hollywood moviemaking engine and moviemaking was more exclusive and therefore more difficult and more in need of the right people in the right places than todays internetenabled world so luc besson wouldve had to do quite a bit of negotiating and promisekeeping to achieve this result which makes the endproduct all the more remarkablebr br but then again the french movieindustry has always maintained an excellent reputation yes i know luc besson is belgian but the movie is a french production and has been the source of many hollywood remakesbr br if i have one criticism its that the coverpicture on the dvd and possibly the original sales poster bears no resemblance to the movie whatsoever and appears to be a rather bizarre image rather than representative of any of the movies themes  at first glance it appears to be a man in postapocalyptic armour on a swing but on second inspection reveals a man in armour with a lance on an office chair with his legs on a desk in a reclined selfconfident posture this never happens in the movie oncebr br its blackandwhite filmstock zero dialogue physical acting tight scenes and brilliant actors makes this movie one worth adding to your private movie collection a superb movie
