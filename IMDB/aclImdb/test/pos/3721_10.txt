if you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then dont watch it but if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while until you get the details then you will love it now dont get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way br br basically the plot is in a postapocalyptic world where anyone fights in his or their way for survival in this fight they lost the ability to speak i dont want to write more to not spoil the movie for you but trust me if you like sfauthors like lem or capec or even some from orson scott card you will love this movie
