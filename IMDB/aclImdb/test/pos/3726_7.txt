well i guess i was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning this movie wasnt it it plodded along at a pretty slow deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes but there wasnt really anything in it that i was terribly interested intheres an intriguing and mysterious feud between jean renos character and an old man but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character whom i didnt know much about and couldnt really relate to at the time he wanders around alone for the most part he doesnt meet anyone i imagine the director was trying to depict the loneliness of the human condition in this postapocalyptic world or something which is all good but i still wish hed trimmed it down from 40 minutes to 15 because it can get incredibly boringbr br but after those 40 minutes things start to get very interesting i guess i wont really say more than that because i dont want to spoil anything so if youve seen the first 1530 minutes of this movie and are thinking about turning it off like i was just stick with itit gets a lot betterbr br one of the most interesting things i found about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue whatsoever which really made me have to think about what was happening how characters were feeling and what their motivations were why things were how they were in this postapocalyptic world all of which gives the story a lot of room for audience interpretation and its amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors arent telling you exactly whats going on
