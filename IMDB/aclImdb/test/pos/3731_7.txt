i saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline i go to the movies as an escape to leave everything behind and enjoy a story i found this to be a good movie not great but good it was worth my money and my tears br br diane lane was wonderful as always richard gere isnt an overactor he held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect he brings his own style to the moviebr br i think it was the kind of love story that doesnt always get told it was messy and they had other priorities but they wanted to be together and wanted to wait for each otherbr br id definitely recommend it
