wtf do any of his booksmovies end in a happy ending the notebook was goodbut sheesh enough with the depressing endings already im told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life understandablebut sometimes its nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives  to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days dont we already know what really happens in real life cant we  for one moment an hour and a half live vicariously through a movie that ends on a happy note  that gives us hope for our own futures br br yeah  wah i know but for real i think we need to preface movies that end like this one with a warning beware no happy ending
