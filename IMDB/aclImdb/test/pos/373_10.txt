one of alfred hitchcocks three greatest films along with psycho and the 39 steps strangers on a train is as brilliantly outofcontrol as a merrygoround in metcalf and almost as deadly its the kind of film you have so much fun watching you cant even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breathbr br top amateur tennis contender guy haines farley granger meets a singularly weird louche stranger named bruno anthony robert walker on a train thanks to the gossip pages bruno knows all about guys problems with his nogood wife miriam and rather gaily suggests they do each other a favor bruno will kill miriam and guy will kill brunos father who wants to put bruno in an institution guy laughs it off but bruno aint kidding as guy finds out to his perilbr br its a great premise for a murder story and hitchcock gives strangers on a train a run for all its worth with the help of walker in perhaps the greatest performance in any hitchcock film including anthony perkins in psycho while perkins makes his mark playing tetchily against the grain walker as anthony is one perfectly at home either buttering up old ladies at a swank dinner party or strangling a young woman at an amusement parkbr br what drives bruno many commentators suggest his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty guy yes bruno lights up the old gaydar but guy seems happy enough on loves rebound with socialite anne morton ruth roman brunos interest for guy could just as easily be envy for someone making a mark in the world while he lives at home letting mommy file his nailsbr br oh i certainly admire people who do things bruno purrs looking like a cat eyeing a mouse you know it must be pretty exciting to be so importantbr br later on bruno calls himself a bum accurate enough except for our rooting interest in him even as he wrecks guys life with his homicidal meddling its the ultimate perverse underdogs tale theres a sense of integrity about bruno in his dogged dedication which commands our respect and which hitchcock plays to so brilliantly when bruno floats away from the scene of his big crime am i the only sick person in this world whos actually happy for him i think not yet hitchcock keeps the story on a rightenough path for us to realize how low we have fallen we dont want bruno to win exactly but we enjoy his élan as he triesbr br everything else is so perfect or at least close enough to make every shot memorable hitchcock always managed at least 23 good setpiece sequences per movie here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone 20 big shows the neon side at the entrance says and they arent kidding script camerawork a gripping tennis match ruth romans jawdropping figure its all too much greatness for one film to contain even granger does his callowyouth thing here with more risible plausibility than gregory peck ever managedbr br you can call this a clinic in moviemaking but clinic sounds too dull strangers on a train is good nasty fun all the way through leaving you with a nifty stinger at the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all along heck ill take that ride over again in a second
