gerald richard carlson and kitty veronica hurst have just finished celebrating their engagement announcement in france with family and friends when he receives a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle located in scotland geralds uncle reportedly has fallen ill and has requested gerald the sole heir be present gerald goes off to scotland leaving his future bride behind a few weeks pass and he doesnt come back concerned kitty sends out telegrams but doesnt hear back from her fianc√© four more weeks pass and kitty finally receives a weird response from gerald calling off the engagement and telling her to move on with her life not ready to give up on her relationship and looking for answers kitty hops on a plane and decides to pay gerald a visit accompanying her on the trip is her levelheaded aunt edith katherine emery best known for her starring role in the classic chiller isle of the dead when kitty and edith arrive at the macteam estate they immediately suspect something strange is afoot for starters gerald seems to have aged twentyyears in a matter of weeks secondly this once nice and charming guy has turned into a complete jerk who repeatedly demands they leave the castle and never come back when edith comes down with a mild cold kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of thingsbr br why is gerald being so cold and cruel to the woman he was just about to marry why is gerald so opposed to having company why do the house rules state that guests must be locked inside their bedrooms at night why are guests forbidden to enter certain areas of the estate such as geralds bedroom and a large hedge maze out back and whats making those strange dragging noises every night these are just some of the questions the maze poses the movie actually does a fine job building up mystery and intrigue you genuinely become interested in whats going on and patiently await the resolution to explain the weird events that are taking place and then it happens i definitely dont want to ruin the finale of this film because youre better off not knowing but it takes one of the most unbelievable and jawdroppingly strange turns ive seen in any movie its wonderfully ludicrous in a way but it also takes a pretty solid little bw mystery and sends it straight into zgrade schlock territory and yet this ending seems so out of place youre not likely to forget it once you see itbr br despite the ending or maybe even partially because of the ending i really enjoyed this odd bird its extremely talky and slow moving for the duration of the run time but it managed to keep my interest throughout director william cameron menzies who made the much more famous invaders from mars the same year is best known as a twotime oscarwinning art director and his set designs here are also really interesting theres almost a silent movie feel at times with model work for some of the exteriors some painted backdrops and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings as with any good castle set there are also secret passageways and long staircases this one also throws in a few rubberbatsonstrings for good measurebr br a few of the actors are a little stiff and awkward but i liked most of the cast hurst is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who unfortunately never seemed to catch on despite being both beautiful and talented emery who also gets to play narrator in framing shots at the beginning and end of the film is decent enough as the overly mannered and cautious aunt my favorite however was michael pate as the silverhaired sinister servant who does this hilariously upright zombie walk every time he ascends the stairs also on board in smaller roles are hillary brooke who played the title role in the sherlock holmes mystery the woman in green and lilian bond whales the old dark house of course carlson also starred in it came from outer space creature from the black lagoon and some other horror flicks so youve got yourself a pretty decent cast for genre fans right there i say check it out
