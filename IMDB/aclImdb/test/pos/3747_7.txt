i recently saw this film at a 3d film festival in hollywood it was in polarized 3d gray glasses not red  blue it was so much fun to watch this film with an audience the print was excellent and the 3d perfect the performances were over the top and that added to the fun the surprise ending that we arent supposed to share with fellow movie goers at least according to the movie trailer and poster had people howling with laughter by todays standards this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added dimension of 3d complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen this film was an entertaining romp into 50s horror
