a woman and her aunt go to scotland to locate her evasive fianc√© this is a muchmaligned film because of its denouement but up to that point its interesting wellacted eerie and with fine set design by william cameron menzies developed for 3d projection veronica hurst is captivating and genteel sort of a chic british marilyn monroe still in love with richard carlson who is hiding a family secret in his forbidding castle there are even bats in the belfry it moves leisurely until the final extraordinary setpiece when hurst and her aunt katherine emery also the narrator sneak out of the castle in the night to venture into the maze and find what theyre looking for in its center as a kid i always remembered this sequence  theres nothing scarier or claustrophobic than not finding your way out of a 10foot high maze of hedges naturally the two women get separated setting the stage for engrossing suspense with horrific music the final result is mildly disappointing really since carlsons epilogue at the end makes some sense to all the goingson even provoking sympathy worth seeing
