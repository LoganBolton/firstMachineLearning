safer indeed hitchcock is cinemas all time pervert however we all know his perversions are ours as well so we forgive him and we not only forgive him but we applaud his clever way to invite us for an unforgettable train ridebr br i saw hitchs 1953 i confess a week before this one and i put both in the same category as part of his trademarks these trademarks resided in his genius questioning and pulsing his artistic veins that spills psychological drops of blood on the viewer without leaving stains of guilt instead very subtle awareness of feeling ashamebr br the pen is always mightier than the sword and hitch firmly wrote the most arguable questions with his wrist and then holding firmly with his hands he held cameras that always reflected peoples thirst for blood most humans have otherwise comedy wouldnt be mostly a tragic thing and making people laugh wouldnt be so complexbr br mixing all dark elements of high society with a wealthy psychopath bruno and an ambitious tennis player wanna be politician guy the story is one of the most well constructed and guided by hitch inspiring many filmmakers not only with its plot but with tricky images provoking dark smiles and happy nightmaresbr br barely perfect
