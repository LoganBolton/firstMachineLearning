i remember this film of old its a great chilling atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a scottish castle only to discover that there are strange goingson in the corridors at night and there are even stranger events taking place out back in hollywoods most familiar hedge maze yes this is the maze youve seen in every featurelength film that ever involved a topiary puzzle up to and including the shining but the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess i certainly didnt see it coming this is a fine example of how good and convincing a movie can be even when the premise is utterly loopy bordering on laughable id recommend it to anyone
