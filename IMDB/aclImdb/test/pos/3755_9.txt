thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow imdb member ive just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years and i can honestly say it hasnt lost any of its kick i cant believe that channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty br br it focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two outsiders from school specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other as events from both the past and present unfold the tension gradually thickens not dissimilar to shane meadows excellent revengechiller dead mans shoes the acting writing and direction are very bold for 1983 and still pack a wallop today in spite of the upper crust accents of the central characters yes it might be set in public school but its worlds apart from anything put out by merchant ivory i got a state education and can still draw countless parables from the story br br this is a film that youll remember for a long time if you see it  except you probably wont because channel 4 or filmfour have chosen to bury it on their own official website they describe it as an inexplicably overlooked gem from the early days of channel 4  overlooked by who this was one of the very first channel 4 films which would later go on to become filmfour thanks to the success of films like trainspotting so somewhere someone must still have the master print in these days where you can get extended collectors issue dvds of more or less anything its a bit moody that they cant give a film this good the promotion it deserves br br so if one of the channel 4 production flunkies is reading this stop making programmes that showcase people humiliating themselves in the hope of securing a tabloid deal chase up this film and sort out a nice special anniversary edition disc or something please
