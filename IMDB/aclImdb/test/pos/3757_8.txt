i absolutely love this film and have seen it many times i taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on channel four but my tape is severely worn now and i would love a new copy of iti have emailed film four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as i know hasnt been repeated since the 80s i have had no reply and it still hasnt been repeated the performances are superb the film has everything its funnysaddisturbingexciting and totally takes you back to school days it is extremely well paced and grips you from start to end the scene in the shower room is particularly horrific i also cannot hear the song badge by cream and not think of this film this film deserves to be seen by a much larger audience as it is superb channel four please show again or release on video or dvd
