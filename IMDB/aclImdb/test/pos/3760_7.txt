mark blankfield from the old late night tv show fridaysplays dr daniel jekyll a mildmannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drugcrazed party animal this was not of course his intent he had higher aspirations but he goes with the flow this is actually a fairly stupid movie but its also pretty fun of course once the good doctor realizes what hes done hes ashamed but hes also not above doing it all again  running through hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair  gold chains theres a few subplots like jekylls fianc√©e who is the daughter of the head doctor at our lady of suffering and pain jekylls employer and theres tim thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly few real parts and a taste for men and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of howard hughes and who is going to make several people rich with a complete set of organ transplants including testicles yeah the humor is raunchy and silly and overall the whole thing is fairly tasteless but if youre not above a quick wallow in the gutter youll probably like it just fine now available on dvd too for the first time woohoo 7 out of 10
