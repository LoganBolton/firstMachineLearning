in the first transformation scene what is the music ive heard it was the greeks dont get no freeks is that right i really liked that sound i also liked the hydes got nothing to hide in the final scenes truly a doper movie but with many laughs and puns sight gags and slapstick madam woowoos place was reminiscent of some places i have visited myself ivy venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing she looks much different in the movie were talking about but her maturity didnt hurt her a bit mark blankfield reminds one of gene wilder in some ways bess armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time
