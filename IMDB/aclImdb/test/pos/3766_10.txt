coming from the druggie generation i thought this movie was hilarious it definitely brought jekyll  hyde uptodate so to speak my husband and i laughed all the way through it would love to have the movie in my collection i told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it they arent into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie its been so long since ive seen it i cant remember but a few things i would have to say the funniest part was when dr jekyll dozed off on his lab table and inhaled the straw while snoring then snorted up the powdered drug he had invented funniest thing id ever seen in a movie
