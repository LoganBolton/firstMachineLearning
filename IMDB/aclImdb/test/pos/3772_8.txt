so its not an award winner so what have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly the villain and this one could top the listmy husband says that jekyll and hyde together again is one of those movies that if youve been there and done that youll think this spoof on the 80s cocaine culture is a riot i think the whole film is just fun nothing is sacred hospitals plastic surgery howard hughes there are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate to say that the film doesnt follow the book would be true but then a lot of really good films take liberties with the published word also i recommend this movie to all the old stoners among us we may be smarter now but we will still recognize and laugh at many folks we knew ourselves back in the old days
