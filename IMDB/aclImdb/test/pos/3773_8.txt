so its a little dated now its almost 30 yrs old amazingly enough i have this on beta tape and it still plays just fine if it came to dvd id snap it up in a heartbeatbr br the drug humor is not appreciated nowadays as it was back then then it wasnt as harmful much like driving without airbags seat belts and child seats i can remember my father crying he was laughing so hard watching this i had coworkers in the 90s whod seen it and i could bust them up by getting on the intercom and saying iiiiiiiivvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyybr br great lines great spoof of the original and funny to me anyway even three decades later
