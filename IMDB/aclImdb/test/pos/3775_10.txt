i first seen this movie in the early 80s and we used to have it on betamax as we all know betamax went the way of the 8trak tape sigh it really had nice picture quality too anyways im glad i found this movie again ive been searching for it for more than 10 years this movie falls into the category of movies like airplane continuous jokes oneliners funny actions bodylanguage mark blankfield is absolutely hilarious his transformation from the shy dr daniel jekyll into the sexcrazed partyanimal mr hyde is unforgettable complete with goldtooth chesthair and goldchains the part i loved best was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to madam woo woos totally psychedelic experience without the drugs if you need laugh therapy this is the movie to do it when i first seen it i had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly laughing this is a movie i could watch over and over again i highly recommend it
