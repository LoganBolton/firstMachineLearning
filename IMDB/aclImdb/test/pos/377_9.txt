in alfred hitchcocks adaptation of patricia highsmiths strangers on a train guy haines farley grangerand bruno anthony robert walkermeet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of carrying out two murders the rather pushy anthony suggests that he could murder haines unfaithful wife and haines could murder anthonys domineering father the lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain unsolved the tenor of the conversation leaves the more easy going haines with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious complications arise later when anthony murders haines wife in an amusement park and then pursues haines to keep his side of the bargainbr br the differences between the two men are clear from the start haines is a professional tennis player respectable and rather modest about his achievements whereas anthonys life is going nowhere and he admits to having been thrown out of three colleges for drinking and gambling haines is in a relationship with a senators daughter who he wants to marry anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical manoeuvre on haines part to provide himself with a shortcut to a career the character differences are also reinforced visually anthony often inhabits shadowed areas and travels in a boat called pluto whereas haines is frequently seen from the more heroic perspective provided by low camera anglesbr br there are some striking visual sequences such as br br 1 the murder of haines wife which is shown through the reflection of her glasses which fall to the ground as she struggles to free herself from anthonybr br 2 the depiction of anthony alone dressed in black and looking very small against the enormous white jefferson memorial buildingbr br 3 the occasion where all the spectators at a tennis match are moving their heads in unison following the action whilst one head anthonys chillingly remains fixed in a position looking at hainesbr br 4the scene where the roundabout goes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularlybr br frequent use is made of doubles throughout the story for example haines and anthony are originally introduced as 2 pairs of feet getting out of their taxis and going to the train as the train pulls out of the station there are 2 sets of tracks each providing a choice of 2 ways forward the 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskies the hitchcock cameo sees him struggling on board the train carrying a double bass haines feels double crossed when his wife reneges on an agreement they had for her to see a lawyer to arrange a divorce haines wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boyfriends when anthony confronts her before the murder he lights his cigarette lighter and produces 2 reflections in her glasses anthony later becomes very disconcerted when he meets the senators younger daughter who he sees as a double for haines wife anthony also feels double crossed when haines refuses to go ahead with the second murder when haines is travelling alone in a train going to metcalf he sees 2 men in the same carriage accidentally kicking their feet together in the same way that he and anthony hadbr br the action throughout the movie proceeds at a great pace and the performances of robert walker and patricia hitchcock as the senators younger daughter are particularly powerful
