chaplin enters the trenches of wwi in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war the rain the mud the explosions  all these things are present but chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all hes in france for one thing to fight the germans something he does with unbelievable successbr br it almost seems like an extended ego trip for chaplin  a very funny one at that  until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sensebr br perhaps its what all soldiers dream of before the go to war
