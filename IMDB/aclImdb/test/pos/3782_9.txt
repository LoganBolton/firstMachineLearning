fantastic chaplin movie with many memorable moments as charlie joins the army to fight in ww 1br br at first he goes to boot camp where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line thats a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straightbr br next thing you know hes in france in a trench hilarious scenes here include a starving charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someones shoulderbr br when charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring this is such a funny part i cant really describe it just watch the movie when charlie wakes up his legs feel numb so he tries to wake them up it had me rolling on the floor when it turns out his second leg still feels numb while charlie actually rubs his roommates footbr br the movie then turns a bit grim as charlie shoots a couple of germans from his trench although its done in a very funny way and him personating as a tree to get close to the enemy saving a friend of his from a death squadbr br last part is him getting a french girl in trouble by hiding in her house he then has to save her and while doing so he captures the german kaiser as well to do so he impersonates a german kolonel or something i love it when charlie is asked something in german and hes like nein nein nein the soldier looks at him in a funny way so charlie changes his mind ja ja ja the kaiser gets captured and charlie is the hero but then he wakes up again in bootcamp it was just a sweet dreambr br charlie did one of those dreamsequences before the bank comes to mind but who cares this movie was so funny it had me laughing all the way chaplin also has something to say with this movie as his later work became more of a social comment to several mishaps in the world and is explained best in the last sentence of the movie peace on earth good will to all mankindbr br in short a charlie classic very funny timeless 910
