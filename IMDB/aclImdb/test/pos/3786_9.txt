this is one of chaplins first national films from the period between his glorious mutual shorts and the more mature united artists features more opulent than the mutual films it continues chaplins quest for perfecting his comic expression most people forget that the film is actually a dream that charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the frontbr br there is plenty of slapstick via the limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy and chaplins foray into enemy territory dressed as a treebr br by this stage in this career the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves doubtless this was not the case but still it gives as convincingly realistic view of life at the front as i can remember albeit from an ironically humorous perspectivebr br as far as i am concerned familiarity with the entirety of chaplins work should be a prerequisite for all cinephiles  do not delay
