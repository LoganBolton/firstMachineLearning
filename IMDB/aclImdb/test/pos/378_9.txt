in truffaut booklength interview with hitchcock its apparent that big als fear from the police dates back to his childhood his father sent him to the police station carrying a note the note said hes been naughty imprison him for an hour the policemen obliged and ever since hitchcock has had a deep fear of being wrongly accused and taken by the policebr br strangers on a train is probably one of the best in his wronglyaccused series the movie is based on a patricia highsmith novel thats the same author who wrote the ripley series she was always fascinated by smart criminalsbr br hitchcocks opening is very strong and takes you immediately to the protagonists guy haines a famous tennis player and bruno anthony the aspiring criminal the two guys share a chemistry which in that day and age was probably a lot more than what the audience could chew bruno tries to persuade guy that they could commit the perfect murder leaving no clues if they switch victims bruno will kill guys wife who wouldnt give him a divorce and guy would kill brunos father the motives are respectively love and moneybr br brunos performance is meant to be seductive and homoerotic this is not something that was done by accident in fact hitchcock edited two versions of the movie one us one uk in the us version the volume of brunos seductiveness was turned down quite a bitbr br strangers on a train is a very deep movie but more importantly this is another excellent hitchcock thriller an excellent example of a thrilling scene is when guy is climbing the steps up to brunos father room hitchcock reasoned that the audiences attention needed to be distracted at this point so that they dont figure out what guy will find in the room hitch treats us to a huge menacing dog at the top of the stairs which provided the needed distractionbr br the most famous shot in the movie occurs during a tennis match bruno has been continuously stalking guy so that guy will fulfil his end of the bargain kill his father when guy looks at the audience all the heads are swiveling back and forth all except one  brunos hes looking straight at guy with an illgetyou smilebr br the ending is another example of suspense both men fight for one key piece of evidence on a merrygoround thats rotating at mad speed a worker is crawling under it so he could get to the controls when we finally get off this ride and the movie ends with guy proving his innocence we are left exhausted and nailless for those of us still biting our nailsbr br strangers on a train is easily one of hitchcocks best wrongly accused movies some credit him with one of the best villains bruno as well all in all the movie might appear somewhat dated but thats a lesson in thrillermaking from the master himself i wont turn down leonardo if he came to teach me renaissance painting so neither should youbr br  review posted at filmdailiescom
