in these modern times as subject known quite well to the director of the short film that this german count is going to talk about politically correct films are the leitmotiv of the modern young filmmakers projects shoulder arms directed by herr charlie chaplin during wwi the film was released only a few weeks before the armistice is an obvious example of why the early cinema pioneers were a very bold people certainly to direct a humorous film inspired in the terrible bloody first world war was a complicated matter that only few directors with those dangerous and daring ideas could be allowed to do to venture upon such delicate enterprise and with success was reserved only to geniusesbr br as this german count said shoulder arms was made during wwi that time in where definitely the whole world lost its innocence fortunately not the german fat heiresses of this aristocrat and it is a hilarious inventive social satire about that and any war the film it is full of great gags and entertaining film continuity for a story in where that tramp will live though risky and courageous adventures in the front whether a hero for the allies or notbr br to mock the war trenches the unhealthiness the frontal attacks and the germans how you dare by the way there are a lot of inaccuracies in the film  the german soldiers by that time had moustaches and longer beards not to mention that the kaiser lacks many medals in his uniform in an elegant funny and delicate way it is even today a film miracle impossible of being surpassed keeping in mind those terrible wartime circumstances the difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent obviously herr charlie chaplin had very much of itbr br and now if youll allow me i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must go back to the schloss trenchesbr br herr graf ferdinand von galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzienblogspotcom
