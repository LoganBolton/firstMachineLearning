the very few reviews i could find online of barnens รถ really do not do it justice i read them all before ordering the dvd but for some reason i ordered it anyway i regretted it almost immediately but the order had already gone through so i couldnt cancel it im very glad now that i couldnt its an extraordinary moviebr br i wont give a synopsis of the plot because other reviewers have already done that but i will say that i dont understand comments that its bleak shocking weird clinical depressing or pornographic it is certainly very unusual which i suppose could make it seem weird to some people but the other criticisms must reflect the reviewers own issues because i didnt see any of that in the movie i just watched im not attracted to boys so the nudity didnt seem pornographic at all to meits just a kid trying to figure out who he is with no help at all from the irresponsible adults in his life and its sweden not utah so topless women are no big dealbr br but what surprised me most is how positive the movie is in its depiction of this gutsy lost kid who goes on a sort of odyssey through all sorts of strange experiences looking forand ultimately findinghimself its fascinating thoroughly original and deeply satisfyingbr br im not at all surprised that barnens รถ won three major guldbagge awards for best film direction and actor but im absolutely astounded that the actor who won was not tomas fryk the kid whose fearless performance as reine must be one of the most remarkable ever filmed but ingvar hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of stig reines mothers sleazy boyfriend i dont understand that at all but it doesnt alter the fact that this is a great movie
