i rarely write reviews but this film simply demands more attention than it gets as it contains the most hysterical kidnapping gone comically wrong sequence ever filmedbr br i have only seen this once and found it to be the funniest film i had ever had the privilege to watch i laughed from beginning to end it is such a shame it is not out on dvd or videobr br you can only compare its cinematography with that of its a mad mad mad mad world or promise her anything only this storyline isnt nearly as complex as mad worldbr br i hope in the near future this film is released as it would be a shame to lose such a comedy gem amongst the dregs we have nowadays
