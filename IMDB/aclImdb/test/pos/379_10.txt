this is one of alfred hitchcocks best films and one of his most underrated i believe it certainly exceeds a psycho or the birds for technical artistry and brilliance it is a macabre tense darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for quite some timebr br robert walker creates one of hitchcocks most memorable villains as the fatherhating motherfixated but arent most of hitchcocks villains mummys boys bruno it is a disturbing stunning performance that illuminates the whole film his character is obsessive apparently homosexual look at those deliberately effeminate ties and hear how he is described as european strangely charming and dangerous to cross farley granger certainly knows this as he becomes entangled in brunos sordid web after the pair meet on a train bruno knowing some inside information on guys affairs proposes the two swap murders for each others benefit walker will kill grangers slutty conniving wife who is inhibiting his marriage to beautiful anne whilst granger will murder brunos father who he so intensely hates everyones happy right a winwin as bruno asserts wrong granger forgets about the indecent proposal but an obsessed walker doesnt he commits his murder and is determined to hound granger until he completes his side of the bargain too strangers becomes a riveting suspenseful game of catandmouse in hitchs capable handsbr br hitchcock was absolutely amazing at creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes we have the whore miriam grangers estranged wife pregnant to another man she lasciviously slurps a phallic icecream cone whilst openly eating up bruno with her eyes barbara morton annes sister is a deceptively sweet yet smart and cunning young girl who comes out with the most crude remarks youll hear from a bespectacled girl in the pictures in the 50s senator morton is authoritative and selfabsorbed this is one of the most daring films hitchcock ever made and it is typical to a hitch film subtly sexual in detailbr br this fits into the filmnoir category with its focus on murder lies and deceit and shadowy cinematography walkers nut is one for the ages and granger makes a convincing troubled protagonist roman is perhaps weaker than the other two and i never believed her relationship with granger still the overwhelming positives cancel out the slight negatives and it can be safely said that this is one of the best american films ever madebr br just look at what hitch does here the originality the technical skill we see the murder of miriam reflected in her shattered glasses a game of tennis turns into one of the most thrilling intense scenes youll ever see a innocent fairground turns into a place of murder and foul occurrences a young boys balloon is popped callously by walker hitch obviously liked what he saw in the third manchildrens delight at riding the carousel turns into screaming fastpaced terror hitch subverts normal everyday events like no otherbr br the camerawork here is among the best ever seen in a hitchcock film and the premise is todiefor its slick oozes sophistication and devilish charm the crosscutting between walker and grangers characters is magnificent grangers doordie tennis match is just as vital as villain walkers rescue of an incriminating piece of evidence lost down a drain hitch again build his villain into a nasty repulsive yet sympathetic and oddly charming did anyone else find him strangely attractive more so than granger piece of work we are just as tense as walker in our hope that he can get the lighter out of the drain we need him to anyway he holds the key to the storybr br youll never view an approach from a stranger in the same way again after seeing this filmbr br amazingbr br 1010
