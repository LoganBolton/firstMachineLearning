some spoilers includedbr br although many commentators have called this film surreal the term fits poorly here to quote from encyclopedia britannicas surreal meansbr br fantastic or incongruous imagery one neednt explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky tenyearold boy at large and seeking his fortune in the drivers seat of a red mustang could be fantastic those curious might read james kincaid but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car hed surely protest no way what fantasies and incongruities the film offers mostly appear within the first fifteen minutes thereafter we get more iterations of the same in an evercruder and more squalid progression that far from incongruous soon proves predictable not that it were on the other hand literally believable but it were unfair to tax motorama in particular with this flaw any plausible suspension of disbelief having fallen precipitously on the typical filmmakers and viewers scale of values ever since raiders of the lost ark became a blockbusterbr br hallucinatory how do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing that we are having one at any rate some people know that they enjoy hallucinogenic drugs but if motorama typifies the result of doing so then im at a loss as to why anyone would take them more than once there is of course the occasional bad trip the movie must be one of those pun and allbr br juxtaposition of words that was startling how many times can a tenyearold startle you by uttering oh my god when he likes something or damn when he doesnt these two interjections are about par for the course with this script sadly any sense of the surreal in what passes for dialogue could only reveal in direct proportion ones naivete regarding the speech patterns of the rising american generationbr br a world completely defined and minutely depicted but that makes no rational sense motoramas world indeed makes no sense but it is about as completely defined as a cartoon in an elementary school newspaper the numerous guest stars in the cast all have cameo roles even less intelligent than our little hero who exclaims damn in the blink of an eyelash but needs several seconds to concoct the lamest lie and even his character despite appearing in nearly every scene gets no significant development heres scant reward for any viewer who sympathizes as i must enough to wish to know him better and understand where hes coming from one vaguely senses a far better story and protagonist struggling to get outbr br fully recognizable realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous paradoxical or shocking framework no we see a succession of stereotypical and ever more dilapidated billboards filling stations greasyspoon eateries cheap hotels and their lowlife habitues along country highways exactly where they stereotypically belongbr br largely responsible for perpetuating the traditional emphasis on content there is little content momenttomoment in motoramabr br to sum up picture british millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates on the way to a posh costume party sitting serene and mute as cautious chauffeurs inch their rollsroyces like fragile skiffs through a roiling sea of desperate humanity chinese who implore them through the windows and smear the glass with blood or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques limousines like those above now rusting and white pianos tinkled by ghosts into this detritus wander an exhausted boy and an ailing woman to whom he clings as motherfigure becoming girlfriend who fall asleep side by side on the grass he is awakened on the feast of the transfiguration white and glistering day 1945 by a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun finding that his consort has become a corpse he first believes that he has witnessed her soul going up to heaven later he explains only a little less innocently i learned a new word today atombomb its like god taking a photograph now there are just two samples of cinematic surrealism surrealism whose ironies ripple out far enough to invade its films very title empire of the sun if you seek surreal please dont miss it alas however hard he treads on the accelerator to race his chariot through and beyond the desert no scenes so exquisitely strange rich subtle or gorgeous await motoramas poor little gus in his questbr br none of the above necessarily constitutes a thumbsdown on this film though somewhat disappointed i cant dismiss it in view of the respectability of another genre that it does exemplify one influenced to be sure by surrealism but also by expressionism existentialism and franz kafkas pessimism amidst omnipotent power structures lets try on for size theater of the absurdbr br turning to ebs article on this style i am amazed by how to the extent that theater of the absurd is a valid artistic style the above objections to motorama vanish like a puff of smoke im tempted to quote the entire text as support of the identificationbr br theater of the absurd attempts to show that the human situation is essentially absurd devoid of purpose humankind is left feeling hopeless bewildered and anxious having instantaneously achieved his purpose of getting away from a depressing home life among bickering parents gus finds himself purposeless until he drives past a glittering billboard reading motorama and decides to win the lottery that it promises as others have already revealed this ambition proves illusory although the game never expires the sponsoring corporation has no intention that anyone should ever win and has ways to trick confuse and leave crestfallen any aspirant to the reward he like others is ultimately disappointed in his dreambr br absurdist playwrights therefore did away with most of the logical structure of traditional theatre there is little dramatic action as conventionally understood however frantically the characters perform their busyness serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change their existence a timeless circular quality emerges language in an absurdist play is full of repetitions repeating the obvious until it sounds like nonsense underneath a sometimes dazzling comic surface we find an underlying message of metaphysical distress guss obsession with a silly game his inane language the plot device wherein he divines a bleak future andor returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still bleak turn so much fits now while an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films anyway of spielberg admirers of motorama as it really is should find fellowtravelers not instead but addition in the works of beckett ionesco and genetbr br but one cant quite stop here after his disillusionment with the game gus returns to phil ie love the first attendant he had met and the one person who had treated him decently although he had also scolded him at a service station advertising be fullfilled under phils tutelage he learns a life of waiting for cars we might note here that the absurdist playwright beckett had entitled his most famous play waiting for godot and that for godot we should read god god is one of phils preoccupations too furthermore as the indirect result of his previous encounter with gus phil is badly maimed and goes about in a cast with his arms straight out horizontally in the last scene gus now phils protege says that he wants to hear music we hear none but we see phil wiggling his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm beckoning gus closer and gus responds the endbr br finally on to an author whom i happen to be reading currently the anglican theologian william stringfellow if this rebellawyer is not acknowledged as an architect or undergirder of liberation theology which is more a roman catholic than an anglican movement perhaps he should be police brutality and corporate greed are a cliche in cinema and literature including motorama but stringfellow supports and illuminates such sentiments with impressive warrants from scripture tradition and reasonbr br his most significant work is an expose of the earthly activities of those fallen angels whom the bible refers to as principalities and powers principalities wrote stringfellow are behind all of our popular three is images institutions and ideologies all of these commend themselves to our worship by making false promises the more deeply involved with an image an institution or an ideology any person becomes the more his own personhood becomes depleted and be becomes a slave to them promising power control and immortality they inexorably deliver helplessness chaos and death as essentially fallen defeated powers they can do no more than that yet they beguile humans with that dominion over the earth promised by god in the book of genesis while in fact no one of us controls an image an institution or an ideology bent inevitably on its own hegemony and selfpreservation they take on lives of their own dominion happens to be a mistranslation a more accurate rendering of the hebrew would be stewardship but this is a quibble beside a more fundamental problem most of us neglect to notice that god had delegated this power to adam before the fall we have no reason to assume that we his descendents still exercise it now on the contrary it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from usbr br one might add two observations of cs lewis first that mans conquest of nature is a mere illusion and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as the instrument and secondly contrary to popular belief satan is no kind of goodtime charlie he may dangle out pleasures at first but he is very niggardly with them and will withdraw them from any human firmly in his thrall perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and seething with resentmentbr br now applying these insights to motorama we seem them mirrored remarkably in guss experience he is if not nice at least a pretty little boy prior to falling victim to the motorama game the first signs advertising it glisten glamorously the longer he continues however and the deeper he journeys towards the sponsoring corporations headquarters the more shabby they become hes lonely meeting no one else who plays the game the stations giving out the cards have either fallen into ruins or are staffed by zombies the people he does meet along the way are more and more ugly deceitful and hostile the fact that the principalities answer to a common dictator does not mean that they can abide one another guss humanity is leached out of him as he becomes not only totally selfcentered and oblivious to the needs of others but partially blinded disfigured prematurely aged while infantile in the literal sense of linguistically challenged eventually even his precious mustang is taken from him in a crash and he must continue in a dead mans wreck yet at long last having done everything he thought was expected he presents himself to the principality in its proud tower to receive his prize using the biblical power to confuse wielded by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity its agents evade him disappoint insult and finally throw him from the top floor he falls long and hard landing finally in a body of water in other words in classic symbolism he dies he has met the inevitable bad end of anyone who has put his faith in such a deceiverbr br but this fate proves to be only a warning look into a mutable future he repents and returns to phil and upon seeing him performs the very first generous selfless act we have seen from him for almost an hour and a half noting that phil is now handicapped and hardly able to insert a hose into a gas tank he asks can i help you with that then seeing the help wanted sign he decides to apply for the job explaining to the motorist with whom he was hitchhiking that he reckons hell get out here because it doesnt look like too bad a place to workbr br this interpretation is conjectural of course and it may surprise or even outrage the films cult classic aficionados who see quite different points in itbr br if motorama isnt quite my cup of tea im at least convinced now that its hardly the worst film ever made
