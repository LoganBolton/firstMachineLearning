well this is about as good as they come there are arguments about whether hitchcock was only a master of commercial suspense or maybe a compulsive technician  or was he really deep nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean but its legitimate to ask if at his best he could not have been all three things at oncebr br in this one he seems to be about at his peak hardly anything in it is accidental it abounds with doubt ambiguity and wit and the story is engrossing patricia highsmith apparently having complexes similar to hitchcocks ownbr br im sure the plot has been thoroughly outlined elsewhere so i wont bother going into it ill just point out five on screen incidents that hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible forbr br bruno antony walker has followed miriam laura miller and her two boyfriends to a carnival at night with the intent of murdering her shes noticed his attention and is innocently flattered by itbr br 1 laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through the tunnel of love and then to an island in the center of the lake walker is right behind them smiling in his boat  pluto pluto its not an allusion to the walt disney cartoon character its a reference to pluto also called hades a god of the underworld in greek and roman mythology this tiny touch cant be an accident and the underworld that walker represents is not just a literal hell but the underworld of the human mind i hate to say hes a jungian shadow but thats what he is did carl jung see this movie he was alive at the time of its release  but probably not 2 now this is a deadly serious sequence right walker is a lunatic who is about to murder a woman he doesnt even know imagine the way this would have been laid out by most directors a nighttime stalking through a crowded carnival stealing from shadow to shadow the killer peering from behind the canvas walls and so forth what does hitchcock show us when walker first comes through the gates concentrating on his victim a little boy in a cowboy suit holding a balloon runs up and shouts bang bang youre dead walker jerks his head back in surprise and glares down indignantly at the kid and when the kid starts to walk away walker darts his cigarette at the balloon and pops it then continues his pursuit without another glance thats one way hitchcock treats impending doombr br 3 the famous strangling reflected in the fallen eyeglasses which has been aped innumerable timesbr br 4 miriam and her friends stop at one of those devices that you pound with a big mallet sending a kind of hockey puck up the shaft to measure the strength of your blow one of her boyfriend whams it and the puck doesnt reach the bell at the top under miriams delighted and admiring gaze walker smiles and rubs his hands together then picks up the mallet slams it down and the puck bangs against the bell shes thrilled he puts the mallet down looks at her grins and waggles his eyebrows at her like a tenyearold showoff 5 after the discovery of miriams body while whistles blow and people shout walker leaves the carnival and encounters a blind man waiting at the curb walker takes the old fellow by the arm and leads him across the intersection gravely holding up his hand to stop the traffic a macabre jokebr br these incidents and others all take place during the ten or fifteenminutes of the carnival visit robert walkers performance is exceptional throughout its essentially a kind of invitation to be noirish cf ride the pink horse but the menace of the scene is undercut by hitchcocks insistence on irony and distance none of the familiar noir techniques are employed theres nothing really creepy about it and the murder itself is hardly a savage one i dont think that any director other than hitchcock would have handled it the way he did it would have been all menace and shadows hiding places abortive attempts scowls instead of grinsbr br not that its an entirely flawless movie a flawless movie is not yet with us some of the middle section is a bit slow going and farley granger although a nice guy is stolid dull and rather stupid his new girl friend is just dullbr br hitchcock was to treat the misattribution of guilt with deadly seriousness in the wrong man im not sure hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt the latter was imposed on him at an early age by his catholic education original sin  youre born with it  and all that in filmed interviews he always glibly explained away his fear of the police and of authorities generally by telling a story about his father taking him to the police station to put a scare into him after some peccadillo were justified in asking if that was only what psychoanalysis calls a screen memory i hope you get the pun i know i know its strained and inept but i spent a good deal of valuable time thinking it up
