the outer limits is a brilliant show that for the most part leaves me with very strong emotions there are undoubtedly some stinkerepisodes but its essentially an old pulpcomic turned into a tvshow so that can be expected for the most part its excellently done well produced and directed and often featuring some bigname talent who seem to enjoy working in a solid translation of short fiction to hour long television formatbr br the outer limits tends to focus on rather large ethicalphilosophicalmoral questions and rarely ends without the voiceover intciting serious thoughtbr br from timetotime the themes are hammered in a little bit too heavily for all but the most thickheaded viewers additionally while a certain level of distrust of the government is conducive to an effective democracy you can unluckily catch several episodes backtoback that border on the absurd with regards to distrust of the armycia etc one further note is that any large group with power the roman catholic church evangelicals the peoples republic of china and so on are cast in a bad light in frequency ranging from once to oftenbr br while the show can beat a dead horse if its watched enough the overall quality is astounding and im grateful that scifi has decided to continue airing it until they produce a seasonbyseason dvd set and i can afford it
