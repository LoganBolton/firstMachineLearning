think like a dinosaur was an wellproduced  executed show of the outerlimits series the actor enrico colantoni as michael burr plays an impressively well and convincing protagonistrole you can actually identify yourself with him and his introspective feelings on what to do to the girl whom he has fallen for because hes been alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels hopeless until kamala comes to his life with a timid fear of performing the task of being transported he then consoles her and lets her know its all going to be alright which ends up being an deception to both of them more so something bad occurs and she prototype comes backand her clone is sent to the other inhabitant planet although the dino and micheal have yet to find this out when they do its up to michael to decide to either kill her or to let her live yet what happen to him prior upon meeting her kamala was very much related to what happen to his wife his wife died similarly this show professes irregularity and sorrow thruout most of it after the show youre left ponderingabout what should have been done and youre stuck with the 5050 of whats right from wrong hence the balance equation being solely there is no onebr br 1010 highly recommend watching this show
