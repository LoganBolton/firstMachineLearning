i viewed the original outer limits in real time when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in reruns and complete on dvd i find the new outer limits well more than just a remake of old retread episodes as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggestedbr br with seven 7 years of programs versus just the two 2 years of the original series the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced cable tv series plots are intelligent scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent futurebr br while most producers and directors in hollywood ignorantly view scifi as indistinguishable from horror and fantasy this series returns to the origins of science fiction in the logical moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies into their possibly fearful near term realizations this series does this very well and remains unique in its avoidance of the shootemup video game monster mentally of much of the current generation it has brains history a message and good entertainment it is an adult series without unbearable teenage knowitall fantasies hurraybr br now if we can only get mgm to release the entire new outer limits series on dvd instead of just the six poor teaser discs and the 1st season now only available
