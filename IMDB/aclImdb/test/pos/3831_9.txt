i agree that this is one of the very best episodes of the entire seriesmy only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of mark lenard as the romulan commander my reasoning is thisif you were not around for the first run of this episode then you know mr lenard as sarek spocks father and for the 2nd generation trekkie or trekkeryour preference it takes you out of the scene at first yet hes an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and wellacted by all there are excellent points made by both sides about the cost of war vsthe price of peace and certainly does remind one of some of the best of the wwii and later era movies those are not my favorite genre but i certainly would recommend a fan of such to view this episode through that filter youll see it holds up ill never understand why scifi gets so little respectthe best drama comes out of placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances
