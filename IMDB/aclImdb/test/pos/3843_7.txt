after seeing the aristocats special edition in a two pack with the fox in the hound i decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favouritesbr br the aristocats is a classic definitely it might not be a fivestar classic but it is a fun film and makes a good evenings entertainment it is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker more serious disney classics the aristocats tries to be a lighthearted musical comedy and i think it just about succeedsbr br the storyline doesnt really make much sense and i dont think the plot is particularly strong but it is certainly not weak the animation and backgrounds are a bit scratchy in places typical of disneys 70s films but it does have a rustic old fashioned charm about itbr br the aristocats strongest points are the characters the music and the humour the music is very memorable  try getting everybody wants to be a cat out your head in a hurry the songs are written by the sherman brothers who also did the music for the jungle book there was one song called she never felt alone that was going to be in the film but sadly didnt make it into the final feature it is a shame because i think it would have fit in very wellbr br the characters are unforgettable thomas omalley is voiced by phil harris and is basically baloo in a feline form eva gabor gives duchess this warm and maternal feel and the kittens voices actually sound like children and not an actor imitating the voice of a child the secondary characters are here by the dozen and yet you still end up understanding their personalities edgar the villainous butler plays a similar role to cruella de vil but hes more comical than scary often ending up in funny situations even though hes the bad guy hes still lovable all the samebr br the two british geese  abigail and amelia really had me cracking up along with their crazy and drunk uncle i also like the dogs who tend to argue over who is the leader i could go on but i wont spoil it but i can tell you the aristocats is funny and will entertain everyone without having to resort to rudimentary toilet humourbr br the bottom line  the aristocats might not be disneys crowning achievement or even their strongest film from the 70s that award is a tie between the rescuers and the many adventures of whinnie the pooh but it is an enjoyable romp and is sure to entertain if you are looking for a dazzling work of art you might be better off watching bambi but if you want a fun night in the aristocats is the way to go it is a charming and lovable film and its impossible to dislike enjoy and besides its good to have a film where cats arent seen as the villains
