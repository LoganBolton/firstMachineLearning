a group of cats look to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butlerbr br the aristocats is regarded as one of walt disneys finest 2d animations with its charming script and cool characters but it doesnt quite have the magic that created snow white or the jungle bookbr br the slow opening will have younger viewers raising their eyebrows but once the cats become established into the story does the fun and entertainment beginbr br the young cats create the most enjoyment with a charming young hearted rivalry the special kind of bonding any brother or sister of any age can associate withbr br not the funniest disney picture out there but there are some great comic moments especially involving the cats and the dogs the representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusingbr br the story after the boring beginning is consistently entertaining and exactly what a family film should be there are hardly any lapses and no dull moments the journey to find home is interesting and you get a sense of exploring not to mention two very strange british swansbr br with disney you always get a strong meaningful message with the jungle book it is where you belong with beauty and the beast you explore the importance of inner beauty however with this 1970 picture there seems to be something missing the film has the importance and relevance of home but is not cemented enough it seems very far fetched and irrelevantbr br my sister and i found it very strange watching this as some of the central characters were voiced by the jungle book castbr br despite the bad beginning and the confusion of its preaching message this is a consistently fun family film with a good music score and some cool crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to
