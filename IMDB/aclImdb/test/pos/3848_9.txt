the aristocats is really quite charming and is rated far too low on imdb the songs arent as memorable as the ones in the jungle book but they werent bad at all the animation is really lovely the best sequence being the landscape of paris in general it looked beautiful this is probably disneys most relaxing animation i think and as another reviewer quite rightly said who doesnt love cats another great piece of animation was o malley looking into duchesss eyes as their romance was so believable while not obviousa good thingthe plotabout a greedy butler and a fortune reminds me of baileys billions was a little unoriginal but worked very well and the script was really funny especially the fights between the kittens they remind me of me and my brother and 3 sisters always fighting my favourite scene was the chase of edgar with the two dogs who were always fighting about who was the leader the voice talents were a delight most notably phil harris whom i recognised from the jungle book and eva gabor from the rescuers the supporting characters namely scat cat were also well done in conclusion a really pleasant film that is definitely underrated 8510 bethany cox
