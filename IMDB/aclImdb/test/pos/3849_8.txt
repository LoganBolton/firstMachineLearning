the aristocats is classic disney at its best its not considered as the ultimate disney classic along side the more wellknown disneyfilms but its a wellmade and fun film that certainly deserves to be a disney classic aristocats is certainly a sure kidspleaser cause it has all the components for a fun kids film ill liked it very much as a kid im not sure if this film is a sure pleaser to the adults who could watch disney classics for the nostalgia sake but i still enjoy this film as an young adultbr br storywise aristocats may not be so complex or innovative but it doesnt matter this film was made on that period where the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were the story and wise versa which aristocats certainly shows the characters make the film theyre all likable fun have great lines and have a great interaction with each other the voice actors are also a part for making the characters so compelling eva gabor as duchess phil harris as thomas omalley and etc a misconception could have been the dogs napoleon and lafayette since theyre showstoppers and havent so much to do with the actual story but fortunately theyre fun and amusing characters and the scenes with them are pure goldbr br aristocats is both entertaining and cute but its also a very funny cartoon the animation style and look fits perfectly for the films french surroundings especially the city of paris looks greats the character animation and design is great and the songs are really catchy too my favorite is scale and arpeggios but the title song is a cute song along with thomas omalley cat and the memorable showstopper everybody wants to be a cat and the score by george burns is a perfect fit for the film funny and emotional situationsbr br overall aristocats is in my opinion the best disney cartoon from the 70s and its a film that deserves to both be seen and remembered so what youre waiting for do your self a favor and share this disney classic with your kids it deserves to be in their memories
