im not a massive disney fan but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them so weve built up quite a collection and this is one of my favourites we first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since ok as others have pointed out not the most complex or inventive of plots but theres more to a film than thatbr br great characters phil harris stealing the show as thomas omalley but edgar the butler not far behind the music is superb  my disabled son always insists that i lift him up and dance with him to everybody wants to be cat this says it all and thomas omalley is just as enjoyablebr br im not sure why some people have such a downer on this film other than a dislike of cats and yes it does take a few of its cues from 101 dalmations and maybe the lady and the tramp its been a long time since ive seen that so im not going to compare them and while 101 dalmations is better in some ways for me the aristocats is far more enjoyable isnt that what these films are about br br apart from peter pan now that is a 1010 film this is my favourite disney film my 7 yearold son loves it his grumpy 41 year old dad loves it so you cant ask much more of a family filmbr br superb
