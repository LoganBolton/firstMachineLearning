the aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen clearly not that many because it only got a 68 there is nothing wrong with it at all its my favorite of the disney classics which have tons of fantastic films already made like beauty and the beast snow white and peter pan the reason why the aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is i hate to say this but i dont blame edgar for what he does i probably wouldve had them taken care of too id be devastated of some old bag who id been working with for so many years just decides to give her will to the cats id of killed them also i dont even like cats so i wouldnt give a damn i think that the aristorcats is so funny and cute there are many characters that are hilarious like edgar the aristorcats is my favorite of the disney classics and thats final the cats out of the bagbr br the aristorcats
