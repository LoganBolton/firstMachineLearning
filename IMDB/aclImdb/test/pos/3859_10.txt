as the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old i adore aristocats it is a movie that contains no doubleentendres no almostswear words like heck or darn no parents who are functional idiots and no crotchsmashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the best kids movies these days the story line is sweet and interesting the music is great the love story is quite romantic the kittens are adorable and the various other characters are unique and attentioncapturing the action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing the characters are quite wellcast as well i love listening to eva gabors velvety voice and there are so many others that are familiar from childhood and also fit the characters so well its really a movie about love tolerance good manners and faithfulness who doesnt want their kids exposed to these values it is a movie that i dont mind watching over and over unlike happy feet where i couldnt watch the whole thing even once because it was so irritating i wish production companies would move toward making movies more like this one
