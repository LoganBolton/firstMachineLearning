no im not kidding with this one he was a guest reviewer for entertainment weekly and gave this movie positive marks and who can blame him this is a charming upbeat and rather funny disney movie who doesnt love kittens the music in evrybody wants to be a cat is jamming it makes me want to snap my fingers or something only years later when cats dont dance came out have i seen a movie that was that musically fun what aristocats lacks in animation and story it makes up for in charm plus everything moves at a relaxed pace and even the villain isnt all that scary its perfect for the younger set while not being so sappy that adults cant like it if snoop was here im sure he would say the same thing yeah dig those crazy cats man
