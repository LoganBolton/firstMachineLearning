bart the genius whilst not the first simpsons episode bart he genius more or less is the first typical episode theres no gimmickry or theme its just your typical simpsons episode in setup it always seems to me that its an episode that grows on you there are certain elements i dont care for largely the blotchy animation which can be forgiven but over time i take a liking to this story of its uniquenessbr br for example itd be very hard for a liveaction sitcom on a standard budget to do this episode due to the various different sets that show in this episode the computer bays in ms melons class the opera and so on my point is with that the simpsons realises one of the biggest strengths in animation the sheer lack of visual limitations when compared to liveactionbr br on a writing standpoint its also highly intelligent and fresh the concept is pretty unique and particularly the problems faced instead of the ol failsafe that work was too hard it was simply barts social isolation from his classmates that failed him although the exploding science experiment may prove otherwisewhich i also think is one of the best visual gags of the series the ending seems a little unoriginal largely because the bart running naked into his room to avoid homer was already done in the shorts but still funny for marge and lisas short backandforth if for nothing elsebr br ultimately its a very good episode with lots of interesting new point in the series though not exactly perfectbr br oh and the now iconic name kwijybo was of course unleashed onto the world
