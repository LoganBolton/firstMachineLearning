strangers on a train was one of those film classics i had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing i finally watched it a few weeks ago and as always with any hitchcock movie it not only stood up to the test of time it far surpassed most thrillers being made today you can see the inspiration for future action movies here  the climactic ending with the outofcontrol merrygoround and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of jan de bonts speed of course strangers is over forty years older than speed and contains no modern special effects but the visceral thrill is there  hitchcock was a true geniusbr br the notsosubtle gay side of bruno robert walker in an amazing performance has taken form in many other psychostalkerfigures in future movies consider him a male version of jennifer jason leigh in single white female he knows about guy before he even meets him on the train  we almost get the feeling their contact isnt incidental  and is soon entirely obsessed with himbr br hitchcock loved the oedipial elements in his movies also see psycho for more blatant undertones and theres a lot of that here bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother his effeminate ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by the censors in 1951 when gays were not allowed to be portrayed on the screen  yet hitchcock gets the message through effectively when we see bruno in the lounge on the telephone wearing a very nonmasculine robe flirting with guy and responding to his motherbr br the deep layers of this movie make it a fastpaced thriller than you can return to again and again  unfortunately its being remade as a bigbudget hollywood production but after seeing the original i honestly cant imagine anything surpassing the sheer whiteknuckle thrills of this movie
