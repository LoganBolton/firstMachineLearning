i watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot i was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any starsbr br i will not give any spoilers to the plotline or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value until the very last minute i did not know how it would turn out frequently you can pickup the formula and predict a story direction i could not do that with this filmbr br i would recommend this as one of the finer films of this genre
