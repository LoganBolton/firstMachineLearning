i saw borderline several years ago on amc ive been looking for it ever since it was haunting visual textural sensual this movie took me somewhere like a dream and i didnt care where i will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze i still remember the way it made me tilt my head i remember my facial expression when i saw it i didnt know what had happened when the movie was over but i find life is that way it didnt bother me the unfairness of the ultimate rejection of an innocent character strikes me as sadly real i loved the faces the way the camera dwelt upon them the camera gazed at the set with the unfocused eyes of a daydreamer borderline was real to me in a way movies arent it was exactly the lack of explanation color sharpness that made it enter my consciousness like a thief in the night i love this movie someday i will own it
