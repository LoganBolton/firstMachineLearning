the ateam is still repeating every day on dutch television rtl7 around 1800hrs and i still watch it i dont like the ateam i absolutely adore them it is just great to see justin chasing the former members of ateam brings back memories from the old days when i was young an sweet i would have given you a 10 for excellent but justin looks like he is chasing the former ateam members all by himself of course that is the only bad thing on this documentary too bad justin does not look for melinda culea amy a allen but it is great to see mr t back into action too bad for him he does not show up at the party at the end but that party is too short to laugh again and to see everybody in action again
