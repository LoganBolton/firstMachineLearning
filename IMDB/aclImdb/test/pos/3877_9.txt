bring back the ateam was a hour long special screened on channel 4 in the uk of last year and hosted by presenter and comedian justin lee collins the show attempted to track down and reunite the fellow cast members of the ateam together for the first time ever on tv this has been something which has never been attempted before by anyone well not by anyone that i know of that isbr br justin makes a great presenter and his eccentric personality and humorous banter shone throughout this programme the attempts he makes in getting hold of the cast members is ever so funny but also he was very persistent and eager to fulfil this task too which is a credit to him id say mind you he is great on tv anyway be it by presenting a show such as this or the friday night project with his cohost alan carrbr br there were appearances and interviews with dirk benedict the faceman himself dwight schultz aka howling mad murdock marla heasley who played tawnia baker jack ging aka general bull full bright the creator of the ateam stephen j cannell and the big man himself mr t aka ba baracus they were just fascinating to watch and hear what they had to say about the programme that became a global hit during the 80s as they reminisce and relive the good and bad moments of the show both during and behind the scenes unfortunately no george peppard but of course he is already in heaven understandably and strangely enough no melinda who played amybr br i just didnt understand why she wasnt featured in the show okay she was axed after 3 seasons or whatever but she was the first and original female member of the ateam only to be replaced marlas tawnia and so it wouldve been great to see and hear her side to the ateam story in addition to the other cast membersbr br all in all bring back the ateam was a great documentary style of show perhaps this couldve been spread out more by means of which this couldve been a sixpart documentary but nonetheless this was a great effort on the part of jlc recommended
