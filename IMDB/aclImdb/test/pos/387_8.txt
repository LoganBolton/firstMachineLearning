even though some unrealistic things happen at the end ie a cop shooting a gun into a crowded merrygoround where any number of innocent could be killed this still was an intense enjoyable thriller one of alfred hitchcocks better films robert walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times his costar in here farley granger is okay but is no match for walker either in acting or in the characters they play its the typical hitchcock film with some strange camera angles immoral themes innocent man gets in trouble etc unlike a lot of his other films i thought this one was a fastmoving story with a very few dull spots being an extennis player i enjoyed his footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies hitchcocks reallife daughter patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here she didnt just get the job because of her dad she can act also of note the dvd has both the british and american versions and there were some differences in the story this is a classic film that is still referred to in modernday films even comedies such as throw momma off the train
