garlin outdoes himself as writerdirectoractor in his indie production about a big guy garlin wandering around chicago with an eye for every woman he sees the laughs keep coming almost every minute its a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love but done with great comedic writing and acting the supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie richbr br rose abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film sara silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with jeff bonnie hunt is classically great in her role i only wish there was more of her in the film as i think most will agree its certainly refreshing to see her in a tight leather outfitbr br david pasquesi was the aloof detached sidekick and voice of reason mina kolb plays jeffs mother who he lives with there were numerous other cameos all of them done very wellbr br at the premier jeff mentioned his inability to do more with bonnie due to production issues still its good to leave you wanting more i think its that indie thing of keeping some things ambiguous to let the audience do some thinking for themselves to fill in the blanks the wordy title should clue you in to thisbr br jeff said some of the basic characters were based on his past relationships this explains why they work so well real life people are always unusually colorful and makes great characters he departs quite a bit from what you might expect having seen curb your enthusiasm and some of his other work its one of those break out things where an actor takes some risks to do something they maybe always wanted to do but couldntbr br i think its noteworthy that garlins improv second city background and hunts for that matter set the style here of acting being the focus of the story and the directing its perhaps a new innovative hybrid of improv meets indie filmmaking
