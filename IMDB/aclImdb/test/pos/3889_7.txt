any movie that offers bonnie hunt sarah silverman and amy sedaris in the supporting cast has to be well worth watching and comic actor jeff garlin takes advantage of the terrific talent he recruited for his 2007 directorial debut a sadsack comedy about an overweight man who feels out of step with the world around him familiar as larry davids manager jeff on curb your enthusiasm garlin plays james a stillstruggling 39year old chicago actor who still lives with his widowed mother his selfesteem is so low that he cant meet women but its the comical way he views his single status that makes his dilemma involving if the storyline sounds a bit familiar thats because the film is partially a tribute to the 1955 ernest borgnine classic marty about a lonely bronx butcher living with his meddlesome mother in fact garlin uses marty as the play which james is desperate to do since he is so empathetic to the characters situationbr br naturally there is a love story of sorts in this new millennium version and silverman plays beth an offkilter sexually voracious ice cream parlor server who takes him on an underwear shopping spree their best scene together is in his favorite convenience store where they improvise different characters in different aisles hunt plays a lonely elementary school teacher who shares a passion with james for jazz musician ben webster they meet accidentally in a record store and then again at a career day at her school where he hilariously exposes his sexual neuroses in front of a classroom of firstgraders including his best friend lucas pert daughter penelope played by dakota fannings lookalike baby sister elle in a wedgedin cameo and looking quite a bit like jerri blank sedaris plays the schools counselor who speaks to james after his inappropriate monologue david pasquesi plays luca a retirement home manager and his scenes with garlin have an easy rapport that makes their friendship easy to believe almost stealing the movie is character actress mina kolb who plays james pixilated mother with pluck and heartbr br there are also unexpected cameos from teen idol aaron carter and gina gershon dont askÂ…but the setup is funny as well as sharply played bits by director paul mazursky as the snaky director of a candidcameratype show smear job tim kazurinsky as the unsuspecting victim of that show and dan castellaneta as the toughlove convenience store owner with his rueful bouts of insecurity and selfloathing garlins comic sensibilities resemble those of albert brooks and the casual dialogue at its best reminds me of modern romance and defending your life the one persistent problem i had with the film is pacing as some scenes dragged out longer than necessary the problem is more evident in the first half when garlin is trying to establish the right tempo and the lack of real conflict adds to the sluggishness regardless what he does well is capture that gnawing sense of desperation one feels upon the revelation that life is not what it is supposed to be that a significant other may be out of reach and that a steady diet of junk food eaten on a car hood is the only sure thing when it comes to gratification
