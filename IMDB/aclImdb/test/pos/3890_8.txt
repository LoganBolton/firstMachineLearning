garlin did a great job nice concept well executed and tightly produced came across as a very sincere story as a fan of curb your enthusiasm where jeff was pretty much the straight guy role i was delighted with how much depth he brought to this role in a simple yet effective portrayalbr br much of the humor was understated and subtle and drew on poignancy which i really liked rather than being slapstick or overexplained and there were some nice little surprises and twists the convenience store vignettes were a delightbr br when i say it is a wonderful small film i dont mean budget or quality it is simple intimate and handcrafted it tells a highly believable everyday story relax and go see it let it wash over you and you will feel good for having done so
