turner and friends are closing in on hbo for the top spot among madefortv movie producers this is a nicely paced contemplative thriller of sorts william macy is stellar as always and adam arkin offers one of his better performances a bit more lively than classic hitchcock but not as inyourface as typical movies of its type a slight case of murder eases you in and never lets go note i saw a preview copy which means i didnt have to wait through commercials those interruptions may hurt the pacing but you know this will be available on video sometime
