i thought this movie was pretty goodok so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and theres nothing wrong with that it keeps the story alive i dont think this movie was pathetic at all and im not just saying that because im a major chad michael murray fan but because i enjoyed it i was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and i really enjoyed it and we were talking about it the whole way home i would tell my other friends to watch this movie im not saying its the best movie thats ever hit the box office but its a lot better than some people are describing it to be everyone has their own opinions so if you really want to know whether its good or bad watch it and then decide
