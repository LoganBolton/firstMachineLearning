i think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they dont want to leave their car to get stripped deserves whatever happens to thembr br the guy wade who went to a barbershop and asked for the heman haircut wasnt my type but theres this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed thats a little too highmaintenance for me br br also fun but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks like elton john only gayer but that whole plot goes nowhere br br blake was hoti could see myself with him if he wasnt so into his girlfriend who is a phony paris hilton in a bad wig no chihuahaua in her handbagthough but that would have been really precious i dont think girls who look like that go to football games anyways nick the car thief is the sexiest one of the best parts is where a football lands by him and instead of throwing it back he chucks his cigarette down and it burns the football see thats just the kind of guy he is he has a sister who looks dumb borrowing his white wifebeater her bra straps are showing for like 12 the moviebr br mostly you will just want to wax your legs and not ever go to football games after seeing this
