i usually give horror films around 610 but this one caught my eye house of wax was by far the best horror film i have seen even better than the amityville horrorbr br paris hilton was quite good in this and i must say has a good future ahead her death scene was probably the coolest ill just say how she diesbr br she gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they closeups on and everything gory eh brian van holt was very good as both the killers bo and vincent vincent had the long hair usually he plays a mean cop or soldier but he did very well in thisbr br eliza cuthbert and chad michael murray also acted very well as carly and nick jones nick took the spotlight in the first half of the movie then eliza stole it back by enduring a lot of pain in the second half like getting the finger clipped off ripping her lips apart after they got glued together and getting a straight forward punch in the face by bobr br overall i give this movie an 810 fans of horror films must see this
