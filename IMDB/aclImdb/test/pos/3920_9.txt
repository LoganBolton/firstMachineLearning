probably the best horror movie in 5 years theres been lame remakes attempts to make you scared when all they make you do is walk out of the theater and movies that just shouldnt have been made but this one is worth it the only reason i didnt give it a 10 is because paris hilton is in it but her death scene makes up for it believe mebr br so here they are the spoilers of all the death scenes in the moviebr br 1 my favorite death scene ever  paris hiltons after finding her boyfriend blake laying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck paige starts to run well speed walk is more respectable she finds this like garage with all these cars in it then one of the killers cuts her ankle from below this whole time shes holding a huge metal spikeso she drops it and runs and hides behind this car the killer picks it up and as she looks through the window he throws it through the window and it shoots through her forehead ive never been so excited or laughed so hard in my lifebr br 2 paiges boyfriend blake gets a knife stabbed into his neck and then the killer walks up to him while hes on the ground and steps on it pushing it farther into his throat then he diesbr br 3 elisha cuthbert carlyone of the hottest chicks ever doesnt die phew but she does get her lips superglued together punched in the face and gets part of her index finger chopped off yeah i felt like heaving 4 carlys twin brother nick also survives but not without getting his ass kicked and a stab wound to the legbr br 5 nicks best friend dalton gets thrown down a flight of stairs and then is decapitated his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink then he gets covered in waxbr br 6 wade carlys boyfriend gets his achilles tendon snipped by a massive pair of scissors and then is attacked by the same scissors he doesnt die but hes covered in wax and on 2 occasions his skin is accidentally removed revealing his nasty bloody flesh yummybr br so there it is definitely worth your money
