i recently saw house of wax and must say i really enjoyed itbr br its been one of the better horrorthriller films in the past few years if not one of the best and most entertainingbr br ive heard a lot of people bashing the socalled slow start and character development which takes up the films opening 45 minutesbr br yet if the film dived straight into the deaths audiences and critics would have criticised the film for not having decent characters who they couldnt care less aboutbr br well as for the character development i think it worked amazingly wellbr br taking into my own response and others from reading posts off the message board a lot of people ended up wanting the characters to live one of which ive noticed many people mentioning being paige edwards paris hilton taking into consideration warner bros have been marketing her death its a surprise turn around that many audiences ended up cheering her on for survivalbr br speaking of the chasedeath scenes they were some of the most inventive and suspenseful ive witnessed in a while and enjoyed each one very muchbr br the acting in the film was absolutely fine i couldnt fault any of them especially paris hilton i thought she was very decent and i was hoping for her the get more than a mere 25 minutes screen time in a 120 minute film yet her chase scene made up for that and believe me when i say paris can act scared watch the scene where shes hiding in a car from vincent and he walks past her  the look of terror on her face comes across as very realbr br overall i give house of wax maximum stars for entertainment value and suspense and even gore  only criticism is i wish that during the marketing for the film they hadnt revealed the death list and who dies and who survives as it would have been ten times better not knowing if the character being chased was going to live or die and horrible deathbr br cant wait for the dvd but go see it at the cinema while you can it wont be the same in your own front room yet if you do wait for the dvd watch the film in the dark with no interruptions trust me you wont be disappointed
