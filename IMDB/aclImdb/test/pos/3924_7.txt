ok maybe it doesnt deserve an oscar or a golden globe or any award for that matter the acting isnt outstanding theres no reason to give credits to the directing and its really just another semigory 21st century slasher flick that most people will consider just decent or maybe even dreadful but in my opinion all of this doesnt matter a bit and thats because i had a great time watching this moviebr br sure the first 40 minutes are pretty slow but as the movie progresses something in it you will like if you are like i was and anybody else should be when watching this movie and that is looking for 2 hours of fun mindless violence and a kickass ending which i wont spoil yes there are many flaws in this movie but dont let the cast list on the front cover fool you hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a striptease that wasnt as nasty as anything an online popup would promise of her but still not so unbearable as to fastforward or turn off the dvdbr br the violence in this surprised me nobody at school or on the horror board was talking about it like they were about these new movies called saw and hostel but i could safely say that wax was more graphic than saw and some death scenes were actually quite disturbingbr br in conclusion im not surprised house of wax didnt make a place on the imdb top 250 but it is definitely worth a look
