my college theater just had a special screening last night of this film i have got to say that i think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was though my roommate didnt care for it but hes not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if paris hilton can act by the way if youre worried about that dont be im not exactly one of her fans but i must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene overall all the actors were very good im not gonna go into detail for the plot since im sure you know about it surpirsisngly the characters are pretty engaging and you actually care for them especially elisha cuthbert and chad michael murrays characters we meet them as rival siblings and end with them having to work together another plus is that it does not have the sleek look of amityville horror or texas chainsaw massacre and feels almost documentarylike rather than a music video dont get me wrong i loved texas chainsaw and enjoyed amityvillebr br now for the death scenes in most slasher movies whenever a character is stabbed or killed the scene immediately cuts away to another scenebut not in this one when a character is about to die they die pretty gruesomely but the filmmakers dont stop there and add a little something extra each time for each victim i wont say anything about the death scenes and will let you see them for yourselfbr br while this is a great slasher movies it does have the flaws of almost all slasher films exploring a creepy house when you shouldnt be getting a ride with a suspicious character splitting up and screaming so the killer can hear you also there is a kinda stupid plot twist that was unnecessary and didnt add to the film at all you could tell it was just added in at the last moment and if you took it out it would not have affected the movie at allbr br basically if you are a horror film fan see this movie you will not be disappointed its got all thats needed to make it a great slasher film possibly the best of the year even though its kinda early the suspense is felt and it is at times a funny movie if you hate horror films chances are you may like this one and if you are divided i encourage you to give it a shot
