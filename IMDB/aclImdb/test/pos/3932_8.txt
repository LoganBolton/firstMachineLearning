i saw a sneak preview of this tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast after seeing sneak peaks for boogeyman horrible 310 and amityville remake soso 610 i enjoyed this a lot more as seen in the trailer one knock i had was believing that a whole town could be forgotten but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so i accept it for what it isbr br my only major complaint is i assumed paris hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc and moan thats hot but they didnt do that how could they resistbr br there is no nudity from the 2 girls although paris looks great in her lingerie im surprised they didnt put a 3rd hot token victim in the movie for some needless nudity which is the norm for this type of flick i wont list any death or plot spoilers but i will say that paris  eliza both get roughed up good br br the characters are developed decently and are somewhat likable not like cabin fever where you wanted them to die and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the 1st 30 minutes like most horror filmsbr br i give it a 810 as it delivered good scares and gore and i had low expectations going into it if you go with some friends that like cheesy horror movies youll have a good timebr br noah
