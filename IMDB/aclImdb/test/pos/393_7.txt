very enjoyable 50s western i have it in my collection and recommend it to western fansbr br mostly victor matures movie and quite well done in my estimationbr br hes a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout red cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions they all joined as scouts after their lossbr br victor has set his eyes on the colonels wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulationsbr br action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other charactersbr br 50s westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction a western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again one to enjoy gave it a 7 rating likely 68 worthy but films like these become more precious over timebr br for filmnoir fansthe big steal they live by night side street are most wonderful movies to be enjoyed bought and viewed noir seems to resemble westerns in a way some long ago and never forever
