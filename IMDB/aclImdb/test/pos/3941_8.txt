are you crazy or what this movie has talent who are you to criticize a movie that was made by famous directors and producers i mean you must be watching some crappy version because if you had a proper version you wouldnt think its some low resolution game graphicsbr br this movie is for people who enjoy hongkong cinema the other side to what asian people enjoy watching you are such a sellout hongkong cinema is totally different to that of hollywood hk cinema is in a class of its ownbr br so if you dont enjoy watching movies from hongkong producers dont go and ramble on about how its a waste of time to watch just let other people enjoy the moviebr br and personally ive seen this movie and i love its story and the way it was made
