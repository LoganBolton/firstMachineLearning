story chinese tall story tells the story of righteous monk tripitaka who along with his guardians monkey sandy and pigsy make their journey west on a quest to recover ancient sutras finally they reach the final leg of their journey in shache city but all is not as it seems when the city is attacked by evil tree demons monkey tries his best to battle them but is overwhelmed knowing his master is in grave danger he uses his trusty golden staff to thrust tripitaka to safetybr br the monk ends up being knocked out when he land and when he wakes up he finds himself in the presence of a young lizard imp named maiyan who takes quite a shine to our young hero after many verbal misunderstandings maiyan becomes convinced tripitaka loves her so when the monk decides he must rescue monkey and the others she insists on accompanying him so the mismatched pair begins their adventure togetherbr br review okay so its another journey to the west movie which isnt a bad thing to me since i love the story and the characters associated with it so i was a little excited to get my hands on the dvd so i think ill start off my review with the story which is all over the place at first it was your standard fantasy film then it became a ridiculous comedy then suddenly became full blown scifi if the director jeff lau was experimenting with mixing genres then he did a pretty scatological job with this movie i think its a pretty unique approach by having the story centre on a character other then the infamous monkey king especially taking a character as pacifistic as tripitaka and then putting him into what is at its core a love story so overall i liked itbr br the acting is for the most part solid with leads nicholas tse and charlene choi putting in some really good performances though ah char does spend most of her screen time behind some rather ugly make up the supporting cast is nicely put together it includes all the usual eeg main stays so boyz and isabella leong make appearances one actor id like to mention is wilson chen who plays the monkey king he did a good job with the limited material he seemed to have been given he played a version of the monkey king who was subdued yet arrogant i had a feeling hed be retreading twins effect ii territory but fortunately thats not the case here i hope he gets to do a follow up to this with himself in the central role since the film does leave itself open for a sequelbr br okay so lets get down to the directing which again is kinda all over the place lau gives too much time to the stephen chowesquire nonsense comedy which includes a scene where tripitaka in order to toughen himself up dresses up as spiderman which i assume lead to many a head scratching moment since the film is meant to be set in ancient china he does create some really nice and tender moments between the two leads and does delve into sappy territory but this reviewer does enjoy a bit of sap on occasion so it didnt bother me in the slightestbr br right now onto the cgi which for the most part is quite bearable there are a lot of moments which probably belong on a ps2 like many other reviews have stated but there are some cool moments particularly the scene in which monkey battles a flying minion a lot of the cg gags are provided in the form of the golden staff which turns into a range of different things ranging from a giant fly swatter to a mech suit straight out of the matrix revolutions so yeah it sounds crazy but i guess youd have to see it to believe itbr br right so in closing a chinese tall story isnt a movie without its flaws but it keeps itself together long enough to be able to entertain and generally be a overall enjoyable movie if all of the above doesnt swing you to see it how about i put it this way its much better then twins effect ii
