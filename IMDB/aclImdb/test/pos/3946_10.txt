the weakness of this comes from the confusing storytelling plots often coming out of nowhere but it really didnt matter because i still enjoyed it to its full length once you actually accept that this movies not to be taken too seriously then youll enjoy it even more its basically a love story a confusing one at first but as it evolves it really is something worthwhile sure its been done so many times before but the complicated version of this is quite inspiring and touchingbr br the over the top fantasy and cgi was overwhelming at first but i still enjoyed its purpose and people quit whining about how it borrowed from other movies guess what we know and it doesnt really matter because its purpose was to humour and entertain sometimes people has to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start yapping about comparing this to hollywood standards is utterly stupid and ignorant its a totally different style and target audience as far as im concerned some the best films ive feasted my eyes upon are from eastern producers and directors theres your police story 4shaolin soccer kung fu hustle dragon tiger gate fist of legend hero crouching tiger etci for one like this movie and haling from the philippines us england libya and now australia ill always be interested in these types of films now try and judge my perception but i warn you i do see things from from the point of view of those 5 countries ive lived in so you better be as experienced and open minded
