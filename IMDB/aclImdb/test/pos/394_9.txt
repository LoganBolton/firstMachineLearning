i enjoyed this film which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex lovehate relations along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline all the main characters are well cast true john wayne or robert mitchum could probably have done the starring role just as well but victor mature certainly comes across as a headstrong brawling tarzan of sorts reminds me of his film role as samson another difficult but not impossible man to tamebr br the mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism as the era of pure trapper mountain men pretty much ended 20 years before with the collapse of western beaver populations as well as the fashion market for beaver pelts this story supposedly takes place in oregon just before the end of the civil war judging by the volcano in the background of the opening sceneprobably mt lassen the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote section of the cascades as we never see any other civilians however there is plenty of conflicting evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of wyoming or montana red cloud the war chief who threatens the trappers and soldiers in the fort is the namesake of a very famous sioux war chief who led a very successful campaign in 186566 to exterminate the newly built army forts in wyoming and montana fort laramieeastern wyomingis mentioned as being not too far removed from the fictional fort the plains tribe of assiniboines is mentioning as joining red cloud this aspect of the story then bears a general resemblance to historical factbr br it may be of interest to note certain resemblances between the plot of this story and that of john fords fort apache in both cases we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to his first frontier post with native american problems he underestimates the military prowess of his adversaries regarding them as little more than cannon fodder to promote his career in both films he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy also in common the greenhorn commander resents a subordinate who has long experience with the local native americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and not to do in both films we have a budding romantic relaionship between a woman very close to the commanders heart and a subordinate which the commander does everything to squelch clearly the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completionbr br i also see certain resemblances with the misfits the soldiers as a whole including the commander are misfits of a sortas one of them admits mostly they have problems or are raw recruits with no experience fighting native americans the commanders wife apparently is the only woman in or anywhere near this fort thus is inherently a misfit with a husband who is very uncertain of his future in the army the trappers in turn are also misfits not really wanting to accept army or civilian discipline yet cut off from their previous free spirit lives by the recent armygenerated antagonism by red cloud br br finally we can also compare this story with anthony manns later film the far country starring jimmy stewart in stewarts case he can choose to return to being a loner cowboy at the end but matures character doesnt come up with an appetizing new way of being his own boss red cloud has made life outside of the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate besides he has an obsession with the commanders wife
