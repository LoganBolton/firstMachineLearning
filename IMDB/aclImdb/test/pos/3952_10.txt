blind spots images are great the action draws you in completely even though the movie is a bit long by the end credits all that you can think about are the films positive highpoints the lead actors have the most incredible screen presence the story is heartwrenching the film score is nicely understated  completely moving in its own powerful way not your standard melodramatic cuing trancelike moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions hope you get a chance to see this film it delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light
