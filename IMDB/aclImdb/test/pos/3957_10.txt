blind spot one of my festival favorites i was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways the cast is great james franco is particularly amazing as the brokenhearted boy from los angeles his journal entries which we hear in voiceovernarration work well with the visuals and are quite intense the film has a powerful style it pushes elements like the road movie and revengedrama in new directions it also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love there is a dreamlike quality to several sequences and the images are saturated with an eerie sense of tension strange suspenseful beautiful to look at definitely worth seeing i really would like to see it again periodically i check to see if blind spot has been distributed i cant wait to see the film again in the cinema or on dvdbr br davide pepe 13082005 bologna  italy
