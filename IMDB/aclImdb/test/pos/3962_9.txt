this is a funny clever film and well worth your time in my opinion it is much better than american pie and other films of the same genre that seem to get knocked out all the time i hadnt heard of this film so i guess it didnt get much press which is kind of a shame it doesnt take itself too seriously but at the same time delivers a serious message to people about life and life experiences and what is importantas opposed to a film about a bunch of desperate guys trying to get laid for the first time and one dude sticking his dk in a pie but in the end everyone gets laid and whoopdedo one thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty awesome and not the usual cheesy american poppunkthey actually had real punk from back in the day like the ramonesthat in itself made the film better to be honest i wasnt expecting much from this film and i was pleasantly surprised at how good a comedy it is
