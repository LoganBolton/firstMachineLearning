on the face of it any teen comedy runs the risk of being sophomoric and obvious and fair enough most of them are there are a few that have risen above the usual banality of the source material bring it on eurotrip and they give me hope that others can join that depressingly rare crowd of teen comedies that are actually funny and not just an excuse to flash some starlets boobs or be a vehicle for some neverwas like tom greenbr br enter accepted directed by john cusack pal steve pink and led by the likable justin long the smart nerdy kid in galaxy quest and more recently featured in apple computer ads about a bunch of kids who dont get accepted to college and decide as disclosed in the trailer to fake a bogus one to get their parents off their backs when they go a little too far with the website and other kids end up enrolling the kids have a few problems to solvebr br okay the setup is obviously preposterous but most comedy lives or dies in the execution and here accepted does pretty well longs bartleby gaines mostly shortened to b is accompanied by enough wellmeaning comically acceptable friends to help him share the load but probably the best supporting character is dean lewis no doubt named as an homage to rodney dangerfields dean martin aka uncle ben lewis black who is wisely restricted to short spurts where he can rapid fire his unique brand of cranky observational humor black is terrific here frankly telling the kids what life is really like his expletiveladen final line is hysterical and providing the adult face to the bogus university for the parentsbr br but long has to carry most of the film and he does so in spades bartleby is easily identified with and we take to him almost immediately a nice twist was provided by columbus shorts character hands an athlete who loses his scholarship due to an injury and ends up becoming the de facto art faculty at the fake college also noteworthy as bartlebys hyperintelligent and sarcastic little sister is hannah marksbr br yes the film does feel familiar in some spots theres a debt here owed of all places to revenge of the nerds those who are rejected by everyone else find a home with bartleby and his cohorts and of course the villains are steroidenhanced conformist master race types who run a fraternity well okay frats are evil and seek to humiliate and bury the oddballs for the  gasp  crime of being different but that aside accepted has fun with the material and even asks a few decent questions about the expectations on college kids and the course of higher education not that its a brain teaser by any means but accepted isnt just another mindless teen comedy or owen wilson vehicle its a funny clever 90 minutes that while not a great departure from its genre is intelligent and creative enough to be very enjoyablebr br there is at least one moment of unadulterated brilliance in the film when bartleby checks out a nearby college in an attempt to harvest ideas for his own schools curriculum when he sees that the kids are all stressed out at the other school several refuse to even talk to him during class for fear of missing something he shakes his head thinking that there must be a better way as he moves to leave he is met by a stream of kids going the other way one person moving against a human tide while in the background the opening lines of eleanor rigby play perhaps an unplanned moment of brilliance but brilliance none the less
