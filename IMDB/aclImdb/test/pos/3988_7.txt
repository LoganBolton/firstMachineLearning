i totally disagree with the person who first commented about this movie to me this storyline is about a man with growth hormonal disorder trying his best to look for the love he is yearning for trying his very best to fit into the society who doesnt seemed to accept himbr br he then met someone who treats him with best friends love and was shown the way to receiving the love he always wanted to have the man who created all that happiness in returned received something important from the giant which is family and spouse lovebr br and the comedy its just part of making the audience feel some laughter bugs at certain part of the showsbr br and i must admit it made me tear a little
