warningthis film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kidsbr br the artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter unfortunately in so many ways this guy was also a jerk in so many ways some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art but other times he was simply a drunk jerkespecially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist late in the film his being annoying abrasive and needlessly cruel seemed to have diminished while all this didnt make him a particularly nice man it is important to capture on film so we understand a lot about the nature of the artistbr br i really found the movie fascinating and loved how the artists actual works were shown throughout the movie like in lust for life i really wish i could show this to my students i teach at a school for the arts but cant because there is just too much adult material yes there is nudity but even more problematic for any audience particularly younger ones is when hehmmmi dont think imdb will even let me describe what occurred but it was very graphic and involves bodily fluids not only a nasty and disgusting scene that did not need to be seen but a reason to keep junior from watching this otherwise wonderful film its a real shame
