it is not surprising that this film was made by im at the time it was im examined the early beauty and tragedy of chosun dynasty life in seopyonje and delightfully explored a wellknown korean folk tale in chunhyang and these comprised his last two films what is most surprising is that chi hwa seon his 2002 offering is not presented in the pansori style of those previous two filmsbr br nonetheless the experienced hand of im comes through we explore together the life of a real person a late nineteenth century chosun dynasty painter who rides on the edge of modernity but who is not a noble and who because of that causes a stir in contemporary korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old korean noble class and his contempt for wouldbe japanese ruling colonials alike the painter chang seung up known popularly as oh won performed magnificently by choi min sik the famous star of park chan wooks already legendary oldboy becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film contemporary korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact or maybe because of the fact that he was so ostracized in his time ims sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact im is a master at capturing his countrys past idiosyncrasies and in this film he almost outdoes himself as expected in an im film the cinematography is breathtaking the editing is precise and the story is centralbr br plots are set against seung up family ties are tested and broken scandalous behavior is alleged and is sometimes real all to bring down the man who painted fire but against all the intricacies of ims detailed but sometimes convoluted account of seung ups life seung up himself somehow manages to survive he becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous chinese paintings after only one look art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off oh won in other words lines of people who wish to take advantage of the real seung up an artistic star begin to form but he refuses to be manipulated his cleverness in staving off both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience if not the cast br br what does seung up think he possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished he despises those who would try to turn art into profit and he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as traitorous but he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming upheavals horrid scenes involving foreign invaders from france and japan are presented ims signature historical epic motif and his influence in the realm remains on prominent display in this multimillion dollar epic br br the protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint this is when the story takes on a whole new meaning one that is not just political but social in nature im takes on the issues in laudable realist fashion br br he oh won becomes a jesus figure the people believe him capable of artistic miracles and the government feels it needs his artistic support but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be eventually both government and people come down upon seung up in a manner taken straight out of the bible his holiness becomes human his humanity is not accepted he dies for or escapes from the sins of the commoners the art critics the politicians who hound him br br but does he die as with most of ims films a question remains in this case does seung up really become an immortal hermit the film does not tackle that question it merely presents a possible end for the real man of chang seung up or oh won no death is depicted because no death is known br br it is difficult to find fault with this film but im has become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that when he does it hardly surprises anymore as usual for ims films the cinematography the editing and the writing are all first rate its a wellcrafted film imbued with ims uncanny storytelling ability granted he may be best at doing this through the ancient korean musical art of pansori still the film contains stretches of this admirable art form and by the end viewers feel as if they have become privy to a great untold story and they have because that precisely is ims gift
