this film winning im kwontaek the best director at cannes in 2002 tied with pt anderson for punchdrunk love is about a 19th century korean painter with a commoners roots and significant impact on korean painting one of the strengthsof the film is that im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend jang seungup choi minshikreceive inspirationbr br the costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good its not a movie that moved me but it was one that made me think about art and what it means to find your own voice in it thats pretty cool its also interesting to see a version of korea during those times right before the turn of the century where chinese and japanese powers are both in korea and the chosun kingdom is coming to an end more than one revolution and political ideology are gathered in the film but are never the center its firmly on the painterbr br in the end its a well made film about the life of a painter but it doesnt exactly have the regular threeact structure plot so you have to be able to take a nonstandard hollywood story to watch it yay for art 810
