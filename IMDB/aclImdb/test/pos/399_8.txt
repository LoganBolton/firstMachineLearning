ordinarily anthony mann made westerns with the big guys  james stewart gary cooper henry fonda    the a list cowboy stars but in this b film he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western the main character played by victor mature is a trapper mountain man and ordinarily they are romanticized in films  robert redford in jeremiah johnson that sort of thing where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men not here for once a true mountain man  vulgar crude animalistic  is the central figure and its something to see giving mature one of his better later roles the real acting chops are provided by robert preston excellent as a selfabsorbed custer type cavalry commander and james whitmore the poor mans spencer tracy as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other even more impressive is a very young anne bancroft as the officers wife who is initially repulsed by the very sight of matures grisly character then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize to her own shock that shes attracted to him rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen without the romantic allure that john ford gave such a place in his masterful fort apache the battle sequences are big scale and notably violent and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format good show and underrated movie all around
