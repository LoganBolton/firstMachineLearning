ever since i first encountered the divine ms merkerson as a sex therapist in spike lees shes gotta have it i have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress she received an emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is welldeserved is a masterpiece of understatementbr br here she simply shines as the guiding force and hand in her community this was especially poignant for me for i grew up in this very same time period the production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s  60s and of women like ms merkerson portrayed she was thoroughly and ably accompanied by a hot hot cast with performances one would enjoy over and over again i first saw macy grays name in the credits and went hohum her performance was so good i didnt even recognize her until about a 3rd of the way through i am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a feel and look of another beautiful era in africanamerican culture that is very tastefully donebr br another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but infinitely more attuned to the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that in the final analysis it is about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choicesbr br this is a worthy elegant presentation of africanamerican life and is most assuredly destined to become a classic you owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collectionbr br i highly recommend
