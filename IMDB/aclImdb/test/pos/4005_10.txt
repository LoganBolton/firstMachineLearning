first of all i want to say ang lee did a very good job on this one i watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised the story is very good but all the ignorant people would say this sucks people cant fly to them i say its fiction and that it is this is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a fairytale and a very pleasant to watch asian fairytale the images can actually blow your mind because there so artistically filmed  ang lee has a very unapreciated u might say big talent the fight scenes are very cool and beautifully brought to the viewer but its sad but this film didnt get the appreciation it should have gotten but ang lee did fortunately get the attention he deserved with his blockbuster broke back mountain so even for viewers who are not interested in the story the images are entertaining enough
