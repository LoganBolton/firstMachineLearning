i cannot hate on the show when the old and better tech tv had to hit the bricks the channel was reformatted and new shows stepped in attack of the show is the replacement for the screen savers with 3 cohosts in the beginning they were kevin rose kevin pereira and sarah lane brendan moran came to be something of a cohost as well but he mostly did prerecorded pieces for the show kevin rose decided to leave the show and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host but that didnt pan out for some reasonbr br eventually i just learned this from this very imdb messageboard sarah lane and brendan moran moved on because hey this is what i read the two got married that was a big secret to me now there is a new female cohost the notashot my opinion olivia munn shes hiding something in those tops she wears while sarah lane had a perfect body and she wasnt afraid to show itbr br ahem sorrybr br attack of the show deals with everything young people want to know about its music movies comic books the internet and television this is whats great about the show if you dont want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching mtv you can get all you want on aots some segments and bits they do are funny they have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big namesbr br even though the hosts arent as geek as id like them to be i still have found attack of the show to be entertaining even with its latest lineup
