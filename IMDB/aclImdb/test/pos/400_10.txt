a very delightful bit of filmwork that should have had wider distribution ian mcshane is right at home playing the soul loving dj who gets canned because he wont  go along with the program  and sets out to let the world know what theyre missing the supporting cast is great as well and the music is the soul of the film i just wish that the film would be released so that i could get a copy of this for my film library
