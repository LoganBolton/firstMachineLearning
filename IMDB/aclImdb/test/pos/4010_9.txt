my favorite show of all time yeah i thought this was so cool and larisa oleynik was the first crush i ever had aaaawwwwww it was well written funnyexcept when it it wanted to be serious and just a great show overall but since we couldnt afford to keep nick i couldnt see any episodes after feb 1996 and maybe that makes me think more of the show than i should to me its more the epidemy now that doesnt look spelled right of having to say goodbye to someone that you love and know youll never see them again and i still think that because as far as i know there are no plans to release this on dvd any time soonyeah life is mean ive found that out for sure though you can find an odd episode every here or therebut i never liked the bootleg copies of things much eitherbr br so enough of my sad lifemost kids in 7th grade dont need powers like alex gets to get them through life unrealisticfor sure but then again how many towns have a superevil chemical plants that is willing to do anything for progress at any cost gee this show was fun to watch though id agree the diaglouge is a bit over developed and even a little politically correct sometimes my favorite parts were when the kids would have some reason to break into the plant a video tape or something like that like a kids version of tom clancys rainbow six which years later i got hooked on that game series for probably the same reason almost then youve got the plants security team who are trying desperately to find the kid from the accidentvery mean dudes at least when i first watched the showthey seem more sympathetic to me now i feel rather sad for larisa oleynik not sure if she minds this role typecasting herbut its what ill always remember her bybr br oh and btw the actor that plays aaron peirce from 24 is on here too as a school coach or somethingtoo cool maybe he can get the producers of that show to get larisa in next season of 24 i only bring it up cuz jack bauer is my other tv hero and id just love to see crossover things lol both are set in california so ill just keep on dreamni can see it now let me alone with that suspect for a few minutesno i dont need a car battery
