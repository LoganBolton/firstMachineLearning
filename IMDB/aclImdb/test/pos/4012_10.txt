this is probably my favourite tv show ever i love all the characters especially alex who is the perfect woman always makes me laugh and feel good when i watch this show there is just something about it that is amazing hard to describebr br it seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well here are a few examples the episodes start again when they end  but dont play end credits until the very end but always play the opening credits with most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice but some go on furtherbr br radiohead pink floyd bob dylanbr br 202 double bogey kid a  ok computer episode plays at least 4 timesbr br 214 saturn kid a  meddle  shot of lovebr br 219 world without alex kid a  wish you were here  pablo honeyepisode plays at least 4 timesbr br there are clues in the episodes which tell you which albums synchronise kid a may synchronise with every episode
