oh i remember watching this show at 400 pm during my junior high days it was not a pleasant experience because i remember watching it when i made my homeworkbr br still the show caught my attention when alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problemsbr br but the show wasnt all about adventures and special powers it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overallbr br the lead actress cant remember her name and im too lazy to copy and paste from the main details delivered a fantastic performance she made the show watchablebr br they just dont make shows like this one anymore
