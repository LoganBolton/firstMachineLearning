the movie is based on a jules verne book i actually have read once about ten years ago i remember i liked the book a lot and this movie does a good job in telling the story the most important thing in this movie isnt the story however but the highly original visual look it hasbr br the visuals are absolutely beautiful and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors stopmotion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie combined by jules vernes own unique versions of airplanes and submarines and karel zemans good directing results in a very well done and convincing visual style that manages to effectively hold ones attention until the end of the moviebr br there are some problems as well one of the underwater scenes at the end takes maybe needlessly lot of time for example as the story in the first part of the movie is rushed through quite quickly none of this matters much though since the movie is always highly enjoyable a gem that deserves to be more well known for todays audiences as well a recommended movie for the whole family
