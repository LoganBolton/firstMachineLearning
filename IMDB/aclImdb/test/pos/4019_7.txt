like the first film in this series slaughter 1972 i think it would be a mistake to just label this a blaxsploitation film sure slaughter is a tough guntoting black man but its more of an action picture regardless of the color of the leading man or the bad guysand a very good action picture at thatbr br for the second and final time jim brown plays the title character the film begins with one of the goofiest scenes i can remember in a film as slaughter and his friends are enjoying an outdoor party along comes a biplane and begins spraying the group with machine gun fire no slaughter isnt so tough that he then shoots down the plane with his 357 but slaughter is ticked and no one is sure why this hit was happenedhowever slaughter is going to get to the bottom of it well it turns out that the hit was attempted in retribution for the last movie in it slaughter takes on the mafia and kicks lots of butt down in mexico now in a horribly bungled and clumsy attempt the guys in the plane kill and injure quite a few people but miss slaughter and because the job was bungled so badly the mob boss ed macmahon orders the pilot and gunman killed by his brutal assassin don stroudin a very typical sort of role for him stroud is greatscary and nasty to the core but ed macmahon as the boss wow thats an interesting twist br br slaughter is now stumped he figured out who the two guys were in the plane but by the time he got to them they were dead so to help him along in his own private vendetta brock peters who plays a cop tells him who the mobsters are who ordered the hit and got slaughter to agree to help by doing some illegal undercover work so slaughter and his pimp friend break into the mobsters mansion and steal a list of payoffs to key government and police officials and naturally there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the processbr br stroud isnt about to let slaughter get away with this and kidnaps slaughters girlfriend now its a standoffslaughter has the list but if he doesnt give it back the lady is dead being a tough but gallant man you might just be able to guess much of what happens nextbr br the action is very good in the film and jim brown is menacing and tough the only negative i noticed was that while having macmahon play this nasty boss at the end he simply foldedand way too quickly when slaughter catches up to him macmahon becomes a wimp and all the previous nastiness disappearsand this is too much of a clich√© and inconsistent still despite this minor quibble its an engaging film that is not for the kids due to all the violence and boobs
