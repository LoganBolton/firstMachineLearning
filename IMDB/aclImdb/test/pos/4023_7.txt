somehow this film burrowed its way into the soft spot of my heart dont ask me how it happened but i suppose having the film feature ed ill sponsor anything mcmahon as a tailchasing crack hustler had a bit to do with itbr br frankly i was disappointed with slaughters first outing in 1972 nothing more than a quick throwtogether to follow shaftmania how does the sequel get away from this big jim brown seems stronger as slaughter here than in the first perhaps this is due to the fact that one year later he had something to work from instead of his simple be like shaft motivation beforebr br the most outstanding part about the film is the soundtrack provided by pimpdaddy number one james brown almost every scene is graced with a touch of funk by the godfather an excellent period film for the music wardrobe vehicles lingo and hair i should also point out this film is also an excellent period film to represent a time in motion picture history when jim brown and ed mcmahon could actually grow hairbr br double the chicks double the blow triple the body count and factor in ed mcmahon and james brown youll be in for one hell of a 70s action flick and one that outshines its predecessor no less for my money slaughters big ripoff can play ball with any blaxploitation film ever made even shaft chances are youll disagree but slaughters big ripoff has its own distinct feel something the original was lacking
