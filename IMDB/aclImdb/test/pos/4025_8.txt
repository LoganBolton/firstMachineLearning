we saw la spettatrice at the syracuse international film  video festival  liked itbr br this film delved into the fear we all have fear of rejection fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequaciesbr br the three lead actors barbora bobulova as valeria brigitte catillon as flavia andrea renzi as massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent it was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed realbr br i believe barbora bobulova is a stand out i hope we see much more of her in the coming yearsbr br this film doesnt take the easy way out thumbs up to the italian team who put this film together highly recommended
