this film is not really a remake of the 1949 obrien film which is excellent it borrows the main premisea man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer but i like that the writers chose an english professor instead of a private dick as the protagonist the plot is also quite original in general the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake but what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it probably due to the horrendous 80s original music scorecombined with an affected noir feel dennis quaid grins inexplicably throughout the whole film at odd moments but hes still compelling in a general way meg ryan is fine as the student helperlove interest when the film gets sort of bad is when dex the prof meets the british bodyguardchauffeur and their duels are pretty laughable the bodyguard works for the rich widow played by lovely charlotte rampling but those scenes are too selfconsciously noir to help the film along even though the family plot line is rather interesting dex also keeps showing up at the same place and finding this bodyguard which is rather coincidental in the latter part of the filma man is shot by a window and from the outside you see him jump out of itthat was pretty bad direction but aside from some of these obvious flaws i think it still holds ok i certainly didnt predict the ending so that was goodthere is a twist and although some posters here think they were misled i thought it was a fine and believable ending dennis quaid with his weird smirks and black eyes is more likable in the right stuff great balls of fire inner space and cold creek manor but here as dex hes supposed to be somewhat of a jerk so he did fine fairly decent movie
