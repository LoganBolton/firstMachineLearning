doa is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish dennis quaid is at his caustic best and quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in hollywood his then beau meg ryan also appears with him but as is usually the case doesnt really make much of an impactbr br  the film is stylishly directed throughout drawing on a number of influences to capture its seamy feel would you credit that its actually directed by two people the answer is no the whole thing is superbly slick from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography all these elements help to keep proceedings freshbr br  really the greatest thrill here is to be had with the dialogue its snappy yet intricate doesnt waste a word and yet still manages to be entertaining the screenplay for this is like a pocket work of artbr br  this went unnoticed by me for ages before i finally caught it late at night if this is the first youve heard about it dont leave it like i did catch it soon it really is topnotch br br  if youre in the mood for a solid genre flick that manages to surprise at every turn this really fits the billbr br
