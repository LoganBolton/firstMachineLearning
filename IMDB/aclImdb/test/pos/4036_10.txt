i thought that the storyline came into place very well i liked this movie a lot if youre going to rag on a bridget fonda movie you can just rot i thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea apparently somebody doesnt think so i rather enjoyed the movie im even thinking of buying it i want it to be my very first dvd for my room thats how much i like it i rather would not start an online argument with someone i dont know  have it be over a movie if someone could kindly retract what they said about the storyline i would be more than happy to retract my insult however if they feel that i am not worthy of a retraction i might just feel that they are not worthy of one either but i cant control their actions i can only encourage them in the right direction hey they dont have to make a retraction but i would greatly appreciate it
