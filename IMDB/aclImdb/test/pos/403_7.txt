another nice entry in the crime doctor series 410 with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid spanish american backdrops and sets and a more offthewall storyline toobr br a man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party the crime doctor is on the scene ostensibly as a guest to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over for one of them did the deed was it the frothing brother of the dead 1st wife the 3rd wife and rich widow hilary brooke the dancing brother and sister vampires the intense young man the eccentric cabinet maker lloyd corrigan on loan from boston blackie the irreplaceable butler or oddson jerome cowan police inspector emory parnell had his work cut out but warner baxter as ordway was as unflappable as ever in working it all out one of the goofs listed on the imdb is wrong on breaking into the murder room ordway says right through the centre of the forehead and cowan replies he didnt miss this time favorite bits baxter and cowan travelling through club sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make amends for their interrupted dinner party the scene where the bragas place of repose is seemingly rumbled the plot does seem to meander a bit at times and the way it was all explained off was perhaps more worthy of monogram but leaving it in the air as supernatural wouldnt do eitherbr br well worth a watch if you already like the genre you wont be disappointed unless you really dont like the genre
