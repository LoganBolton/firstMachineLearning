enchanting the best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad its all just so cute all even the way that white bear loves the queen in secret and gets her in the end also the achievement the two young actors of gerda and kai gave its music is also very nice the two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once hell see the snow queen is not so bad she only tries to surround herself with love in the wrong way the evening this movie was on here first part i only watched it because i was bored but i loved it a lot more after and was very angry when they didnt show the next part because of the popes funeral yeah that was terribly sad for me but when they said it will be on next week i was so happy that i recorded it and now im glad to have done so
