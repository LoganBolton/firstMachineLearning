i have probably watched the movie 4 or 5 times every time i get more and more impressed by how far the wish of a young heart can go and the strenght of both kai and gertha to struggle for what they believe inbr br and the whole story is presented in such a way you just get transfered into the plot and before you know it you are there you can see yeah theres kai working hard on the mirror a little jump theres gertha fighting for her love and theres the snow queenbr br its just a wonderful mix of love adventure tensionbr br its brilliant 10 out of 10
