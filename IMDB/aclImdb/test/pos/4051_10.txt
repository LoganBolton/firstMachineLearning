back in the midlate 80s an oav anime by title of bubblegum crisis which i think is a military slang term for when technical equipment goes haywire made its debut on video taking inspiration from blade runner the terminator and maybe even robocop with a little dash of batmanbruce wayne  iron mantony stark and charlies angels girl power thrown in for good measure 8 episodes long the overall story was that in 21st century tokyo japan year 20322033 living machines called boomers were doing manual labor and sometimes cause problems a special swat like branch of law enforcers the advanced police ad police for short were formed to handle the boomers but were mostly ineffective prompting millionaire scientist sylia stingray the daughter of the scientist who made the boomers to create four powered combat armor hard suits to be worn by women to fight the boomers and fight the evil corporation that produced the boomers genom that group becomes known as the knight sabers and in addition to ring leader sylia her ragtag band of rebel women included priss asagiri a struggling rock and roll gal with a passion for motorcycles and a disdain for cops linna yamazaki an aerobics instructor with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through boyfriends and nene romanova a young officer of the adp and expert computer hacker the first in a long line genom meanwhile is represented by quincy a tall gaunt old guy who happens to own the company his younger assistant brian j mason killed in episode 3 and an annoying boomer man named largo other characters included leon mcnichol and daley wong two ad police detectives leon appeared in a spinoffprequel anime ad police files which i heard was very dark their balding overweight boss chief todo sylias younger brother mackey and a funny little mechanic known as dr raven who apparently helps sylia with maintaining the suits aside from the overall knight sabers  ad police vs genom storyline there was also another storyline involving a friend of linnas who was apparently a daughter in a big crime family the annoying largo trying to usurp genom and various prisswantsrevengeforaminorcharacter story oh and did i mention that there were hints that sylia herself might have been a boomerbr br well it was a great watch full of chaos and mayhem and even some very nice pop songs but it was not without its flaws some of which unfortunately were due to the fact that the series was discontinued after episode 8 when it was originally planned for 13 episodes in all so some of the storylines like largos scheme or schemes the family of linnas illfated friend and sylias origins were never resolved another problem with the series was that at the time priss was the most popular character so a good portion of the series focused on her and unfortunately most of the priss oriented episodes basically focused on priss selfrighteously seeking justicerevenge for some secondary character who had never appeared before but happened to be a friend of hers yet she rarely went out of her way for her the knight sabers who were always bailing her out of trouble and for some reason cared a great deal about her wellbeing just to be fair though she did go to rescue linna in episode 7 and her boyfriend got killed by a boomer and the adp acted wrongly in the investigation this meant we didnt really get to focus on the more interesting back story of sylia or even the daytoday antics of nene and linna linna had two episodes oriented around her which pertained to her friend with the mafia family while nene managed to snag the last episode for herself which showed her eternal good cheer was genuinely good spirits and not ditziness nene also got to put her computer skills to good use quite a bit or she sometimes just acted like a lovable goof which put her screen time and character development a few notches above poor linna who was often thrust into the background with only her greed and her tendency to eat up boyfriends to get her any attention dont get me wrong i like it and i love the overall concept of it all but it did irk me a little bit also this is one of those runnerups for worst english voice dubbing of all time features meaning youd better stick to the japanese some of the voices were okay some really did match their characters personas but others were just flat and passionless or in the case of priss really overactedbr br well tokyo 2040 comes along and pretty much tosses all that out the window set a few years ahead the story here is that after earthquakes shattered tokyo genoms boomers rebuilt the city into a big old paradise except the boomers still have a tendency to fly off the handle which prompts the ad police to be formed followed by the knight sabers being formed so the overall story is the same but the backstories of the characters and the look and attitudes of the characters have changed a lotbr br 1 originally sylia had short purplish black hair and brown eyes was usually dressed like a stern proper business woman and was distant from others 2040 sylia has more of a supermodel look to her dressing more provocatively and possessing white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light runs the gamut from blue to purple to silver and eyes occasionally looking purple or gray and also 2040 sylia is more of an emotionally unstable woman who flies off the handle when shes not in public and possibly keeps even more secrets than before sylia also doesnt take as much risk on the battlefield as she is more of a stayinthemobilepit type here but she does do battle when she has tobr br 2 originally priss was a short woman with an afro and a really bad temper always picking fights with people who offended her always biting off more than she could chew etc 2040 priss however has gone the way of the clint eastwood loner  very cold very stoic and emotionally distant more like the original sylia you might say so shes not really attached to anyone also her hair is more stingry and catlike a big improvement and she is clad in leather like trinity from the matrix although much less annoying than before unfortunately the writers screw her in the end when revealing her reasons for hating the adpbr br 3 originally linna had this big black hair going for her but now her hair is shorter browner and well more 90s like 2040 linna is also an office lady who has bad luck with being sexually harrassed as if to apologize for the way she was treated by the oav writers the 2040 writers actually dedicated the first 6 episodes to linna writing her as a country girl new to the city but determined to meet the knight sabers and win a spot with them which she eventually doesbr br 4 originally a short red haired girl who was often the victim of ridicule and ate a lot of candy nene is now a short blonde haired girl who likes to tease and take pot shots at adp detective leon mcnichol revenge for him toying with her in the oav and other characters even her surrogate big sister linna and mackey sylias brother whom she becomes infatuated with cockey and arrogant she still eats a lot of candy and is a master hacker but she is eventually deflated and grows beyond her comic relief statusbr br 5 nigel kirkland is a new character a tall stoic ruggedly handsome man with long black hair he looks like adrian paul from tvs highlander he replaces dr raven from the old series and now serves as the man who gives maitenance to sylias hard suits nigel is also sylias lover but you wouldnt know it by his demeanor hes kind of the fatherbig brothermentor figure to mackeybr br 6 leon and daley are back but of course differently the original leon was a tall pretty boy built like a baseball player with slicked back brown hair blue eyes a black leather jacket tight blue jeans and always carrying a revolver that could magically pack more whallop than a howitzer if necessary while he wasnt really a bad guy deep down he was kind of a jerk but he served mostly as comic relief as he tried to pursue priss romantically exactly what he saw in her is a mystery but occasionally he and daley served as information guides to important plot points also the original daley was a fairly muscular red head who dressed in pinkpurple suits as he was a flamboyantly homosexual character who was always hitting on leon when not providing important information in 2040 leon is no longer a pretty boy but more your typical rugged tough guy type with spiked black hair brown eyes tall and sporting big muscles a brown leather jacket and blue dockers he actually looks like arnold schwarzenegger a little bit or maybe a pumped up colin farrell or hugh jackman and he still carries a revolver a big one but its not as powerful as before although 2040 leon still has a bit of an attitude probelm especially in approaching priss hes not nearly as much of a jerk as he was in the old series but he does have a bad temper and he is easily annoyed by nene and daley also he drinks way too much coffee oh and leon is still after priss but he has a lot more luck this time around daley meanwhile is now a taller but not as tall as leon more pretty boyish looking guy with red rimmed glasses a white suit green eyes and light brown hair and he carries a big machine gun he actually looks like james marsden from the xmen films daley is a lot smarter and more assertive in 2040 than the oav and although its not completely clear his homosexual tendencies have been almost totally disappeared save a moment of what appears to be jealousy when he hears about leon inquiring about prisss emailbr br 7 brian j mason what does that j stand for is back and so is quincy but mason is much more the main villain here with quincy as covillain as he is no longer a towering figure of terror but a vegetable with a bunch of batteries and wires plugged into him mason now sports slicked back brown hair instead of black hair as he did in the oav he actually looks like oav leon in a suit and he is very much from the alan rickman school of villainsbr br 8 though a pervert in the first series mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040 of course there are lots of things different about mackey in 2040 but they wont be revealed herebr br 9 sylia now has a companion an alfredthebutler type named henderson who worries about her and the gangbr br 10 in the original series boomers were like the replicants in blade runner armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions but in 2040 theyre more of the dumbmonstersontherampage type most of the time theyre just big robots who do whatever theyre programmed to do heavy labor combat clean up etc and they have this tendency to go rogue which means try to evolve and become a monster in the processbr br what does stay the same is the theme of humanity vs technology do machines have souls sadly this series though well animated and well written only runs 26 episodes so it moves by faster than one might like especially those of us who are used to more than one season of our most beloved characters and unfortunately it still ends on a cliff hanger with unresolved storyline bits which i will not discuss here what saves this show and makes it what it is however is the characters a colorful cast of screwballs they are ranging from stoic loners psycho women genocidal mad men rough neck cops sardonic intellectuals wise old sages and loveable innocents much more diverse than before and with a lot more to play off of theyre enough to make you wish this show had gone longerbr br its not great but its a good watch also the english dub by adv is quite good though not without a few flat spots but certainly better than the dub on the original
