i first saw signs of life on pbs as an american playhouse presentation its a wonderfully written ensemble production with terrific performances by michael lewis as joey and vincent donofrio as his brother daryl arthur kennedy in one of his last roles is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close the rest of the cast which includes beau bridges kathy bates and marylouise parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their charactersbr br the direction is subtle and effective ive watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it a beautiful piece of filmmaking
