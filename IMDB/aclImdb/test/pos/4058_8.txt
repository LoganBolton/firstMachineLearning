this is actually great fun i really enjoyed it even though it wasnt that original at all robert de niro and eddie murphy were great together all the characters are cool and the story is pretty good plus robert de niro and eddie murphy are simply amazing in this rene russo is excellent in her role and there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout especially when deniro spoofs clint eastwood and danny glovers lines plus the finale is just great yes its just another run of the mil buddy buddy cop film but it works due to the fantastic chemistry between de niro and murphy plus it had some great car chase scenes as well its nothing that great really however i found it to be great fun and a perfect way to pass the timehowever the main villain was very weak and wasnt very good at all this is far from being the best buddy buddy cop film however its still a very entertaining one and i thought it was pretty well made and written as well plus the ending was quite funny this is actually great fun i really enjoyed it even though it wasnt that original at all robrt de niro and eddie murphy were great together i highly recommend this one the direction is very good tom dey does a very good job here with great camera work cool angles and keeping the film at a fast pace the acting is a lot of fun robert deniro is amazing as always and is amazing here he is hilarious very likable had fantastic chemistry with eddie murhpy did his usual awesome stuff pulled some really funny faces seemed to be enjoying himselfhad some funny lines and had a really cool character de niro rules eddie murphy is also amazing here he is hilarious like de niro did his usual funny stuff obviously loved being in front of the camera and while he can do this stuff in his sleep he was still a lot of fun to watch murphy rules rene russo is fantastic here she had a cool character and while she didnt have much to do she added a lot of screen presence and made her character interesting always she was just great russo rules william shatner is funny here surprisingly and didnt overdo it and brought some good laughs into the film the main villain is ok but kind of weak and rather bland still he did what he had to do adequately rest of the cast do fine overall i highly recommend this one 12 out of 5
