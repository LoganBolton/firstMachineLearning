dad 78 and i 46 both had a good time watching the flick today for a guy primarily known for serious roles de niro is a heckuva comic actor of course it helps to have his past film images to play against consider that one of those roles 15 minutes was a cop having to deal with the interference of the mass media and you have an interesting set of comparecontrast performancesbr br murphy plays another of his axel foley sort of characters shatner plays a burlesque of himself a parallel world self who was best known for tj hooker and not star trekbr br its interesting to watch how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its fictional counterparts in tv and film shatner lectures on the proper means of sliding across a car hood de niro points out holsters scratch the hood finish ironically as the film progresses de niros character begins to incorporate the illusions of tvcop reality into the real world case hes workingbr br the film draws its inspiration from a gamut of sources so one could make the comment it is derivative well so what satire needs to derive its humor in order to exist and besides the film does have quirky moments of originality for example im reasonably sure the method of the villains death has never been done before br br one quibble about the reality of the weapons involved shouldnt those guns have had some kind of recoil in order to penetrate steel those bullets had to have enough inertia to penetrate and any bullets highest level of inertia is at the moment of firing so firing a volley of these tankkiller bullets should have driven the shooters back onto their butts oh what the heck its a satire maybe the guns lack of recoil is itself a satire on the bfguns used so casually in thrillers br br
