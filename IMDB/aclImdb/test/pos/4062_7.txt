as many of todays movies are guilty of the plot isnt exactly stellar the movie doesnt move anyone and certainly this wont warrant any award outside of blockbusters perhapsbut then again who really caresbr br eddie murphy and robert de niro team up to produce a very funny at times hilarious movie that i really enjoyed russo and shatner played their small parts well as well man i hope in the future my wife ages as well as miss renee hasbr br moving along this buddy copflick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time the movie is enjoyable enough to avoid the wait for videodvd release and instead to go ahead and check it outbr br eddie murphy is at his usual topform and is downright enjoyable to watch de niro has molded into this type of role perfectlybr br i really enjoyed this movie and think that any true movie fan in need for a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy showtimebr br top performance murphy hilarious enough said directing job nice nice action scenes used murphy and de niro together like a charm russo fed off in a nice supporting jobbr br my rating 7 out 10 its not going to move you or anythingbut its an extremely enjoyable moviebr br its showtimewas a great success
