at one time buddy cop movies ruled the box office it seemed that every summer flocks of beverly hills cop wannabes descended on our nations theaters not any more lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle the drought has eased a bit recently with the release of showtime a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genrebr br mitch preston is a dedicated cop hes not a dirty harry type by any means hes just incredibly focused professional whos completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike say a tv cameraman mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and so falls into the clutches of chase renzi a producer looking for a killer hook for her reality tv cop show she thinks that mitch will give her the edgy boost it needs to be a hit but feels he may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself enter trey sellars a patrolmancumactor whos watched way too many police story reruns of course mitch and trey mix like oil and water and much merry mayhem ensuesbr br we know that mitch and trey are bound to become best buddies by the end of the movie thats the way buddycop movies are suppose to work in fact it has to be said that showtime rarely deviates from the timehonored clichés as writ by lethal weapon and tango  cash theres a high tech mcguffin to get the ball rolling in this case an automatic rifle that fires rounds big enough to stop tanks theres a slick foreign baddy with an accent of undetermined origin there are chases shootouts and explosions we all know this going in and we have a pretty fair idea how its all going to turn out you know what theres nothing wrong with that yes we know the wellworn bases are going to be touched but the fun here is the trip not the destination showtime doesnt strain to be original instead its energies are funneled into its characters and humorous situations as a result showtime does a competent job with the action sequences but really shines in its comedybr br robert de niro is dryly funny as mitch in the past ive thought de niro to be a cold and unexpressive actor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy lately though hes grown on me he seems to be injecting more humanity into his roles eddie murphy is hilarious as trey the best way to describe his performance is that trey is what murphy would be if murphy werent so talented and hadnt hit the big time rene russo has a droll time playing motormouthed show biz shark chase renzi she stalks through the movie chasing high nielson ratings with aweinspiring determination in her zeal she revamps mitchs life to make it more camera friendly she even calls upon t j hooker himself william shatner to show mitch how be a more authentic cop shatner is funny playing himself precisely as we expect him to be loud oblivious and slightly obnoxiousbr br i have to admit i was really looking forward to showtime and i wasnt disappointed ten years ago this movie would have been a guaranteed hit today its doing moderate business at best thats a pity because showtime is a whole lot of fun
