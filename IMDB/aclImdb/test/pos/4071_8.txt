if youve seen the trailer for this movie you pretty much know what to expect because what you see here is what you get and even if you havent seen the previews it wont take you long to pick up on what youre in for specifically a good time and plenty of laughs from this clever satire of reality tv shows and buddy cop movies showtime directed by tom dey starring robert de niro and eddie murphybr br 	mitch preston de niro is a detective with the lapd and hes good at what he does but working a case one night things suddenly go south when another cop trey sellars murphy inadvertently intervenes a television news crew shows up and mitch loses his cool which results in a lawsuit by the television station thats going to cost the department some big bucks except that they may be able to get around it thanks to chase renzi rene russo who works for the station and likes what she sees in mitch enough to pitch an idea to her boss for a reality cop show that would feature none other than mitch preston whom chase sees as a real life dirty harrybr br 	her boss likes the idea and gives chase the green light now all she has to do is convince mitch to participate which shouldnt be too hard since the station has agreed to drop the lawsuit if he will do the show but mitch is a cop not an actor and he wants nothing to do with any of it that is until he has a hearttoheart with his boss captain winship frankie faison who puts mitchs future into succinct perspective for him and just like that the show is on oh yes theres one more thing for the show mitch is going to need a partner and who do you suppose theyre going to come up with for that lets put it this way trey sellars is more than one of the usual suspectsbr br 	this is deys second film as a director his first being shanghai noon also a comedy and hes definitely showing a penchant for the genre from the opening frames he establishes a pace that keeps the story moving right along and he allows his stars to make the most of their respective talents and personal strengths including their impeccable timing with stars like de niro and murphy dey of course had a leg up on this project to begin with but hes the one who keeps it on track demonstrating that he knows what works achieving just the right blend of physical comedy and action and employing the subtleties of the dialogue to great effect br br 	there isnt a more natural actor in the business than de niro and he steps into mitchs skin like he was born to it and after years of doing hardedge cutting drama in which he turned in one remarkable performance after another with such films as analyze this meet the parents and now this one he has firmly established his proficiency for doing comedy as well mitch is not an especially complex character he is in fact something of an ordinary guy but therein lies the challenge for the actor to make him believable to make him seem like the guy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community and on all counts de niro succeeds hes mitch the guy you run into at the grocery store or the bank or say good morning to on your way to work who likes to watch the game on tv and has a life just like you and me who happens to make his living by being a cop its the character mitch has to be to make this film work because it makes the ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances angle credible its one of those role and work that is often wrongly dismissed outofhand because it looks so easy and of course this is what makes de niro so exceptional he does make it look easy and he does it with facilitybr br 	as trey sellars eddie murphy turns in a winning performance as well and its a role that fits him like the proverbial glove trey is a cop but also an aspiring actor and a bad one and it gives murphy the opportunity to play on the overexuberant side of his personality reigned in enough by dey however to keep him from soaring overthetop into jim carrey territory which works perfectly for this character and this film from his melodramatic take on a part during an audition to his throwing out of oneliners delivered by looking directly into the camera which as far as hes concerned isnt even there while filming the reality show murphys a riot and he has a chemistry with de niro that really clicks which is not unexpected as this is another of de niros many talents his ability to connect with and bring out the best in his costars all of whom evidence will support are better at their craft after having worked with him including the likes of meryl streep christopher walken and ed harris just to name a few most importantly this is a part that allows murphy to excel at what he does best and he certainly makes the most of itbr br 	russo makes the most of her role as chase too a character who isnt much of a stretch artistically but whom she presents delightfully with a strong believable performance and william shatner playing himself absolutely steals a couple of scenes as the director of the showbr br 	the supporting cast includes drena de niro annie pedro damian vargas and james roday camera man well crafted and delivered showtime is a comedy thats exactly what it is meant to be pure entertainment that provides plenty of laughs and a pleasant couple of hours that will have you chuckling for some time after its the magic of the movies 810 br br  br br  br br
