i absolutely hate the idea of made for television films  for me tvms usually involve jane seymour or jaclyn smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat disease all done in such a sugary manner that the audience doesnt need tissues it needs insulin  so when deadly voyage a made for tv film by the bbc and hbo based on a true story i vaguely remembered from a couple of years previously turned up on the tv schedules i sat down waiting to be bored senseless  i was surprisedbr br no strike that last sentence  i wasnt surprised i was shocked  here is a tvm that grips you tighter than a great white shark  in fact deadly voyage doesnt deserve to be relegated to the tv schedules it should have been made and distributed by a top hollywood film company due its absolutely terrifying premise and whats more its  unlike papillon and sleepers  completely true br br for those who dont know the story  possible spoilers as to plot  sometime in the early 90s a bunch of africans stowed away on an ukrainian freight ship bound for france in order to work there of course it was an attempt at illegal immigration but the crew of the freighter had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants onto their ship from a previous journey and not wanting to get into anymore trouble with maritime and immigration authorities the crew murder the africans after discovering them hiding in the hold all except one african  kingsley ofusu  who manages to escape from the firing squad but who must try and survive aboard the ship  but the problem is the crew are hunting him and france is still several days voyage away br br just typing the above paragraph reminds of how good deadly voyage is  what a remarkable story  and once again it is  unlike many stories that claim to be  totally true  its very well written  directed and acted  especially by sean pertwee  why isnt that guy a big name star    and most of all its a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that i can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time  i look forward to seeing again br br but youve got to ask yourself how can a tvm be better than most of the hollywood action blockbusters that came out round about the same time  oh hold on  ive just had a disturbing thought about jerry bruickhiemer doing a remake with tony scott directing and with denzil washington playing kingsley  brad pitt playing pertwees role  massive artistic licence taken with events etc lets keep deadly voyage a superlative tvm rather than a poor blockbuster
