i caught this on local mexican television at 200 am and i decided to give it a chance since its based on a real life case that deals with the murder of the typical all american family a dad a mom and a young sonbr br on the beginning the hints point to walker to be the murderer as he had strong differences with his father shortly after when walker and luke are taken to the sheriffs dept to being examined by the lies detection machine things turn out to be very differentbr br also when walker and luke attend to an appointment with their fathers lawyer they learn that luke would receive 200000 and walker is out of the heresy luke immediately buys a convertiblebr br anyways this is an excellent mystery movie that deals with betrayal ambition feelings and cold  very cold bloodbr br i know the real names were changed but still the experience is the same give this movie a try i know there are hundreds of based on real murders or events of the like but this one is truly worthy pure quality on acting direction and plot
