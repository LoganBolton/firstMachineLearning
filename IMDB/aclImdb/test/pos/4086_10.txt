tv churns out dozens of truecrime movies every year you can see 3 or 4 every saturday on lifetime and court tv can be relied on for a few every weekend so i started watching the morrison murders thinking i knew very well what to expect a more or less competent retelling of a reallife family murder what i got was a subtle beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finishbr br both the brothers were totally convincing and jonathan scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of luke the look and feel of georgia was in almost every frame if i had any complaint it was gordon clapp as the sheriff he just doesnt look or act like a smalltown southern lawman named byron calhoun he looks and sounds like medavoy and medavoy is not right for this partbr br but this is a minor quibble the morrison murders is well worth watching and not just on a rainy saturday afternoon if youre going out tape it you wont regret it
