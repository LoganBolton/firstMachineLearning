i have to offset all the terrible comments i love this movie i own the movie and the soundtrack i watch it whenever i need a pick me up granted its not like the sound of music but its as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing i adored the late and great bobby vann and james shigeta has always and will always be a favorite i saw this when it first came out in the theaters im a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than twiggy in the boyfriend its a modern musical and shouldnt be judged by all that went before its just the best for dreamers like me who wish they could find this place  no illness no wars no drugs all the bad things in life are gone this is nothing more than a feel good movie that is what all movies should be about shaun phillips title song is superb and explains the entire feel of the movie if the acting isnt the greatestwho cares i love the idea of the movie peter finch a very stiff actor liv ullmann gorgeous as ever sally kellerman surprisingly good voice michael york typical and olivia hussey stunning all convinced me they were normal run of the mill people not one of them acted like actors in a movie they acted like real people the same way i would act if i found this place torn between going home and staying there in awe of everything yes there are flaws in this movie but get over it its not citizen kane its a feel good musical
