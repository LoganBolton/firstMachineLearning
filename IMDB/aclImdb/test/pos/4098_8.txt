i saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it since then ive searched for a video but never found it until now 33 years later when i ordered it from moviehunter sorry to say it doesnt hold up this glamourized version just cant rise up to the 1937 production level i love burt bacharachs musical score that is if listend to by itself and i even bought a cd of it but for my taste it doesnt lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story just doesnt fit michael york is lost here sally kellerman tosses off a fine performance but olivia hussy is just ridiculous and not worth lugging through the himalayas the best performance is charles boyer as the head lama
