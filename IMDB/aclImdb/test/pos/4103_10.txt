it amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply ive been looking for this movie on dvd for a while and vhs for years one can get all sorts of movies on lineold movies new movies but it all targets a particular group this movie is very nostalgic for many im not sure why i cant get a copy maybe if enough people will write in the copyright holder will get a clue its about time for this to happen yes its date but so is the wizard of oz it doesnt seem like this should be so difficult so for now ill keep seeing those illegal copies on search engines like many others
