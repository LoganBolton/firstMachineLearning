the cast is admirably chosen and wellbalanced this cinematography is excellent the music is delightful as all of burt bacharachs music is and is appropriate to the plot line making a musical version of hiltons tale is a welcome change from a plodding remake we see seasoned actors who add real depth to the emotional content and significance of each scene i cannot agree with the critics who overlooked this scintillating gem of a film it is a treasure of the silver screen find it if you can  and let its magic carry you beyond the drudgery of daily worries inspiring you to find your own lost horizon
