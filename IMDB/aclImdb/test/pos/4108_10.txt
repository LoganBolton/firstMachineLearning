i dont see that much wrong with this movie granted the principal singers might not be luciano pavarotti and maria callas but they can certainly carry a tune burt bacharach and hal david are talented songwriters and i happen to love their songs especially the world is a circle the things that i will not miss and question me an answer some people claim that hermes pans choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic i disagree on both counts ive seen powdered snow before and the snow in those mountain scenes looked realistic to me and most of all in this films defense it is appropriate for a family audience at least i remember it being that way when i saw it on christmas day a few years ago with all the outcry over sex and violence in the cinema these days i find it refreshing to note that this film deserves its grating and they dont say that naughty f word every ten minutes like some films ive seen thank god so although this film may not be everyones cup of tea it does have some redeeming value and i give it ten points out of a possible ten thats my story and im sticking to it
