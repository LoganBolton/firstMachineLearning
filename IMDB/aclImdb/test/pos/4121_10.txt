this is at least very close to a perfect video publication messianic metal group dinosaurs of rock n roll biggest and most influential heavy band in the world plays their hit songs and reminisces bands past  what more do we needbr br video starts from war pigs and ends to paranoid and in the middle all the greatest and most significant classics of the original lineup are included electric funeral sweet leaf after forever iron man children of the graveand of course my personal favourite into the void im glad they didnt leave it out well how could theybr br still this video is more than just the music ozzy osbourne tony iommi geezer butler and bill ward goes over the groups colorful history only thing that slightly bothers me is when a live song is being interrupted with bits of interview for example is it that necessary to inform how the song nib got its name right in the middle of it  one on top of the other i doubt its still a small flaw so its not too big dealbr br band members also laze around in chairs and chat together pleasant material for a sabbath fan i admit i have difficulties of following what ozzy osbourne is muttering but its just amusing i had a privilege to participate when the last supper tour entered finland and for me personally this video is an ideal way to recall that magnificent show
