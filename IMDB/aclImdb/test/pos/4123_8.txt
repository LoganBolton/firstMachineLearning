this film biography of early rock and roll star buddy holly 19361959 is a tour de force for gary busey the movies highlights are buseys stage performances where he plays guitar and sings holly songs he brings such energy to the performances that hollys own filmed performances almost pale in comparison buseys infectious toothy grin lights up the screen he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his oscar nomination for best actor was well deservedbr br the film follows hollys career from growing up in lubbock texas to stardom and new york and his untimely death in a plane crash one thing i found interesting if true was buddys driving ambitionhe had great plans to go beyond recording and performance to producing as young as he was he was already establishing himself as a shrewd businessman and definitely wanted to take things to a higher level we will never know if he would have ultimately catapulted his early success into a business brand like the rolling stonesbr br the lyrics of many of hollys songs are pretty adolescent read the lyrics for peggy sue or oh boy and you will see what i mean maybe to a great extent this explains his popularity with adolescent audiences but his instrumentation and stage performances surely account for his influence on groups to followboth the rolling stones and the beatles have acknowledged his importancebr br clearly some liberties were taken for dramatic effect for example i doubt that holly ever punched out a producer in nashville or that the audience at new yorks apollo theater was so immediately responsive as to be wildly dancing in the aisles if you are interested in getting closer to the truth see the documentary the real buddy holly story 1985 that is produced and hosted by a very relaxed and engaging paul mccartney this contains interviews with hollys family friends and bandmates hollys musical brothers are not even mentioned in the buddy holly story members of other bands like keith richards and don everly also offer opinions and stories and there is footage of old holly performances the mccartney production can stand on its own but it makes an excellent companion piece to the buddy holly story and perhaps should be required viewing for anyone who watches the fictionalized story
