first im a huge buddy holly fan i grew up knowing who he was and i knew all about that fateful plane ride that extinguished three incredibly bright flames just like that but i had never truly listened to his music i had heard much of it yes but not until i sat down with the intention of getting something out of it did i truly come to see the real buddy holly and let me tell you that my world is a different one now because of himbr br because of this adoration for such an incredible man i bought the buddy holly story without ever seeing it previously im torn on my views of this film perhaps its because buddy feels so alive to me that i just couldnt bear seeing gary busey in this role ill admit that he did a nice job acting but his singing sounded so forced it seemed to me as if he knew he didnt sound a bit like buddy himself and therefore was using far too much energy to make an attempt at a similar sound in some parts of the film he succeeded but others ouchbr br the movie spanned a period of several years but i feel that portraying this time span could have been handled much better i had a difficult time distinguishing at what point in buddys life certain events were happening i also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies i think the worst one was the portrayal of the crickets i understand how their real names couldnt be used and how for simplification there were only two of them in the movie and maybe this was a good thing because the films background vocals were cringeworthy and i disliked the way they were portrayed as a hindrance to buddys career something else that really made no difference to the film but irked me was gary buseys teeth they wore me out buddy holly had much better teeth i dont know why i noticed it but i didbr br ill end this review on what i felt was the best part of the movie buddys last performance his final phone call to maria the big boppers performance bringing him and richie valens to the stage followed by the still frame ending it startled even me and i feel that it effectively shows the audience how at one moment buddy holly was so alive and energetic and that his flame was snuffed out in the blink of an eye it was a beautiful way to portray this horrible tragedy i thinkbr br good movie despite the obvious problems 710br br some obvious flaws could use some work but not bad
