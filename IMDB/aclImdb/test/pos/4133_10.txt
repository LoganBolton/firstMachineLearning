gary busey did a splendid job playing the rocknroll legend buddy holly193659 he does have a spitting image to the man being a garage band in the 50s is sure different from todays having a group of three is usually simple back in those days i bet that buddy hollybusey was a much better musician than most of what i heard since he lived in lubbock texas it was only a quiet country town back then his parents were christians though his mother was a strong supporter of her sons work thats one of the reasons he didnt act like elvis he stuck to his kinder ways that really makes him good when he went to tennessee he saw how bad the producers were they hated rocknroll that turned holly off big time getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge to holly and his friends he got to tour with sam cooke went to the famous apollo which the allafroamerican audience quickly accepted them i liked that and sam cooke made sure holly and his band got some service thats what i call tolerance its sad that he ritchie valens and jp the big bopper richardson had their music careers cut short by a plane crash in 1959 at least their memories will live on in our hearts i dont what inaccuracies were in the movie all i care is that buddy holly overcame the obstacles of music and politics in that time and the music is nearlyperfect for gary busey he was perfect in the role and making the music as well god bless you gary busey 5 stars
