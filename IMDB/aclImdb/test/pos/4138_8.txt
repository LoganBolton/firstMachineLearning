gary buseys best performance in a nicelyflowing biography since had a musical background he was able to do his own songs and it really works its always good to see that fine actor don stroud one of the crickets and charlie martin smith as wellbr br an 8 out of 10 best performance  gary busey thankfully mr busey was oscarnominated for this losing to jon voight in coming home a fairly lowbudget flick that doesnt disappoint with great songs by mr holly i hope this made plenty of dough busey was never this popular again for varying reasons but thankfully he has this one great one on his resume
