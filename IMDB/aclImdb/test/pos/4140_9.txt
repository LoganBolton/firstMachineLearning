this film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow it accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads the steadiness of the camerawork avoiding rockvideo clich√©s that were actually invented for the beatles in their first two films tight editing and a nonjudgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god or demon yes there are minor holes in the plot and incidental details that are a little unnecessary and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics but the issue here as in the much more recent i walk the line or carpenters famed tv elvis biopic of the same era is whether the meaning of the performers life in its time and place as a catalyst for fans ideals and appreciation is made manifest in the performance and this is clearly the case here we come away from this movie understanding not only how buddy holly became a star but why i dont see what else one could want from the film
