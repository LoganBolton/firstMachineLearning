i turned 13 when elvis hit the big times in 1956 with his first rca hit a year later buddy holly stepped in to give the king some competition one of buddys major talents besides his unique singing style and his songwriting ability is often downplayed buddy was also a skilled lead guitar player developing a unique rockabilly style all his own on his fender strat gary busey attempts to capture this aspect of buddys persona there were other contemporary master guitar rockers of equal caliber such as chuck berry carl perkins and eddie cochran but buddys talent is often overlookedbr br as noted by others busey is the driving force behind the success of the buddy holly story not only does the script play with the facts of buddys life but it even interjects several anachronisms for the two years of buddys popularity basically 19571959 one that comes to mind is the scene where buddy and maria are watching a 3d movie buddy is disenchanted with it all and tells maria that itll never last its just a fad in reality there were no 3d movies in circulation at the time the heyday for 3d was in the early 1950s by 1955 the fad had already faded yet another example where just a little research would have sufficed to make the story more believablebr br at times it is difficult to separate what really happened from urban legends surrounding buddys career the story about how the crickets got their name may or may not be apocryphal but it certainly did not take place the way it is presented in the movie another problem with the film is how buddys parents are depicted certainly buddys parents were supportive of his musical career maybe baby is credited to buddys mother and she did have input into the writing of the songbr br its good that buddys biggest hits were used in the movie but i miss hearing one of my favorites im looking for someone to love im proud that as a result of this movie buddys music was reissued for a new generation to hear his legacy is one of the very best from the early days of rock n roll rave on buddy rave on
