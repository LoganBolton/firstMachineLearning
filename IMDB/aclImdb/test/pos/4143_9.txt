i was fortunate enough to be an extra in this movie when i was about 13 during the roller rink scenes my junior high school drama class was invited to participate it was a fantastic experiencebr br gary busey charles martin smith and don stroud played the music live all day as a musician i can appreciate the tireless work and dedication these guys put in to their roles they must have played those songs 20 times its very difficult to maintain consistency and energy under those conditions this is visible during a cut to a closeup on thatll be the day but fortunately the unsuspecting public probably wouldnt have picked it upbr br skating around all day getting the day off from school and being transported back in time was a incredible thrill i also had my first date on film i had to walk a girl up to the ticket booth woo hoo even with an outofdate haircut and hot lights melting the vaseline in my hair it was still worth it fun stuffbr br the movie is top notch and is highly satisfying as a whole busey delivers his best role ever and the supporting cast is superb im glad to have participated in a great film of the day to think i could have been in corvette summer or something notbr br a funny ironic ending to this is that years later i was in a video store in malibu looking at the movie the week it was released on video gary busey walked in and stood right next to me i showed him the cover and babbled on how great he was and how i was an extra and whatnot pretty weird but very cool for what its worth
