i always liked listening to buddy holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash he wasnt in the old rock n roll class of  lets say chuck berry or jerry lee lewis but he wasnt far behind who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades almost every single he put out was a hitbr br so i was very pleasantly surprised how good a job gary busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice he did buddy proud as were the actors don stroud and charles martin smith who played hollys backup group the cricketsbr br musicwise there are some of hollys betterknown songs in the beginning of the film and its really good with a strong finish at the end as holly and the boys are shown in iowa in their last concert ever busey not only sings like holly hes a dead ringer for him in the looks department some thing was the actors best performance ever and you get no argument from mebr br im also glad they ended the film on an upbeat note with that iowa concert instead of dwelling on his tragic accident the ending could have been a real downer but they didnt let it be
