an interesting look at the immigrant experience told as a fable with some very weird imagerybr br i got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from sicily who traveled to america i imagine much the same as my grandfather did at that time travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships i cannot imagine it was very comfortable as shown in this filmbr br laws restricting immigrants existed i would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the mediterranean and africa immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities in the film we see physical and mental exams the latter because of the view that low intelligence is heritable single women could not enter the country on the presumption that they would become prostitutes so most married single men already in the country as arranged beforehand at ellis island before entrybr br this is the story of a british immigrant charlotte gainsbourg who arranges to marry a poor sicilian vincenzo amato he is trying to get his family through with a son that is mute and a mother aurora quattrocchi that is considered feebleminded she was fantastic in the role by the waybr br you will also see character actor vincent schiavelli in his next to the last appearance i dont know if his last film has been released he plays a matchmaker and is also very goodbr br it was a strange but enjoyable film its not for everyone as i imagine those who dont have some interest in the immigrant experience would find it rather slow
