nuovomondo 2006 shown in the us as the golden door was written and directed by emanuele crialese this film is differentand i think betterthan most movies about impoverished people who leave europe and come to the united statesbr br the film begins with scenes in a poor rural region of sicily we always hear that sicily is a rocky island but you wont really understand the implications of that phrase until you see the first halfhour of the golden door br br the middle section of the film is devoted to the long voyage to the us most immigration films show us ten minutes of people in the thirdclass section becoming seasick and then show us the statue of liberty not this moviewe get a sense for life below decks and it isnt charming we never actually see the statue of liberty either br br finally the typical movie will give us another ten minutes of ellis island and then the immigrants are walking through new yorks lower east side not herethe ellis island experience occupies about onethird of the footage br br vincenzo amato is outstanding as salvatore mancuso who is bringing his two sons and his mother to the new world charlotte gainsbourg is equally good as lucy reed a mysterious englishwoman who also speaks fluent italianbr br there are some strange touches in the movie especially the sound track with songs by nina simone there must be some symbolism there but i couldnt make sense of itbr br another reviewer has already pointed out that this film will do better viewed in a theater rather than on dvd still large screen or small screen its worth seeking out
