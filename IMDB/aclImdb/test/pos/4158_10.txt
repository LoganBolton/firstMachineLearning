i just had the opportunity to see nuovomondo hitherto known in the us as the golden door and was very impressed by both its dreamy  occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from sicially to the us in the early days of the 20th century it also worked as a proverbialmiddle finger jammed into the eyeball of homeland security preferably all the way up to the 3rd knucklein its depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land the mostly italian cast with a few exceptions works well this is a quietunderstated film that is lovely to look at the occasionalbut tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasurewhile the screenplay is well written this is a film for those who are sick  tired of mindless escapism from hollywood that serves little more than to sell popcorn not that i have any burning issues with popcornmind youi actually love the stuff you would do wise to seek out nuovomondothe golden door or whatever its being titled in your area
