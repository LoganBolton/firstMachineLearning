i never thought id say this about a biopic but there is a near overabundance of characterization especially concerning kenji miyazawas emotions and too little on the literal occurrences in his lifeby the end im not sure if he dies hes supposed to or if his sister finally dies shes supposed to or if the director spent a little too much time on the galactic railroad thats an inside joke in case you missed itmiyazawa wrote a childrens book called night on the galactic railroad however this glimpse inside the mind of a writer who sketched poetry and fairy tales from his imagination is very intelligent creative entertaining and emotionally powerfulbr br all this despite the fact that everyone is animated as animals like in many of miyazawas storiesbr br some of the visuals are truly astounding especially considering that it was a made for tv movie seriously some of them like the sequence with birds trailing blue light rival parts of fantasia however i still cant stand computer animation when it is mixed with cel animation the cgi trains are horribly obviouseven more so than the anastasia trainbr br 810
