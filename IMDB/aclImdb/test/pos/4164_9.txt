spirit and chaos is an artistic biopic of miyazawa kenji a japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century the film captures and interprets his artistic method sketching poems his inspiration the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imaginationbr br the film integrated excerpts of miyazawas poems into the plot beautifully his relationships with his students was powerful especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom miyazawas selfless compassion for the farmers in his village his sister and other unfortunate people can serve as a lesson to us all furthermore miyazawas devotion to science was also nicely portrayed in a time when western ideas were still met with skepticism especially in provincial towns like the one where miyazawa grew up he understands its usefulness in helping his fellow villagers and is inspired by its elegance the way the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the writer were truly intense and well interpretedbr br i felt that the cgi integrated into the film while groundbreaking an innovative clashed with the more organic animation it could be argued that this was intentional to represent conflict within the main character but i found it rather unaesthetic i also wish that the film had discussed miyazawas buddhist influence but it worked fine without it br br i though this film was very well done i give it a 910 with the one point being deducted for the cgi otherwise the animation plot and dialog were all wonderful and heartfelt i havent seen any other films by kawamori shoji but after seeing this one i will be sure to give them a chance
