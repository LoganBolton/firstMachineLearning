head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars the monkees and victor mature or its directorcowriter bob rafelson but also its other cowriter and brief cameo jack nicholson as it stands most of them seem to shun it and to outsiders the movie is regarded at best as a curiobr br while the tv series was famously based on the antics of the beatles help this film is also judged by the same accord yet far from the trite and painfully overrated beatles films and even the dated monkees tv series head has a layer of depth an undercurrent of mans darker nature is at work here and while that may sound like a bizarre thing to say about a manufactured pop band the use of certain themes and images hitting women laughing at cripples and reallife footage of a vietcong pow shot dead at pointblank range give the film an edge that many serious films would not dare to aspire tobr br there are also the fun moments which range from james bond parodies to big victor and my personal favourite mickey dolenz under beseige by arab soldiers on horseback one of them turns to mickey and hisses pssst only for the pssst to appear in subtitles the group are aware of their manufactured image in the film im the dummy mickey im always the dummy claims tork neatly summing up his onedimensional foil role of the series meaning that their characters  they play themselves acting and notacting here  are opened out more and consequently are less generic and irritating than they were in the series this level of parody and selfawareness even takes on their fabfour origins with subtler takes on the maharishi and outandout acknowledgements with a waitress who asks well if it isnt gods gift to the eightyearolds are you still paying tribute to ringo starr also listen out for tork whistling strawberry fields forever while in the bathroombr br then there are the songs of course six of them here slightly more psychedelic than usual which may have alienated their fanbase and even a frank zappa cameo wouldnt have turned on an adult audience to their charms at this point probably the best is the charming as we go along though the first a carol kingpenned porpoise song interestingly talks of the desire to live while time is ticking remorselessly away and death gets ever nearer on a lighter note its refrain of the porpoise is laughing seems to be a direct mickeytake of i am the walrusbr br constantly inventive with direct references to silent film and drug culture perhaps heads finest feature is its narrative structure not the only  but the most important  reason why it improves with multiple viewings the story goes left right forwards backwards circular and through several levels of reality in essence a series of sketches hung loosely together its cohesion is tightened by the spacetime defying plot which hangs its internal logic together by means of flashback dream sequence prison of the mind and remote control channel changerbr br with a perfect beginning and end this intelligentlywritten knowing film was not what the monkees preteen audience was expecting and subsequently suffered a negative critical reception now those expectations have gone this one is in dire need of serious reappraisal
