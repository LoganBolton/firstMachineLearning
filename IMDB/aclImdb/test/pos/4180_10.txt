try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and youll be hardpressed head is a masterpiece of nonlinear nonstructure surrealism and experimentaion in less than 90 minutes it manages to be not only a timecapsule of an era but also a fulllength experimental feature that defies timespace and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties couldhead is a reflection of those films no matter how one feels about the monkees this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium had it not been for the films unorthodox ad campaign and the fact that by the time it came out the monkees so oversaturated the media that the public had become weary of them and every critic was ready to pounce on them this could have had a much greater impact studying how the film was edited is much more important and exciting than whats actually in the film and yet there are some great things in it great songs great cinematography etc  should be seen after midnight for maximum effect because of its overall dreamlike feel 1968 was a time of social unrest and a call for change thus the films working title changes and head perfectly mirrors that time
