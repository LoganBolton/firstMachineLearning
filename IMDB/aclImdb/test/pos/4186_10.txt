a very weird psychedelic esoteric and did i say weird  experiencebr br but on at least on one level  it did exactly what it was supposed to do it bridged the gap between the silly manufactured hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the monkees tv program and the adult musically growing and evolving and yet still a little silly monkees of the 70s and beyondbr br the most important line in the film is mike nesmiths if they think we are plastic now wait till they see how we do it that the monkees were tired of all of the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of record they said it over and over in interviews they needed to remake themselves and what better way that to debunk and hilariously lampoon the very machine that created them and at the same time they commented on our whole society news movies art everything and said hey why pick on us  isnt all of this stuff manufactured on one point or another these are the orwellian proles the monkees represented the persecuted everyman even at their silliest in the tv seriespulling down big brothers pants and kicking him in his very deserving buttbr br loved the ideas loved the music loved the effects loved the movie but then as peter tork says in the movie but then why should i speak since i know nothing
