this is not your runofthe mill police story where the characters were only secondary to the gun battles and car chases the episodes so far are more realistic and intelligentbr br if you are looking for something with a lot of buttkicking rambostyle cop story you will not find it herebr br i gave it a 9 i wish this series lives long morse is excellent
