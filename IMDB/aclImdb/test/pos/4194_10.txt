i will admit i had the opportunity in the past to watch this film and after about 5  10 minutes into it i felt like many did i was expecting a monkey movie that was similar to the television show but instead i was given well i didnt know what i was given to be honestbr br however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings and just when i think ive figured out something in the film its answer is destroyed once i watch the film again brilliance indeedbr br it seems that most people who disliked this film are wanting to watch a film with primarily a clear plot they want everything explained and all questions answered in the finale well sorry if thats what youre wanting this is not the movie for you but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give youbr br think of the film being like a dream in our dreams things make no sense things we expect to happen dont people places and things dont speak act or function in the same way they do in reality to complain about head is like complaining about a dream youve had that you felt you could not understand the mind is a complex system and being that a film titled head is just as complex is it that difficult to relate the twobr br the music and musical numbers really stand out especially peter torks two compositions which remain the best tracks in the film can you dig it and long title do i have to do this all over againbr br this film proves that the monkees were much more than just four zanny guys in a prefab group as their critics called them on a television show but that they are actually much more intelligent and talented than the world would give them credit for theres so many messages that can be derived from the film both in regards to the monkees and to the entertainment industry in general that it stands as a masterpiece of filmmaking that was far ahead of its timebr br i feel had this film been released as an independent piece at this point and time it would actually garner the respect and admiration it deservesbr br and one finale notebr br one could compare this to the beatles magical mystery tour film since the beatles film appeared to be just as strange and bizarre however in my opinion head stands far above anything the beatles put on celluloid
