i am  proud of head mike nesmith has said he should be because this film which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors works on many levelsbr br yes its unconventional to many frustrating its almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt you figure it outbr br you probably already know that the monkees tv show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception tv shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first than to entertain that the monkees broke out of the box for a short time to make head is a testament to the groups popularity and importance in pop culture despite where your heads at get one thing straight head is not the monkees tv showbr br so what we have here is a psychedelic documentary about western pop culture from a source that has authority on the subject head is a movie that could only come from those inside the box by 1968 the monkees cast and crew were seasoned and weary professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment the movie was a deliberate attempt at market repositioning so it did three things make a film the way the monkees envisioned most importantly reinvent the group to one not subservient to its old bosses  and yas hipper than before make a film that exposed american attitudes of information disseminationbr br head therefore really is about media manipulation and its net result deception the mass media is supposed to inform educate us on the happenings in the world at large and ultimately asks us to form opinions of these events that can shape thought into positive action thus we assume the information we absorb to be complete and unbiased  otherwise how can one establish a valued conclusion on any one idea presented by a book newspaper or tv show in one of the street interviews in head a guy admits i havent looked at a newspaper or tv in years is he lesser or better the man even the drug parallels are a soft veiling of things are not as they seem remember the old joke everything you know is wrong the screenplay starts with the monkees public admission of its own manufactured image and runs with the football  literally is the football scene in the movie a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind head is the film a streamofconsciousness exercise is the film the culmination of pot smoking marathons there are too many coincidences that occur in the film that suggest otherwise my guess is that head is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intended and unintendedbr br largely the insiders responsible for head seem to enjoy themselves in the revelries that take place in the film but there is anger  anger at the chaos that characterized the late 60s and anger at the way the media television especially had changed culture in negative ways drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late 60s and still are but the producers of head want you to know that poor information is a far greater dangerbr br wars have been attributed to hoaxes and lies what perfect way to spread disinformation than through tv repeatedly the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle to the monkees and seemingly all of us as well in one scene peter is sullenly sitting in a saloon holding a melting ice cream cone and is asked by a fellow monkey whats wrong i bought this ice cream cone and i dont want it the movie suggests that the first purpose of the media is not to inform but to sell en mass blindly head goes further put any idea into someones head and merrily goes hebr br the filmmakers know this and the danger is real head is either a movie that creates itself as we go along or is a deliberate statement perhaps perhaps not maybe it is just pot meets advertising as critics scathed in 1968 the jokes are on the monkees and us be careful what you ask for you may get itbr br cheers a true guilty pleasure very funny intelligent will please the fans find the substance its there unabashedly weird bizarre collection of characters good tunage length is appropriate lots of great one liners including my all time prophetic favorite the tragedy of your times my young friends is that you may get exactly what you wantbr br caveats dated drugs no plot no linear delivery of any thought in particular at least twentyfive stories that interweave in stopand go fashion so may easily frustrate may seem pretentious to some people who cant stand the monkees need not watch though that in itself is no reason to avoid it the psychedelic special effects may kill your ailing picture tube or your acid burnt out eyeballsbr br match cut
