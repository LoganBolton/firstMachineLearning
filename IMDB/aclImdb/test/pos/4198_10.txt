this is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldnt like it my wife has never seen it and when i just rewatched it last night i waited until after she went to bed she might have been amused by a couple small snippets but i know she would have had enough within ten minutesbr br head has nothing like a conventional story the film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era it could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres if youre not a big fan of those thingspsychedelia surrealism postmodernism and the acid trip aesthetic assuming theres a difference between them you should probably stay away from this film on the other hand if you are a fan of that stuff you need to run out and buy head now if you havent alreadybr br oddly the film has never received much respect that probably has a lot to do with preconceptions after all it does star the monkeesmicky dolenz davy jones michael nesmith and peter torkand the monkees were a musical group of actors put together by producers bob rafelson and bert schneider to be a kidfriendly bubblegummy beatles for a television series in their era they had as much respect as say menudo new kids on the block the spice girls and so on as a fellow imdb reviewer rightly notesperhaps people in 1968 thinking of the monkees as a silly factorymade pop band ripoff of the beatles refused to see headbr br the monkees and head have never been quite able to shed that negative public perception its a shame because there was a lot of talent both musically and otherwise in the monkees its probably odder that rafelson who directs here and coproduces with schneider and jack nicholson yes that jack nicholson who wrote the script and also coproduces decided to take the monkees in this unusual direction its as if new kids on the block suddenly put out an album equivalent to pink floyds ummagumma 1969 or atom heart mother 1970 in fact the songs in head written by the monkees and frequent collaborators such as carole king and harry nilsson have a floydlike quality somewhere between the syd barrett era and the immediate postbarrett era this is much more prominent than any beatles similarity some people have complained about the music in the film but to me all the songs are gems for that matter some people dislike barrett era or other floyd which is just as difficult for me to empathize withbr br but what is head about the basic gist is just that the monkees are taking a trip through various film genresthere are war scenes adventure scenes horror scenes comedy scenes drama scenes western scenes scifi scenes romance scenes and on and on except in the films reality this turns out to be happening primarily if not exclusively on a studio lot at root were watching the monkees shoot a film of course all of the scenes in the various genres have something surreal and selfreferential about them and they and individual shots within a scene tend to lead to one another using dream logic not dissimilar to the monty python television show as a dream head tends to vacillate between a good dream and a nightmare while often being one that would cause you to laugh in your sleep something that i frequently do by the waybr br technically rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to realize the above there are scenes with extensive negative images there are a lot of very fast cuts including a great sequence that features davy jones and tony basil dancing alternately in a white and a black room wearing a combination of white and black reversed in each that occasionally toggles back and forth as quickly as two frames at a time there are a lot of bizarre segues there is an animated cow mouth there are odd editing devices and so on for my money i wish this stuff wasnt just a relic of the psychedelic era this is the kind of artistic approach i relish it seemed like a good idea back then and i still think its a good idea id like to see films like the life aquatic with steve zissou using 2004 using these types of extended techniques now that would make that film surrealbr br interpretationally some folks who arent so in tune with the acid trip aesthetic have complained that its basically bs to offer meanings for something intended to not have any i disagree with such a pessimisticnihilistic view head was intended to have a lot of meanings and its not just films without conventional plots that have multiple interpretations nicholson rafelson and schneider have a lot of interesting things to say about the monkeesthe film postmodernistically comments on their manufactured status pop stardomway before pink floyd head conflates pop stardom and violence from images of war to images of fans cannibalistically dismantling their idols and na√Øve usoriented ideas of international perceptions and respectwellarmed foreigners in a desert surrender to micky dolenz just because hes an american then later they blow up a coke machine again in the desert for him because hes thirsty and cant gain access the film comments on many other topicsfrom big industry to police surveys spectatorship especially in relation to tragedies and on and on head is full of ideas appropriately enough with intelligent multifaceted things to say about thembr br head deserves to be considered a classicits basically shooting for the same vibe as the beatles yellow submarine both premiered in november of 1968 interestingly enough and both were intended as something of a summation of the psychedelic aesthetic yellow submarine wasnt quite successful head is everything yellow submarine should have been
