everywhere i hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetchedwell maybe a dogood cab driver in philly is pushing it a little at least the cab drivers ive met but thats what makes the show greatbr br the fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun its highly watchable and even though u know mike wins out in the end he never wins in life david morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role his supporting cast is great and i must say the location of the show is especially greatbr br all in all i watch this show not because im looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action i watch this show because its got great acting a good premise and a great storyline every week its also a plus when i can pick out the landmarks he drives by or know what intersection hes at i love this show and i love philly give this show a shot
