i had heard of john garfield but didnt know him i loved this movie i had never heard of it i just picked it up randomly john garfield is a boxer in the movie he had been in real life also so he knew his part he was a fugitive throughout the movie someone else killed a man he character was blamed he is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him all sorts of minor plots ensue my favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and one dead end kid couldnt swim and none of them could get outjohns character saves the day the dead end kids were great as his friends and followers one of them right to the very end ann sheridan played the familys daughter and johns eventual love interest she was believable but not lovable in my opinionthe only weak link in the movie
