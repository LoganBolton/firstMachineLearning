whoever plays the part of j douglas williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job he apparently received no credits too badbr br all the dead end kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry it is odd to watch them in a western setting with their brooklyn accents  i guess that should be bowery  they even show some swimming abilitiesbr br i think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxinglovecrime story my favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film busby berkeley shows his dance movie expertise when john garfield shifts his feet and as we watch that move the camera moves up to his face i will not give away why or when but the look on his face at that point probably brought the 1939 audience to its feet in the theatersbr br some will think john garfield looks a lot like frank sinatra in many scenes just his face actually frank was not yet making movies so maybe frank looked like john the boxer named smith in the movie looks like a clone of ed begley jrbr br now i must tell you something that is not a spoiler but if you watch the movie watch grandmas hands may robson does her part well she seems to have hands that wander a bit in a scene where she and a crowd go into the boxers john garfield dressing room watch where she touches the reclining john garfield while he is wearing only his trunksbr br a great ending lots of wonderful charactersbr br best line might be at the gas station eight gallons thats a dollar twentyeight tom willett
