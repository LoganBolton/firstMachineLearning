the early films of the dead end kids before they were rechristened the bowery boys were all very entertaining and wellproduced films from warner brothers despite their being rather formulaic they still had excellent writing acting and hold up well over time do not confuse these with the cheap bowery boys films from monogram picturesdespite the presence of huntz hall and leo gorcey these films were several notches below the earlier films in regard to qualitybr br the film begins with toughguy john garfield winning the lightweight boxing championship unfortunately shortly after this hes on a drunken binge and is blamed for a murder he really didnt commit the problem is that he was so loaded that he wasnt sure he didnt kill the man so he runs away and lives the life of a hobo eventually he meets up with feisty may robson and the dead end kidsas well as a lady you just know will become his girlfriend given timebr br where the rest of the film goes was not all that surprising but because of the quality of the film it doesnt seem to matter garfield and the kids are at their best and this is a film sure to please all but the pickiest of viewers
