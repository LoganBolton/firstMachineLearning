another enjoyable warner flick i really liked john garfield in this though im wondering why cagney wasnt in the role perhaps it was too similar to angels with dirty faces i mean its another dead end kids story of sorts too but i really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama the boys work great with garfield a nice sequence was the whole swimming scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disasterbr br one negative comment claude rains was grossly miscast as the detective the fine actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a whorehouse
