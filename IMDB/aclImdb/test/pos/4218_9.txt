the movie was surprisingly wonderful especially considering the last sequel the third was dark and semiinteresting but it wasnt nearly as fun or enjoyable as this it is filled with comedic lines about martha stuart dolls anatomy masturbation and it was actually done effectively during gruesome and disturbing images the movie wasnt scary or suspenseful and im sure that it wasnt the directors intention it was fun because of the silliness jennifer tillys over the top and sexy performance the puppetry of the dolls were so well handled the movement of mouth lips tears in eyes knife in chest and the costumes the dolls were just marvelous and it made the gruesome deaths more enoyable considering the fact that they were done by wonderful dolls the new chucky look was great and tiffany was very cute a few scenes with chucky hugging the human tiffany even made my father smile jesse and jade were surprisingly well very attractive and the special effects were cool the ending was so unsuspected and the fact that they could make another as good is quite unlikely it may not be as suspenseful as movies like halloween h2o or urban legend but it is certainly more fun
