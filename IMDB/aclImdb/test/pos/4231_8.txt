the first childs play was an original and effective little horror movie as expected though the 2 horrible sequels seemed to spell the end for this franchisebr br well when i heard they were making a 4th one called bride of chucky i just rolled my eyes and muttered a when will they ever learnbr br but when i heard that they had gotten a great director ronny yu and a solid cast including the awe inspiring jennifer tilly my interest in it perked upbr br this film is extremely well done it has a great sense of humor highly stylized graphic violence great cinematography and the stunningly sexy jennifer tilly strutting her most impressive stuff during the first half i should add that she is also a fantastic actress as wellbr br it keeps its tongue firmly in cheek without veering into campy territory the doll effects are great and the verbal interplay between them is priceless its more of a horrorcomedy than straight horror but the humor is welcome and well integrated br br ive already heard that theyre planning a son of chucky if they can match the quality of this film than maybe this franchise will have made a legitimate comebackbr br rating85
