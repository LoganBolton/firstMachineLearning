ive commented once on this chucky great but i had to do it again to say some things about the film when i first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater the film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first chucky film ever in a theater and that was a special moment for me because i cherish chucky the other horror villains are referenced with great coolness and the gore was shockingly great the scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful that was a great gore scene and the ending was so bizarre and shocking it made me s my pants the idea of having the seed of chucky was very very bizarre and shocking when i left the theater i just loved it and i couldnt believe it was real the bizarre and different qualities of this childs play installment for some reason made me mark it as the jason goes to hell of the childs play series it just had that intensely shocking bizarre and different quality that reminded me of jason goes to hell a sure  out of  heres how i rank the series  1423 i loved it but not quite as much as tom hollands original childs play classic i cant wait for seed of chucky bring it on
