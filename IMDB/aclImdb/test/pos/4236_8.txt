i would say bride of chucky is a return to greatness but the series was never really great very good 1 was 23 were throwaways and i think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie and it contains the best subtitletagline chucky gets lucky so he does in the role of jennifer tilly who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as jeri ryan did for star trek voyager tilly didnt just create a presence she added much needed humor backstory drama tension and a great little sidekickplaything for chucky and as much as i liked her in the feature she cant get all the credit the props watch the first 12 minutes for horrorhomages the writing the inside jokes again the opening  pinhead and chucky lines were great in fact if this were a movie it would take 34 sequels just to do it justice among others mercifully chucky and the series has given up on andy the hide the soul quest and just settled for a new way out of his body he teams up with his ex tilly whom he transfers into a bride doll and a couple of bonnie  clyde teens really heigl to regain this pendant buried with chuckys human corpse this is for any chucky fan 1980s slasherhorror fans or even to those whos never seen any of the previous childs play films its funny dark harmless gory  but not over the top and despite tillys literal 20 minutes of screen time its always great to see her after all you barely see her play poker anymore side note of course i picked up on the superman reference  hackensack nj
