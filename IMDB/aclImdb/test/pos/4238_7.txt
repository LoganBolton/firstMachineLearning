this is a 100 improvement over the dross of a third movie and its one hell of a good time this is a john hughes movie meets the devils rejects i really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series i thought jennifer tilly played tiffany really well and brad dourif in chuckys shoes once again really makes this movie shine actually theyre the only good parts of the movie i got rather bored with katherine heigl and nick stables scenes its as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day but chucky and tiffany were great to watch and i really liked the black humor to it i thought it made the movie stand out more if you want one hell of a good time then be sure to check this outbr br 710
