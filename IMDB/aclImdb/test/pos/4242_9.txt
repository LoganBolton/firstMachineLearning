chucky the murderous doll from childs play and 2 crappy sequels is dead but his exgirlfriend tiffany jennifer tilly gets his remains and using voodoo for dummies revives him then through circumstances too convoluted to get into she is killed and has her soul put into another doll together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple nick stabile katherine heigl to take them to chucks coffin to get an amulet to make chucky and tiffany real people againbr br a lot better than it sounds after the last two sequels to childs play both of which were horrible i was expecting the worst but this actually was lots of fun the movie doesnt take itself seriously for a second seriouslyhow could it and the lines and situations are actually quite funny also there are a few very gory murders thrown in to satisfy us horror fans and the film never stops moving the movie also has a few things usually not found in a horror moviea gay best friend gordon michael woolvett who is intelligent and not played for laughs and a sequence in which stabile has his shirt off just to show his muscular body john ritter has a nice cameo too as a sheriffbr br the acting is goodstabile is young very handsome and likable heigl doesnt have much to do but pulls it off and brad dourif the voice of chucky and tilly are hilarious as the murderous dolls my favorite part is when the dolls have sex dont ask and she asks for a rubber and he responds but im made of rubber the special effects are good no lousy cgi here and this is one of the few horror films to mix humor and violence in an entertaining way well worth seeing i give it a 9
