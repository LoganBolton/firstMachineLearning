i have to admit i had never heard of this movie i caught it last night on tmc i thought it was hysterical i laughed so hard and loved the ending image what a marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with salvadore dali and malcolmn x and then all dropped lsdbr br funny and edgy are two overused words these days this movie sure has that plus about 200 iq points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot i had to be up at 600 am and watched it until 230 i over slept and missed my obligations still worth it i would not recommend renting it i would recommend owning it it was that goodbr br the only warning i have is that so of the references are dated and might not be gotten by younger people bare with it and use your headbr br i would have to put it in my top comedies of all time
