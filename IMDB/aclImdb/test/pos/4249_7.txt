sure the film is full of black militant stereotypes and much of the jargon of the time in that sense the movie has indeed dated but as a satirical look at americas number one parasitical industry advertising its still on target but just as important is the counter message namely the effect of big bucks on those who would make the industry more socially responsibleno promoting war toys alcohol etc thus the movies also about the allures of capitalism note for example how putneys garb suddenly changes to resemble thirdworld revolutionary fidels just before he pulls out of the firm for a moment it looks like swopes minirevolution has succeeded among his staff and hes moving on maybe to spread the movement but then the former militants succumb to the allure of big bucks and he departs shaking his head perhaps to hijack a plane to cuba downeys final word however is an ironical one as the arab i believe burns down the money tower leaving the metaphorical structure of advertising capitalism a smoking ruin to me this looks like change can only succeed as a cleansing act of destruction and not as a process of reforma message consistent with the radical spirit of the timebr br whatever the subtext there are some genuinely funny moments especially with the commercials that play as well now as they did then those who compare the anarchic style to that of the marx bros make a good point the throwaway lines fly thick and fast along with the outrageous setups forty years later its still a hard movie to get a consistent handle on despite the crudities however the film remains a work of daring originality with some genuinely telling moments
