i love this show its clever and very well acted david morse and andre braugher have great chemistry the writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief after every new episode im always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is my only complaint would be donna murphys absence at this point in the second season as david morse exwife heather she added such character to the showbr br i think this show is a credit to the crimedrama genre with that said  i can not for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating would someone please who gave this show a 1 rating back it up with a critique
