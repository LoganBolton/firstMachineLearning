when someone refers to the independent cinema realm in the united states its often inferred that it means the filmmaker or people behind the project had much more creative freedom and did what they wanted this today is not really always the case unless someone is a solid auteur and creative freedom still comes with the caveat that one has to find distribution with one of the independent divisions of major studios or by getting picked up somehow for some kind of lowlevel deal at a worthwhile film festival but putney swope robert downey srs film about a toughasnails africanamerican accidentally promoted to head advertising guru at a production company is independent cinema the kind of work that went right along with the likes or romeros night of the living dead and cassavetes faces at the same time of getting no real typical studio distribution but causing waves kicking ass and taking names in the cinema world for all its moments that are rough and crude its unforgettablebr br its also a film that is funny very and excruciatingly funny sometimes the sense of humor is just so ridiculous its nearly impossible not to laugh from the mere appearance of the president mimeo with his wife to lines of dialog from the advertisements swopes team puts together like i cant eat an air conditioner in a real soul voice it is as smart as the audience it is aiming at which is anyone with two brain cells to put together who can see that this work isnt offensive or too shocking because its meant to rattle the cage and it does this pretty well in the first five minutes once thats past downey sr goes on his blitz of sorts as far as being a filmmaker with nothing to lose his protagonist is part fidel castro part isaac hayes circa 1972 and yes its 1969 in the film and part hardassed ad exec with a firing streak to make mr spacely on the jetsons look kind and dont forget those side characters dear godbr br theres so many memorable lines and moments that its hard to keep track from maybe the most hilarious botched assassination attempt in any movie to the one ad for faceoff skin cream that includes lines that would give south park a run for its dirtymouth money to just little asides with the one guy from jack hills movies playing the muslim who keeps giving lip to swope and that one boy with the the nun who curses up a storm and impresses swope in a swift stroke its a pretty direct message about media and advertising but theres also a lot of powerful moments where it just hits the nail on the head about racism in america sometimes without having to do more than a gesture and sometimes with doing something huge like having black panther types going this way and that around swopes advertising regime and for a lowbudget production i mean super low hence the comparison to night of the living dead and faces downey got some really good actors all nonunion and its hard to imagine that some of them might have had their first time on camera herebr br it should be mentioned that downeys style doesnt make it perfect it is crude and sometimes too crazy and dated for its own good and im sure i didnt get some of the underlying humor of a couple of the ads since im from a full generation after these ads were aired albeit the miss redneck jersey was definitely not lost on me in general though this is one of the finest of its time period a satire that stings and a feature with a predominantly black cast that is all too knowing of what comes from an excess of power regardless of skin color it is as someone might say good s
