i thought i might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years on the contrary i was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour in 1969 the transition among africanamerican groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and selfdetermination was still quite new and more than a little controversial it took courage and finesse to portray both the establishment and the antiestablishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life special mention should be made of arnold johnsons performance he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery id rather watch this than to sir with love any old day
