if you get a chance to get a hold of this lost for many years gem i doubt you will be disappointed ps has an odd blend of social satire and ultracool blaxploitation even hints of slapstick but its so odd that it was not only ahead of its time nothing has been seen like it sincebr br i strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated especially with spike lees bamboozaled sp a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message good filmmaking disjointed scriptbr br robert downys direction is brilliant allowing many of his actors to improvise the film gets better as it goes along and the jokes swagger from hit or miss oneliners that are as forgiven as those found in a mel brooks comedy to sheer nonpc i cant believe they just said that funbr br favorite parts the commercials the film switches from gritty black and white depictions of the ad agency to beautiful perhaps 16mm color and gets away with it br br i refuse to hint at any spoilers but if you get the chance to see the dvd version be sure and watch the downey interview but leave it until after the movie br br my vote 1010 most underrated film of the late 60s early 70s thank you prince
