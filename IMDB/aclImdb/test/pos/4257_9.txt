i cant say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often ive described that scene to folks not familiar with this film i saw it the year it was released i was 19 i dont think there were a dozen people in that east village theater that night for years i thought we were the only ones who saw it nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as i had and see its lasting value despite the time gone by rent it buy it or steal it a must see
