i especially liked the ending of this moviei really felt what the characters must have felt which i think is a mark of good directing i was tickled with how the new hire at the record store turned outgreat character development there even though his role would probably be considered minorbr br i was also impressed that the entire film while dark in its subject matter was free from gratuitous nudity profanity and violence sadness sexuality and darkness can all be communicated often better by what is left unsaid but it seems that this is often unique to really classy films and actors kudos to the filmmaker for that
