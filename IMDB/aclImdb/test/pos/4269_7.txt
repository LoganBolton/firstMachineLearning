where do we go from here that is the overriding question of this film and make no mistake mainly etc the 2003 effort from director john jansen asks far more questions than it answers but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this onebr br much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies and im sure many of the questions raised by the main characters youll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery however one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer questions are raised  everything from the mundane to the profound  but jansen skillfully forces his audience to examine and answer these questions ourselves with little to no help from the charactersbr br side 1 opens with an increasingly complex and beautifully orchestrated arrangement of nonlinear segments to introduce us to the main characters we meet them on the morning of april 8 1994  the day kurt cobain committed suicide and it is the death of cobain and the journey to his wake two days later in seattle that serve as the backdrop for the film in exploring cobains life music and death the characters attempt  with varying degrees of success  to understand and come to terms with their own livesbr br there are some aspects of the film that are what you might expect from a lowbudget indie film the performances range from decidedly mediocre to outstanding with the strongest performances coming from jessica scott holly and noel wood daniel some of the dialogue is admittedly a bit stiff but never completely strays into the unreal and there are some minor sound problems particularly once we get on the road that make it difficult at times to follow the action on screenbr br but despite its shortcomings mainly etc is a solid deeply affecting piece of cinema amid moments of haunting poignancy laughoutloud humor and intimate turmoil jansen deftly weaves all of the character threads together and illuminates their own struggles while at the same time making them accessible and engaging for us and because we can see reflections of ourselves in one or more of these characters we can identify with the questions and issues theyre struggling with and were able to look back and remember where we were on that day in 1994 when for many people the world changedbr br while jansen takes credit for the writing editing and direction of the film kudos must be given to his photography as well with an uncanny eye and amazing ability to capture and draw us into each of the characters worlds jansen managed to produce shot after shot after shot that stuck with me long after the credits rolledbr br and no review of this film would be complete without a nod to the amazing soundtrack the music in this film is used to amazing effect at times subtly underscoring the action at other times taking center stage but never getting in the way or deteriorating into kitschy music video the soundtrack plays like the ultimate greatest hits though i suspect that label would probably not sit very well with the directorbr br the new double dvd archive edition offers some deleted scenes trailers music videos and a cobain documentary the deleted scenes offer some insight into the making of the film through alternate opening and closing sequences and its certainly a treat to have the rare and beautiful raining kind video the cobain documentary is fine if a bit worse for wear and certainly more extensive documentaries are available for the hardcore fans conspicuously absent is a director commentary and i cant help but wonder if jansen has plans to rerelease this at some point with that tasty tidbit attachedbr br suffice to say that the next time youre looking for a strong piece of work from a talented filmmaker i recommend you get on board
