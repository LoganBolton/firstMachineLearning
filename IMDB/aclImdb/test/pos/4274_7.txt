this show really is the broadway american idol it has singing the british guy a guy whos sometimes nice and a supernice womanbr br of course it is different because there is a singoff and theres dancing and some acting we just dont see some of the acting br br i gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that i know a lot of people including mewould make if they were working for the show the first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home i know they want to find the right danny and sandy but america should have the power to decide who does home theres really no point to the singoff the person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway another things id change is to see them actually act on the show whats broadway without the acting the last thing that need to be changed is the song the eliminated people sing at the end the eliminated danny always sings the same song and the eliminated sandy always sings the same song as they exit since they sing it every week those songs eventually get annoyingbr br i admit to not being a fan of the movie grease but for some reason i am hooked this show is very underrated it has so many memorable performances and moments
