i really liked this moviebr br everyone has something to be blamed for everyone is real no paperboard heroes or cold omnipotent knowall charactersbr br i read many others viewers here complaining about anne morality and about james will to maintain his love for her despite her cheating on him but i dont agreebr br i found anne emily watson absolutely wonderful and i felt love for herbr br she was a heavily repressed woman her actions were not planned once she started to break free she was in confusion and did many errors but so its in real life when you gain freedom you are likely to do errors expecially at the start pointbr br was she a little too ungrateful maybe but we must remember that she is running with her feet for the first time she knows that james after all is a good man maybe a little too stiff serious and work centered but she also feels the urge to live the life as herselfbr br is she to blame more than him i think nobr br but the turn happening into their lives generates some changesbr br james instead of letting his wife go out of his life as other viewers suggested as the right choice bites the bullet and waits hoping for the better he starts to understand that what he superficially though was ok his marriage in reality was a control game played by him on his wifebr br this is not a story with characters having overemotional and precarious nature ie the usual clich√® latin american or italian jealous guys this is a story of men and women that use both heart and brainbr br it can be very painful but if you really love a person women or man and if you are not a terribly unstable nature you are likely to forgive hisher cheating and let himher go unless you are a jealous prehistoric crimeofpassion inclined possessive and mentally instable individualbr br a really good movie the last scene when james  despite all the things happened before  goes with anne to the train station is really moving she is free and he understood what freedom means for a personbr br guido
