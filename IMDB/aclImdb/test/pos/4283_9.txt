how on earth can people give this movie a low rating unbelievable the performances of wilkinson and watson are so full of merit that i can only imagine that these detractors were weaned on blockbusters and porn if this sounds badtempered its because i just wiped my original 400worder just now i was so impressed by tom wilkinson all hail the guy this is a performance of considerable subtlety and massive skill his development as an actor from the full monty to this masterpiece of a performance is amazing one of the best things to happen in filmmaking in the last ten yearsbr br emily watson is somewhat less commanding due to that glint in her eye that says see me this cheeky woman here you cant guess what im going to do next because i dont know either it seems to be something she cant help showing us in every role but still shes an actor of terrific ability and presence she is very sexy here as she needs to be and fair play to her for this this is a screen quality that normally for me she doesnt have in previous filmsbr br as you might expect rupert everett required to play an upperclass late30 something who could give tutorials at phd level in how not to give a toss about heading to hell on account of total selfishness delivers he is so thin here throughout the movie however im worried for him linda bassetts housekeeper is also excellent a smallish role but with a major plot twist to deliver she makes you ponder how much talent we have in britain in terms of character acting i want to see more of herbr br the narrative arc is fine its an interesting enough plot given that noone in filmmaking seems to be trying to convince joe public that theres nothing new under the sun though it does stray towards 40s melodrama in the last reel but never mind that  this is a terrific 80 minutes worth of anyone who has halfabrains money congrats to julian fellowes on his first directorial effort o how we need more films of substance like this he shows a lot of skill in terms of adapting the original novel telling a story with much effectiveness and subtlety and congrats too on conjuring an immense display of the film actors art from mr tom wilkinson what a geezerbr br t
