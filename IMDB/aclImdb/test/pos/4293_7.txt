another popular screening for a british picture at coalvilles century theatre a well crafted solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing twists in the taleas the lies piled up a masterclass of acting by a flawless cast well marshaled by first time director julian fellowes outstanding performance as usual by tom wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors linda bassett and john neville our audience was engrossed by this film which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you jump a good tight production at around only 80 minutes probably produced on a very limited budget but a success which should see fellowes directing again for the big screen some publicity for the film seemed to suggest it was set in the 50s as per nigel balchins novelbut obviously this is not the case recommended viewing
