although this film is set amongst the sophisticated english upper classes it is a simple story of a couple torn asunder it has a slightly dated air being an adaptation of a way through the wood a 1950 novel by nigel balchin once hugely popular and now forgotten julian fellowes who despite an academy award for the script of gosford park has a somewhat anachronistic persona himself wrote the script and directed the latter for the first time with the dvd version i saw there is a most illuminating audio commentary by julian his primary focus was on getting his characters right and by and large he has succeeded in this he was helped by two outstanding performances from tom wilkinson as james the stitched up city lawyer and emily watson as his attractive wife anne he also kept it short the running time is only 80 minutesbr br james and anne have a town house in chelsea and a comfortable former vicarage in buckinghamshire anne is some years younger but they are childless outwardly they seem happy but james one of natures moralists unusual for a city lawyer is a control freak just down the road is the aristocratic the hon william buel who is not one for middleclass morality and he is more than happy to take advantage but theres a complication a road accident in which an elderly cyclist is knocked over in a country lane by a ruthlessly driven range rover just like the hon bills soon james anne bill and the victims widow who happens to be james and annes cleaner are drawn in to a conspiracy to conceal what really happened the primary focus is on the corrosive effect of all this on james and annes relationshipbr br the third person in this m√©nage a trios bill is played by rupert everett from the point of view of casting his languid superior manner is right for the part yet somehow he doesnt quite get there partly this is because he is supposed to be sick for some of the time and he looks well when he is supposed to be sick and viceversa the part seems underdeveloped it is interesting that john neville as bills father who has only one significant scene manages to establish his character beautifully in the time he hasbr br the world of five star hotels and superior restaurants is nicely evoked as julian fellowes says in the audio commentary these people are able to convince themselves that the edwardian age still exists at bottom though the film is about what draws a couple together and what tears them apart nigel balchin was going through a marriage breakup when he wrote the book and fellowes has made a good fist of conveying the atmosphere as he says his is a fairly free adaptation but the central theme is the same
