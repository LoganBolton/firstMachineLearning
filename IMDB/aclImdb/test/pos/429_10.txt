it seems that hack has been described as unrealistic but thats what tv is tv is meant to provide an escape from everyday life and i feel hack does a great job in that regard add to this the slow process of revealing his past and engaginginteresting plots you just cant seem to get enough plus with such great actors as david morse andre braugher and even little mathew borish what more can you ask for so if you are looking for an involving experience and have a liking for underdog characters i suggest giving hack a chance especially now that its finally getting off its feet
