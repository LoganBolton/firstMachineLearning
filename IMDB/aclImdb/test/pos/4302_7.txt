this is a well directed columbo episode with also some good character but the story just doesnt really know to interest enough and doesnt appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a columbo movie this also goes for the killers plot to kill his uncle its quite simple and doesnt seem as well thought out perhaps this movie didnt really took itself serious enough since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light at least when compared to different columbo moviesbr br for instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief mostly coming from the columbo character himself it makes the movie an enjoyable one to watch but it also gives you the feeling they sort of overdid it times also mostly since it doesnt correspond with most other columbo moviesbr br the characters are good and it helps that it features martin landau in a double role its always funny to see how much different he still looked as a young man while for instance a person such as peter falk hardly changed any over the years he only got grayer the movie also features julie newmar among others who is best know for playing catwoman in the 60s batman life action series its funny how she still moves like catwoman in this movie intentional or is this just her way of actingbr br its an enjoyable and good to watch columbo movie but it also gives you the feeling that it all could had been a lot better with a better thought out scriptbr br 710
