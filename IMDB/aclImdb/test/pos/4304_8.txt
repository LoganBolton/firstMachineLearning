this is my favourite columbo martin landau excellent plays twins one of whom may have committed a murder this columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesnt give you any clue to which one did it peter falk is on form as usual in this episode written by steven bochco who also wrote murder by the book my second favourite episode the supporting cast are great especially julie newmar very underrated and jeanette nolan as the house keeper that columbo just keeps on upsetting the surname of martin landaus characters in this is paris that was the surname of leonard nimoys character in mission impossible coincidence or a steven bochco joke
