do you liked dead man dont wear plaid what about top secret and a chorus line well müllers büro is a fantastic melange of all three of them as unlikely it may seem very funny tongue in cheek movie noir hommage with stunning songs and great dancing you have to have a little odd humor for this movie but it is very well worth seeing it ive voted it a nine if the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten thats how good that movie is
