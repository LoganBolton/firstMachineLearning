a unique blend of musical filmnoir and comedy  with a few sex scenes thrown in for good measure the only other film i can think of with a fairly similarly wild and madcap mixture of themes and clichés is the french movie billy ze kick  but that has a more surreal and quirky approachbr br not that this film would not be surreal or quirky the humour is at times quite subtle at other times blatantly in your face  and often crossing the border to offensiveness to give an example in the postcoital chitchat with a prostitute our hero max müller encourages her to reveal who was responsible for a recent murder using the words schiess los literally this phrase means shoot in german and that is exactly what a hidden assassin does in response in other words  this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a punbr br müllers büro is also one of the very rare examples of films with funny sex scenes larrys romance is accompanied by the song ich will mehr i want more  while the song perfectly underpins the action the meaning of its words changes a couple of times hinting at the end at larrys inability of providing any further service the films main love scene between max müller and bettina kant lacks such subtlety  this is jawdropping stuff especially when bettinas singing slowly transgresses into moaning of course all in the rhythm of the musicbr br unmissable unless you are one of the easily offended
