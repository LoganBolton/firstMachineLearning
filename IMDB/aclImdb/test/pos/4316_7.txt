indeed cynthia watros is in this movie as elizabeth talking to desmond though im just wondering how she ended up as a rehab patient where hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight as seen from the previous episodesbr br anyway this last episode is really suspended the ending is not so understandable i think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 comingbr br i just hope the next season will give light to more unclearhanging events that were happenedbr br just cant wait further for season 3
