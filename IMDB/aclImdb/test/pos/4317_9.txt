watching the last 2 episodes i remembered a tv add from my childhood it showed the wild west very dusty and dry and there is a small saloon a man enters the barsaloon he is thirsty as hell lips cracked etc he has just walked through the nevada desert and hasnt drunk water for days he croaks to the bartender gimme a packet of potato chips while he is eating it we can feel how thirstier he is getting we hear a voice in the background saying keep building that thirst build it till you cant hold it any more then blow it away with team the man drinks team a soft drink it feels like a few dozen bags of potato chips the thirst is so intense that i cannot hold it any more season 2 has even more twists and turns then season 1 the ending answers a lot of questions but asks many many more questions hopefully we will know the answer in season 3 but i doubt it because i feel lost has the momentum go a lot further then 3 seasons if the people behind the camera keep up their good workbr br i for one will keep watchingbr br from pakistan with love
