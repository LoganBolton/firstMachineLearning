could contain spoilers read only after seeing last episode season 2 think about it the guys on the north pole center of the earth looking for abnormal magnetic behavior they also said something about did we miss it again so there was another abnormality of course that was when the plain crashed i think this whole island is a setup set up by her daddy she found out about it and is looking for her desmond how else can she know what to look forbr br so basically its an island in a magnetic shield all of it is fake all the signs are there fake beards fake doors fake medicine fake observations stations with fake air shafts that lead to nothing its a project indeed and because of the final scene in the season 2 finale i know it has to do something with desmond his chick and her dad and probably libby shes weird maybe she actually has something to do with the plane crashing ok now im drifting offbr br also in this episode henry gail tells michael to go to some coordinates and hell find rescue their this is probably some sort of door in the magnetic shield once youre gone there is no way backbr br i think its pretty obvious despite of the numerous questions i still have and hope to get answers for in the next season if you think back on what weve learned in season 1 and 2 im sure well get loads of answers in season 3br br cant waitbr br can anyone agree on this theory hope to hear from you
