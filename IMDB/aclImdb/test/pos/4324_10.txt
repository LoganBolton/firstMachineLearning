first of all i just have to say that im a huge lost fan everyone who makes the show i love em its got everything in it reallybr br im glad that they have great people making it for instance jack bender is the greatest director well maybe after jj abrams and of course full credit to damon lindelof  carlton cuse theyre geniusesbr br anyway the season 2 finale is definitely one of the best episodes of lost ever live together die alone focuses on desmond david humes story of getting to the island and henry ian cusick is so great playing that character the makers of the show would have been very stupid if they wouldve let olddes die on usbr br so in lost the plane crash survivors have been there for 65 days 65 days man whileas rousseau has been there for sixteen years and the others have been there for god knows how long referring to jeffrey lieber lindelof  abrams anyway i hope well get the answers we need in season 3 cant wait my vote is nine
