i couldnt agree more than with the comment left by coldshitaction and how this film is a masterpiece i have never seen a film that had my adrenalin flowing that this film did and that mostly happened when bronson comes running out a fire escape with like an m60 and plows down like 20 dude from a gang its genius quite possibly the best action movie ever made no exaggeration either it really could be the best action movie ever made from the start one should know that youre in for something sweet when the police let bronson go and tell him tell him to clean up the slums once again genius and once again bronson is a bad ass paul kersey is just as cool maybe even cooler than john mcclain or the terminator hes just simply a bad ass and what else is great is the fact that hes a nice guy and buys a kid some ice cream and helps out an old couple all before he kills some scum bag genius highly recommended if you hate this movie youre crazy
