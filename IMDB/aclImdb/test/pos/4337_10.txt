death wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be terrible acting implausible scenerios ridiculous death scenes creepy evilfornoreason villains the last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film especially in the scene where the decent hardworking citizens string chains across the street knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them only to be joined by the neighborhood children  in celebration and how can i forget the elderly woman with the broom shes sweeping out the scum and if thats not enough lets not forget how quickly the punks give up after fraker is killed im laughing just thinking about itbr br i also love the death scene of kerseys girlfriend he just walks away after seeing her get blown up its little things like this that make death wish 3 such a bad movie and im not even mentioning the bizarre soundtrackbr br i watched this movie because of martin balsam who i seriously think is one of the finest character actors ever and whos own getting beaten up by the scum scene is hilarious and i walked away with a new favorite movie thank you death wish 3 for making me laugh so hardbr br some other things i forgot to mention 1 the weird sound effect after kersey says cash when buying his used car ha its so evil sounding 2 mandy fraker mandy did the writers run out of tough guy names 3 the fact that the gangs apparently have a lend and lease thug exchange program i need some more guys and that mandy has a working phone line in an abandoned building 4 at the end of the movie after kersey blows up fraker is it just me or does it look like the street gang is about to break into choreography as theyre giving up just watch how in sync they are after the female punk gives the stop signal br br i love this movie nothing cheers me up like death wish 3
