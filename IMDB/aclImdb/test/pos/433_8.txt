as a longtime admirer of the 2001 film moulin rouge and a more recent admirer of jean renoirs filmmaking i knew that id inevitably watch his french cancan sooner or later the movie tells a fictionalized story of the opening of the moulin rouge nightclub the impresario danglard jean gabin tries to turn montmartre laundress nini fran√ßoise arnoul into a cancan star without arousing the wrath of his tempestuous mistress the bellydancing lola maria felix this is just one of several love triangles in french cancantrue to stereotype these french showbiz folk are always falling in lovebr br renoir directs with his typical gentle humor and attention to supporting characters and also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful waltz song prominently featured in the movie gabin perfectly incarnates the aging french playboy hero arnoul is a cute redhead who holds her own in the dance numbers except for a few trick shots where a double is obviously usedbr br french cancan is billed as a musical comedy and while there are lots of musical numbers that take place on the nightclub stage etc only one character casimir ever breaks into song in the middle of conversation the actor who plays him philippe clay is fun to watcha really tall skinny young man who sings dances and does contortionsbr br the movie ends with a long cancan sequence as all the characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together the dancing is much more brightly lit and coherently edited than in moulin rouge in fact if i have one complaint about french cancan its that the whole thing is a little too technicolor even when nini experiences heartbreak or someone sings a melancholy song the lighting is bright and flat no shadows intruding yes the result is a cheerful and warmhearted musical comedy its just that i cant help thinking that things werent ever this colorful and innocent in real life
