lolbr br the mere fact that i start off my review with lol says it all i used to watch this movie all the time as a kid and even then i sensed the silliness of it all the low budget horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then i watched it again yesterday and just couldnt stop laughing its so bad its actually good lol like another reviewer said it doesnt take itself seriously theres no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so the soundtrack is so funny i laugh every time i hear it the climax is just a laugh riot its an all out war zone in new york full of explosions and total chaosso ridiculous you cant help but chuckle at the sight of it br br other hilarious moments br br  the scene with kersey and the cop running side by side like 2 cowboys against the whole wild west was so cheesy it was funnybr br it killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at kersey and he could even drop down on one knee taking eversocareful and slow aim and not get hit lmao of course with him it was one shotone kill with his elephant handgun lolbr br  another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gangwith a rocket launcher loldestroying the whole side of the apartment building with itbr br  its apparent that kersey is all but used to losing loved oneswhen his new girlfriend is quickly disposed of after only a few dates the acting is so bad that you cant blame anyone that could only think that kersey is mad at the destruction of the car lolhe runs down looks at the carnage and just walks awaybr br again so bad its goodbr br  out of  stars
