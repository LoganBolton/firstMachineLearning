most critics seem to have dismissed this film like so many other charles bronson vehicles as just another patchwork of mindless violence and while there is a fair amount of mayhem death wish 3 is not that awful of an effort particularly for fans of the series and its starbr br this time out aging charlies paul kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of new york city the triggerhappy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory where he once again becomes a oneman army in an urban war of good versus evil bronson at least the older version is truly at his bestbr br im not saying death wish 3 is a classic indeed to the discriminating eye it has a plethora of imperfections the characters are generally made of cardboard the violence is over the top a man well into his 60s outruns and outspooks dozens of young punks but in the tradition of the original death wish and later films such as falling down with michael douglas it has a definite crowdpleasing charm who doesnt want to see gangbangers get their due there are also some great cheesy moments and oneliners so common in 1980s films when a tenant of his apartment building sees kersey setting up a booby trap for instance the vigilante lightheartedly says hes thinning the herd a line only bronson can truly make workbr br so you see the key to enjoying death wish 3 is to accept it for what it is it aint spielberg and it aint art so throw the popcorn in the microwave and have fun with it
