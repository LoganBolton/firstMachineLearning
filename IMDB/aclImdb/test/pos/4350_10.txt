little dieter needs to fly is another in the remarkable body of werner herzogs filmic work that is without peer having recently rewatched it on dvd nearly a decade after its initial us release in 1997 it has lost none of its power and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as herzogs own recent grizzly man and errol morriss academy award winning the fog of war like the former it details in its far too brief 74 minutes the life of an interesting american like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see yes we see the violence and the heroism but as the fog of war brought us into the mind of one of last centurys foremost warmongers this film allows us a peek at the life of a grunt who is captured by the enemy tortured and ultimately triumphs except in no way shape nor form is the film as simplistic nor upbeat as my brief description of it nor is little dieter needs to flys titular subject dieter dengler and immigrant german who survived the depredations of the nazis we find out as example that in his hometown wildburg in the black forest his grandfather was the only man not to vote for hitler and suffered brutally for that stand postworld war two germany and his own imprisonment at the hands of the vietcong when his air force jet was shot down over laos on february 1st 1966Â… while the title of the film and the idea of denglers passion for becoming a pilot stirred by the impression allied fighter planes made on him when they razed his town as a child make one believe that dengler is the central subject of the film this is not true the subject is denglers survival or more precisely his human will all human will the details of denglers romantic life are too hollywood and staid an aspect to interest herzog nor is the fact that he won a purple heart medal of honor the dfc and the navy cross that thing which pushed dengler to survive so much and remain such a relatively upbeat man although there are glimpses of darker sides is what is at the center of this film and all of herzogs canon dieter denglers distant barbaric dream of his past is fully ripened herzog country and the use of a madagascan chant oay lahy e during many jungle scenes among other excellent touches in the score show herzog is perhaps along with only martin scorsese the best manipulator of image and music in film long may he merge
