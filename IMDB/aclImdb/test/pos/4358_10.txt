this film stands as one of the most amazing examples of compelling and artful filmmaking ive every seen herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of dieters story as well as his endearing personal character by the end of the film i was left wishing that id had the opportunity to meet dieter before his passingbr br on a technical note the cinematography is intimate and astoundingly beautiful the narrative is intricately woven with great awareness of the subject and his capacity for reliving and reenacting traumatic events few documentary directors have so strong an ability to so thoroughly invest the audience in the character this film is a must see
