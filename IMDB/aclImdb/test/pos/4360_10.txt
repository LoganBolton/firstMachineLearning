wowthis is a touching story first i saw rescue dawni didnt like it and now i have seen the person  dieter dengler  about whom this story is being told by herzogvery impressingdieter is a driven human being who encountered the most opposite emotions in his live on this earthwhat an extraordinary life this person has led his tale about the capture by the patet laovietcong and thus his suffering is horrifying but whats most impressive is his incredible will to survivehow could he find the strenght  in a haunting way  dieter is telling us in full flowing sentences about his terrible ordeal during his captivity he is a great storyteller and herzog does him the justice this brave man deservesbr br in my opinionlittle dieter needs to fly  tells it all   leaving nothing to the imagination  thus making  rescue dawn  a superfluous film the horror doesnt get more real than in the words of dieter dengler himselfhe totally succeeds in painting the picture
