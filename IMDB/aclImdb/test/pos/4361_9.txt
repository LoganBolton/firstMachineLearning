i had the opportunity to see this last evening at a local film festival herzog introduced the film and did an hour long qa afterwardbr br this is a brilliantly done documentary herzog explained afterward that he does not consider his films to be true documentary since facts sometimes camouflage the truth instead he scripts some scenes and adlibs some to introduce a new element that may have been missed if he followed the original story outlinebr br little dieter unlike timothy treadwell is a real person that you fall in love with you cheer for him you feel the anguish that he feels you admire the sense of humor and joy for life that he exhibited here 30 years after he was taken into captivity by the viet cong you are disappointed to hear afterward that dieter passed on not too long agobr br as in most herzog films the imagery is breathtakingly beautiful with a wonderful choice of background music especially a scene of battle taken from archives of the viet nam war but fitting the story line of dieterbr br the core of the film has dieter return to the hellish jungle where he was a pow and he reenacts his journey with some locals harrowing for us to watch i cant imagine what he felt as he was bound againbr br one of the better films to depict and discuss the nightmare of the viet nam war it should serve as a lesson to us all
