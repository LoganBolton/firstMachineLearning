yes this movie was just hilarious and the acting was top notch from the whole cast except shelley winters german accent wasnt that great but then that doesnt matter as she is hardly in the film so if youre a fan of hers beware the two main stars of this film are laurence harvey and julie harris now before this film id only see miss harris in east of eden with james dean and i own an audio tape of the glass menagerie that she did on stage with monty clift and jessica tandy so i wasnt sure how shed be in this role and boy did she impress me how hammy was she i love ham  mr harvey he tickled my fancy i am now a full time laurence harvey fan that hair cackles omg its almost like burt lancasters that crazy messy look it doesnt get better than that he is young and so innocent in this film see it now its definitely in my top ten  i am so glad i found a copy that is all mine unfortunately this movie is out of print and very hard to find on video br br btw watch out for the hospital hotel room scene its one of the best parts or when mr harvey has convinced himself hes ill and hes trying to get his knee to kick you know how doctors do with that little rubber hammer  well he does it himself and his leg kicks and it kicks the table squeals check out the look on his face so innocent i cant describe it but to all those people who say he couldnt act very well and other cockamamie comments see this film and you will see what a great actor he really was youll be bowled over if you arent then im afraid there is nothing i can do for you youre hopeless
