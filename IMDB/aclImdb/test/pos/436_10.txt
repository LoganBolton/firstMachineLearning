i just viewed jean renoirs wonderful film french can can it is a visual delight and a great entertainment the recently produced moulin rouge pales by comparison i didnt quite get all of the praise that the recent movie received now im convinced more than ever that my appraisal was correct after seeing a master film maker like jean renoirs version of the same story he succeeded in getting great performances out of his entire cast and the great french actor jean gabin was in rare form the dance sequence near the end was one of the most exciting one id ever seen it was long but i didnt want it to end this film deserves to receive more recognition than its got
