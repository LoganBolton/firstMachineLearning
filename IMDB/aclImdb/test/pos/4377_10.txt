it might be a stretch saying this as a diehard carlin fan but the material both written and as performed in its bad for ya is some of the best lateera material yet at 70 carlin bounces back from the level of despair and some of the stumbles in the act itself from life is worth losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful or as much as the old f can get and is continuously ceaselessly funny and funny as in reminiscent of what some of us had going on when watching back in town or diseased the first time the material even if sounding at times a tinge of the previously done ie the whole bit on children in school and camp like the children segment in diseased is always fresh and with such a sting of truth to everything that it scalds the mind while here goes tickling the funny bonebr br going from the topic of death how long to wait to scratch off a name from the book six weeks unless if on the computer scheduler the facets of communication looking down from heaven spots of god naturally kids and just troublesome gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have rights make up the bulk of the special centered around the premise that whats bad for you plain and simple is bs total complete bs which as we also learn or if youve really learned it youre like the kid waiting at the street corner for a week following dropped off notquite randomly by the parent holds the country together carlin isnt necessarily angry though even if disdain seems to spout out at most turns even just to observe how horrifying childrens teeth coming in look its skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is not going to be finebr br what it comes down to is this carlin is to dirty witty cautionary standup comedy what yoda is to jedis everywhere which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where its pretty damn hard to get any at the least we get classic gc  outrageous lines and bits from the mans 13th or is it 14th comedy special including as far as an eyebrowraising observation on people who play mozart music during a birth
