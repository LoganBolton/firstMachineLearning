jean renoirs homage to the paris of the late 19th century is beautiful in many ways not only does it appear to have been photographed by toulouselautrec and mucha it portrays the geographic paris the streets accessible only by staircases the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell in an uncompromising picture of show business that is in stark contrast with the picture painted by hollywood there is an obvious comparison to be made with lloyd bacons 42nd street which had been made about 20 years before featuring ruby keeler as a dancing sensation a freshfaced kid from the sticks who had come to new york to get into show business who saves the show when the star failsyoure going out there a kid from the chorus but youve got to come back a star warner baxters julian marsh is a director who suffers for his art and is unappreciated jean gabins danglard keeps running afoul of genital politics but when he talks about the show he is more like knute rockne than like julian marsh hes all about the game exceptfor his pointy thing he has a profitable new venture sewed up until his mistress become jealous of the woman whom she recognizes as his next mistress his prospects rise and fall with every coital journey he takes br br danglard takes mistress 1 lola de castro played by maria felix slumming to a dive where he sees nini fran√ßoise arnoul with her boyfriend and first lover paulo the baker and discovers that she is a spirited dancer he uses his charm and the prospect of money to lure nini to studying dancing so that she may go on the stage the prospect of money and fame charms nini and she become danglards next mistress as well as an apt student of the cancan which danglard has dubbed french cancan to cater to the current anglophile tendency in the dancebr br both 42nd st and french cancan are tributes to show businessto modern entertainmentthat has is own iconography and its own conceit 42nd st is centered around julian marsh a great director of broadway shows which he organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement the male juvenile is a middleaged twit with lumbago replaced by dick powell the pretty tenor with secret wealth to hide danglard on the other hand goes from woman to woman seducing them with the promise of fame hooking them with what must have been a very persuasive endowment one has no doubt that he is heterosexual and quite active postcoital scenes aboundbr br days after seducing nini away from paulo he has discovered esther a piaf type and begun to prepare her for her job of singing the films theme song while he plays it on her fiddle that of course arouses ninis jealousy just as she has aroused the jealousy of lola and of course nini had already forsworn the privilege of being a czarina the whole movie is about how danglards concupiscence has cost him money but how even his troublesome horniness is subordinate to his love for the showhow the audience demands devotionand it is this potent combination of phallic persuasion and tempting fame that makes danglard the hero while asserting that a true lover of the show will never profit as much as the money men at the movies conclusion danglard having outfoxed the creditors and the jealous babes approaches a new attraction watching the incredible and believe me it is incredible performance of the cancan have you ever thought about being on the stage he asks and the curtain descends meanwhile poor julian is sitting of the fire escape of the theatre listening to peggy sawyers new fans disparage his contribution to the shows success i wont even go into 42nd streets central line oh guy it was grand of you to come br br furthermore i wont go into the glimpse one gets of legendary parisian entertainers including a brief vision of piaf nor of the vision of a paris both urban and rural certainly there is a sample of the styles that engendered trenet and aznavour but it is the memoir of an assertive and welcome masculinity something unseen in any hollywood musical with which it might be compared is a pleasant relief from the androgynes of 30s hollywood musicals including my beloved fred astaire not to mention dick powell let alone the barf promulgated by mgm in movies like the repulsive american in paris all those fountains well save our comparison of that turkey to breakfast at tiffanys and its deconstruction of the american male for another daybr br that danglard may have been a hopeful vision in postwar france of a kind of hypermasculine mec that may or may not have ever existed is practically beside the point that he is a mans man neither john wayne nor edward everett horton is perhaps more on target that he is a man who likes the ladies is never in question i for one wouldnt mind living his life at all i wonder if gabin was that lucky br br at the beginning of this comment i wanted to talk about baz luhrman and what sinclair lewis called boloney i never got that far bazs moulin rouge well paris doesnt put that kind of stuff in the seine anymore
