ive seen just about all of the coen brothers films now and i have to say this is one of their better films i wouldnt dare say its better than the big lebowski but it was very good in its own rightbr br i thought the story was very interesting and hilarious at times i loved all the characters especially tim blake nelson delmar and john turturros petebr br there really isnt anything bad i can say about this movie but this movie isnt for everyone it might be safe to say that if you liked the other coen brothers films then youll hopefully like this one too and if you liked what you saw in the trailer i think youll like the film but dont hold me to itbr br anyhow i hope that you liked the film as much as i do thanks for readingbr br chris
