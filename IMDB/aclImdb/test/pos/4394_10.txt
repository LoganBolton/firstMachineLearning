the first time i saw this movie it didnt seem to go anywhere when i watched it a second time though it made a lot more sense give it a chance watch it more than once there are a lot of key elements that shape the story that could be missed the first and even second time watching it the cohen brothers brilliantly weave actual happenings of the early 20th century into this story to make a believable setting and storyline the combination of clooneys leading role blends well with turturro and nelsons supporting acts john goodmans appearance in the movie is hilarious the soundtrack is great as well this movie has become a household favorite for my family 1010 for sure
