this was the best film i saw in the year 2000 the cohen brothers have never let me down before and they certainly didnt this time eitherbr br its one of those rare movies these days  its witty intelligent and vastly entertaining i left the cinema with a warmth in my heart of course theres lot of cohen stuff in there  odd characters and peculiar gadgets welldeveloped plot and magic camerawork but no cohen film is resembling any other cohen film if you overlook the general quality of them of coursebr br the big surprise for me was that clooney is so good but the true master performance in this movie comes from tim blakenelson but the rest of the cast is superb toobr br a film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolve its story round rednecks and old time country music  dripping with wit and intelligence thats a very unlikely combination but its exactly what this picture is
