thank goodness for the coen brothers their success has brought them bigger budgetsbut hasnt rid them of their creativity i had planned on seeing another movie but it was sold out so i went to this one instead by the time it began i had forgotten what movie i was there to see i was surprised in more ways than one this movie is hilarious but they dont make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs the writing is brilliant and delivered with great skill by george clooney after this nobody can say hes just a pretty face and the rest of the cast it can be appreciated on many levels whether you remember the odyssey or not i cant remember the last time i saw a movie that was this clever ive seen others i would describe as beautiful intriguing funny and charming all of which also describe oh brother but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end you can feel that their journey is building up to something but you cant tell what and the coen brothers do not fail us the end is certainly not disappointing its surprising and ties up all the loose ends neatly without wearing the story out
