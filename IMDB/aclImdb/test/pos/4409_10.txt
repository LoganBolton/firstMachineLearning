just to correct something in a previous review here i dont believe this film is only for people who know london its a case of a very specific situation being used to make universal comments jack rosenthal says in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to be about characters who by going though this gruelling knowledge test gain some measure of selfknowledgebr br i think its one of the most perfectlywritten dramas ive seen technically its supremely adept at conveying quite complex details but its also joyous in how it involves you at the start you know no more about this london knowledge test than the main characters but you get scooped up right along with them until its vitally important to you you become tremendously proud of those characters who succeed and you are crushed for those who dont especially one whose downfall without giving anything anyway will make your hands fly to your facebr br also just as a point of fact nigel hawthornes character mr burgess is called the vampire not dracula you dont need to know this im not saying its crucial but its a measure of the drama once youve seen this you will want everyone to and you will evangelise about its every detailbr br i hope you get to see itbr br william
