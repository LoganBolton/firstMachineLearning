one of the most sublime of american masterpieces morrissey opens the film by sexualizing dallesandro with his open mouth snoring on a pillow we wonder is he coming off a heroin high we just see his face then flash his body flash his naked rear i cant think of another film that used this flashblip form of editing so well to create a hypnotic druggy mood an editing method that works wonderfully as both pacing and style after that introduction when dallesandro opens his mouth his accent is jarring  we expect him to be some kind of softspoken androgyne instead hes got the voice of a street thug  morrissey isnt comfortable letting our assumptions go unchecked the lengthy opening is very sexy and playful  its a combination of martial troubles dallesandros fascinating liprubbing kisses and early morning sexual escapades it all kind of flows together if not always smoothly then emotionally realisticallybr br what i got from this was the same as what i got from the 400 blows when i first saw it  this is like a 20something continuation of that story theres a sense of camaraderie between the flesh sellers and the buyers when dallesandro walks the street looking for men to fund his wifes abortion theres the feeling of a secret handshake as boys make deals with each other i never found it boring though nothing happens  nothing happens brilliantly the boys hanging around as they do waiting for tricks the main trick that dallesandro finds is fascinating to watch using greek descriptions and only touching his back a form of aesthetic body worship on the mans part its also dreadfully funny im not talking to an empty bed am i its one of the most revealing scenes in the movie  in any movie i think certainly any movie dealing with sex and sex for sale when dallesandros eyes seem red and swollen we cant tell if its because hes drunk ashamed embarrassed or allbr br the conversations in the film are cutup  they dont matter the film is silent in a few scenes some of the most poignant and beautiful you may ever experience yet when morrissey chooses to include one the way he includes it we sort of piece it together its startling such as one conversation between dallesandro and a newbie hustler  and neither of them ever mentioning the word gay or hustler what follows is a scene where we listen to a pair of transvestites as dallesandro gets serviced  this just after explaining to the newbie getting used to the jobbr br dallesandro is a subject worthy of the attention paid to him both by his clients and morrissey hes less than effective as an actor in the sense of acting as performing but as far as revealing something hes incredible  hes someone we immediately want to feel above yet we go through his experiences with all their complexities and were forced to try and know him hes the kind of blank slate that were drawn to but cant get a hold on and of course hes incredibly striking  forgetting everything else this is partially a testament to the beauty of the male body dallesandros gorgeous torso and permanently erect nipplesbr br the movie has one devastating scene but like everything else you cant really master it  a girl says that shes been raped and her only selfdefense is in saying that had the rapist only asked for sex wooed her he would have gotten a better lay its shattering the movie has feeling for everyone but even better than that its not merely sympathetic it actually attempts to help us understand human beings  and without ever dictating what it is were meant to be understanding it neither looks down on nor glamorizes the people within the film it feels inclusive when we see joes arm around a transvestite when he reads a letter he talks about not getting past grade eight at one point hes utterly charming as he pauses on a wordthen says woteva and continuesbr br you can learn something more profound from the interaction between dallesandro and one of his clients in terms of gaystraight relationships than you can from any case study here we have the young boy who smiles his top lip disappears as he does so when a 30something gym bunny korean war veteran runs his fingers through his hair its a scene that feels very profound this adult man sharing something with a younger version of himself  its not two gay men together or a gay man paying a straight man its something else you cant put your finger on questions of sexuality are beside the point never before has popping a pimple seemed as affectionate after sharing something with each other emotionally though with dallesandro since hes there for money its never apparent why hes there though hes never less than sincere which may be his most disarming quality socan you help me out the man says sure i dont mean my pants 1010
