french cancan is one of my favorite all time movies its an excellent film theres color theres humor theres music its a very good portrait of the so called belle Ã©poque though jean renoirs priorities were always to show a creation a fantasie so the film isnt a historical movie the final sequences in which the girls dance cancan are unforgettable images its a film you shouldnt miss
