ive been a fan of rachaels since the beginning of 30mm on the food network so i have seen her grow over the years the minute i saw her interact with oprah i predicted that this show would happen because i saw how taken oprah is with her and with good reason she comes across as very natural and willing to laugh at herself which is very engaging the set is appealing and there are some fresh ideas i love the lazy susan that the audience sits on theres just enough of a celebrity segment and she stays away from controversy and debate theres enough of that on daytime tv the show is a lighthearted escape and she hasnt moved away from her strength cooking which is very good planning i know there are people who hate her and hate her show thats ok you cant please everybody and somehow i think rachael knows and accepts that so just turn the channel i dont think shed mind
