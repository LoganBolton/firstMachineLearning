then again i like rachael ray she is fun sweet fresh and such a joy to watch i have to alter just about everything she makes as i am a vegetarianbut its great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality after all she is a television personality i think its cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be downtoearth the studio audience appears to be rather small but that just makes for a cozier environment some people have posted that the show sucks i guess it depends on your own interpretation of it and of her if you notice the early episodes of 30 minute meals you will see a completely different personality than in those of the past few years im sure she will find her comfort zone with this show as well good luck rachael
