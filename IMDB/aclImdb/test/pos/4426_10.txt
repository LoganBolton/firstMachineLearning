i just returned from viewing this academy awardnominated doc and i was thoroughly touched and interested in exploring the works of this fellow id never heard of before of course im someone whos captivated with beautiful architecture so i realize others wont carebr br we can only imagine if there had been a couple more visionaries in philadelphia back in the late 60s when kahns plans were a possibility what a wonderful city center there would be if you wonder whether youll see more about the bangladesh building at the beginning of the movie be patient for there it will provide the climax of the film at the end br br his sons personal discoveries in the process of making this film are quite interesting sometimes touching and even funny at times there is one of the most comical antivisionary rants ever captured on camerabr br rounding out the good points of this doc is a touching musical score with some excellent expressive string music and expressiveness is a major point to be found in kahns architecture the points made by other architects about the spiritual nature of matter and how kahns buildings brought that out tie together the overall experience of this movie
