i think the title of the movie describes it well if you are looking for a documentary on louis kahn and his work youll have to look somewhere else although some of that is covered in this filmbr br of course i eat up pretty much anything im fed and i dont know much of the family history revolving around this case so i believed what i was told about nathaniel and his father etcbr br for what this movie was i thought it was pretty good a little slow and grabbing for attention at time i wish that nathaniel would have focused a little more on his fathers work than his family drama although much of the history was interesting louis was a bit of a playerbr br this really is a journey through someones life and i was happy to tag along for the experience a learning experience for me and so it seems for the filmmaker as well br br oh and the footage of some of kahns work is stunning
