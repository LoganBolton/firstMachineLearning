i rented this film because it was a documentary and highly rated its more a study of a bastard son trying to find out who his biological father was than anything about architecturebr br more than anything else the underlying theme of the movie is that we have an eccentric highly praised possibly genius architect who had little regard for anything or anyone outside is professionbr br the tragedy of the film is the broken families he left his babymothers came across more as scorned fans than irresponsible women which can only have negative results on the childrenbr br that said nathaniel the producer of the film and son of louis khan came across as fairly stable and curious if not bitter the people he interviewed were of course more interested in talking about louis khans buildings than his personal problems but i find the mix of themes made the film interestingbr br as for his buildings i found them like abstract art  strange nonpractical and usually only appreciated by socalled critics
