louis khan was one of the most influential architects of our time and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew his sons desire to find out who and more importantly what he was is moving and emotionalbr br this film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about what good design is and the emotional price that is paid for it equally haunting is the sound track if you see the film and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening as a practicing architect of over 30 years my heart ached and rejoiced over the film and its very straight forward albeit emotional honesty and sinceritybr br i had the honor of seeing this film previewed in chicago at the national convention of the american institute of architects the film was introduced by daniel and he was kind enough to do a question and answer session afterward during the entire presentation of the film not a sound not a cough not one distraction took place the entire audience sat mesmerized and the real treat was daniels mother was present during the showing of the filmbr br i will always remember the film and play it over constantly in my mind every time i listen to the soundtrack
