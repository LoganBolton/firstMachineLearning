after visiting the kimbell museum in forthworth texas usa enjoying the art and the architecture also of the adjacent modern art museum and having a delightful conversation with the knowledgeable bookstore lady i purchased this a propos dvd with rather high expectations and was not disappointed in the leastbr br the thematic approach dramatic tension revealing interviews archival footage and stunning architecture are also mixed in a coherent whole to explore the life of the late iconic louis i khanbr br the documentary begins contemplative classical music plays archives are scanned with a reflective shadowy face superimposed blurring letters symbolically referencing a train window passing a backdrop landscape  a journey  focus and out of focus the search eventually culminates to an article in a newspaper nathanial khan reads from the front page of the new york times where his father is simultaneously praised as the best american architect alive and his death announced br br when i first read that obituary i have to admit i was looking for my own name i was his child too his only son i didnt know my father very well he never married my mother and he never lived with us  he died when i was elevenbr br so years later this illegitimate son is still haunted by unclear fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father who seems to be a great professional and public figure but whos secretive personal life escapes him and affects him to the point where he intends to do something about itbr br for years i struggled to be satisfied with the little pieces of my fathers life ive been allowed to see but it wasnt enough i needed to know him i needed to find out who he really was so i set out on a journey to see his buildings and to find whatever there was left of him out there it would take me to the other side of the world looking for the man who left me with so many questionsbr br so the documentary is twofold by a slow systematic discovery of the worldrenown architect we get to know 1 his ideas buildings and the architectural perspective and 2 his families coworkers peoples life he affected and the human perspectivebr br the dvd also offers added insight with a qa with the writerdirector and additional footage that includes such great louis i khan quotes as everything that everybody says is the truth its their truth it might not be factual and a good idea that doesnt happen is no idea at allbr br this movie is a journey of discovery selfdiscovery and discovery of a man a great man yet a human imperfect like all of us we get to know him through the eyes of an admiring and slightly bitter son but with the openness and objectivity to really explore without making easy conclusions and without judgingbr br by key interviews with people who interacted with him in various capacity we slowly put some pieces together until that final interview with this man from bangladesh who really seems to bring it back home with visceral and sensible commentsbr br brilliant architect brilliant documentary
