on march 17 1974 a man is found dead in the toilets at manhattans penn station although wellknown he cannot be identified because he scratched out the personal information in his passport and his body lays unclaimed at the citys morgue for three days it turned out to be the body of what many consider one of the greatest american architects of the twentieth century louis i kahn he died at the age of 73 on his way from india where one of his greatest projects the institute for management in ahmedabad was nearing completionbr br one of the most influential postwar american architects louis kahns architectural legacy includes the house of parliament in dhaka bangladesh the kimbell art museum in forth worth the yale art gallery the salk institute in california and a kind of mobile music boat designed to give concerts in harbours in various cities around the worldbr br while celebrated as an architect very little was known about his private life in addition to his wife esther and their daughter sue ann kahn was survived by two mistresses harriet pattison and anne tyng and their two children all three families lived within miles of each other in suburban philadelphia but their paths never crossed until the funeral his son nathaniel the director of this film was only 11 years old at the time and had only a few memories of his fathers weekly visits at harriet patterson nathaniels mother in philadelphia twentyfive years later he sets out on a journey to confront his father by visiting kahns buildings talking to relatives and colleagues and visiting the places that played a role in louis kahns lifebr br one of the most moving confrontations is when nathaniel asks his mother a landscape architect and mistress of louis kahn why she kept up with playing second fiddle to his wife and never confronted him with this tears shed her eyes but she has no regrets it was worth it its such an intensely sad moment shes obviously shattered treated as an outcast at his funeral which she was forbidden to attend its almost as if she led a substitute life it all feels strangely unreal another interview with edward bacon kahns architectural nemesis who was in charge of the rebuilding of his native philadelpia in the fifties and sixties almost suffers a stroke on the spot when he is reminded of kahns unsavoury ideas about architecture his son nathaniel listens uncomfortably when a very senior bacon literally screams with anger whenever kahns name comes up the final scene is reserved for kahns grandest creation the capitol in dhaka bangladesh it took 23 years to complete a vast and extraordinary building of which the bangladeshi are extremely proud its one of the very few national symbols with stature in this impoverished nation some of the interviews with the locals brought tears in my eyes especially when they find out they are talking to  god forbid  the architects own sonbr br the film is as much a personal journey as it is an account of kahns grand architectural legacy and is above all about the fruition of the film itself and filmmaking in general perhaps louis i kahn faltered as a father but these shortcomings in his personal life make for an all the more interesting portrait in this extraordinary filmbr br camera obscura  910
