nominated for best documentary feature at 2004s academy awards my architect follows filmmaker nathaniel kahn in his quest to find out about his father the legendary architect louis i kahn lou kahn died in 1974 when nate was 11 years old leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other br br my architect follows kahns life through chronologically examining his buildings and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic but selfish and emotionally immature genius as the son which lou never publicly acknowledged during his lifetime nate has delicately placed himself in the story without overpowering the main focus br br when examining the magnificent salk institute in california nate evokes his fathers mythic use of space and light in his buildings making it a peaceful and fascinating experience for viewers the shot of nate rollerblading in salks smoky white central meeting place emphasises the buildings harmony with nature its breathtaking my architect also covers the difficulty louis kahn had with getting his designs accepted several fantastical buildings exist only on paper dismissed by more practical architects and property developers it wasnt until louis kahn went to the east that his visions were enthusiastically embraced in india where he built the indian br br institute of management a former coworker describes him as a guru in bhangladesh where he built the magnificent national assembly building citizens consider him a father of democracy br br watching my architect is a wonderful way to begin or continue learning about architecture and the importance of space but its the irony of lou kahns egotism combined with the transcendence of his work that will inspire you 4 stars
