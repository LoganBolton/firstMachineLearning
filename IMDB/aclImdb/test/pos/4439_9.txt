my architect is a great film about nathaniel kahns search for himself via the legacy of his famous architect father louis kahn dead since 1974 the film builds slowly but perfectly and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomethings identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love loss family and perhaps more importantly our lifes workbr br i had never heard of louis kahn prior to this film although i was vaguely familiar with some of his work through the words both good and bad of louis kahns colleagues you get a very good sense of what nathaniel must have felt as memories are recalled and stories retold sometimes it seemed as though these people were telling nathaniel how to feel about his father as i listened to each recollection my own opinion of this man would range from beautiful to horrible sometimes in the span of a moment so you get a good feel for the rollercoaster that nathaniels emotions must have been ridingbr br the final sequence in bangladesh totally made the film for me the reverence of which the people of bangladesh spoke of louis kahns work tied all the loose ends together nicely for me and hopefully for nathanielbr br i think nathaniel kahn finally found what he was looking for
