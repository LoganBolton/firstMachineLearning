this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre set in rural italy there is a serial killer of children at large add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a madwoman a newspaper reporter ineffectual police a sexy siren a priest a mute girl a mentallyretarded loner etc this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70sbr br unusually for a giallo the victims in this case are young boys which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle the fact that it is kids who are the target of the maniac only serves to make things a little more uncomfortable fulci is pushing the envelope a bit here and he goes even further in a gloriously outrageous unpc scene where a young boy is subjected to the somewhat inappropriate attention of a sexy naked young woman barbara bouchet who he is tasked with delivering a drink to she displays herself openly and actively invites the youngster to ogle her ultimately asking him if he wants to go to bed with her although she is clearly playing around with him its still quite an unusual scene admittedly there are one or two unintentionally funny bits of dialogue here but its very nicely photographed and barbara bouchet exudes high levels of confident sexappeal a standout scene even if you might feel slightly wrong watching itbr br along with barbara bouchet the other standout performance is from florinda bolkan who plays a madwoman who is accused of murdering the children she is not directly responsible but it is left to the viewer to decide whether her black magic may or may not have kicked off the subsequent killing spree irrespective she is hunted down by a lynch mob and chainwhipped while a car radio blasts out rock music this scene is very strong and unpleasant its viciousness indicates the path fulcis career would subsequently gobr br despite the visceral impact of the above murder its maybe a little surprising that the other killings are either bloodless or committed offscreen the only other death scene comparable with the lynchmob is the demise of the killer at the end of the movie although this sequence is kind of silly the plot is convoluted and awash with red herrings although personally i found the identity of the killer a little predictable this weakness is less problematic on subsequent viewings though  like most gialli dont torture a duckling is eminently rewatchablebr br technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill fulci obviously went on to make more graphically violent horror movies but here he shows a talent for slightly more restrained material its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema
