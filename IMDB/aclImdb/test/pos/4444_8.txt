im not a huge fan of lucio fulcis films most of his 80s gore films had their moments but often came across as secondrate dario argento imitations with the exception of the entertaining zombi which was a george romero imitation i didnt really enjoy them i know italian horror often disregards the plot but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards this is why dont torture a duckling surprised me its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery its possibly the best giallo ever made only seriously rivaled by dario argentos entries into the genre and unlike fulcis previous giallo a lizard in a womans skin this never dragsbr br fulcis direction here is quite good he keeps the story moving at a good pace and maintains the viewers interest throughout also the conclusion to the mystery comes as a complete surprise to the audience plus he adds some clever touches such as the upbeat soul music during a particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence overall the violence here is restrained and only used when necessary for the story the acting is good for the most part also full of familiar faces from 70s italian exploitation cinema both thomas milian and barbara bouchet are super cool throughout the only weak link is florinda bolkan whose performance is just far too overthetop its the only laughable aspect of the film dont torture a duckling definitely comes with my recommendation and may be a good introduction to the giallo subgenre as a whole 810
