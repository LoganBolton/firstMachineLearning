dont torture a duckling is one of the coolest italian horror films ive ever seen and ive seen my share to call it a giallo is a little misleading because its not really a typical murder mystery its more of a straight horror moviebr br complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old fulcis twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school italian feel the setting is perfect an old italian village the music is ridiculously perfect the finale is genuine and originalbr br after seeing dont torture a duckling you really have to wonder how fulcis later stuff got so off beat i like all his stuff but he strayed maybe he figured he already did itbecause with this film he hits the bullseyebr br id recommend this film to anyone who thinks that dario argento owns the giallo genre fulci beats him with this one br br 10 out of 10 kids
