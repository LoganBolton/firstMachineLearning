dont torture a duckling is an absolutely stunning giallo diversion for lucio fulci unlike other subgenre heavyweights like mario bava and dario argento fulci takes a decidedly gritty grounded and socially perceptive approach to the giallo narrative in this film there is nothing glamorous about the child murders and borderline pedophilia a gutsy subplot for 1972 going on here and fulci wisely shoots with a staid and lugubrious eye avoiding flash melodrama and directorial histrionics the proceedings are punctuated by gory and instantly mindsearing set pieces that are bolstered even further by fulcis jarring sense of realismÂ— the deeply disturbing witch killing scene in particular with its baldfaced brutality feels like a snuff film composer riz ortolani bookends these carnagefilled scenes with ferocious reverberating string blastsbr br the film is capped by a simultaneously lyrical and violent conclusion wherein theology morality fanaticism and superstition collide it is a deeply effective ending that has the capacity to leave the viewer in a befuddled and disarmed torporbr br fulci couldnt have picked a better location for this film dont torture a duckling was photographed in and around the ancient city of matera italy as matera continues to modernize to this day highlighted by its shift from an agricultural economy to an industrial one it is grappling with its unescosponsored reputation as a receptacle for mysterious paleolithic ghosts the anxieties of the reallife materani are reflected by the characters in the film who wearing their christianity on their sleeves fretfully confront any exotic fringe tradition namely witchcraft that strays outside of the normbr br interestingly enough matera was also used as a standin for jerusalem in mel gibsons the passion of the christ if anything this adds even more potency to fulcis message catholic guilt and grisly slayings are such a resonant combination
