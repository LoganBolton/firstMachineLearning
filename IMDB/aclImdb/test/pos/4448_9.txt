easily lucio fulcis most respected film dont torture a duckling is highly renowned for its edgy subject matter gruesome imagery and strong storyline terror befalls a small italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery was it the creepy hermit the spastic voodoo witch one of the hookers the rich girl someone else contrary to most fans frequent representation on the films violent content  i consider it much more plot driven featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed involving chains and boards in no aspect does this detract from the positive attributes this movie delivers fulci proves himself fully capable of dishing out one hell of a dark and disturbing giallo with childing killing black magic and of course a nice full set o knockers though im particularly more fond of fulcis lizard in a womans skin and new york ripper dont torture a duckling dominates the giallo genre as a moody and compelling murder mystery
