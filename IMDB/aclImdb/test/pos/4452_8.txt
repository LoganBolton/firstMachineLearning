i was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work vivid cinematography and yes  wonderfully explicit gorebr br this film is no exception however compared to his later films the beyond zombie 2 city of the living dead house by the cemetery etc the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic whodunnit amongst the lush hills of italy the scenery is at moments reminiscent of cherished folklore and then immediately contrasted by mud and bloodsoaked terror shrouded by crumbling ruins the gore in this film is not quite as prevalent and seems restrained compared to fulcis later films however splatter and giallo fans will most likely be satiated by a few closeups of oozing wounds and the last 5 minutes of the filmbr br overall a fantastic and mature film from one of our great italian horror directors
