set in and near a poor working class town in the mountains of rural italy its a story of madness the landscape may be quite picturesque but theres madness herein concealed behind the mask of a person who seems outwardly normal this person kills little childrenbr br in style and tone this film resembles dario argentos famous italian giallos those fascinating whodunit horror films except that argentos films are much better looking still the visuals in fulcis dont torture a duckling are competent with some interesting compositions and lighting lightning and thunder on a rainy night enhances suspense in one sequence wherein one of the ducklings is vulnerably alonebr br in one sequence the gore is a bit overdone but this is no slasher film a legitimate theme undergirds the story and that theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms not just the obvious delusions of people who practice voodoo or black magicbr br plenty of red herrings render the puzzle solution difficult if the viewer doesnt assume an agenda on the part of the director dont dismiss someone who might not seem to be a suspect the twist near the end provides good misdirection however in one scene midway through a line of dialogue could have been added to clarify the relationship between two characters one of whom is the murderer the films finale takes place on a beautiful mountaintop with the wind whistling in the background we see flashbacks to clues and get insights into the killers mindsetbr br i dont care for the films widescreen projection but background music is effective and ranges from jarringly creepy at the beginning to lowkey jazz to indigenous italian songs acting is generally average though in a couple of cases its a bit overdonebr br though not as visually brilliant as argentos giallos dont torture a duckling nevertheless is a fine film one that contains a thematic storyline and enough of a whodunit puzzle to interest most viewers who like thrillers and murder mysteries
