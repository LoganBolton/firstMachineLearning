if you are one of those people that think lucio fulci is all about gore guts and zombies you have to watch this and the psychic too for that matter even though the film does include some quite brutal scenes of violence and a unsettling subject matter its not the main thing here this is a truly impressive story and characterdriven murder mystery that might well be the directors masterpiece here he proves that hes a real craftsman creating a memorable disturbing yet strikingly beautiful masterpiece filled with creepy catholic imagery and interesting social commentary it also has a great cast including the gorgeous barbara bouchet as well as tomas millan from beatrice cenci and irene pappas in a small but important role still it is brazilian actress florinda bolkan who also stared in fulcis bizarre lizard in a womans skin who steals the scene in the role of majara giving an excellent performance of a woman driven insane by her superstitions and her vicious murder scene is particularly heartbreaking the second star of the movie is sergio dofizis cinematography who along with the melancholic morriconeesquire score by riz ortolani help bringing the secluded italian village with a dark secret setting to life i have to admit thought that the dummy head hitting the rocks kind of pulled me off but nonetheless this is a definite italian horror classic  a moving sad and ultimately thought provoking work of genius 1010 for me if you liked this one i recommend watching alfred soles alice sweet alice as they are somewhat similar and are both underrated gems
