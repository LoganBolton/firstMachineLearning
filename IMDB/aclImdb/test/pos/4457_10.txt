the name lucio fulci congers up images of graphic death and mutilation in the minds of may fans thanks to movies like zombi 2 city of the living dead the beyond and the new york ripper fulci has a reputation for being one of the goriest directors in history and although many of his later movies certainly justify his reputation until the release of zombi 2 in 1979 fulcis films did not contain anywhere near the amount of blood and guts hes know for in fact they were for the most part gore free instead relying on more traditional shocks and disturbing imagery to work dont torture a duckling hardly contains any gore yet ranks as his bestbr br dont torture a duckling is set in a small sicilian town where superstition rules instead of logic the townsfolk are very distrustful of outsiders as well as anyone different often shunning them after a series of child murders though many people descend upon the town including andrea martelli thomas milan who tries to uncover the truth about the murders while they continue to happenbr br this is a remarkable film its very well made with an excellent cast filled with many favorites of italian exploitation cinema it also contains a solid score as well as many creative camera movement courtesy or lucio fulci but the real draw of dont torture a duckling is the disturbing nature of the movie little kids around twelve years old are shown mocking retarded people visiting prostitutes and being propositioned sex by an older woman it also contains some very biting commentary on the middle class and the catholic church it is for reasons like this that dont torture a duckling was blacklisted throughout europe when it was first released and never was shown in the united states still dont torture a duckling stands as a monumental achievement in giallo cinema as well as lucio fulcis best work i really cant recommend this one enough check it out
