if you like whodunits you will like this film considered the best italian detective story giallo fulci has donebr br its not mickey spillane for sure there are scenes designed to disturb anyonebr br many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12yearold boy she was joking but she was naked nonetheless and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones she also tries to tempt the local priestbr br young boys are turning up missing and there are several interesting suspects you have to watch carefully to discover the killer can you dont jump on the first guy its way too early and he is too obviousbr br anyone familiar with fulci will be able to guess the killer who died a violent death at the end what crazy reasoning he had
