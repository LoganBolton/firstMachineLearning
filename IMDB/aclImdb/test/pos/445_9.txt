this film works on a lot of different levels its a profile of one very cool couple a social commentary on aging and nursing homes a love story a musical ive seen uncle frank a few times and every time i watch it im not sure who to go call firstmy parents my wife a friend ive lost touch with   but it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your lifeand want to reaffirm the ones that continue expect a lot of laughs and probably some tears if any of the vibrant characters here strike a chord im pretty sure they will
