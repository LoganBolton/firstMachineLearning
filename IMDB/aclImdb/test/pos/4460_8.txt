dont torture a duckling lucio fulci  italy 1972br br definitely a prime candidate for the most insane movie title ever conceived and thats quite an achievement in gialloland originally the film was titled even more absurdly dont torture donald duck literally translated from its italian title a small donald duck figure features briefly as a toy but hardly enough to render a title like this but apparently it was changed in fear of legal ramifications by disney i railed quite a bit against fulcis earlier lizard in a womans skin 1971 but here all the right ingredients are present a surprisingly effective mystery a good cast and imaginatively shot against an unusual rural setting everything just clicks i think its justly hailed as one of the directors most accomplished achievementsbr br the story is set against the backdrop of a small mountainside town in sicily where someone is killing young teenage boys among the suspects the most obvious one is a young woman maciara florinda balkan a selfproclaimed witch who is seen suspiciously unearthing the skeleton of a baby and sticking pins into way effigies guiseppe the village idiot is under suspicion as well since he made a feeble attempt to profit from the disappearance of one of the boys and walked right into their trap by the time a quickwitted newshound tomas milian arrives from milan to cover the murders he immediately begins to question the authorities assumptions when he meets two other potential suspects don alberto the local priest marc porel with a highminded attitude and patrizia barbara bouchet a bored young woman from the city with a troubled past of drug offense who also fancies having sexual relations with the young boys in town talk about your prime red herringbr br fulci nicely contrasts modernity and tradition with the newly constructed elevated highway meandering through the sicilian hills past old towns where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition one could debate about the films political stance as the north versus the south or as commentary on smalltown virtues  societys conventions in general  that are all too often dangerously close to tipping over into moral disintegration chaos and  ultimately  selfjustice by the populace the film has often been lambasted because of its anticatholic tone but its hardly an important element here except for obvious plotrelated reasons which would be giving away too much its actually rather tame compared to a film like joÃ«l serias dont deliver us from evil 1971 probably the films rather unflattering portrayal of smalltown sicilian values when another boy is killed the local populace are depicted as a retarded lynchmob might be cause for some offense in sicily but  considering sicilys problematic relation with the rest of italy  hardly problematic for other italians i would think the film vanquished into obscurity far too quickly to have much impact anywaybr br when talking fulci the amount of gore is usually a prime subject for discussion although eyesgouging scenes are lacking the film does contain two very graphic scenes in the grossout finale the killer falls of a cliff smashing his face along the rocks on the way down with gruesome results albeit not very realistic and the chainwhipping sequence with florinda balkan in the graveyard shows fulcis penchant for sadistic violence and typically hes not holding back at graphically showing what most filmmakers would merely hint at surely one of the most horrifying scenes in fulcis repertoire br br above all this is a taut wellwritten effective little mystery nicely lensed by fulci with an impressive cast of genreregulars like barbara bouchet marc porel not very convincing as a priest tomas milian and florinda balkan mouthfoamingly crazy as the towns witchbr br camera obscura  810
