dont torture a duckling is one of fulcis earlier and honestly in terms of storyline better films  and although not the typical bloodbath that fulci is known for  this is still a very unique and enjoyable filmbr br the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations  either as suspects or those helping the investigation or in some cases both  include the towns police force a smalltime reporter a beautiful and rich exdrug addict a young priest and his mother an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protégé a mentally handicapped townsman and a deafmute little girl all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns until the actual killer is revealedbr br dont torture a duckling is neither a classical giallo or a typical fulci gore film although it does contain elements of both  it is more of an oldfashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulcis later works this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end recommended for giallomurdermystery fans or anyone looking to check out some of fulcis nonsplatter films  but dont despair dont torture still has more than its fair share of violence and sleaze some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of disconcerting  but if that type of material doesnt bother you then definitely give this one a look 8510
