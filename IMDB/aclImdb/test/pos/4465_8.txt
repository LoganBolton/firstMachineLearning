sporting a title seemingly more suitable for a looney tunes featurette than a grisly giallo dont torture a duckling 1972 is nonetheless a grade a thriller from horror maestro lucio fulci in this one someone has been strangling the preteen boys in a rural southern italian village and typical for these gialli there are many suspects theres barbara bouchet patrizia looking more scrumptiolicious than youve ever seen her a rich girl hiding out after a drug scandal florinda bolkan martiara the local epileptic voodoo woman her witchcraftpracticing beau giuseppe the local idiot the sweetfaced priest his dour mother and on and on the film features some unusually violent set pieces including a chain whipping of one of the main characters in a graveyard one of the most realistically bloody sequences that ive ever seen and a nifty dukeout when the killer is ultimately revealed the films bursts of violence compensate for the fact that there are no real scares or suspense to speak of still this giallo fascinates with its unusual rural backdrop unsettling child murders oddball characters and freaky score by riz ortolani the film has been beautifully photographed in what i presume to be monte santangelo near the adriatic in southern italy at least that towns police force is thanked in the closing credits and while subtitling wouldve made this finelooking dvd work even better the american slang doesnt convince in this rural italian setting anchor bay is to be thanked for another job well done ohthat title does eventually make perfect sense too
