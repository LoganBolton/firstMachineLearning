as far as i know ive seen most of lucio fulcis films with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on dvd now and i would have to say this was his best prezombie offering in fact it beats out his later movies handsdown this is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small italian town out in the middle of nowhere where young boys are dying mysteriously its no mystery how they died i guess its more whos doing it is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch is it a young woman that lives in a fancy modern house on the outskirts of town who used to do a lot of drugs is it the village idiot who gets nabbed early on because of being in the wrong place at the wrong time youll only know if you watch and watch you should for this is a topnotch mystery thriller or should i say a giallo ive seen this before but its been a long time and upon a second viewing it was still as powerful as the first time for those of you that only know lucio fulci for his zombie flicks well open your minds to this because its well worth seeing and while the monsters in this are human theyre as nasty as anything dredged up in his later films 9 out of 10 stars see it please
