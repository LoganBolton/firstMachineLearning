this is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it that would be fine if the film were a travelogue but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry that is not good enough the theme of interspecies respect and cooperation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of interspecies love but its approach is stereotypical indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species as with many films one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter alas we probably will never know
