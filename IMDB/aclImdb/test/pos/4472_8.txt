i love this movie though i dont like how they picture egyptians being an egyptian citizen myself thats why it earns an eight out of 10br br the relationship between augustin and the leopard is awkward and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopardbr br a very touching scene when the leopard dies watch augustins reaction br br all in all i find it enjoyable and im looking forward to reading the short story by balzac
