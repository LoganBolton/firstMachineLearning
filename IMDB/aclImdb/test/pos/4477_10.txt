this movie is beautiful in all ways it is visually stunning and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper the acting is superb it is subtle passionate and intense ben daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal and mixing that wild nature with a mans overbearing passion and honor there is not one flaw not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere it is completely perfect but only if you understand what youre going to experience it isnt a movie for anyone who wants normality
