i remember reading the original balzac story in college frenchbr br i remember ken nordine of wgntv in chicago reading it as one of his late night showsbr br always loved the story but never believe they could or would make a movie of it to my surprise they did and did it very wellbr br few of any balzac stories lend themselves to dramatization which is unfortunate and cat lover that i am i was always hoping it would be filmed without a lot of hollywood sexing up this is as close to perfect conversion as could be donebr br the theater of the mind is always better than what the eye can see but this is as close as i think it can come to letting the imagination of reading meet the reality of seeing
