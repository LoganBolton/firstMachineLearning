i will never forget the utterly absorbing effect this show had on me when i saw it for the first time from the moment that the major is startled by the clown to his anguished attempts to make sense of the situation   were alive were people we must have memories inexact quote but close to his clever attempt to improvise a means of escape this is riveting dramabr br little touches stay with the viewer for a long time after watching it the moment when the lovely ballerina dances for everyone to the off key screeching bagpipes of the scottish musician the tramps wistful remark  a miss is as good as a mile the majors shaken conclusion that they must be in hellbr br this is a brilliant episode beautifully written and acted the breathtaking beauty of susan harrison adds to the memorability of the strange touching story
