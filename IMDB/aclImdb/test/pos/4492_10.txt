while researching susan harrison the ballerina in reference to a bonanza episode i was reminded of this gembr br this episode is the inspiration for dylans all along the watch tower hendrixs cover is probably as well know and is one of his best which is one of his bestbr br thus this episode is responsible for several bests  not bad for approximately 22 minutes of televisionbr br but this is the twilight zone further comment of the series is unnecessarybr br 5 characters is typical serling intense dramatic barreling toward an end that is as inevitable in hindsight as it is surprising the first time you see itbr br this episode is spoiled in one sentence and is too good to spoil for any who have not seen itbr br but you will feel ambushed and you will never listen to hendrix with the same ears again
