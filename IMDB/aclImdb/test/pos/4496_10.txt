ok i havent read the book and maybe the book was betterwho knows but i loved the movie it was entertaining not a bit boring enjoyable and most of all heart wrenching the friendship between the two kids was so pure and innocent these kids acted so well especially the son of the servant oh my god thats like the form of god on the face of earth arghhhh he steals our heart so easily spoilers the other friend the rich guy is a kid and his confusion and frustration can be understood but i did get angry when he abandoned and ignored his friend in the time when he needed consoling anyways he was just a kid and a bit stubborn to i wish the movie would also have shown the older version of the poor kid arghh it pains to just think of the ending this movie is sad i felt terribly sad during the ending tears dropped down my eyes yes the background scores are fantastic the scenes are wow the kite scenes are fascinating and well it gets a bit of an adventure in the middle wonderfully acted and superbly cast the kids acted so well great direction dont know why this movie failed to wooo the critics but it sure did woo me 1010 mustsee
