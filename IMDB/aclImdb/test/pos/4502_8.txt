i have no read the novel on which the kite runner is based my wife and daughter who did thought the movie fell a long way short of the book and im prepared to take their word for it but on its own the movie is good  not great but good how accurately does it portray the havoc created by the soviet invasion of afghanistan how convincingly does it show the intolerant taliban regime that followed id rate it c on the first and b on the second the human story the afghanamerican who returned to the country to rescue the son of his childhood playmate is well done but it is on this count particularly that im told the book was far more convincing than the movie the most exciting part of the film however  the kite contests in kabul and later a minicontest in california  cannot have been equaled by the book id wager money on that
