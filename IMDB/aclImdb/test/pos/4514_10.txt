i just saw it at an advance screening i havent read the book but heard many good things about itbr br the movie was absolutely fantastic very moving with a roller coaster of emotions you totally connect with the characters shaun toub was great it was a complete departure from his usual roles and his acting for those who understand persiandari was incrediblebr br one thing to notes it that khaled hosseini actually loved the film which is unusual for book adaptation movies even after seeing the movie several times he was sobbingbr br also the animation from the intro was exquisite with names displayed as if it were persian calligraphy very unique at times the translation was not clearly conveying the message efficiently but all in all this was a great movie
