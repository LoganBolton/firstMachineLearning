the kite runner was beautiful poignant and very moving i particularly loved the two child actors in the film as well as the actor portraying the father it really made me want to go back and read the book againbr br the music was a wonderful part of the fabric of the movie if there is a soundtrack coming out for the film i will buy it to accompany my second reading of the book it is also a visually stunning film the cinematography was gorgeous and really added to experiencebr br the brazilian word saudades is very descriptive of how i felt at the end of the filmit is a deep feeling of longing for someone or someplace which is very sweet but also tinged with an inescapable sadness definition provided years ago by antonio carlos jobimbr br saw it at a small cinema here for an advance screening i would love to see it again on a really large screen with a tricked out sound systembr br cant wait for the formal release i will definitely recommend the film to friends
