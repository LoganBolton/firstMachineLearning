i just watched this film at an advanced screening i had not read the book and knew nothing of the story but went because the book was voted book of the year by two local colleges so i cannot compare the book with the movie as others have donebr br in short i thought this was an incredibly moving story the acting was believable and the insight into afghan culture and political history was both interesting and shocking my oldest friend is iranianamerican and so i felt an affinity for certain middle eastern values and traditions that were portrayed in the movie as they reminded me of the times i spent with his familybr br the themes of friendship family human values and courage under fire are universal and are well developed in the film i wont list the plot details as these can be obtained elsewhere but based on the films technical aspects the acting and above all its heartwrenching story i would definitely recommend this movie
