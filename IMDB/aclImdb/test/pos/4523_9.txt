this is my fourth review of a charlie chan movie in series chronological order on these consecutive days this is also my first comment of one ive seen previously though its been about 24 years since then so i didnt remember much of it in this one the honolulu detective is investigating an espionage ring that was initially tracked by a former scotland yard acquaintance who has turned up missing in the big applethis is the best of the chan entries ive seen so far in current memory with every clue being connected though of course if i look at them at closer examination there could still be some holes though i cant think of any right now and no 2 son jimmy victor sen yung is somewhat of a help when he first identifies the poison that results in some murders early on though of course he blunders a little later among the returning supporting cast from the last chan filmcharlie chan at the wax museumare blonde joan valerie as june preston and stanley blystone whos brother john g helmed a lost chan one called charlie chans chance as a fingerprint expert nice intrigue especially with an exciting climax aboard a bomber plane oh and watch for a certain stooge at a police line up
