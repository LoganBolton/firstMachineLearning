murder over new york is one of the better chan mysteries and ive just seen this for the first timebr br in this one charlie chan is visiting new york to attend a police convention at the same time people who are involved with aircraft plants are being murdered and he decides to help with the investigation along with his number 2 son these murders turn out to be the results of sabotage at the aircraft plants and chan helps to identify the murdererbr br charlie chan is played well by sidney toler and the rest of the cast includes sen yung as his number 2 son and marjorie weaverbr br i rather liked this mystery and is worth having if you like this sort of thingbr br rating 3 and a half stars out of 5
