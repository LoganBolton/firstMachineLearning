the 13th and last rko falcon film starts with the mutual injunction by tom conway as tom lawrence alias the falcon and ed brophy as goldie of no dames whilst they prepare to go on vacation while youre still wondering what theyre going on vacation from as they hadnt had a job since the beginning of the 1st film in 1941 with sanders as gay though and jenkins as goldie they bump into a woman and get dragged into a seedy industrial espionage caperbr br they promise to help her when her uncle is murdered by taking an envelope containing the details of a formula to make substitute industrial diamonds to his business colleague in miami suspect everyone here except the cops here who are after lawrence  and goldie for the murder to console himself goldie keeps paraphrasing travel brochures on the coldest day you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice cosy electric chair for one some nice languid atmospheric nightclub scenes rub shoulders with some especially bad behaviour from the baddies favourite bit the dignified game of hide and seekhunt the thimble the imperturbable and suave lawrence has with the baddies on the sleeper train least favourite bit the most embarrassing scene in the entire series in the alligator wrestling hut  definitely thrown in for the kidsbr br all in all not the best in the series but yet another entertaining outing with an overall satisfying plot and many episodes even in this that make me wish they could have gone on for just a few more years as columbia did with boston blackie although rko were churning these out faster absolutely no sex not much violence in fact none at all by todays high standards and positively no message all make this type of film anathema to serious people who can only regard movies as an art form that must depend on these three pillarsbr br three diet falcons were made later with john calvert in the title role i dont mind them but could never bring myself to count them into the main series which tom conway had made his own by this time sad also that it was all downhill after this for conway who moved into tv voice overs and even played norman conquest in park plaza 605 rather well in 1953 he also developed serious eye and alcohol problems  i dont know if they were linked  wound up poverty stricken and after a spell in hospital in 1967 was found dead in his girlfriends bed for us folk that want to at least we still have his 10 entertaining falcons plus a number of other worthy even classic rko movies from 1942 to 1946 with which to remember him by
