this movie probably isnt the funniest ive ever seen and it certainly doesnt have much redeeming value in fact it is really nothing more than a collection of vignettes tied together by a loose plot however this makeitupasigoalong attitude actually works to the films advantage tommy boy succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that the snl skits farley and spade starred in succeeded their welltimed extemporaneous silliness and mayhem makes them humorous despite their immaturity
