a kinda remake of planes trains and automobiles in a lot of waysi thinki think its such a bad and sad coincidence that both john candy and chris farley left us when they still had a lot of stuff to dogod bless them bothi think the plots of 2 movies are really similarroad trips of two different poles of charactersand a lot of unlucky consequences because of the chubbies this movie can not be planes trains and automobiles but its a really entertaining movie especially with the great performance of chris farley the missing part in this movie is the touchy stuff if we compare it with candymartin classicbut i think its better this way
