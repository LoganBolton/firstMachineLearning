caught this recently after noticing james earl jones name on the title it was better than i expected of course its pretty old  made during the earlymid 70s but it actually is a decent drama it runs a quick 90min or so and showcases good performances from james earl jones and diahann caroll the plot is conventional in general but told through the perspective of a single black woman on welfare who has 6 children and trying to deal with all the problems that persist this makes for an interesting viewalso in the fact that the script wasnt too sentimental or overdramatized  its almost like looking at a slice of the past all the 70s styles are out in abundance the ending is kind of kooky thoughprobably wouldve done better without the theatrics
