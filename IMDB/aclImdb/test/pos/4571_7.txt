if this film is examined closely its a bit sad it is detailed enough to touch upon very real problems children who grow up in poor dysfunctional environments yet it retains its comedic value with spirited performances by diahann carroll and james earl jones the sadness lies in the struggles and dysfunction of the mother carroll who cannot truly help her children not because she doesnt want to or try but because its obvious she doesnt know how remember this is a comedy but if youve never seen this or if you have watch this film and see the humanity in the characters good film
