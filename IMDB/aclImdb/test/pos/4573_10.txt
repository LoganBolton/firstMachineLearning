idiocracy felt like mike judge took my thoughts on society and put them into film in fact the movie is a social commentary almost feels like a documentary at times luke wilson did a good job playing a boring average joe like in most of his moviesbr br of course idiocracy was an extreme of the current state of society but thats what makes most comedies funny a extreme of any situation fiction isnt that much different then realitybr br with kids praising materialist hiphop culture and taking pride in being ignorant when people feel useless in life they breed giving them a purpose in the world and it seems only the worse people breed the most i can understand how others dont like it it doesnt help most of the jokes were 2nd grade bathroom humor not much different than a kevin smith filmbr br idiocracy throws away logic reason any intelligence for good reasonbr br mike judges comeback was a knockout
