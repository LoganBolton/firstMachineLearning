i like money i stumbled on this brilliant film in a local video store last week wasnt sure what to expect brought it home set up the player and then my journey in to stupidity began the first viewing i did a lot of chuckling no laughing out loud really it wasnt until the second viewing the movie really started to take a hold on me and the humor was that much funnier it reminded me of austin powers first viewing it was all right then the real fun began telling people about it just talking about each scene and the set up im making all my friends watch this movie everyone i know this movie may very well be one of the most accurate future movies ever made this movie is more then just 84 minutes of entertainment its a warning to the future of our civilization mike judge the fantastic mind who brought us office space has brought us a vision of life in the automated future luke wilsons dead pan humor as average joe enhanced the movie that much more watch this movie then once youre done read more write more think more for the futures sake if not for your own
