i stumbled upon this movie by accident i mean how else could i find out it wasnt hyped at all by the studios nor did i even hear about its release from my normally plugged in friends after throwing my money away on so many bad movies this year i wish i couldve seen this one in theaters as opposed to dvd mike judge is the master of disguising deliciously intelligent humor in a low brow package just watch king of the hill for a whileits ostensibly redneck humor but its a very subtle jab at rednecks while being very sympathetic at the same time i read the tagline for this film and immediately i ordered it off the internet i really dont understand where these negative reviews are coming from except maybe from carls jr this movie is not only hilarious but its balanced as well moments of levity are interspersed between hilarious sight gags and jabs at our current superstarcorporate culture sure there is some fart humor but its only there to laugh at derisively the premise is only semiplausible but since when did that even matter i dont see people heaping scorn upon futurama because the premise is very similar just watch this movie if you dont laugh then something is really wrong with you maybe your dad works for gatorade or something and he was really offended by the movie maybe youre an idiot probably the latter
