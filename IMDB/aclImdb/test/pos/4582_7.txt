yes i know that this movie is meant as a comedy and the humor is over the top but the theme about people getting less intelligent in future time might not be so far fetched i cannot say that it will happenbut if we dont take proper care of our educational system than this could be a possibility i have noticed that some schools arent teaching facts anymore like historygeographybasic stuff the focus is more on learning practical abilities the theory behind most subjects may be boring but is essential in understanding how things work in the movie there is this ridiculous example of people growing crops with gatorade in stead of water wellwe can laugh about it but if you never been taught that water contains minerals necessary for plants to grow so how would you know to me this is a scary notion so now you understand why this subject isnt funny anymore it could be that mike judge is making fun but at the same time is warning people for a real disaster if education doesnt improve fast am i taking this movie too seriously yes of course to each his own fun i loved mike judges work beavis and butthead and office space in these he was able to be critical and funny at the same time in idiocracy i missed this most of the events are too absurd and as i said earlier very scary i do think if you are in the mood you will like this movie
