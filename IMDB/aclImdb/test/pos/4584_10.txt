i had never heard of this film when a good friend recommended it i trust this friends taste so i purchased the dvd my wife and i sat down to watch it with no knowledge of what it was about i thought it was the funniest film i have seen in a long time mainly because i saw the truth in the satire i strongly recommend this film to all my friendsbr br this is not a film for everyone some people will see the crass humor and aura of stupidity and find idiocracy to be one of the stupidest movies they have seen what these people dont seem to understand is that the crass humor is there not to amuse the audience but to show what appeals to the morons in the futurebr br luke wilson is well cast as an average joe he is mainly there to be a foible for the biting commentary about society that is spread throughout this film many of the funnier bits are in the background so it is easily worth seeing several times what makes the movie even funnier and more scary is that i see elements of it in every day life in people i meet or on the media then i go back and rewatch idiocracy and realize how good it isbr br the few people who have seen and enjoyed this film are able to be part of an elite club ill see an advertisement for some product with some breakthrough new ingredient and turn to my wife and say its got electrolytes she knows exactly what i am saying
