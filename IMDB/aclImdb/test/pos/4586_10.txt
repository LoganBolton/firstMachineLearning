this movie is brilliantbr br i dont remember this movie even being in theaters so thinking it was a straight to dvd i have fairly low expectations even though i am a big fan of mike judge it has some of the same kind of comic future satire as brazil and demolition man but taken to the next levelbr br then i saw the cast luke wilson maya rudolph and dax shepard who were all brilliant in their rolesbr br needless to say this movie won me over in the first 5 minutes where it shows aboveaverage people having fewer children and the poorest stupidest trashiest people having lots of ignorant children and how this is leading to a kind of reverse evolution it takes that concept and then shows where we are headed with this pollution of the gene poolbr br sadly i dont think it will take the 500 years as depicted but probably only about 50 i already see the shocking rise of mild retardation in the general populace media and culture people who like classical music and art are ridiculed instead of respected the lowest common denominator seems to rule especially in hollywood and on tv eg jackass the movie and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate yourself for moneybr br all of the politicalsocial satire aside this movie is also just laugh out loud funny and i dont say that lightly few movies make me actually lol but this one didbr br a lot of the best jokes are wordsight gags in the background so you really have to pay attention to get some of them i even had to pause and zoom in for a few of them like when joe got his government id and for hair it said yes and for eyes it also said yes also the prison has engraved on the front house for particular individuals since the cops in the movie much like real life cops call everyone individuals instead of people etc again this was on the screen for just a momentthis is one of those movies you can watch again and again and dissect it to get through the layers of funnybr br also i normally watch movies with the subtitles on and that clued me in to some jokes that might pass by your ears in the dialog mix for instance the police constantly talk about people excaping instead of escaping and there are many other mispronunciations that just cracked me up but again i might not have picked up on them just by the dialog mixed with musicsound effects it is very subtle but still hilariousbr br additionally the special effects were really good for a scifisocial satirebr br i could go on and on but overall i think this is one of those movies that if you dont think its funny its probably making fun of you i plan on recommending this to many many people
