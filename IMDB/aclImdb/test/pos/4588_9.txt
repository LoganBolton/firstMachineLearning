mike judges idiocracy is an interesting film and one that his fans will undoubtedly track down and seebr br before i start the review i would preface it by saying that if you get a chance to see it definitely do as it is worth watching and isnt the easiest film in the world to track downbr br lets start with the premise  luke wilson is private joe bauers an army librarian who is deemed to have absolutely no outstanding attributes or glaring flaws making him totally average in every way this along with the fact that he has no living relatives makes him a standout candidate for an experimental cryogenics procedure also frozen with joe is a prostitute named rita who was pimped to the project by upgrayedd her abusive pimp unfortunately a few days after they are frozen the top secret project is abandoned and they are forgotten aboutbr br they wake up in 2505 and find that with the dumbing down of society following the trends of recent times everyone on earth is only slightly more intelligent than a chimp the way that everyman joe bauers talks is seen as being faggy much as someone speaking like shakespeare would ridiculed now and a former professional wrestler is the president of the united states actually this one probably isnt that outrageous really the best show on tv is called ow my balls which admittedly sounds pretty good and not only is everything spelled wrong but signs seem to have run out of space for the wording leaving them to be bunched up at the endbr br its a funny premise for film but this is the problem  aside from the initial premise not that much in the movie is truly funny what i mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind from having read the premise of the film are probably about as funny as the film itself obviously its not terrible but it probably could have been funnierbr br there are some winners in the script such as starbucks now offering happy endings and people placing their blind faith in the universally misunderstood electrolytes but they are just too few and far between so unless you are going to laugh hysterically every time one of the idiots of the future slurs out a slackjawed profanity laden sentence with little to no logic andor intelligence then the laughs might be pretty well spacedbr br its unfair for everyone to be comparing it to office space because its a very different film but as a film regardless of what came before it idiocracy is a funny concept that will probably have you laughing a lot more in the opening 1520 minutes than in the rest of the filmbr br i give it 5 out of 10 because it is enjoyable but doesnt do enough to raise it above middle of the road
