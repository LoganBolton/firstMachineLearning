this movie is the stupid comedy of the year and quite possibly the best thing from mike judge since office space if you are a mike judge fan or enjoy shows like futurama then you are doing yourself a grave disservice by skipping over this little known limited release although the dvd touts very few bonus features this film is certainly funny enough to make up for its perceived lack of valuebr br this movie is about an army grunt by the name of joe bowers played by luke wilson who is part of a top secret army experiment designed to preserve army personnel in peace time so that they can be thawed in war time to fight for our country however things take an interesting turn as the general in charge of the operation is busted in a prostitution ring and the experiment is all but forgotten bowers and his sidekick rita played by maya rudolph both find themselves awake in the year 2505 where through the course of natural selection the population of america has grown increasingly stupid now joe and rita have to find their way to a time machine to get back to the year 2005 with the help of frito played by dax shepardbr br what i really enjoyed about this movie was mike judges comedic satire on the course of us history over the last 50 years and how mankind progresses over the subsequent 500 years this is most evidenced by the advertising in the movie which has become a staple of the american culture with shows like south park in the mainstream media its easy to see how conclusions could be drawn that in the future profanity has become a marketing tool this is portrayed in the film humorously with subtle things such as fuddruckers changing their name to buttfers and a billboard which displays the advertisement if you dont smoke tarryltons f you i also cannot stop laughing at carls jrs role in this future with their slogan f you im eating and their automated kiosks selfadvertising their extra biga tacos with more molecules this film contained everything i go to the movies for excellent sharp witty comedy as well as an engrossing plot make this dvd one for the ages be warned however if you are not a fan of mike judge did not care for beavis and butthead or do not have a sense of humor then this movie probably isnt a good match for you otherwise i would say this is probably the funniest movie to come out of 2506 i mean 2006
