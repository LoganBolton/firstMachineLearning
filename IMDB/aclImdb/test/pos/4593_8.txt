first let me say that although i generally appreciate mike judges work ive been merely tepid in my response to office space king of the hill and beavis and butthead i generally prefer more intelligent comedy and therein lies the irony with respect to idiocracybr br in a future world where the embodiment of beavis and buttheads views basest instincts and intellectual capacities are the framework of a chaotic messy semimad max semiblade runner society where every trailertrash guys fantasy becomes reality a man with even average intelligence is threatening and accused of talking gay and the mob mentality takes over and this world is also incredibly funnybr br yes its obvious that carls jr starbucks costco and fuddruckers executives will be horrified at the twisted values given their products in the year 2505br br there were some missed opportunities with the film and the relationship between the time travelers  the other being an average intelligence woman whos worried about her boyfriends pimps retribution  could have been stronger the chemistry is there and there dont seem to be too many women in the futurebr br i did leave with a grin on my face but the experience is a bit better than the memories thus its my kind of popcorn film and it will be fun to revisit on video recommended fyi stay through the credits for an extra scene
