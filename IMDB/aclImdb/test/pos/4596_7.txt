a lot of things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically funny than actually funny though it does have some laughoutloud moments but a lot of that is because it seems to have been cut by the studio to better appeal to exactly the idiots its mocking many situations arent allowed to develop theres obvious overdubbing of expository material and worst of all a narrator explains everything most of which needs no explanation probably because some preview audience didnt understand what was going on in other words a movie about dumbing down has been you guessed itbr br one hopes that a longer better version of this comedy will eventually surface on dvd and it will become the cult fave it deserves to be but even in this mutilated and somewhat comic spiritdiminished form its one of the more memorable films of the year a screech of disgust against our culture and all the ways its become trashified stupidified and uglified in the name of appealing to the yahoos i watched it right after land of the dead george romeros latest milking of the single idea that consumers  zombies which is basically the same point judge is making yet where romeros counterculture viewpoint now zombies  underclass that needs to revolt against the rich seems hopelessly out of date judges take is fresh deadon and far more disturbing just listen to the yahoos in your movie audience whooping it up for president camachos state of the union just like their counterparts on screen and youll know that were all doomed
