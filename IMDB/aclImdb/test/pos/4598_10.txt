im not sure why there are no articles or posters or anything about this film because i just saw it and thought it was awesome i guess its not for everyone because its basically kafkas the trial meets beevis and butthead which is a pretty tough combination to swallow still i thought it was great if youre going to see it because you want a sequel to office space youre probably going to be disappointed but if you want to see one of the most brutal acidtongued and hilariously honest looks at where our society is headed youre in for a treat i just saw the 8pm show opening night in los angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater which means the film will probably be gone in a week thats really a shame because in its own way idiocracy is one of the best satires to come along in quite a while but then again its basically making fun of the people who make up about 99 of the moviegoing audience so i guess its no wonder the studio panicked and tried to dump it
