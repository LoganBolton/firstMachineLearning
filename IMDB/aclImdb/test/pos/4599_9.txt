shame on fox for dumping this movie it was a total riot and i only hope that it will find a second life on dvd and cablebr br this is a hilarious satire it takes the what if situation to an extreme and it doesnt pull any punches or kicks to the groin it makes you think what is to become of this empire once weve gotten totally to lazy and stupid everyone gets hit in this one esp a number of major corporations and even fox news takes a punchwhich is probably why the movie never had a proper release  other than the marketing department over thinking the campaign and not knowing how to market it so well just give up some may find the movie sophomoric due to the groin kicking and farting but the movie is much more than that you either get what mike judge is saying or you dont most of the negative reviews ive read seem to come from people who just dont get it or are film snobsbr br itll probably play for one week in the selected markets so if you miss it keep an eye out for the dvd itll be worth the rental and i will eventually have it in my collectionbr br good job mike judge its a shame that you got screwed but you made me laugh out loud and i look forward to the next movie you do
