let me start by saying that if youre expecting subtle humour youre in the wrong theatre its lowbrow and heavyhitting but hes not out to tickle your funny bone hes got the sledgehammer out and hes drawn a bead on the side of your head but fear not as movies go this is a fairly gentle education oh also heavy on the swearing but once again mike judge not fred rogersbr br was this movie called intelliocracy f no the gem the essence that is mike judge is that he has the ability to make people laugh at themselves beavis and butthead was most popular with teenaged boys the very people at which it incessantly poked funbr br with that in mind i dont think the humour in this movie is aimed at the super intelligent maybe you are all too smart to get it but hes not aiming at you hes aiming at your average joe and hes got a message get your act together and for gods sake study botany it is a little disjointed and the narrator gets to be a little irritating after a while but once again this movie is meant for people who need a lot of narration  its funny it has a message that it wants to make sure that we all understandbr br i question the casting of luke wilson in the role of a man with a 100 iq sometimes hes not able to play down whats he got like a 104 to the level of his character slightly forced at timesbr br kudos on dax shepard in this one i remember seeing him in zathura and thinking this guys looks like an idiot in this movie he makes a great idiot maybe im psychicbr br it took a while to warm up to maya rudolph but i gave her a little leeway after all she did have to play straight man to an entire planet but once she got a little screen time she made a solid contributionbr br terry crews played the same psychotic aggressive character hes played many times before but he makes a firstrate president none the lessbr br another bonus is that the place was practically empty counting my girlfriend and i there were literally six people in the theatre we couldve had a barbecue pit and a mariachi band so no annoying people talking as appears to be the norm in the talkingtothetv agebr br all in all a good premise and a competent delivery given the intended goal lots of laughs sprinkled throughoutbr br what made this movie scary was the fact that when we walked out of the theatre it was sort of like the movie was still playing we saw a lot of idiocy in the people immediately around us maybe made more apparent by the dose we got in the theatrebr br theyre all pods all of them
