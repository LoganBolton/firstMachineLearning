this movie was quite a pleasant surprise i had anticipated it for a long time and was afraid going in that it couldnt possibly live up to my expectationsbr br it exceeded thembr br i adored this moviebr br hilarious from start to finish stay until after the end credits it is absolutely remarkable how a movie about dumb and annoying characters can be so intelligent witty and engagingbr br with its obvious matte paintings the movies future earth recalls the planet of the apes series and other scifi movies of that erabr br in fact this movie is essentially planet of the apes but with people who are the mental equivalent of apesbr br it moves at a fairly brisk pace and luke wilson carries the movie quite well with a character that recalls the one he played in bottle rocket theres even a notsosubtle nod to bottle rocket in an early scenebr br maya rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former painter who was frozen as wellbr br despite all its strengths idiocracy has the distinct feel of a movie that was taken away from the directoreditor before it could be finetunedbr br i cannot for the life of me understand why a movie this funny would just be dumped into a few theaters with no advanced screenings no trailers no marketing whatsoeverbr br its as if the studio decided they were not going to spend any more on it and just walked awaybr br or maybe they thought the movie had the makings of a cult classic and the only way for it to become a true cult classic was to set it up to fail br br whatever the case it is a shame because mike judge and this film in particular deserve betterbr br i predict this movie will have real legs on dvd and word of mouth will propel it to the success it deservesbr br perhaps the fox executives saw themselves in the characters were confused and thought it was a documentary
