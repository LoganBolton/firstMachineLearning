theres no other word for itfox dumped this out with no marketing of any kind nobody in the country other than those who have been looking forward to this film know anything about it all the red flags have flown it has to be a mess it cant be anywhere near as good as office space right wrong though office space it aint this film definitely has satirical bite and wit its a misfire on certain levels but whos to blame is left to mysterybr br based on what is currently showing in theatres i can say idiocracy is a good movie its funny sometimes laughoutloud funny its effective sometimes ingenious what it isnt as far as i can tell is finished we will see something come of this film again whether its an extended cut or reshoots alone it can be hilarious its ballsy at timesbr br leaving the theatre looking around at the mall i was surrounded by advertisements and billboards commercialism and stupidity its not quite as damning a dystopia as 1984 but this movie paints an ugly future for our culture and there doesnt seem to be much anybody can do about it anyway go see this if you can and try to find out what happened that it was so specifically buried
