the black castle is one of those films that has found its way into a boris karloff collection and is mistakenly expected to be an outright horror movie whilst some horror elements exist within nathan jurans movie this really is a multi genre piece thats tightly produced and effectively portrayed joining karloff in what is a small but critical role are richard greene stephen mcnally lon chaney jr rita corday john hoyt  michael pate its produced unsurprisingly out of universal international pictures the plot sees greenes english gentleman travel to the castle home of the sinister count von bruno mcnally hes following an investigation into the disappearance of two friends an investigation that is fraught with danger and surprise at every turnbr br this has everything that fans of the old dark housecastle subgenre could wish for genuine good and bad guys a fair maiden dark corners for doing dark deeds devilish traps ticking clock finale and we even get a good old fashioned bit of swashbuckling into the bargain the cast are all turning in effective performances particularly greene and the wonderfully sneering mcnally whilst jerry sackheims writing is lean and devoid of the pointless filler that has so often bogged down similar films of this ilk a very recommended film on proviso that karloff fans understand its not really a karloff movie and perhaps more importantly that horror fans dont expect blood letting to be the order of the day a fine atmospheric story with a sense of dread throughout the black castle is a fine viewing experience 710
