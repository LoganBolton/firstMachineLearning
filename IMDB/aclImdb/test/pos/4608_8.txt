universal studios the name conjures up so many memories to horror fans of beautiful matte paintingserlandscapes fogenshrouded countrysides full moons howling wolves taverns and torch wielding mobs yet it is quite strange looking back on those films how little the era which produced the true classics lasted the 30s had its masterpieces but those were mostly from the same directors and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today the 40s produced more mindlessly fun matinée films than it did high art and most fans agree that the classic era of the gothic horror films ended in 1945 with house of dracula bumped around with the abbott  costello comedies and was officially dead by the 50s and the coming of the atomic agebr br so its strange that perhaps one of universals finest gothics was made in the 50s that alone makes the film an oddity since costume dramas were on their way out everywhere it may not be comparable to the all time classics like the james whale films and the wolfman but damn does it condense all the fun elements of those films into one delicious treat get ready for nothing but pure entertainment since various social mores had changed the film also indulges in violence that would not have been allowed in earlier eras theres no blood but we see characters shot and stabbed directly and theres even a burning torch to the facebr br the film may not really be a horror film but it sure has the atmosphere look and feel of one it begins in the dead of night with howling windsand wolves as two men seal the tombs of two apparently dead young lovers but wait one of them is not dead but he cant move hes trapped but talking silently in his own mind unable to communicate what is his story now that is how you start a horror filmbr br english businessman sir ronald burtonrichard greene giving one of his best performancessets out under the alias of richard beckett to investigate the disappearance of two friends of his who disappeared at the castle of oneeyed austrian count von brunodid sacha baron cohen see this it seems many years ago von bruno posed as a god to the natives in africa to steal ivory he was exposed by burtons men and the natives disfigured him now he is lusting for revengebr br the film has all the clichés a jonathan harkerstyle ride to the castle an inn full of wary villagers death traps and a hulking manservantlon chaney jr the torture chamber scenes are genuinely suspenseful including a panel in the floor that activates a dungeon doorwhich makes for an ingenious getaway scene later on a hunting expedition involving an imported pantherand even an alligator pit and then theres the romeo  julietstyle fake death that leads to the films prologuebr br the plot is cliché and the worldview is black and white but its still incredibly entertaining with director nathan juran making every scene pile on the atmosphere and seem fresh and new there are several plotholes too why does ronald attempt to leave the castle so early and he never does solve the mystery of what happened to his friends even though its obvious but he doesnt know that when he gives up and he seemed so sure earlier weirdbr br all of the actors are great despite being a rude upperclassman richard greene makes burton one of the most likable protagonists ive ever seen in a horror film rita corday is excellent as the counts peasant wife who becomes burtons love interest she may have the stereotypical falling in love with just a glance problem of all film heroines of this era but her portrayal of a longsuffering woman in a loveless marriage to a sadistic monster is very convincing she also shows a suspicion and wit few film heroines of this era do even seeing a forced attempt by burton to quiet herand to paw at her necklace although it is simply to analyze it as it has an important clue as a rape attempt yet she never seems nasty in her paranoia the audience sympathizes with her even though he fails to make von bruno seem truly foreign and otherworldlyhe is a villain in a horror film after all stephen mcnally gives a truly chilling performance as the sadistic nobleman when he reveals his burnt eye and laughs maniacally it is truly scary lon chaney jr is also great as his mute henchman gargonbr br but the best performance is undeniably by boris karloff as the mysterious physician dr meissen he has little screen time at first but steals every scene he is in it is a performance that is both creepy sad mysterious and ultimately heroic as he leers evilly as he applies leeches to one of brunos henchman spies on our hero and speaks in that famous you know im up to no good voice only karloff could make you wonder whether if he is a hero or villain always skulking about and although he does function as the main agent of our heros escape he still shows human frailties such as greed and fearfulness for his own life even coldbloodedly poisoning a man for burtons benefit before he even gets burton to agree his plan to help our hero  heroine escape also puts them directly in the clutches of von bruno as he arranges an amazingly sadisticif unbelievably flaweddeath for them that had to have inspired similar scenes in cormans poe series he may not have much screen time but this is easily one of boriss best performancesbr br while the ending may seem abrupt and anticlimatic for some half the fun is getting there and theres much excitement to be had kick back and relive the days when heroes were heroes and villains were villains its no masterpiece but its escapist fun at its best
