good grief sethrp1 you completely missed the point the girl was only seen briefly specifically because she was the one who was going to kill herselfeveryone else was so wrapped up in their own stories they didnt notice her nor did we as one of the other students says at the end  were all so wrapped up in our own problems we dont notice whats going on for someone else br br the director himself said if he had killed off one of the others it wouldve suggested their problems were worse than someone elses the whole point of killing kelly was that she was unnoticed by all of us get it now
