i saw 237 at the toronto international film festival in september and was blown away by it a scene of panic opens this film at 237 pm set in an adelaide high school this scene is left unresolved as we revert to the beginning of the day and are introduced to the teenagers getting ready to go to school the audience becomes intimate with each of the main characters and explores the daytoday issues facing teenagers  including drugs promiscuity being gay bullying and violence each scene is played again and again from different teens perspectives and is reminiscent of gus van sants elephant this is a remarkable film by firsttime director murali k thalluri it was made with nonprofessional student actors and workshopped through an unprecedented 76 drafts of a script it features stunning performances by a number of the student actors particularly teresa palmer in the role of melody this comingofage film is both intimate and thoughtprovoking with a surprising and disturbing ending
