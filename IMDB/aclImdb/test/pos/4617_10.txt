i have to confess i fell into the cynical trap of believing that australians couldnt make drama unless it meant a lot of crying and i am an australian sad isnt it while this movie does involve crying its not dramatic crying its honest emotion shining throughbr br also this film is a whodunnit i knew what the final outcome was going to be when i started watching this so i tried to guess who it was that was going to do it i missed by a milebr br i was stunned when i found out the director murali thulluri was only around 21 when he made this film i would love to shake his hand he knows how to make a movie i hope he has more comingbr br all of the characters we meet before the main title credit about 12 minutes in is an anti hero all of them troubled in their own way and all of them as selfish as the next one even when they are sympatheticbr br the saddest scene in the movie and there are some that are difficult to watch is the final scene where were formally introduced to the real main character and were told of their nephew that scene made me crybr br my faith in australian drama has been restored were masters at comedy but i was getting bored with comedybr br murali if you happen to check this out you touched my soul and for that i can only thank you
