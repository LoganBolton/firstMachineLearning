being featured at the 2006 cannes film festival and gaining quite some fame this movie appears to be another modern and profound school drama br br its about a bunch of adolescents who get through a revealing and desperate day at school everythings circling around a suicide  shown at the very beginning to some extent  that happens at 237pm the characters are somehow all connected with each other what moves them is described via short interview sequences strictly shot in bw the characters are well written the acting is intriguing especially teresa palmer as melody and frank sweet as marcus are discoveriesbr br lets stick to the movies technique thats what really impressed me there rarely are cuts most of the time the camera follows one of the protagonists like in gus van sants elephant some scenes are presented more often than once but each time from a different point of view here character this surely evokes a slowly developing but grabbing atmosphere that drags you inside literally the colours are vibrant somehow unfitting considering the tough plot  but thats nothing less than a clever contrast a disturbing everythings fine thing the use of lighting is adequate all the time underlining the characters actual mood and finally there are decent placements of musicbr br 237 somehow itches you from the very beginning it does not compromise nor does it serve laughter it rather strings together what psychologists would define as terror moments this movie substantially focuses on emotional precipices there aint nobody whos not to handle some kind of neurosis even the depicted minor parts eg the teachers seem to be in some state of disorder and that is what keeps this movie from being really good its summing up of piercing tragedies is unrealistic to its very bones there is no friendship love smiling truth passion there is faking humiliation despair sickness and beating up its like being hit in the face real hard all the time but you are numb after the first hour this flick keeps on hitting you until it reveals something quite instructive in the endbr br for being sensitively and superbly acted 9 for being technically innovative and original 9 for being unidimensional 3br br makes a solid 7 out of 10
