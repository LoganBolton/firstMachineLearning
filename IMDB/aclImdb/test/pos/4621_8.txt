yes 237 is in some ways a rip off from gus van sants elephant its about some students who are dealing with their problems leading to the suicide of one of them yes its full of clich√©s but thats life you just cant deny that creepy nerds disabled persons or popular students who despite their popularity do have problems are existing in the real worldbr br but thats not what this film is all about its not about life in highschool its not about the misery of life itselfbr br if you look beneath the surface beneath the soaplike social relationships that are shown you will find some gripping thoughtprovoking criticism of our societybr br why are people committing suicide do we really understand their motives or are we just trying to understand after its already too late and why is it always someone you would never have expected it to bebr br this movie doesnt answer this question but it raises it and it does so in a very intense way all the way it keeps you guessing whose blood it might be that you see at the very beginning you are following the paths of some students all of them having a more or less good reason to end their lives just to be forced to watch the gruesome act in the finalebr br did you know who it would be or were you caught by surprise like in real lifebr br the message is verbalized by one of the surviving kids in the end we are always so fixed on our own problems we forget to see those of others there might be someone a colleague a friend who does not want to live anymore but if you dont open your eyes youll never know until its too latebr br this movie delivers well it might have some flaws but they dont matter anymore when its over either you see a reflection of society or you are blind for reality
