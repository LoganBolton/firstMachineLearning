many other viewers are saying that this is not a good movie to watch since they feel that it isnt realistic how can it not be considered realistic they feel that say the incest part isnt easy to relate to that it isnt common i can guarantee you that you have met more people than you think that have had an incest act occur many of them arent going to come out and say it and mostly these are victims also many people are gay and are still in the closest because no matter how much they would like it to be they know they will be ridiculed and possibly even abandoned and tell me how many kids have you went to high school with that has ended up being pregnant or had an eating disorder i bet a lot and although pregnancy isnt from incest most of the time its still easy to relate to who cant relate to being an outcast or being bullied that happens all the time and many viewers are probably concerned with there education such as marcus being a stoner seems to be quite common these days to so there are a lot of things to relate to more than the rest though no matter how popular you may get sometimes you feel invisible or alone not noticed or overlooked such as the suicide victim how can you not feel like you can relate to the movie i find that the movie may have seemed pointless to others but i would like to think of it as important it an interesting way of showing that suicide happens and to be aware it comes from the people that dont show their unhappy thoughts its very surprising the people who show there problems do commit suicide sometimes to but when you hear of suicide who would have guessed is usually running through most peoples mindsbr br the ending surprised me i wasnt expecting it to be the girl that until the end was mostly an extra in the scenes not even introduced the story even in its description says its about 6 teenage lives when in fact it was 7 my only real disappointment was that it wasnt one of the characters that we got to learn about it merely at first seems like the movie was pointless to watch if the real victim is just some random chick until i thought more it made perfect sense for being a huge surprise since thats what suicides are like plus who was to choose who any of the other students had more of a reason than the otherbr br though this movie has some bad points most movies have a few but i would recommend this movie as long as you can deal with watching the tragic moments of watching the suicide and violence and profanity shown in this film
