237 is an intense and fascinating drama which has some similarities in tone and subject with films like bully elephant and kids although by my point of view 237 is a superior film to those three onesbefore watching this movie my expectations were neutral but i ended up taking a very good impression thanks to the intelligent screenplay murali k thalluris perfect direction and the excellent performances from a group of young actorsbr br the sporadic instances of school violence around the world have inspired many movies tv programmes and books which pretend to find and predict the external or internal reasons of those unbridled expressions of rebelliousness discontentand specially madnesssome people may say that 237 arrives too late to that artistic movement however i do not think like that because that delay permitted the movie to make a more artistic analysis focusing on the situation with more subtleness and intelligence instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and anguish which impregnated other movies with similar storiesbr br on the characters from 237 we can find clich√©s from the juvenile cinema from director and screenwriter john hughes rips movies to the teen horror films the beautiful princess the clumsy nerd the antipathetic athletes etcit would have been very easy to make them become in hollow caricatures defined by their function in the screenplay but it is something admirable that the screenplay transcends the stereotypes to make them real people with credible problems which in more or less degree any person can find on hisher road to maturitybr br 237 is an excellent movie whose only fail is that the ending feels a bit affected but which compensates that with a lot of positive elementsit will be very interesting to see thalluris next projects since he has had a great debut with this movie
