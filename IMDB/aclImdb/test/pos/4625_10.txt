i had the pleasure of witnessing this brilliant film at a preview screening in sydney although it was a pleasure to see it pleasure is not the emotion you are left with as the credits rollbr br 237 is a film that tackles not just one stigma felt by young individuals but all of them chief of which is isolation it is not just to place the films final galvanising scene on a pedestal above the others but rather it is important to see it as the culmination and from that it is important to realise what it represents to both you as the viewer and to the people directly effected by itbr br 237 is not a soft picture but the manner in which mr thalluri handles its subject matter with a profound dignity and its no holds barred approach acts as credit to its messagebr br i do not believe films such as 237 should be scaled by votes of favour rather it should be recommended to those looking for purpose in their viewingbr br a brilliantly crafted portrait of innocence lost and a master stroke for a as of yet untaped talentbr br not to be missed
