at 237pm in a bathroom at an adelaide highschool a student takes their own life and the different worlds of six teenagers are changed foreverbr br 237 is a brutal honest and breathtaking film centered on the pain of being a teenager the film follows one day in the lives of six teenagers all intertwined all dealing with their own personal dramas while there are a couple of stereotypes in the mix  the beautiful wouldbe popular girl dealing with body issues the overachiever obsessed with his grades there are several horrors that are as far from mainstream as you can get including a social outcast dealing with a brutal illness and a young girl trying to make sense of a devastating event in her pastbr br the movie is mixed with documentarystyle interviews from the characters which some viewers may find a little out of place in the otherwise seamless narrative the pace is also a little slow but it fits with the feel of the movie the young australian actors are all stars in their own right in particular theresa palmer whos heartbreaking performance earned her an afi nominationbr br the film is very well shot with terrific direction some scenes are a little hard to watch  in particular the fiveminutelong suicide scene but overall it is a film that leaves a big impact on its viewers it draws you in right from its shocking opening scene and keeps you guessing as to which of the six main characters is going to be the one to end up in the bathroom ultimately its a beautiful made but slightly disturbing look at teenage life
