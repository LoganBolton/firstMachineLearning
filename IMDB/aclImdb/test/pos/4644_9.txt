this is basically a goofball comedy with somewhat odd pacing due to some dramatic elements for michael j fox and paul reubens it was their first filmfox had previously been in a short lived tv series and a tv moviebr br since the movie is basically a racescavenger hunt type movie like cannonball run its a mad mad mad mad world or more recently rat race there are no main characters instead there are groups of characters splitting the screen time and allowing for tons of miniplots usually these kind of movies are a way to cram the maximum amount of stars or semistars onto a filmbr br this one has teams with one being the primary team which fox belongs to who are the only characters to be developed their plot is more of a stereotypical disney affiar about a college boy not paying attention to his younger brother who he thinks of as a lazy punk since they are forced on a team together along with the older brothers girlfriend they are forced to work together since this is the main plot it gets the most screen timebr br some of the other silly plots stand out the blue team is about an overweight rich kid whose dad just wants him and his misfit friends out of the house they end up with a cool custom van which had an onboard computer in 1980 to instantly solve the riddles plus play video games with the time saved one member stephen furst went on to play dr axelrod on st elsewhere and later was on babylon 5 ill also admit that i still laugh when barf while trying to unscramble a word ala scrabble comes up with fagabefe this is much funnier than bart simpsons qwyjibo in my opinionbr br the other three teams have plots that are somewhat linked together the green team is a bunch of frat boys with mostly beer jokes which climaxes into a breakdown for one when the hunt leads to the pabst blue ribbon brewery they get a chance to harass the red team with two feminists and two funloving twins the white team of nerds are lead by eddie deezen who was previously in grease but went on to play a critical computer geek role in wargames and later tim conways sidekick in some of the dorf seriesbr br if you grew up in the 80s then there are some classic moments in the movie that bring back memories the early video arcade from back when they were cool is always a plus in my mind look for paul reubens and his quartershooting guns there is also a miniature golf course and a roller discobr br the movie is actually an okay family movie simply because profanity is almost nonexistant and the small amount of sexual humor is completely innocent the odd pacing thanks to the yellow teams cheesy dramatic moments will put parents to sleep while their kids can giggle at giant melons at fat burger oh they actually have a special melon platter that must be it right
