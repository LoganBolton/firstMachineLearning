twenty years after watching this i still find myself quoting things from this movie like look between the two giant melons or ill start to sing the pabst blue ribbon theme on the other hand 20 years later i can now make sense of the meat machine as theres still a lot of the stereotypes like this out there that they used for this movie those are signs of a good movie to me i could say this movie stands the test of time which i cant really say for a lot of 80s movies i continue that this movie is still on a list of a lot of peoples favorite movie as a kid growing up in the 80s if you like games and have dreams of becoming a game master or find yourself dorking out over these 80s movies to relive your childhood you need to watch this also its sometimes sarcastic and funny but one things for certain about this movie if someone ever invites you to a great allnighter they dont mean an x or acid trip party they mean get ready for some midnight madness oh youll see everyone will be dying to play hehehehheh
