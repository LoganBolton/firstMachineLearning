weee this is still jolly good fun as with most of my friends we had seen this movie on hbo when we were young and then had been searching ever since for a copy of it when they finally rereleased it a few years ago we had a midnight madness party and the movie held up well sure its pure cheese but its still a lot of fun if you didnt see mm when you were young you might not appreciate its value today
