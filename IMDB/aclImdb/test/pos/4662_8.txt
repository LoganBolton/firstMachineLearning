well i just discovered imdb from my twin sister carol carol and i played the fat identical twin in midnight madness we didnt have to prepare much for the fat part that came with us and well and the rest was natural  it was our first major film role and we had a blast making it we were 21 at the time and lived about an hour and half from the disney studio in burbank and the hollywood california area we grew up in front of the tv and probably some of the first generation of latchkeykids twenty years later we still have lots of fun and are still heavy or what ever is politically correct these days we dont pursue acting any more but have been know to come back when the right opportunity arrives carol is a chiropractor in our home town of southern california and i am in the information technology field in georgiabr br i maybe bias but i thought the film was cute clean and fun we knew it wasnt a master piece or an oscar nominee however it was and still is a movie the whole family can watch and have fun together its nice not to have to worry if your young children can watch a video without having to fast forward certain parts and no one was more exited when it was released on video as carol and i were carol found it at kmart for 699 now thats an inexpensive way to capture ones memories and share it with othersbr br sincerely betsy lynn and carol gwynn the thompson twins
