warning slight plot spoilers aheadbr br the italian job is not the best movie youll see all year or probably even this summer but it is a worthwhile two hours because it colors within the lines knowing its limits and not attempting to exceed thembr br what carries the movie is the work of the cast in a movie about a crew of thieves the individuals must have a good rapport with each other without that cohesive feel the audience doesnt believe in the characters collectively or individually and the movie never has a chance but from the first scenes in which the men joke around and rag on each other while infiltrating a venetian palace the proper chemistry is in placebr br the characters themselves arent anything novel theyre your basic gang of criminals containing about half a dozen players each with a specific and defining skill but each actor brings the proper goods to the table for his or her part mark wahlbergs understated acting and humor fits well with his part as the mastermind planner edward norton provides attitude and twirls his mustache well in his dark role donald sutherland is the father figure of the crew and he looks the part of the suave and oldfashioned thief who is still mentally spry jason statham seth green and mos def dont do much beyond their characters abilities but they each nail those parts statham as the smoothoperating driver green as the tech whiz geek with a chip on his shoulder and def as the demolitions man charlize theron slides in well in a part that doesnt ask too much of her she is primarily asked to to drive fast and look good that she does none of the characters are that deep or threedimensional but in this familiar sort of movie two dimensions are all that is required br br as the title implies the movie has a european feel to it a la the bourne identity in part because it was shot on location in venice along with philadelphia and los angeles also contributing to the euro flair is the rhythmic bouncy music which adds to the upbeat nature of the flick and complements the rapport of the cast the look of the movie is also a perfect match the bright colors of all locales enhance the mood and add to the attitude the minis not only provide a fun variation on the car chase but also work as a necessary plot device br br the plot is more or less straightforward there are a few surprises but they are more of the swiftandsmoothturn variety as opposed to the dropyourjaw hairpin curve even with those the movie speeds along once the foundation is laid by the first act everything continuously progresses thankfully there are no breaks in the action for a romance something the movie wisely avoided there arent even any breaks for real life the story has its purpose and runs that course without distractions the lack of character depth prevents the italian job from being more than a good popcorn movie but with all the complex details of the heistplanning such superfluities would have dragged down the pace and quality of the flickbr br there are a number of implausibilities that i thought of both during and after viewing but the movie is so enjoyable that i didnt and dont care in the real world most of the movie probably couldnt have gone off that cleanly but the italian job doesnt take place in the real world it occurs in a stylish and lighthearted criminal world that appeals to the rebel in all of us br br the italian job is a movie in the true sense of the word it has no pretenses of oscar and contains no deep moral message it provides pure escapism entertainment and does so quite wellbr br bottom line maybe the best popcorn movie of the year so far 7 of 10
