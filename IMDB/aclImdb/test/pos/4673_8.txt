i find it sad that just because edward norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it people automatically think the movie sucks without even watching it or giving it a chance i really hope norton did not do this he is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent moviebr br i found it entertaining it wasnt mind blowing or anything with crazy special effects but it was not a bad it was fun to watch but yea definitely not a badhorrible moviebr br 710
