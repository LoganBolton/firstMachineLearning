i enjoyed this movie more than i expected it has enough action intrigue and locations to make it worth your while while i cant quite yet see mark wahlberg as a leader hes gotten good enough to be a credible manager and thats okbr br the superhero of the movie is the mini cooper its shown to have the speed dexterity and muscle to pull off any job and to handle a maniac driver like charlize therons character
