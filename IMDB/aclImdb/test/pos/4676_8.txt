one of the perks of my job is that when things are slow i can watch the movie in our downstairs theater i work in a little 2screen theater in the cry room and still keep an eye on the concession stand i have seen italian job probably 20 times and im still not tired of it the atmosphere reminds me of oceans eleven although the acting isnt as good mark wahlberg is ok charlize theron appeals to the guys but seth green is awesome in this movie i thought edward norton did a very good job playing a dirtbag although a lot of people disagree i also enjoyed mos def as the explosives expert thats afraid of dogs i highly recommend this movie and will continue to watch it whenever i can
