i wonder how many mini cooper automobiles were sold thanks to this movie it couldnt help but add to the sales of this little car which is featured in this film along with an attractive castbr br this is a very very entertaining heistandchase film it features a cool cast with mark wahlberg charlize theron edward norton seth green and jason stathambr br the best chase scene is right at the beginning with a boat pursuit in venice italy the film doesnt overdo the violence has a pretty intelligent script with a few short exceptions features interesting characters and is nicely firmed the catandmouse game between norton and therons characters is suspenseful and fun to watchbr br once again however we are manipulated into rooting for criminals portrayed as the good guys how many times has this happened since the days of butch cassidy and the sundance kid in the 1960s its twisted hollywood for you in here one of the criminals norton stole and killed the leader and father figure donald sutherland of the gang so hes the worst of the bunch and the films villain also therons character is in the typically overblownfeminist mode of hollywood in which women can do all things including driving a car better than a man a third minor irritation is seth greens smug smartass attitude which we also are supposed to go along with because its hip and cool br br despite these hindrances it is an extremely entertaining movie and it also doesnt overboard on the profanity or sexand yes those little cars are cool everyone ive talked to who has seen this film enjoyed it
