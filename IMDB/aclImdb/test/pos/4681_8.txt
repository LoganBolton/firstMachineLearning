the italian job is a real blast to watch its a genuinely entertaining film something you watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it its not heavy with drama or emotional handwringing it has no cosmic statements about life and its not violent or profane its just a fun movie between watching the little mini coopers fly around the crowded streets of la and the great bits by stereotypical computer geekturnedcrook played gleefully by seth greene i had a lot of fun watching this filmbr br special kudos to the background music they truly set a masterful tone for such a movie so subtle yet keeps you on the edge when needed apparently a lot of artists contributed to the music i found it to be the classiest part of the filmbr br 8 out of 10 not aweinspiring but a great film to watch at the end of a lousy day at the officebr br barky
