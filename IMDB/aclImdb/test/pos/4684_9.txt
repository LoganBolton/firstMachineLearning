over the last few months i have seen a lot of reviews for the italian job many of them negative the gist of almost all of these pessimistic criticisms is that for all its modernistic bravado and highbudget technology the film doesnt have much substance where it counts look people its just a fun movie this is the type of picture where youre supposed to sit back relax and just enjoy the steadymoving pace of the film like oceans eleven 2001 you can concentrate on the characters and the plot at the same time without having to do much thinking lucky for some of us granted ocean is a better movie but who cares the plot may have some holes theres a huge one about 34 of the way through the action may not be as gratifyingly gratuitous as the trailers made it out to be and some of the dialogue may seem pointless and cheesy but again who really cares cool characters mini coopers big explosions charlize theron what more do you want i think its time to drop the fake roger ebert meets gene shalit act and enjoy yourself for once oh and another thing whatever you do dont compare it to the original because to reiterate what f gary gray has told the press a million times this is not a remake my advice if youre interested in nitpicking your way through a goodhumored fun flick dont even bother seeing the italian job but if you dont have a severe inferiority complex andor want to see ed norton get jacked by a bunch of ukranians go ahead the bottom line my fellow moviegoers is lighten up and have fun dammit
