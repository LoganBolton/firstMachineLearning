hi i have to say you got some wrong information about the series here the main author was richard carpenter he created the series later on there were some other authors but they only did a few episodesbr br the first director who did most of the series i think complete series 1 was ian sharp who created the distinct look of robin of sherwoodbr br clannad did indeed see some of the material and they read the scrips i know this for sure because richard carpenter told it on a con in england last yearbr br i think this is a masterpiece of televisionentertainment because it has great characters and cast good costumes and great story lines for me still one of the best tvseries ever
