i remember watching this series avidly every saturday evening it was the highlight of the week i loved everything about it the location the costumes the actors and the wonderful music by clannad i still have their legend album i loved the way they solved the problem of michael praed leaving by creating another robin this time the earl of huntingdon i believe there were legends of several robins in medieval times another thing i loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors im sure robin and his men would have young after all people didnt live that long in those days other robins always look too old kevin costner with his ridiculous accent looked like robins granddad the only sad thing was the ending its a shame they couldnt at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending
