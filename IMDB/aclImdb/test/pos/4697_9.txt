fantastic series one of my few favorites miami vice and tour of duty are the other two and this series is right up there with thembr br these guys arent into wearing frilly tights  they dress more like woodsmen everything about this series breathes an aire of realism artistic license or notbr br it paints a picture of a europe only slightly out of the grasp of paganism as most of the villagers still have their local deities and there are satan worshipping nuns and magi witches and sorcerers casting spellsbr br however what comes to the fore most is that its a series of its time rather than the version of the fifties which was a lament against centralized government and the mccarthy era persecutions this series is thoroughly grounded in the 1980s thatcherist bleakness and has a strong environmentalist leaning robins protector is a nature worshipper called hern the hunter who often appears wearing the head of a deer and is a personification as is this robin of the green man an alternative version of osiris the egyptian god of vegetation and resurrection  it is interesting to note that in these series robin in the hood isnt a person but a concept when the old one is killed a new one is summoned telepathically by hern  the person may die but robin in the hood will live forever hence the concept of resurrectionbr br the music and score are really outstanding and performed by the irish formation clannad when watching it i couldnt help but think how boring authentic medieval anglosaxon folk music would have been br br all this is beautifully shot in the lush forrests of wales which pass for the new forrestbr br the only down side is that in the initial episodes of both series the actors have to overcome their own skepsis and convince themselves that this really is a serious work after that they get into it and the acting is great michael praed as the first robin the second is played by sean connerys son jason judi trott makes a beautiful and fragile redheaded marion phil rose as the portly and really kindhearted friar tuck ray winstone as the volatile and lovelorn scarlet clive mantle as the giant shepard little john peter llewellyn williams as little johns bumpkin friend and fellow shepard and mark ryan as the exhashashinassassin nazir  all of them giving great performances also great are the steady bad guys nicholas grace as the bugeyed scheming sheriff of nottingham and his aristocratic bumbling sidekick and robins half brother as it turns out robert addie as sir guy of gisburne really cool too is fashion designer richard obrien as the evil lord owen of cluns olliver cotton magician gulnar he appears near the end of the first series and later in the secondbr br the tithe barn in bradford on avon stood in for the sheriffs castle check it out on bradfordonavoncouk under places of interestbr br so if youre at all into mythology the middle ages romanticism dont waste your time on xena or hercules  this is the real thing so go out and watch itbr br alex
