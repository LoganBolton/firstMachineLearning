as listed and stated in many previous comments this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients to its credit indeed more than 20 years after it was originally transmitted it is still watched and watched again and has a huge global fanfollowing something which must indicate that the makers of this series undeniably got something rightbr br the root of the series brilliance and remarkable appeal has however got to be that it rests on wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters  all of which are brought to life by marvellous actors the characters are wonderful in particular because of their complexity in contrast to many other robin hood adaptations and indeed many other film and tvproductions in general the good guys in this series often make mistakes and can be seen to have apparent flaws while the baddies although put forward as evil and ruthless frequently can be understood and even on occasion seem quite sympathetic this very much makes robin of sherwood into a story about multifaceted real people  rather than of good and bad people  something which very much adds to its uniqueness and remarkable appeal also although very much being an actionpacked series featuring numerous amazing stunts which are remarkable in themselves seeing as this was made long before todays computer animation green screens and so forth thus behind every one of those endless guys falling off castle walls horses and catching fire there actually is a real person who at some point did fall off a castle wall or a horse or catch fire there is always amazing dialogue going on between the different characters in each episode in the final analysis however it is generally the series baddies  nickolas grace as the sheriff of nottingham robert addie as sir guy of gisburne and philip jackson as the abbot hugo de rainault  who get the very best lines and who more than often steal the show with their arguments full of wit and cant its a wedding not a celebration is just one of their many timeless pearls of wisdom which seems to follow one through life br br 20 years after the fact it is indeed hard to believe that robin of sherwood was originally something made for television  and apparently not with a great deal of money  in order to provide fleeting saturday afternoon amusement for small children in great britain filmed in beautiful locations with clever amazing scripts and featuring remarkable stunts and fantastic actors  many of whom give the performance of their lives in this show  this in numerous ways seems to be more professionally made and have more production value than many a hollywood film
