this movie is like happiness meets lost in translation with a sixth sense ending or maybe a crying game surprise and the best soundtrack ive probably ever heardif that all make sensebr br the first 30 seconds pretty much tells you youre in for a twisted ride i was surprised no one walked out right away during the brooklyn premiere but from there the film settles down into a talkfest between two really damaged people daphne and buddybr br theyre lonely messup and boy do they talk about sex daphne brings to life her most interesting tales of escorting some are quite funny mr chang some disturbing the harlan scenes with music that tells us what we see might now be whats going on or what daphne is really feeling and because i have a friend who used to escort i might add most seem quite real br br you are alone is multilayered and mostly brilliant okay maybe a couple minutes less of the talking and i dont know that wed have missed anything br br then again i need to see it again knowing the endingbr br i like this moviebr br the director asked people in the brooklyn audience to write a review on imdb because a lot of people read them request granted
