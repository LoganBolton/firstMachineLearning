i first was made aware of this film when i saw a preview before another movie i was intrigued but it didnt get to see it before its short run in theaters was donebr br it is not an easy movie to watch multiple times there is much violence inflicted upon unarmed civilians there are lessons to be learned here one of patricia arquettes lines sums up on to americans if it didnt happen on tv it just didnt happen there is a lot of truth to thatbr br another is that at one point she thinks that just because she announces she is an american citizen that soldiers will part and let her pass it doesnt work that waybr br the scenery is beautiful the acting is all decent the professor is especially good mainly though i care about these characters francis mcdormand and spaulding gray are fine but their appearance is short so they dont matter much patricia has guts in the hands of a lesser actor this could have turned out very badly as it is love or hate the movie you should still come away with the idea that there still exist military dictatorships in the world in this century and until one of our own is hurt we ignore their oppressionbr br aung san suu kyi is the female political leader in the movie in real life she won the nobel peace prize she was only recently released from house arrest the w bush administration as of the date i write this is attempting to pressure the military government to engage in talks with her and reform the government the burmize government was under such scrutiny that is changed the name of the country to the maynamar republic the us government has yet to recognzie the new namebr br if you dont wnat a message in your movie dont watch this one if you dont mind a little educations with your entertainment then its a fine one
