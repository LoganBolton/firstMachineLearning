lush cinematography beautifully written and edited john boormans beyond rangoon is a mustsee for anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation it interweaves a personal and political tale that continues to haunt me popping up in my minds eye with frequency the story line is gripping and the inner and outer journeys are paralleled carefully and delicately both cinematically and in the story line ive watched this film at least six times and it really holds up to scrutiny it is particularly relevant today given world events check it out you wont regret it btw netflix does not yet carry it but you can request that they do
