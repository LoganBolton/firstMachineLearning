i always wanted to see this film and when i finally got to i knew i was in for a nice surprise when john boormans name appeared on the screen known mostly for his epic films he directed the first conan and wrote apocalypse now put together in the classic hollywood structure this one fits nicely with his catalogbr br i also cant express how perfect the timing was considering that myanmar burma is once again experiencing an uprising by monks and students against the military junta run government which is the very same one there has been a change of leadership since but its essentially the same depicted in the movie from 1988 now more than ever this film needs to be aired on television caught it on ifc because of recent events
