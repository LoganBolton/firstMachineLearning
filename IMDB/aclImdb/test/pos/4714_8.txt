i came across this movie on tv i hadnt heard of it before and almost changed the channel but it quickly hooked mebr br the story of the struggle of the burmese people against a military dictatorship was provoking the level of brutality that some are willing to use to hold onto power is hard to believe it makes me thankful to live in a country where the government isnt likely to shoot people in the streetsbr br the story of laura bowman was a good thread to hold the story of political struggle together
