if you want to see real evidence of what a misguided and unchecked government can do to unpopular people this movie provides it read what some people are saying about the patriot act passed after 911 and then watch this movie is it worth it do we really want to give away our freedoms to these people regardless of what you saw on tv you are not fully informed until you watch this movie i apologize for quoting another reviewer but it needs repeating roger ebert of siskel  ebert said whats interesting is if youre looking for people who are unbalanced zealots you dont find them among the branch davidians you find them among the fbi and the alcohol tobacco and firearms those are the people in this movie who deserve to be feared i think i think every person responsible for 911 needs to be brought to justice but i think the government has not shown a history of honoring its duty to protect peoples rights and this movie proves it in dramatic fashion
