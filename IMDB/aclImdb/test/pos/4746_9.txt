roy scheider is not steve mcqueen or clint eastwood but then who is the sevenups is one of the better cop movies even today and is second only to mcqueens bullitt and the dirty harry series which isnt bad company there are three things that seem to make a good cop movie believable script with great acting great car chase scenes and some heavy action this movie has all three and the car chase scene is better than that in dirty harry scheider plays the head of a group of cops out to get nys bad guys sentenced to seven years or more hence the name sevenups overall not quite up to dirty harry or bullitt but far better than all of the cop movies made since the dirty harry series 910
