the sevenups seems like a replay of the french connection which was released two years prior both the late roy scheider and tony lo bianco make appearances as well as stunt driver bill hickmanbr br but we arent dealing with french drug baddies instead we are dealing with a war against assorted hoods and criminals after a cop is brutally killed by a hoodlum we get to see unpleasantness and a pre1990s new york citybr br i love watching this film because it is exciting to see the action and it is a reminder of a cooler time that said when one compares the car chases mr hickman had involvement in the three most compared this movie bullitt and the french connection each chase scene has its own qualities and this one is simply superbbr br and i am glad this title has seen the light of day on dvd
