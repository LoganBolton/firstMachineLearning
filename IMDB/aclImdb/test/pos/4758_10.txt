having grown up in new jersey and having spent many a day and night on the gritty streets of new york in the 1970s watching a film like the sevenups or its kindred spirit the french connection always evokes fond memories of a time and place which for some might have been nycs darkest hour but which for me in my early twenties was always one funfilled adventure after another i truly miss those times as one reviewer remarked this film very aptly captures the stark cold matteroffact feel of the nyc winter season while keenly exposing the underbelly of the regions infamous underworld of crime and policing a great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture a spoton characterization of both the film and the city the stellar attributes of this film  the plot the cast the characters and of course the car chase  are amply described in many of the reviews here so i wont go into that except to say that one of my favorite moments occurs during the car chase when the camera focuses on richard lynch riding shotgun to the maniacal bill hickman the look of horror on richard lynchs face along with the defensive gestures are so outofcharacter for an actor much better known as a source of terror rather than an object of it that it is actually comical to watch i get a chuckle out of it every time
