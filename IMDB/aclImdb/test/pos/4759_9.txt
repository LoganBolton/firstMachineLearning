i was born in 68 with not much parental guidance as far as what i watched on tv as a kid in the 70s i always loved this movie and the french connection and would always try to catch it whenever it was on checking the sunday tv guide ahead of time i bought it on dvd a few years ago and have watched it twice since then and i must say i still love it roy s was a great actor from the 70s jaws is one of my alltime favs marathon man etc and although the 7ups is not an oscarworthy film it puts you precisely in a time a place ny early 70s as did french connection and gives you some tough characters and a glimpse of life as a cop at that time and yes the car chase is one of the alltime best
