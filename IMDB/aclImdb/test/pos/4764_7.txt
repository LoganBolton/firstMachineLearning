im not much for cop movies but this one is supposedly a classic  when i found it cheap i bought it and stuck it on a shelf only to finally get around to watching it yesterday and i liked it now you can have new york city but as a setting for a film like this in the winter months its perfect roy scheider is a member of an elite police task group called the seven ups which are 5 guys that fight crime undercover in an opening scene they recover a shoebox full of money from an antique store by distracting the crooks with a bull in a china shop routine but thats only the beginning seems that there are two guys posing as cops that are kidnapping mob types and holding them for ransom richard lynch happens to be one of these sleazebags and hes as creepy as ever when one of the seven ups who is posing as a limo driver at a funeral gets his cover blown hes beaten and stuffed into the trunk of a car which then leads to perhaps one of the most exciting car chases ive seen amazing though how light traffic in nyc is for chase scenes but still this is rather amazing as scheider follows the two kidnappers through what im guessing is the bronx and then onto a turnpike and then eventually scheiders car comes to a screeching halt in one of the most heartstopping finales to a chase scene that ive ever witnessed anyway since the cop ends up dying scheider and his men are under suspicion because the police commissioner knows so little about their activities he wonders if theyre on the make by kidnapping mobsters so of course this kind of thinking needs to be nipped in the bud  scheider is relentless getting to the bottom of things overall a decent cop actiondrama not really my thing but i liked this one look for joe spinell maniac in a small role 7 out of 10
