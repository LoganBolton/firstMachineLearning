just cant watch this bit too many times its full of true enthusiasm and cleverness mickey mouse had in his first 30 years nowadays mickey is an smart ass little whiner when compared this steamboat willie always makes me smile at least the ending where mickey laughs after hitting a parrot with a potato animation is very nice and although steamboat willie has no dialog the music is enough for itbr br imho if this bit doesnt deserve 1010 then any cartoon doesnt not only because its a true classic but also because its so full of joy and its always fun to watch
