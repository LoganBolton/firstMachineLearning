the 1980s my dinner with andre with wallace shawn and andre gregory is essentially a dialog about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit 2005s you are alone demonstrates how common worldly events can shatter the soul br br the story revolves around three principal characters theres daphne a pretty teenage student who frets about virtually every decision in her life then theres the prostitute or paid escort britney as selfconfident as daphne is selfconscious what makes them interesting is that they share the same body if not the same personae part of the magic of this film occurs in one of the early scenes where daphne approaches a door of an aged hotel room she halts and is obviously torn by the decision of whether or not to knock on the door  but it is britney that effortlessly glides into the room when the door is openedbr br on the other side of that door is buddy a middleaged nobody with few if any personal qualities that anyone would find attractive he goes so far as to be confrontational about britneys chosen profession as soon as she enters the room however we soon learn that buddy is daphnes nextdoor neighbor and has watched through the years as she grew from little girl to womanhood this complicates things for the audience is buddy just being a concerned neighbor or does he want something elsebr br if its sex that buddy wants here it is britney loves sex her definitions may be clintonesque but that doesnt lesson her enthusiasm she prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic wristbands that her clients are invited to chose from each color band denotes a specific act that shell perform  but exactly which act isnt revealed until after the band is broken off her wrist and the choice is irrevocably made br br britney is or believes that she is in control of every encounter even when blindfolded and bound as she is by one of her regular clients she imagines her arms and body being stroked by multiple men but her legs and pubic area being caressed by a woman in blood red lingerie the films imagery just keeps comingbr br buddys pathetic life is one of acceptance hes lost his wife his dog even his fantasies of the pretty teenager nextdoor its no coincidence that hes lured daphne or britney to this particular hotel room theres a painting on the wall of a dinner plate with only a fish head left this is a perfect metaphor for buddys life all of the good parts are finished so its here where he brought his wife when they were still college students that he makes his stand  to regain some control of his own life to make his statementbr br the director of you are alone gorman bechard knows his craft the principal action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film assisted by a myriad of intercut scenes that add dimension to the characters their circumstances and conflictsbr br as the film progresses britney asks buddy if she should get undressed he says yes but she strips only to her underwear an actual prostitute would probably remove all of her clothes one of the professions five gets but it isnt buddy thats being teased we are as the film concludes we find that there are far deeper human emotions and motivations in play a tease doesnt work unless it actually delivers britney does so does you are alone
