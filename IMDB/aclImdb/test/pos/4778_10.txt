steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking this is because it was the first sound cartoon while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928br br now if this were just an important historical film it would be worth seeingespecially to lovers of animation however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is while mickey and minnie behave a bit odd compared to the characters we have grown to love thanks mostly to the kooky mind and talent of animator ub iwerks there is an infectious charm about the film its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years
