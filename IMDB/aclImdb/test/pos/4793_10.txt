the topic of religion in buñuel films is a point that one as an eater of films as an eater of art or as a person need to analyze hardly one can see to a satirical buñuel in la voie lactée un chien andalou or in lage dor is very hard and effective in its critic but when you have seen this and then you see a movie like nazarin after you see this work you begin to be questioned about its author and much have questioned about what seems to be a contradiction for buñuel thinks but is better not called in this way i think that theres not any contradiction in its work only that buñuel religion point of view is very diverse as unique in filmsbr br this beautiful film is based on the novel of benito perez galdós which told us the story of father nazario who lived a humble simple life dedicated to god and to help everyone he lived in a simple and poor region there lived too beatriz who is an abused and abandoned wife she dont find any sense of her life without her violent macho man she have a kind of repulse to him in the other side is andara one of the towns prostitutes father nazario has been stolen again he blames to andaras cousin andara hear this and try to fight without success with the priest who dont believe in violence that night andara find that her cousin is actually a thief she have stole her bellboys andara fights with her cousin with terrible consequences with this andara search mercy from the priest nazario decides to help her knowing well that this could be against his church obviously this thing going to have some consequences since here nazario going to be a pilgrim without nothing even without shoes but with spirit and faith but andara and beatriz want to be with he and be like he to serve godbr br if is the sweetest buñuel film that i have seen so far is too the most spiritual is clear here that the thing that most confuse people with the contradiction is that here we dont see a buñuel against the power of church we see a buñuel whose film is about church but not in the typical  and great  satirical way whethever like it is i dont think that the right word is contradiction actually i find it pleasant and well done and in spite of contain such religious issues as his voie lactée i found it more a spiritual film but that dont try to touch in diversity the catholic religion as maybe he touch and laugh of it in another films nazarin is of father nazario and its perspective front god and the same religion but all of this is at the end analyzed in the spiritual life of this manbr br the other two women are not a contrast but as very well another two perspectives of faith first we have beatriz the mistreated woman that lose all the faith in life first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family this little girl was very sick at side of her was too andara the prostitute who run of the justice in the family of the child just religious women there a big pain but faith becomes in father nazario when he arrives with nothing to this town he bless the child a say later she is fine the priest want go on walking but beatriz and andara have recovered the faith in life and want to dedicate their lives to god with father nazario after some complains father nazario decide to be with them discovering with some things until the end how he feels about faith god religion and the person in necessity the people who must request to charity to survive this last issue then must be noted as one possible explanation for the pineapple ending this ending we listen the drums similar to that in lage dor and a father nazario walking over asking about this things when he refuse the fruit at the first time and at the end decide to receive it as a symbol of necessity or maybe as an answer for its spiritual road that begin being priest meanwhile the two women must take away of the father andara for its crime beautiful scene where she thanks a man who helps father nazario in jail and then she damn the man who hit the priest in jail and beatriz because she prefer be with her macho man in spite that he treat her bad just because she dont accept that she fall in loved with the priest father nazario  and here is maybe the unique place in film to critic church walk to contradict the church the religion that he servesbr br father nazario is that then is a soft for much but not for me critic for some thing in religion father nazario helping a women who is guilty of a crime of a sin but most of all is one of buñuel analysis of faith and life and he really got it with a beautiful tender sweet and unforgettable film that is without a doubt one of his bestbr br sorry for the mistakeswell if there any
