i love the absurdity and biting humor of bu単uels surrealist films such as the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie and the exterminating angel to name two other earlier works like the forgotten ones about juvenile delinquents from a marginal neighborhood in mexico are more serious and provide a strong social messagebr br however i believe it is nazarin which most successfully shoots for the heart of the viewer while its true that its brimming with irony it nevertheless reveals an aspect of bu単uel which would appear to be intrigued by the beauty and solemnity of the spiritual quest here while the director quite typically throws countless jabs at the catholic church he also appears to show surprisingly a sense of admiration for genuine christian thought and its practice of selfless lovebr br what luis bu単uel unabashedly praising a jesuslike figure i always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtue that is until i watched nazarin my appreciation is that he satirically exposes the difficulty of following christs example in a society infested with meanness ignorance and sin but he also presents the hero father nazario as quite the beacon of light amidst a sea of darkness without a doubt by the end of the film i was looking up to him and not down on him br br some would argue that father nazarios doubts regarding his faith point to the loss of his saintly values alas if he cant do good in this world who can but i would say that this flaw his frustration precisely makes his character all the more heroic because it shows how human he is and how challenging his struggle within must be and who says the priest couldnt eventually emerge from that dark night and regain his confidence perhaps weve only been presented with a difficult part of his spiritual journey the elegant open ending in which he desperately accepts the fruit offered by a female stranger allows us to imagine ourselves the final outcome of the storybr br i recognize in bu単uel the aggressive selfprofessed atheist endowed with brilliant wit and social consciousness but after having watched nazarin i also sense from him a certain warmth a depth and maturity thats not so evident in his other workbr br for the sake of contrast i strongly recommend watching afterward his short film simon of the desert also made in mexico several years later it deals with a similar subject matter  the abandonment of the ego in the face of temptation  only it does so in a hysterically funny and totally irreverent style
