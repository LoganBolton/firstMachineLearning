this movie is a fascinating example of luis bunuels storytelling abilities this is a comedy that is not a comedy and a social drama that is not a social drama even though i dont think it was particularly funny it made me laugh also despite the fact that you can never take bunuel too seriously the movie made think about religion and its importance in some peoples lives bunuel tells the story of a catholic priest devoted to his faith like no one else and the viewer witness what happens when the priests undying commitment to serve others is put to test as usual bunuels target is catholicism but i dont think he tried to mock the church as he often does at least i didnt take the film as a mockery of the institution i think he is trying to make an interesting point about how religion could be a nuisance in todays modern society not because faith in itself is bad but because people always mange to bastardize the concept message aside i think this is one of bunuels most clever works francisco rabal is superb as the priest definitely one of the filmmakers best movies
