running out of time is probably as close to a perfect film as youre ever likely to see out of hong kong all the elements click a terrific script by french writers julien carbon and laurent courtiaud that even manages to subvert the odd cliché reliably imaginative direction by johnnie to and excellent central performances by andy lau and lau ching wan the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody especially in his exasperated reactions to his superiors abysmal negotiating skills the supporting cast is fine too with yo yo mung making a strong impression in a tiny role and even the often histrionic waise lee looking remarkably and very aptly like a bald andy lau reining it in to good effect its best not to know too much about the plot going in beyond the basic setup  with only a few weeks to live lau engages in a criminal game with wans cop with no easily apparent motive  and just sit back and enjoy the ride its certainly worth the fare it also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies and played in a mere three scenes the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of filmmaking ive seen in ages theres also a fine score by raymond wong as well the most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years
