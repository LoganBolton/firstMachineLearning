andy lau and lau chingwan are both superb in johnny tos tautly directed crime thriller which puts most western efforts to shame think of it as the hong kong heat only better everything about the film screams class from the performances to the soundtrack the cinematography to the script the tone remains serious throughout but the film has a nice line in blackhumour friendship and romance at its heart sure it gets a little preposterous later on but it would be a hardhearted viewer who didnt find something to love about this movie thank god hollywood hasnt yet remade and ruined a classic do yourself a favour and see this film
