the world is going to miss john frankenheimer this was his first feature film and it was four years before he directed his second but dont let that dissuade you from seeking it out frankenheimers direction is assured and he gets some compelling performances out of his castbr br someone else has already pointed them out but i also want to talk up james gregory and whit bissell in two key supporting roles both would work for frankenheimer again  gregory most notably as the bumbling senator in the manchurian candidate  and they do good work for him herebr br if the whole thing seems too simple in the end thats merely because frankenheimer and writer robert dozier chose to tell a simple story and they do it well keep a lookout for it  turner classic movies just might show it again
