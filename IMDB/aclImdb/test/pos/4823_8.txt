i honestly found wicked little things to be a very cool and fun horror filmmy friend had given this to me and i really saw it as nothing but a crappy low class gory horror filmthen after i watched this i was wrong it was very cool and very good and while ill say it seemed a bit unnecessary at times and while it may not be the best horror film ever its still goodi thought the acting was very good especially from the girl who plays the mothershe seemed very believable and to me very likableand while it is a little clich√©e and over the top its goodoverall i gotta say if the afterdark horror fest films are not your style then you should have no business watching this but if you like horror films or a wicked little time than check out wicked little things 80 out of 10 stars
