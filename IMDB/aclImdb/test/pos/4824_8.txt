i saw part of this film on the scifi channel but missed the ending i bought the dvd to see the whole movie and im glad i didbr br a young mother and her two daughters move into a house out in a backwoods area that they inherited from the husband who died from an illness its very run down but the three women make the best of it the teen daughter scout taylorcompton is warned by a local boy about the zombies that come out at night she ignores him but since he has a cute friend she joins his group meanwhile the younger daughter chloe grace moretz makes a friend in a zombie girl her age named mary it turns out that mary and several other kids died in a mine in 1913 while working as child labor now that they are zombies they attack and kill anyone whos not a blood relative br br this movie was directed by js cardone whose previous films include the slayer 1981 and shadowzone 1990 two movies i didnt like in the slightest bit this is why i was surprised that i actually enjoyed this movie the film is deliberately paced which i liked this allows you to get to know the main characters most of whom are likable child zombies have been used at least since george romeros 1968 classic night of the living dead still i found the toolusing child zombies in this movie interesting it would seem that cardone finally found the right script and cast only the stereotypical scenes of the teens smoking drinking and making out in a parked car were boring to mebr br taylorcompton also appears in the halloween remake moretz appeared in the amityville horror 2005 and the horror film room 6 2006
