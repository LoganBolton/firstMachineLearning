this work is pretty atmospheric with a couple of surprises a few really creepy elements i found this work more rewarding than i first expected given the rotten reviews this receives here at imdb the dialog comes across as natural and honest given the circumstances although the overall run of the film goes from predictable to cliché with the heroines falling down when they should be running and investigating strange noises when they should be locking their doors typical horror movie farebr br the local characters are some of the worst clichés depicting appalachian natives as inbred developmentally challenged freaks the characters of the children and the principals are great the development given is adequate and scout taylorcompton seems to be developing her talents quite wellbr br now im not going to say that this is entirely original or the best thing since sliced bread which isnt all that great by the way but this is interesting and i do not long for my 107 minutes back i would not say this is an awesome movie by any means but there are some really good horror elements herein but there are also some really slow spots where plotcharacter development seem superfluous to the directors or the film editors whimbr br all in all this is good for a rainy night but not so good for a fridaysaturday nights viewingbr br it rates a 7610 frombr br the fiend
