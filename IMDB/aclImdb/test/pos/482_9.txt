there are times i am convinced that the mikado is the best sullivan  gilbert opera ever but that is only so long as im not listening to iolanthe be that as it may the mikado is probably the most frequently filmed of the savoy operas yes i put the composer first nobody says hammerstein and rodgers or hart and rodgers or boito and verdi or whatshisface and strauss you dont even hear the names of librettists for offenbach suppe or balfe gilbert was just the bigger name and the bigger ego at the time so they put his name first its time that silly practice was put to restbr br anyway the mikado is a compleat sg operetta it has some of sullivans catchiest numbers combined with some of gilberts cleverest lyrics it has an interesting book and sprightly dialogue its got a wonderful degree of craziness and it leaves the door wide open for elaborate and whimsical costumingbr br this particular production filmed in a live performance in 1990 turns its imagination toward striking simplicity set in a british seaside resort toward the end of the art nouveau period it throws over the japonerie of the original entirely the result is costuming and setting in an eyecaressing medley of whites grey and blacks accented by occasional bits of red and less frequent uses of yellow and green it takes some getting used to but its really spiffy of course when the chorus tells you they are gentlemen of japan you would be right to exclaim oh pooh bah did i just say that its most gratifying that this fine production is now on dvd however one caveat the print seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and ever so slightly fuzzy the tendency to superimpose images is alas annoying why do people who are doing a really spiffy production want to muck it up with artsyfartsy stuff of that sort but its the performance that counts the most we may skip the overture since although one is performed sullivan never wrote one true it may be so he wrote none for any of the savoys but the mikado overture doesnt even date from sullivans lifetime and was compiled by observing the techniques used in the others as for the rest of the operetta its firstrate and supremely funnybr br the koko here is the estimable eric idle who does it credit there is a tradition of bringing a big name into the role the was a us tv production years ago in which koko was played by groucho marx with mixed results idles performance is delightfully quirky  he does taken from a county jail assisted by a tennis racquet his ive got a little list is done as a speech to a microphone  of course it has the usual updated lyrics which are much funnier than the usual run of such things and his delivery is positively hysterical it goes on that way throughoutbr br in this operetta its important to have a good katisha its just no fun if youre not being bellowed at in style this mikado has a fabulous katisha in felicity palmer in her way almost as big a name as idle she bellows with the best of them in a wonderful rich contralto  wonderful especially for a soprano and her costume not to mention her recital with franz liszt apparently accompanying nankipoo is played by bonaventura bottone i have trouble getting around is somewhat unnankipooish chubby shortness  but is voice is undeniably a solid rich addition to the vocal palette there is a nice touch during a wandring minstrel where the chorus reacts with distaste to the mention of his nancy on his knee  bear in mind the mikados decree about flirting be that as it may bottone is a fine singing actor and if his appearance doesnt put the best face on nankipoo his performance doesbr br yumyum lesley garett and her friends are appropriately pretty and silly she and bottone do lovely duets pishtush mark richardson plays his persona as something a blageur and does it very well poo bah richard van allan is wonderful as a stuffed shirt out of water  a role later done to death in american sitcoms you know haughty butlers forced to cater to bratty children  that sort of thing the mikado richard angas is bloody marvelous with an imperious voice at absolute variance with his ridiculous lyricsbr br i dont recommend you get this as your only mikado get a good traditional production as well so you can see what gilbert intended more or less in terms of staging that being said ill watch this one twice while viewing any traditional bit once on the whole this is a terrific offering a vocal and visual delight with delicious overacting its a dvd to treasure with dervishlike maids tapdancing bellhops and all watch for the bellhops with signs
