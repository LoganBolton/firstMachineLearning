well never see this movie broadcast by hbo in the near future if at all if anyone somehow comes across it in a video store just grab it before someone else does because i doubt if it ever will be rereleased again br br an unbelievable and timely movie about the first attack on the world trade center on february 26 1993 and how the government agencies whos job it is to identify and stop terrorists from doing harm and damage to american citizens and american property completely fell down on the job and unwittingly allowed it to happenbr br bone chilling since we all know now that the terrorists who were apprehended at the end of the movie werent going to be the end of our nightmare that resurfaced on september 11 2001 br br the film brought out everything that went wrong back in 199293 that allowed that first tragedy at the wtc to happen still it took another eight years to realize that we should have learned from that first wtc attack to be more vigilant and ready to prevent the second and far more devastating assault on the world trade center to happen i found this movie harder to watch after the events of 911 then the video of the attacks of 911 themselves br br all i can say about this film is dont watch it alone the very ending itself is so powerful as well as prophetic that it would leave you in a state of shock in knowing what we know today and possibly in need to have someone whos with you but not watching the movie to call for medical attention
