being relatively young i didnt know how bad antisemitism was in brooklyn where my family is originally from this movie absolutely horrified me ive seen many movies about prejudice racism and antisemitism but this seemed to hit me harder than mostbr br this was definitely one of the best indie films ive ever seeni had to travel 45 minutes to see it and it was well worth it nearly everything about the movie was great sometimes it was a little slow but that didnt really bother me because the movie was very atmospheric it took place in the 40s and it really did look like it was the 40s the acting was greatwilliam h macy as always was wonderful so was laura dern and i was pleasantly surprised by meatloafs performance playing the vicious antisemite neighbor br br 910
