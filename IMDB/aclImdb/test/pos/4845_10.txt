without question film is a powerful medium more so now than ever before due to the accessibility of dvdvideo which gives the filmmaker the added assurance that his story or message is going to be seen by possibly millions of people use of this medium therefore attaches an innate responsibility to the artist inasmuch as film can be educational as well as entertaining which dictates that certain subjects should be approached accordingly and with a corresponding sensitivity and sensibility a film like spielbergs schindlers list for example is important in that it keeps alive the memory of that which must not be forgotten and as history tends to repeat itself spielbergs film can be viewed as a valuable tool in preventing a recurrence of that tragedy in that same vein this film focus directed by neal slavin is important in it illuminates the problematic reality of antisemitism which for years beyond number has affected millions of people is still unimaginably prevalent today and like any manifestation of bigotry will perpetuate itself if left unchecked or ignored born of a xenophobic strain its a disease infecting society which unabated could be terminal and with its penetrating insights into the condition this film is an effective vaccine that just may at the very least help stem the proliferation of it and hopefully may act as a step toward eradicating it altogetherbr br lawrence newman william h macy served his country in the great war and has since lived a quiet conventional life in new york hes had the same job as a personnel director for some twenty years and owns the house located in an average middleclass neighborhood in which he lives with his mother kay hawtrey lawrence is the kind of guy who gets by just fine by minding his own business and refusing to involve himself with matters that are not he feels his concernbr br all of that is about to change however as with the advent of world war 2 lawrence along with the owner of the corner market mr finkelstein david paymer inexplicably finds himself a target of the neighborhood xenophobes who have aligned themselves with the union crusaders a national organization currently taken to channeling their fears and hatred upon jews or anyone who even looks like a jew and suddenly lawrence finds that he can no longer just stand on the sidelines and watch the game being played because now he is the game whether he wants to be or notbr br working from an intelligent well written screenplay by kendrew lascelles which he adapted from arthur millers novel slavin presents a chilling scenario that incisively examines the effects of bigotry upon those against whom it is leveled and when one considers the fact that this is not merely a hypothetical situation but a depiction of reality it becomes all the more disquieting even unnerving and what makes the film so effective is slavins obvious grasp of his subject and his studied presentation which is thoughtprovoking in its subtlety in the opening scene slavin establishes lawrences character and very soon afterward reaffirms it in another scene which affords the audience the opportunity to observe and assimilate how lawrences mind actually works the thought processes that direct his life with that in place then slavin is able to take his audience along with lawrence as his problems gradually begin to unfold by so doing he effectively illustrates how the problem evolves rather than merely stating the problem and addressing it head on which heightens the viewers emotional involvement and ultimately enhances the impact of the film br br slavin makes an important statement with this film which is not only an indictment of bigotry but carries a cautionary message about apathy as well and to his credit he never hits you over the head with it or engages in subjective fingerpointing to make his case instead he proceeds carefully taking great pains to be as objective as possible with all that he is submitting for your consideration his approach is that of a cinematic diplomat and its an approach that serves slavin and his film quite wellbr br as lawrence william h macy one of the best character actors in the business gives an amazing performance establishing the credibility and believability of his character with a sensitive honest and introspective portrayal he never attempts to circumvent the personal flaws of lawrences nature but uses them instead to create a character that is decidedly threedimensional which not only makes him convincing but serves to reaffirm the integrity of the portrayal what makes it so compelling is macys ability to convey the process by which he examines his own conscience which successfully enables the viewer to share in the experience of his personal epiphany in the final analysis its the strength of macys performance more than anything else that makes this film so significantly distinct br br another of the films strengths is the performance turned in by laura dern as gertrude hart a portrayal that effectively complements macys work as well as that of slavin dern lends tremendous substance to her character capturing her physically as well as emotionally and her colorful zeal crates a striking contrast to lawrences reserve that works extremely well for her character as well as the film itselfbr br and just as sean combs recently in monsters ball made a good case against dismissing outofhand the acting endeavors of an established rock star meat loaf aday gives a powerful performance here as fred lawrences nextdoor neighbor it demonstrates too that a true artist will produce regardless of the kind of canvas hes given to work withbr br the supporting cast includes michael copeman carlson kenneth welsh father crighton joseph ziegler gargan and arlene meadows mrs dewitt the kind of film that makes a filmmaker proud of his craft focus offers a memorable experience that hopefully will prove to be enlightening as well to those unaware that such conditions have existed and still do even in this the land of the free 1010 br br  br br
