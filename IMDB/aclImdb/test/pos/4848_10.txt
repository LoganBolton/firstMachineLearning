i had to call my mother a wasp to ask her about this was it really that bad in the 40s in new york surprise she couldnt remember so i told her to see the movie arthur miller in not a screen play but a novel for a change was 30 when he wrote this in 1945 it is a painful depiction of antisemitism yet oddly enough there is a tender story of human relationships finkelstein the jew with newman the nonjew primarily underlying the cruel story the acting is competent and the cinematography is very goodbr br the only reason i can think of for this not making it big in the theatre is that its aaagh controversialbr br i actually give it ten of ten maybe a bit high but its so worth seeing
