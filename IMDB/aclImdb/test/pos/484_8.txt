i really enjoy this particular production of the mikado the producers added a few touches throughout to make it more amusing for modern audiences  for instance as some day it may happen the little list song is completely updated and a few lines are adlibbed throughout the play liberties were also taken with the setting the costumes are not japanese but rather 1920s english although some of the tittipudlian girls wear 20sinspired kimonos this production is wellchoreographed with some 1920s dance styles and there are some extra dancing maids and bellhops to keep your eyes as well as ears entertained during the songs if youre a gilbert  sullivan purist these changes may bother you but i think theyre fine  and i love the costumes br br felicity palmer katisha is absolutely hilarious all of her scenes make me laugh out loud one of my favorite addons is when she first makes an entrance  the dancing bellhops annoy her with their antics so she screeches at the top of her voice stop it all of the other main characters do a fine job as well i particularly like mark richardson as pishtush that toupee and lesley garrett as yumyumbr br you must keep in mind that this is a stage production being filmed and set your expectations accordingly there is no change of setting although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest if there is one drawback to this production it is that the stage makeup wasnt modified for closeup shots with a camera foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner lipstick and blush everywhere ive seen this sort of thing happen before with films of plays and its a little jarring at first however i hope youll get used to it and enjoy the mikado for what its worth  a thoroughly enjoyable rendition of a classic
