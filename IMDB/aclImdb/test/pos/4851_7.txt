im a huge fan of legendary director elia kazan  his movies often deal with people trying to overcome their weaknesses be it obsessive love in splendor in the grass poverty in a tree grows in brooklyn or racism in gentlemens agreement while looking for other movies made by kazan i stumbled across a movie that was based on a novel by arthur miller the movie called focus stars william hmacy who happens to be one of my favorite actors and laura dern it deals with antisemitism in a very realistic way br br macys character seems to go along with the bigots in his neighborhood and on his job until it affects him personally thats the key here the reason he acted wasnt because he knew it was wrong and he wanted to take a stand he acted because he was now considered an outsider and he began to experience the same looks the same remarks and the same brutally that mr finklestein david pamyersexperienced br br the movie is very well written and well acted meat loaf does a awesome job of playing a dirt bag both macy and derns performances are outstanding its easier in life to go along with instead of going against sometimes in order for people to take a stand things have to impact their lives or the lives of their loved onesonly then will some find their moral compass
