the essential message  one which miller would have surely intended after seeing vichy war crimes trials  is that hatred of somebody without rational basis is a waste of life meat loafs character fred has known lawrence for many years and yet when the time comes at the bidding of his fanatical supporters he allows them to attack a man who is not part of their target group for me this is the crucial message  it doesnt matter what lawrence and his wife do from this point onwards  they are marked and have chance to save themselves by using reason animal aggression and anger have blinded freds union thugs to realitybr br a friend of mine suggested i should see the wave to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without them realising it i once conducted an experiment in a roleplaying game and was shocked to see how normal and levelheaded people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state  which would ultimate threaten them all  because it crept in in stagesbr br fred is the start his la friends and preacher idol are the catalyst which pushes his neighbours over the edge into violence without stopping to think that what they are doing in wrongbr br the relationship between lawrence and finkelstein the jewish shopkeeper is a fascinating one because lawrence misses the point almost until the end if the bigots force finkelstein out where is he to go if his family have fled the nazis what an irony to be tormented again in the land of freedombr br that big poster its a fairly famous propaganda piece about american families enjoying the highest standard of living in the world is a very important detail when you see this film watch for the grafitti on the subway train and all the little posters the message lurks there toobr br this movie should be on the curriculum of every school especially in our time when baseless hatred is being promoted so widely by reasonable people who are just extremists in thin disguises
