first they came for the communists and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a communist then they came for the jews and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a jew then they came for the catholics and i didnt speak up because i was a protestant then they came for me and by that time there was no one left to speak up for mebr br attributed to rev martin niemoller 1945br br when faced with intolerance or injustice the easiest thing to do is nothing  speak up and you risk becoming an object of scorn but when does enough become too much global antisemitic sentiments allowed hitlers genocidal policies to thrive and equal doses of fearmongering and ignorance made it possible for the anticommunist purges of mccarthyism to destroy thousands of peoples lives inaction makes one no less culpablebr br lawrence newman is a chameleon of a man quiet and nondescript he blends seamlessly with his surroundings lawrence doesnt like to get involved  when he witnesses an attack on a young woman he tells no one and goes about his business his world spirals into chaos when he buys a pair of glasses and is mistaken for one of them lawrences view of the world and its view of him is forever altered br br while the subject matter of this film is not new its presentation is definitely unique it is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice when placed within a certain context  lawrence is more concerned with the assumptions that he is jewish than he is with the views of his attackers he believes that if he corrects this oversight that everything will be all right not realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand br br whether playing a schemer the only thing i liked about fargo or a down home nice guy sheriff william h macys roles are linked by a common thread his characters share a subtle deliberate countenance that gives them substance macy nails lawrence down to the smallest detail and says more with a furtive glance or tremble in his voice than a page of dialogue by showing rather than telling lawrence is able to share his fear and bewilderment with the viewer the supporting cast brings the story togetherbr br laura dern is compelling as gerty lawrences bombshell wife with a past trailer park rough yet other worldly wise she has also felt the wrath of prejudice as the result of a mistake and unwittingly exacerbates lawrences situation michael lee aday aka meatloaf is frightening as fred the prototypical redneck next door equal parts ignorance and venom rallying neighbours to his virulent cause in the midst of the chaos is finklestein david paymer the focus of the aggression and the voice of reason that raises the important questions paymers even handed portrayal keeps finklestein from becoming a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to engender sympathy making his one of the strongest performances in the filmbr br the tight editing and closecropped cinematography make for a clean picture with few distractions and mixes an air of claustrophobia in with the small town usa feel  it is simultaneously comforting and disturbing the deliberate use of harsh twotone lighting to accentuate the malevolent aspects of the piece and the carefully scored soundtrack are powerful without being overwhelming finally the set and costume designs recreate the feel of the era an essential component in the films messagebr br focus unconventional approach in dealing with prejudice is reason enough to recommend this film just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses
