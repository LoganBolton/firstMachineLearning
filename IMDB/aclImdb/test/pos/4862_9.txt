cleopatra 2525 is a very funny entertaining show you shouldnt take all the show seriously but if you wanna have fun thats your tv show being made by the producers of xena is a quality guarantee and cleopatra 2525 isnt that different from xena the female warriors formula is brought to the future where they dont have to fight warriors or gods but dangerous robots which dwell in the surface and the humans are forced to live underground along the two seasons of cleopatra they develop an interesting and funny underground world and we get to know the three main characters cleopatra jennifer sky hel gina torres and sarge victoria pratt they all are different but as a team they work really well the three main actresses appeared previously in xena like most of the regularguest cast there are some known faces from hercules too or from both shows i specially liked the character played by danielle cormack ephiny in xena which is very different from any of her roles i previously knew so if you liked xena and hercules youll love cleopatra 2525 if you dont know them try it im sure youll enjoy it
