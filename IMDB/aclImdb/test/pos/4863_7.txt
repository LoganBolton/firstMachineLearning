there are moments when you dont want those deep dramaseries when you dont want series with heavy stories or a must to watch every single episode to be able to hang on there are moments when you just want to watch a simple series with lots of action and cool characters for those moments you have cleopatra 2525br br i was one of those who actually enjoyed charlies angels critics said it was to superficial and silly but the thing is thats the point people who cant relax and expected a serious movie hated it its exactly the same with cleopatra 2525 it is superficial it has silly and unrealistic characters and thats why i like it it isnt like any other seriesbr br the first season wasnt very good the character cleo was irritating and a little too much the story was a little lame and you didnt get to know the characters very much but hey they only had 20 minutes in every episodebr br in the last 56 episodes of cleopatra 2525 they finally gave the series full 40minutes length and it was here i started to love it the series finally started to grow into a very qualitative series too bad they had to cancel the series because the last episodes of cleopatra 2525 actually was very good i will never forget hel sarge and cleo unique characters that only the creators of xena could have created
