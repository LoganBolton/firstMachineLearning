i picked up a dvd at the 1Â€ discount having no idea what its about but at that price i cant resist in brief i was positively surprisedbr br so much that i did quite some research on the german dvd part 2 of a series of 3 episodes were recombined into two 85 minute parts and out of order here are my results based on wikipedias episode listbr br doomsday is in my boots  the voice final episode br br war of the machines is hel  high water 1 2  pod listener  juggernaut downbr br well what can i say underdressed girlies are of course interesting for older men i never watched charlies angels so much so i cant compare but the more i watched the less i looked out for bikini tops and their fillings instead the characters both m and f became more interesting i can imagine feminists have their fun with this too all in all maybe a guilty pleasure but a pleasure it was
