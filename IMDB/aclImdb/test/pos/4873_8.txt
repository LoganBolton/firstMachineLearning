remember that friend in college who always insisted you rent the weirdest movie possible this is the movie he would have made if hed had the chancebr br i wish i could tell you exactly what sea of dust was about it pretends to be the story of a doctor who gets sucked into weird goings on in the black forest he goes there to help but ends up being caught between two young women both of whom he seems to have a thing for but thats just scratching the surface this is the kind of movie where things just randomly happenand not nice thing people are constantly being whipped and stabbed theres a pair of creepy little girls who appear to have walked out of the shining tom savini is some kind of imaginary religious figure who decides he doesnt want to be imaginary anymore hes got a plan to take over the world by sharing jesus sufferingbr br on some level this is a movie about sex its one without nudity which was a disappointment but theres no mistaking the intent on another whole level its a stoners paradise unexpected stuff happens so often that it stops being unexpected by the time the doctor travels through his girlfriends birth canal to be reborn youll just chalk it up to the crazy nature of the flickbr br on the down side the film is pretty wordy some of the points are hammered home over and over if youre watching it with a bunch of stoned friends this might prove an asset
