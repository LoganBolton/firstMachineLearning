i watched sea of dust at the rhode island horror film festival in providence it was the festivals featured film and won best picture out of i think a couple hundred entries the director and a few of the stars answered questions after the showing one star suzy lorraine was even hotter in person than in the film and she was an eye catcher in the moviebr br this film is independent yet it has a lot of cinematic touches that give it a quality feel it even has an original classical style musical scorebr br i am a savini fan and hes the star villain here in black cape hes more of an evil force than a real person i think he is sucking the souls out of people and using them as soldiers in a twisted attempt to establish his version of the kingdom of god on earth in his view christ was all about suffering and savini intends to make everyone sufferbr br the main story line that holds your interest is about a young doctor stefan who is sent to investigate the strange events savini is causing in an isolated town he proposes to an aristocrat chick on the way but her sob father tells him to get lost then he meets up with a strangely possessed but alluring country girl i think she falls in love with him but she also tries to kill him as do a number of hot women in the filmbr br i found the scenes shot in the woods to be the creepiest and most eye catching with strange people along the road the evil little twin girls scared the hell out of mebr br the film has a lot to it too much to list there is a lot of blood torture and gore hot chicks licking blood off of guys fingers a terrified girls head explodes that was unexpected throats get slit some brutal stabbingsbr br then they play it for laughs sometimes poking a bit of fun at the whole evil black forest genrebr br if youre a fan of hammer films and ingrid pitt it is fascinating to see her in this movie she offs one of the leads by plunging a cross in his skull excellent the guy who played multiple miggs in silence of the lambs is great in an axe fightbr br the movie is surreal and with the ending im not sure the events happened or if they were in stefans head because of his rejection by his wouldbe fianc√©e he returns in vengeance and that scene is brutalbr br the director also talked about the theme of religion being misused to back wars and killings i can see that for sure savinis view of religion was scarybr br this was a strangely exceptional movie with some stars like savini and pitt a lot of good supporting cast including hot babes great gore scenes action and all the time youre wondering what the hell is going on and what is going to happen nextbr br this deserves ten stars because its an excellent independent film effort i dont think it was low budget but it had to be way less than a big studio budget and yet they managed to make something really attractive unique and thought provoking
