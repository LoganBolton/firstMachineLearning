i saw sea of dust as part of a nyc screening audience several years ago i enjoyed the film at that time so i was a little confused by some of the amendments that had been made since perhaps its my memory but there seemed to be chunks of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the rhode island film festival im really not sure which version i prefer but i can honestly say that i found something to appreciate it bothbr br let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie although its been promoted as a hammer films tribute people expecting a showdown between van helsing and dracula are going to be sorely disappointed theres some cleavage but no nudity a staple of the british production houses later movies and while sea of dust is filled with gorgeous eye candy it really is shot like a sixties film and features hammer starlet ingrid pitt its not like any of the companys pictures in tone or execution this film is very dark very confusing and at times very funny i dont remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one but thats not a bad thing especially the showdown in the black forest that plays like a three stooges short and some of ms pitts rantings are quite entertaining its like somebody wound her up and turned her loosebr br the uniqueness of this film doesnt lie with the borrowed details though its in the ideas as an occasional sci fi channel viewer ive regularly taken the network to task for its onenote variations on a theme cgi monster kills then gets destroyed sea of dust is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a whilebr br but dont get me wrong im not complaining if anything i applaud these guys for making such an enterprising lowbudget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts its not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movies you know who you are but for the rest of us those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films the predictability the lack of respect for the audience this may just be your ticket
