there i was on vacation when my host suggested we take in this bmovie festival in breda i was resistant as i hadnt gone on the trip to sit in a movie theater but ive got to admit that i dont regret a second of this one especially with stephen malkmus contribution it probably helped that i had no idea what to expectbr br sea of dust starts out like a typical costume drama weve got a young medical student going to help a doctor whose town is being destroyed by a crazy plague which somehow involves exploding heads on the way he stops to visit his fianc√© and gets thrown off the property by her father traveling on he finds a girl lying on the road another plague victim and takes her along to the doctors yawn i thought it all seemed pretty predicablebr br and then everything went crazy and it suddenly turned into a completely different film tom savini shows up looking like dracula characters begin traveling to the other side of reality and the dialog gets increasingly humorousbr br and just when i thought it had settled into a groove the picture changes again becoming really dark and bizarre i wont spoil it for first time viewers but theres an amazing sequence about hollow people lots of chat about the abuse of religion by society and some overthetop gore effects and did i mention stephen malkmus this isnt a perfect movie in case you havent figured that out from its appearance at a bmovie festival but its well worth the time for adventurous viewers great visuals cool soundtrack lots of interesting ideas the acting is a little zany at times but i think thats the pointbr br funny i had to go to breda to see find an american picture that looked like a british horror movie you figure that one out
