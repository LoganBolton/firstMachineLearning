im not into reality shows that much but this one is exceptional because at the end the viewer gets something useful out of it besides entertainment i dont have children but supernannys lessons will be a great help when and if i ever do my only complaint is that the show has been watered down since it has been in the us i prefer the british version with the sterner nanny approach is it just me or does anyone else find the us version to be a bit soft now its the kinder gentler nanny i guess we yanks need a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down after all still nothing wrong with a sappy happy ending is there
