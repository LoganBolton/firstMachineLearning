having only seen five episodes of the show before this ive been watching the repeats on bbc two i havent really had much experience of the league but as a fledgling fan as well as a massive fan of british comedy i can say this film is hilarious seeing herr lipp who i had not seen on screen before the film briss and geoff on the big screen was a great comedy experience being on screen is something that the league take full advantage of with heads blowing up itll come as a surprise who it is and gruesome murders with random middle ages style battles all the waybr br geoff is easily the funniest character of the three protagonists in this film because he has the best one liners and overall behaviour just like in the series one of my only disappointments with the film was not hearing geoff shout well now ive got this gun even once even though there is a buildup to it in one part of the film the film itself overall is to use the phrase everyone else does pythonesque and its very reminiscent of films like life of brian appearances from tubbs and edward were welcome but papa lazarous line hello daves cracked me up more than anything said by them lazarous probably my favourite vasey character after tubbs and edward its got quite a poignant ending with one of the main character being killed off and i can only hope this is not the leagues last onscreen vasey venture with gatiss mentioning the possibility of another series or film im now very excited this is a film i will see again partly because the projector died towards the end leaving out 10 minutes or so of the film but mainly because its inventive and hilarious im not really bothered if its not as good as the tv series because i loved itbr br one thing though if youve never seen the league youll still love it but dave knows what youll think about the people who make this stuff up as tubbs or edward might put it its a local film for local people and a precious thing at thatbr br  out of  45
