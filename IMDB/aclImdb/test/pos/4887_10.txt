okay im not sure if this counts as a spoiler so i just ticked the box anyway to save the hasslebr br ive noticed that the opinions on this film seem to be a fair split personally i loved it although i must say that i think that some of the cameos were there for the sake of having a cameo peter kay personally i am just thankful that it wasnt the edward tubbs and papa lazarou show and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to headline the motion picture especially sir goeff tipps arguably the funniest of the bunchbr br actually this is less of a summary more of a fairly obtuse bloglike thing but what the hell the film was awesome and i guess thats all that counts
