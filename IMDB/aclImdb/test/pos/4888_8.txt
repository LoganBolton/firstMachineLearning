whether youre a fan of the series which inspired it or not theres no denying this is a patchy piece of work but in the best possible sense keen to get away from the trappings of old sitcoms which made an uneasy transition to the big screen messrs pemberton dyson shearmsith and gatiss have gone down a different road addressing the problems of dealing with their success along with adding other creations and inevitably rehashing some of their bestloved characters its a pity they didnt stick to just a more consistent league of gents movie because as inventive as including themselves in the screenplay is it weakens the finished movie well worth renting though
