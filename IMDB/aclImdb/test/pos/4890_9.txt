i originally watched this because i thought it was going to be the sequel to the league of extraordinary gentlemen and this movie is a whole different thing entirely going on herea comedy however i loved it anyways br br the league of gentlemen is apparently some british tv series with some rather odd characters and some sharp humour this is british comedy so it revolves around being very silly dressing up in costumes and making lots of fun of germans and french homosexual references in short its very very funnybr br the plot revolves around the writers of the tv show deciding to cancel some of the characters and the characters coming out of their dimension into the writers dimension to stop that from happening its a fun twist and theres plenty of great scenes in this idiotic adventure i laughed out loud numerous times and applauded the brazen style of humour this makes mr bean look like the watered down wimp he isrowan is much better in black adder series btwbr br this is not monty python but you can never escape the comparison when you are talking british humour and there are a few similarities but not so many as to keep it from being its own thing and being fresh it leans more towards the young ones and guest house paradiso in its comedic stylebr br if you liked this check out the young ones series and guest house paradiso movie and of course i assume the tv series league of gentlemen must be rather funny as well
