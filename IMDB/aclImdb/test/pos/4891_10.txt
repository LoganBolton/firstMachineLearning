as an american fan of the league of gentlemen i had to wait months to finally see this film when it came out on dvd but it was well worth the excruciating wait apocalypse is fantastic funny freaky clever as hell full of injokes and cryptic references to the television series basically everything youd expect from the gentlemenbr br the plot has already been discussed in other reviews so i wont bother recapping it although i will say when i first read it i was a bit hesitant obviously this device fictional characters entering the real world to confront their makers has been used before notably in wes cravens underrated new nightmare and stephen kings dark tower books where king himself was a character the gentlemen have fun breaking the fourth wall though and even add a new element a second fictional world them days soon all three realities have weaved together and the result is exhilarating geoff tipps being knighted in the middle ages and trying to court queen victoria wood the real league of gentlemen in royston vasey being confronted by characters like pauline and dr chinnery david warner summoning an homunculus outside of bernices church ive heard that some people disliked the kings evil subplot but i found it hilarious especially reeces character who seemed to be channeling judith the witch from series threebr br speaking of the characters i was relieved to find that although hilary briss geoff and herr lipp were planted firmly in at the films core other more familiar characters were given their due bernices confessional in the beginning was hilarious hearkening back to the quicker more sketchoriented feel of the first series pauline and mickey have cameos no ross though strange although i wouldve loved tove seen more of ms campbelljones papa lazarou is accounted for as are tubbs and edward all three are used very sparingly giving their meager screen time an almost magical feel and just what the hell did papa hack up like an obscene hairball according to the dvd commentary a wad of greasy pubic hairbr br the film looks incredible but then whats new the music as always is breathtaking i was thrilled to hear joby talbots new interpretations of the theme music and his slight reworking of the majestic lovely piece that closes out both apocalypse and the last episode of series threebr br i have some minor complaints it would have been nice to see more of the old familiar royston vasey and i felt the stopmotion creatures beautiful by the way were a bit underused both of these issues however can be justified by the films budget so theyre understandable still as much as i loved bernices new church it would have been cool to see the final battle in the high street the gentlemens original vision according to the commentarybr br overall apocalypse is astounding especially if youre a fan of the series i cant recommend it highly enough 1010
