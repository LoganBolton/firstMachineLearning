just saw the league of gentlemen apocalypse at a special screening in manchester with mark gatiss and reece shearsmith of the league in attendancebr br at the back was peter kay who has a brief cameo in the film affectionately heckling at the back during the q  a session after the filmbr br the film was complicated in a good way and very very funny it follows geoff tipps hilary briss and herr lipp as they try and save fictional rosyton vasey from the disinterest of their creatorsbr br the league play a wide range of their characters and themselves or character based on themselves and are ably supported by the cream of british character and comedy actors such as bernard hill victoria wood and david warnerbr br warner is a particular stand out reminding me of his smooth and cutting turn in time banditsbr br the film swims in and out of various realities and allows some of the denizens of rosyton vasey some space to grow beyond their usual limits of their comedy shtickbr br steve pembertons herr lipp has a great bretchian moment near the end of the movie and has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life which brings a lump to the throat at an unexpected moment and surprises you with its tender affection for the charactersbr br this echoes something mark and reece said in the q  a afterwards that the plot of the league being tired of their famous characters is spurious and that the whole film is really a love letter to thembr br for a format that started as a radio characterbased sketch show these guys have really evolved the idea so far as to sustain a movie which takes you on a journey through fiction reality comedy tragedy and a pleasing journey for two of the less obvious characters to carry a long form story from their 70 odd existing creationsbr br the fans of the show will love it it pays off dedication and attention to detail in spades the uninitiated may be a little lost but the joy of the log was always the ability to almost instantly tune into their acutely observed characters and take the stylistic leap into farce and expressionistic movie homagebr br there are homages a plenty in this one including the shining and la belle et la bete to name but two i spotted and they ably demonstrate their love for cinema and history with a segment in 1690s england that makes perfect sense when youre engaged with the moviebr br what can i say i marvelled boggled emoted and snickered throughout and they have definitely pulled off what many have failed at a successful british tv comedy to cinema translationbr br if youve watched and enjoyed the league of gentlemen in the past go see it you will enjoybr br if you havent rentbuy a dvd and then go see itbr br well done guys and thanks for the charming and humorous q  a
