there are two ways to turn a tv series into a filmbr br the first most common and least successful is to basically make a featurelength tv episode see the disasters of the steptoe  son movie the second is to do something else something quite different Ã  la monty pythonbr br thankfully the creators of the cult tv series have gone for the second option and theyve come up with something unique clever and funny it couldnt feel less like a tv episodebr br try to get your head around this the writers playing themselves are confronted by their royston vasey alteregos played of course by them and told to continue writing the series otherwise apocalypse will befall the villagebr br highconcept contrived and easy to screw up yes but somehow they managed to pull it off not for every taste perhaps and the ending does drag but fans will be delighted and it might even win over the uninitiated
