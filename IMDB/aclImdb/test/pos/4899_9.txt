the film was apparently spawned from an idea one of the writers had when he saw one of his creations in a supermarket the inhabitants of royston vasey head into our world to persuade the writers not to stop writing about them and thus destroy their worldbr br if that sounds a bit too serious dont be put off within the first few minutes we get bernice the vile female vicar letting rip at an unfortunate penitent during confession chinnery the vet who inadvertently destroys every animal he touches attempting to collect semen from a giraffe mickey thick beyond belief being ah thick and tubbs inbred sisterwife and local shopkeeper being sweet as ever  but still disgustingbr br some of the regular characters are missing but a new idea by the gents introduces some 16thcentury characters  and we have the gents themselves in the action too if youre new to the league of gentlemen this is an easy introduction and a lot of fun if youre a longstanding fan this has everything youve come to expect  including the joys of jeremy dyson spottingbr br all told its got the same faintly surreal humour thats the hallmark of the series plus some moments of quite touching introspection herr lipp for example maintains a gentle dignity on learning that hes regarded by his creators as a onejoke character while most of the characters stay as they are some develop in unexpected ways that are perfectly natural when they happenbr br this film is a swan song for royston vasey but its also a showcase for the gents who prove that gasp they can write other stuff  and it can be very funny but you knew that anyway
