although a womans story i found this still fairly interesting it is unusual in that is has three reallife sisters playing sisters in the movie i am referring to priscilla rosemary and lola lanebr br why national critics loved this movie was the presence of badboyrebel john garfield in their twisted liberaldominated minds allamerican characters are sickening but souron life poorattitude types like garfield played here are people they can identify with despite that this movie still has an overall feeling of goodness which is why i liked it some of the characters may have done stupid things but they good hearts whose heart was bigger than anns priscilla lane in here i agree with the imdb user comments critic in here who says this is priscillas film as much as the beloved not by me garfields br br with a director the caliber of michael curtiz the film is better than it might have been under someone else curtiz made sure no scene soapy or otherwise went on too longbr br in addition to the lane sisters and garfield we have claude rains who adds muchneeded humor to the story jeffrey lynn the main love interest of the girls gale page dick foran frank mchugh and mae robsonbr br apparently this movie must have been a hit because there were several spinoffs from it neither of them approaching this one in content and boxoffice success
