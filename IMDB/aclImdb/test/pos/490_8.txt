okay sure this movie is a bit on the hokey side its difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility dolph lundgren as the punisher anyone but this tries very hard ive never read the actual comic book but that doesnt really matter i suppose i judge a film mainly on its merits not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone elses idea unless its a film based on a true story that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy so why will i give this movie a fairly high rating because it tries it tries very hard in my book that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining filmbr br many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus it seems everybody has their take on vampire lore be it the cross the silver the garlic the aversion to sunlight whatever some of those ideas are included here the storyline is familiar a group of vampires conspire to take over the world with one person mainly standing in their way blade wesley snipes lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses who have slowly but surely moved into the world and share it with humankind for the most part the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them the vampires have even taken familiars people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being turnedbr br now that i think of it there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the roddy piper film they live a hidden enemy hidden group of people plotting against them the fight to save humankind all that is present in blade as wellbr br the acting isnt the best here snipes is at best only slightly better than some of his other roles nbushe wright a relative newcomer isnt too bad kris kristofferson is forgettable as blades sidekick hes to blade what chip is to the punisher stephen dorff does the best job of the whole cast here as the head vampire you just love to hatebr br i dont know but i just loved the special effects in this film from the bloodsoaked vampirestyle rave all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film the special effects arent half bad theres certainly enough blood and gore to go around but after all this is a vampire movie right the various shapes and sorts of weaponry blade uses are fairly unique and not generally used in contemporary action films snipes has more flair with a deckedout sword than he does with say a machine gun plus theres so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away unless of course you are indiana jonesbr br overall this isnt the best action film ever made but its not half bad either as a bonus the musical score  soundtrack are pretty cool too tell me in what other movies can you hear super drumnbass like source direct or photekbr br my rating 810
