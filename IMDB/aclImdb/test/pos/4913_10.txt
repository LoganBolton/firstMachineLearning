youve got to think along the lines of last tango in paris for this one because the mood and emotion runs along the same lines and maintains the same heights  the difference being that in this exceptional intense and torrid depiction of love among the ruins of a dostoyevskyian dispossessed the setting is a gaysubcultural milieu  perhaps even one that is set to vanish in time and not the equally arresting but heterosexual context of bertoluccis own filmbr br the last third of this film depicts a passionate love never seen in gay cinema to talk of pornography or gay selfeffacement misses the point and intelligence of this work this film though on first impression appears to take us into the familiar  often depicted underworld of gay streetlife then precedes to subvert the rules of this genre by exaggerating it to a superreal degree the result is a hypercharged emotional heightening  an exceptional strategy that elevates the drama to one of big universal themes and giant gesturesbr br this film snatches the high ground because of the brilliant performances by its actors notably a young jean hugues anglade and the directing a tour de force of cinema outstanding in ambition and its unceasing plummet into the depths of human emotion as a contribution to gay cinema this film conquers this difficult ground and makes it its own triumph
