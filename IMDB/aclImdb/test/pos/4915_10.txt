when this showed at the seattle intl film fest i was the only person standing and clapping and cheering the rest of the crowd booed or was silent it is a well played small film that reaches deep into the reality of a young gay mans humanity it is about a real man and does not play to the insipid hyperbuffed muscular gay paositive that passes for the genre of nonporn gay cinema and that is why so much of contemporary gay genre movies are so dull this movie is intense passsion and great tragedy the acting and directing and cinematography is fantastic it all keeps the film clastrophobic and tense and passionate dont miss this if you can find it
