i gave this show a chance because of jaleel white not for his urkel character but mainly for the sonic the hedgehog voice xd so anyway like i said i gave it a chance and i was very fond of it i never cared for the urkel character so i was pleased to see mr white in a role other than the eversoannoying nerd and his calvin j fraiser first called calvin but come the second episode everyone started calling him j was very entertaining and interestingbr br i think my favorite episode was when j was dating the excowboys cheerleader with the snobby kid dont you talk that way bout my momma this is grownup talk you stay down there the only beef i have is that the show was suppose to have 3 main characters but mr whites character always seemed to have the most attention and the other two who are married always had the back stories it isnt exactly a good thing when a story about those two possibly being pregnant takes backseat to j having to babysit his girlfriends dogbr br other than that i really wish this show could have lasted a little longer unfortunetely it seems that people werent interested in jaleel white as something other than the godawful annoying ass nerd known as urkelbr br hope they at least put it out as a dvd box set
