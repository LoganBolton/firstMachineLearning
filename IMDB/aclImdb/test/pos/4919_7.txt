to be honest fellow imdb reviewers i enjoyed this show a lot the reason well it didnt try to be more than it is i mean a sitcom with regular expectations with a well known and repeated plot funny and talented actors and clever jokes oriented for a post college audiencebr br this is what grown ups is all about trying to be mature but in a funny waybr br jaleel white is funny as always and delivers some witty and hilarious sex oriented jokes the humor is very 90s without taking in account the tendencies of the new millennium and thats the main reason in my opinion why the show didnt have success it got stuck in the 90sbr br oh and mrs ribisi was really funny and perkybr br my favorite show has to be the one that deals with karma biting the ass not a cult classic but im sure its part of regular early 2000s nostalgia
