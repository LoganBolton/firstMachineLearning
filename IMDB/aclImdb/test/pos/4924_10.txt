while not the first movie ive purchased for myself this is almost certainly the one ive watched the most the animation is welldrawn by the experts at tokyo movie shinsa and the animators frequently made use of clever techniques such as having the sun cause lens flare having the camera get soaked and having the camera operators hand clean the lens etc while the film avoided becoming a an animators gadgetfest the judicious but generous application of such techniques gave the film a much more realistic feel than the typical cartoonbr br the story has many interweaved plots which dont seem to have much to do with each other until everything comes together at the end in a manner even the writers selfeffacingly admit is contrived each of the major plot lines has its own musical theme ranging from pop goes the weasel hamton  plucky to the love theme from romeo and juliet fifi  johnny the transitions between plotlines are slightly varied but consistentbr br truly a wonderful film there isnt much original music though the new lyrics to spinning song are clever and enjoyable highly recommended
