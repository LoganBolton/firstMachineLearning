it is in the opinion of this reviewer that the best time to be a child was in the 1990s a period when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the airwaves the best producers of saturday morning animation were at warner brothers television who experienced a major golden age with the dreamteam of steven spielberg tom ruegger and paul dini along with serious and dark series like batman they also revived zany outlandish cartoons made famous by the looney tunes animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult humour and homages to the celluloid of yesteryear and today but tiny toon adventures was equally popular by reinventing the looney tunes for a new generation while still keeping that crazy cartoon violence and intelligent comedy that can hold onto any age group no matter how old even when the tiny toons were stretched to a featurelength with how i spent my vacation it did not feel like a longer episode of the television series a curse that so often plagues other featurelength adaptations of popular animated showsbr br the tiny toon gang are young offsprings of the classic cartoon characters who made audiences laugh back in the 1940s and 1950s and are currently learning cartoon comedy to earn their toon degree summer vacation has started and each character has their own idea of what to do buster bunny charles adler and babs bunny tress macneille start a water gun fight which ultimately leads to acme acres getting flooded and them both sailing down the mississippi plucky duck joe alaskey joins hamton pig don messick on a crosscountry car trip to the happiest theme park in the world but hamtons family proves to be more difficult than he imagined meanwhile in other stories scattered throughout elmyra duff cree summer tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze fifi le fume kath soucie attempts to go out on a date with her favourite skunk star and shirley the loon gail matthius goes to the cinema with a loudmouth fowlmouth rob paulenbr br while the premise sounds thin for a featurelength film the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work well together the best of these is pluckys unfortunate road trip which utilises a golden comedic opportunity very well feeling pity for somebody while also laughing at their predicament pluckys annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him are a perfect blend of script and animation all in the confines of a small car stuffed with pork elmyras story definitely ranks second just to see how a little almost innocent girl can cause fear into so many jungle animals the aforementioned cartoon violence definitely comes to the forefront with buster and babs story which makes us smile not only due to the hilarity of the outcomes but also nostalgically since ruegger and company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in that segment practically half of that segment plays as a parody and homage to deliverance including a clever twist on the dueling banjos scene featuring the unforgettable tiny toon adventures theme songbr br part of the universal appeal of the tiny toons is that the humour proves to be very intelligent as it targets subjects with a ferocity that proves that it does not at all deserve the title of childrens fare that people seem to slap it with an entire segment featuring fowlmouths poor etiquette at the cinema pokes fun at yappers in a noteperfect way along with an additional jab at lucasfilms thx logo that scene is done so perfectly that it should be featured before every cinema showing there are also a couple of moments that poke fun at disney world cinematic plot holes and even warners legal department the fact that todays cartoons are bland and uncreative makes those intelligent moments even more treasuring as there probably will not be another animated series that will come closebr br after watching how i spent my vacation for the first time in many years i can say with all certainty that they do not make cartoons quite like they used to with the ongoing censorship that todays family entertainment receive one wonders whether anything like this will ever be made again this review is not only a recommendation of a truly smart film but also a plea for spielberg ruegger and dini to team up again and bring forth a magical creation to our minds once again lord knows that the children of the twentyfirst century is in need for something with the intelligence of tiny toon adventures this is not a simple cashgrab it is a wonderful film with full of spirit madcap mayhem and hilarity
