how i spend my vacation puts closure to the television series that aired from 1990 to 1992 ive always enjoyed the series for what it is ive never compared the series to the looney tunes of the old days the video release was split up in four or five episodes i cant remember as im writing this for television and its included in the episode list of the series whats good about this series is that all the main characters of the show have a major role in the story we see what they all do during their summer vacation in different parts of the world elmyra is with his parents in a safari plucky and hampton crossing the country with hamptons parents fifi is in some beach etc the climax is very good and at the end all tiny toon characters reunite for the start of a new year in the looniversity thus practically ending the good run of this tv show
