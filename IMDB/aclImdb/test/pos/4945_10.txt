soul calibur is more solid than it ever was with the new character creation and the badass chronicle of the sword mode on the home versionbr br the arcade version is more complete even though the character roster is smaller than the home version this version is definitely the more pretty of the two eliminating all of the goofyunrealistic fighting styles found in the home version if you were in any way disappointed with the home version or perhaps thought it was too much you might find a much more likable and straight forward game of soul calibur in the arcade think you have what it takes to become a legend
