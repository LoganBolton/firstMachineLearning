iron eagle has always been one of my favirote films for a long time now it looks like topgun but with a different plot and a lot of people will disagree with me here in my view its better than topgunbr br this film has some amazing dogfight scenes when the fighter jets are zooming through the air it also has the queen song one vision thumping in the background which in my opinion is a fantastic songbr br to be honest iron eagle was very good but its sequels were rubbishbr br
