iron eagle may not be the most believable film plotwise but the characters are well written and very well acted if you cannot believe the characters the film is a flopbr br i believe the photography especially the aerial photography is superb i believe it is far superior to top gun to which it is endlessly compared it is one of the best pieces of aerial photography i have seen the soundtrack by basil paledouros forgive the spellingis great and juxtaposes well with the rock tunes i wish that portion of the soundtrack were availablebr br jason gedrick does well as the teenager who suddenly has to grow up in a rush and and the realities of life death and responsibilities lou gossett is fab as chappy both hardbitten and yet human as he recalls pilot deathsbr br there are lots of movies out there that you watch once and dont care to watch again then there are those movies that get you for one aspect or another and you can watch it again and again iron eagle is that kind of movie
