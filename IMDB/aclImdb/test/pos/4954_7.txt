maybe im biased because the f16 is my favorite fighter aircraft  although the f14 is probably second or third  but i liked this movie the sequels iron eagle ii and iii dont measure up acting and plot wise but the first one  along with top gun  have excellent flying and music along with reasonable plots and acting ii and iii clearly have much less of a flight budget but their main drawback is plot and acting i suspect the relative fame and popularity of iron eagle compared to top gun is almost entirely a reflection of the fame and popularity of jason gedrick compared to tom cruise another plus for me is an all too brief appearance by shawnee smith 710
