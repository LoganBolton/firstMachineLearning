i think that this movie is actually entertaining although it lacks some features essential for this kinda films first of all when doug and chappy start their mission they take off with f16b and during the combat scenes they are piloting f16a the second thing i dislike of this film is the everrepeating f16 rolling to its right to escape from missileswhy chaff and flares havent been shown in any movie yet third of all once you see the f16 almost empty of ammo it appears again plenty of missiles the models used to simulate the destroyed aircraft aint good either however i think that using iai kfir as opponent planes was really good far better than the f5 shown in top gun but this movie isnt as good as that masterpiecebr br a funny movie i love planes and ive seen it more than 3 times
