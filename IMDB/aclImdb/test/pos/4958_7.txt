im sorry but i just cant help it i love watching iron eagle now do not misunderstand me i am not saying that this is a great movie no rather i would put it that this is an endlessly entertaining movie for people who cut this movie to pieces for not being realistic are kinda missing the point of course iron eagles plot was ridiculous but i believe its target audience was kids and i sure remember finding this cool when i was little now i just find it amusing as a guilty pleasure kinda like road house this movie is part of the great pantheon of 80s kidstakingonthestodgyadultpowerstructure movies you must remember daryl real genius et etc if you ask me just watching doug and knotcher ride the snake in the beginning is worth the cost of the dvd that whole sequence was so stupid but at the same time it was hilarious funny totally 80s all that good stuff so bottom line iron eagle is a great 80s guilty pleasure the hairstyles the dancing the music the dialogue its all funny as hell i have iron eagle on dvd and to me it was totally worth 999 at best buy if you love laughing at dated unrealistic action movies this one is a mustsee oh yeah and i think its plot was only marginally stupider than 1986s other fighter pilot action pic top gun
