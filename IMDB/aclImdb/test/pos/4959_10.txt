okay heres the deal theres this american pilot whos flying along minding his own business when suddenly hes outnumbered by evil cowardly nonamerican fighter planes theyre middle eastern types but suffice to say they dont like apple pie or elvis presley who proceed to shoot him down now this american pilot was doing nothing wrong but those evil nonamericans didnt care and before you know it hes banged up in a foreign jail and sentenced to deathbr br now what would normally happen here is that the us military would carpet bomb a couple of nearby towns until the pilot was released but not this time those evil peace lovin types probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre as you can imagine this doesnt please the pilots family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug contented look about him hell make those americans pay oh yes indeedbr br but he didnt reckon on doug masters the captured pilots 16yearold son you see doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car which cant be that long and decides to fly into that evil foreign country and get his dad back so with the help of his friends doug and his wingman retired pilot Â‘chappy sinclair doug launches a two man air raid on the foreigners br br now youd think that this plan would be bound to fail but youd be wrong sure those middle eastern types might be all veteran pilots but dougs got an ace up his sleeve he listens to rock music when he flies after shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery doug lands at an airport and gets his now wounded dad onboard the plane understandably the evil not quite so smug anymore dictator gets quite annoyed at these antics and takes to the skies himself in bid to shoot down doug but the young lad listens to some more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky hurrahbr br after doug and chappy have shot down 90 of their air force the foreigners send up their last few planes in a rather poor attempt to shoot doug down but in the nick of time a flight of us f16s turn up and scare them awaybr br i cannot recommend this film enough it was the first ever videocassette movie that i brought and until i was twenty i kept hoping that my dad would get shot down over a foreign country so that i could rescue him but hes doesnt like flying so it didnt happen
