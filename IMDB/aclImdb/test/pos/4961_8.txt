being a db sweeney fan ive been on the lookout for this movie for quite some time i recently rented the video and found it very enjoyable it had some really hilarious scenes the dysfunctional lives of some of the characters was unsettling but i think the movie also showed that its possible to keep your life on track or get it back on track if its been derailed
