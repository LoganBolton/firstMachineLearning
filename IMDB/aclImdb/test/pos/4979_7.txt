john parrish is an ex union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to the wilkisons over at anchor the trouble is that the price being offered is way to low and when they start to bully parrish and his workers he has a change of heart particularly when things take a brutal turn for the worsebr br originally after watching this one i had a sense of frustration chiefly because of the cast that was involved when you got edward g robinson glenn ford and barbara stanwyck in the same movie you hope that they get a story and script from which to excel sadly they dont get chance to produce a western classic worthy of multiple revisits or is that my over expectation is doing it a disservice well i slept on it and decided to ponder further about the picture i think yes its fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work from it is when all is said and done a plot that has been milked for all its worth and then some but the violent men is still a very rewarding film regardless of the missed opportunities evident with the productionbr br glenn ford as parrish is as cool as an eskimos nose throughout and its always great to see babs stanwyck playing a bitch because shes good at it while eddie g when one gets used to him being in a western is fine in what is an under written part robinson who stepped in at the last minute when first choice as lee wilkison broderick crawford got injured is the one who is short changed the most by the makers even supporting characters such as the devilish wade matlock a grinning delight from the reliable richard jaeckel and judith wilkison a radiant dianne foster get something to leave an impression with but for what it is robinsons crutch toting bad guy is at the least memorable for all the right reasonsbr br not shy on action and gun play its with the twists and almost shakespearean tragedies that rudolph matés film rises above the mundane with all of it gorgeously framed by burnett guffeys stunning cinematography lone pine in alabama has been used on many a western picture see seven men from now for another glorious use of it but here guffey really excels and manages to dazzle the eyes at every turn the violent men isnt a great western picture and perhaps a better director than maté could have really given donald hamiltons the big country novel an adaptation to be proud of but for every niggle and irk i personally had with it i found two more reasons to actually really like it so that it be its recommended for sure 710
