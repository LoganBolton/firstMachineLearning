a western through and through as the title character portrayed by glenn ford says no i dont want to fight but i will if its forced on me this movie is about being intelligent strong and fighting for ones beliefs with courage never stop striving for what you feel is right great action and mostly quick paced good to see brian keith in this role and edward g robinson as an older western man glenn ford lives up to his western image thoroughly enjoyable film includes strategic nonmilitary warfare of course its violent like the title states but not too graphic like in the computergenerated era films its mostly about strong personality clashes
