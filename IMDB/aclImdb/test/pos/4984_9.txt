this was a very good 1950s western one of the better ones ive seen in a decade which featured that genre on screen and on tv it certainly had three big actors on the marquee glenn ford barbara stanwyck and edward g robinson it turns out that ford was the star of this film while the other two stars were in supporting roles ford had the bulk of the dialog he also was the good guy while robinson was the bad guy and stanwyck was twice as bad as robinson she played the real heavy in this film and the character she played was a little too contradictory at times br br ford handled his starring status very ably as he usually did  especially in westerns he played a nice guy who didnt want to fight was a peaceful manbut if you pushed himlook outbr br the story had a nice mixture of action and lulls not overdoing either it had an expansive western setting which was put to good use with the cineamascope widescreen it also featured realistic people in a realistic setting that credibility with the characters especially the supporting players was most impressive the men way outshined the women in this film acting and characterwise dianne foster and may wynn were weak  the only negatives of the production its easy to see why these two actresses never became starsbr br even though it is over 50 years old this western is one youd still find fastenough moving to enjoy no matter how old you are or what youre used to seeing for classic film fans this is almost a must with this cast and good story highly recommended
