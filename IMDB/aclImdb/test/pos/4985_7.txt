this is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers its certainly all been done before and since but the violent men is something specialbr br what makes it special is barbara stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films shes married to the crippled edward g robinson whos the cattle baron here but robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent no matter to barbara whose needs are being met by her brotherinlaw brian keith that doesnt sit well with either dianne foster who is robinson and stanwycks daughter nor with lita milan who is keiths mexican girl friendbr br the infidelity subplot almost takes over the film but glenn ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here hes every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often i almost expect those famous words from wild bill elliott to come out of fords mouth im a peaceable man would have been very applicable in the vioilent menbr br the fifties was the age of the adult western themes were entering into horse operas that hadnt been explored before the following year glenn ford would do another western jubal one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot componentbr br theres enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well
