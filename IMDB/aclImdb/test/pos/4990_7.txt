comanche moon had everything going for it for starters simon wincers back a man whos name is synonymous with highquality tv westerns unfortunately the problems with moon are something even the most talented director couldnt solve a poor script based on a lackluster novelbr br forget historical accuracies  as any reader of the novels can tell you the biggest travesty in moon is that its not even consistent with information from the original lonesome dove masterpiece so many wonderful rich moments in the miniseries and to an even greater degree the book are completely missing in moon considering the fact that most viewers of moon are probably coming with at least some sort of dove background the lack of characterdriven and emotional backstory is downright painful br br that said moon is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen for example the novel moon focuses largely on the comanches themselves to its credit the miniseries tries to service the comanches but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense theyre missing out on some important part of the story similarly val kilmers scull loses out here too  the role should have either been expanded so kilmer and rachel griffiths for that matter actually had something to do or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller supporting parts instead kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act br br theres strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who havent read the book a killer parrot what  further there isnt a single scene that shows us that call and mccrae are anything near the amazing texas rangers they claim to be not a single one of their expeditions in moon or dead mans walk for that matter ends successfully and call and mccrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after anotherbr br frankly larry mcmurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie brokeback mountain mcmurtry can write good novels although theres some dissension over the consistency of that statement but hes never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter this production would have benefited from not only bringing back director wincer but original screenwriter bill wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen witcliff doesnt exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original lonesome dove with all this said comanche moon is almost a brilliant production aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just arent given enough to do steve zahns portrayal of gus mccrae  or rather his portrayal of robert duvall as gus mccrae  is deadon and while some have criticized karl urban as woodrow call saying his performance doesnt imitate the quiet stoic woodrow of the original movie all i can say is blame mcmurtry because mcmurtry is the one who  both in the moon novel and now the miniseries  turned woodrow from socially inept awkward but natural leader into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if youve seen them portrayed far more adequately in the sequelbr br still its the cast that sparkles in moon to the degree that i left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy i felt watching the original lonesome dove  this time because i realized its probably the last time well see these characters appear on screen for a long long time to come  and quite honestly this cast could have done so well in a wellnurtured fullblown network tv seriesbr br all in all aside from wasted opportunities with the cast the biggest travesty is that the original lonesome dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating utterly fascinating to see translated on screen unfortunately all that has been tossed aside in favor of mcmurtrys tedious inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel
