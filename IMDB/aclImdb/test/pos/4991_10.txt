i am very impressed with the acting in comanche moon before i started watching this i wasnt expecting it to be as good as lonesome dove i couldnt believe how well the actors were chosen to represent all the characters it blew my mind how well they played each role this was in my opinion almost as good as lonesome dove its hard to compare any film to lonesome dove if you dont make that comparison i would give this a thumbs up it was very entertaining i dont post many comments on this site but i just felt i had to get my opinion out there amazing i dont want to go off naming every actor who was brilliant because i would probably have to list every single one my favorite was steve zahn he hit the nail on the head playing captain gus his mannerisms were perfect
