what has hurt this film is everyone and their aunt matilda is comparing it to its illustrious predecessor which is always going to hurt any show if you take it as a western its a darned good show we discover how our characters in lonesome dove wind up in the situations they start up in such as why do two texas rangers who live on adventure wind up in a dead town and how did gus manage to lose the love of his life the performances are very good and we see the exact same mannerisms the characters will have down the road the actors did a very good job the cinematography was superb and while the music didnt live up to the legendary score of nearly two decades past that was an impossible task and it was still finebr br it also helped that we had three episodes which you just dont see in a miniseries anymore heck its downright impossible to see a two part telefilm these daysbr br fans of the western rejoice
