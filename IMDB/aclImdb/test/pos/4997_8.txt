there have been some harsh criticisms of comanche moon on imdb i think this is for three reasons first purists are disappointed that the miniseries is not exactly like the book second its not as good as the original lonesome dove finally people like to complain on imdb and the greatest films in the world will have bad commentsbr br i would like to say that no movie is going to be as good as the book thats just the way it is lonesome dove wasnt as good as the novel it was based on additionally the movie of lonesome dove had some things left out ans switched around thats just they way its going to be with a film adaptation of anything so its a futile argument when looking at comanche moonbr br i do agree its not as good as the original dove but hey nothing is i know people that guide their lives by the lessons they learned from the dove if i was going to compare every book i read movie i watched and tv i viewed by lonesome dove i would be perpetually unhappybr br this is a made for tv miniseries based on a prequel to lonesome dave the novel and sequel to dead mans walk and thats what you get its the best tv ive seen in years its a fun set up for lonesome dove we get to learn about the history of the rangers we came to know and love in dove zahn does an amazing job in recreating gus mccrae elizabeth banks and linda forenelli sp also do great jobs as creating characters that help fill in the past of the rangers and newtbr br ifwhen it comes on again i promise youll enjoy it more than some crumby reality show
