i must have seen a different version than the first person on the user comments sectionbr br its really really goodsteve zahn and karl urban are great together val kilmers character is much like he was in the novel although the emphasis is on gus and call and the comanches we get to see what happened with call and newts mother as well i wont spoil it but it gives a lot of insight into calls characterbr br all the actors did a really convincing job steve zahn had the biggest challenge i thought to follow robert duvall theres a lot of action humor tragedy its got something for everyone i cant wait until it airs my family are all jealous i got to see it early
