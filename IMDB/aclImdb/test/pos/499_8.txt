i remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that i vowed to buy the video when it came out br br while i wont go too far into dissecting this film i will say that i gave it an 810 for all the reasons you can read in the other users reviewsbr br what i will say is this br br the first 10 minutes of this film are incredible its as close to a textbook audience grabber as ive ever seen i once put this movie on at a party where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave i just wanted to see what would happen if i showed them the first ten minutesbr br everyone who watched the opening stayed to the end
