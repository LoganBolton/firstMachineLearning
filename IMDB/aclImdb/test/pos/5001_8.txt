i originally saw this film while i was working as a musician doing musical theatre in summer stock if youve ever done any work in theatre  especially at a summer stock theatre  youll really enjoy this filmbr br yes there are some moments of really bad writing in the film but overall its a lovely tribute to the theatre and why people love it
