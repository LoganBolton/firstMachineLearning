talkshow with spike feresten is one of those shows that will definitely polarize audiences either you like it or you dont personally i find most of the bits hilarious but it does have some huh moments br br staples like idiot paparazzi are always good for a laugh but my alltime favorite bit has to be the oneoff hollywood douchebag comedy for stoners is the only regular bit that generally leaves me confused which is part of the point spike and his team of writers manage to churn out loads of fresh comedy time after time so the show never feels stale ferestens brand of humor may not be for everyone but its definitely worth tryingbr br the masses have spoken we like this show and want more please note i am not a friend of or affiliated in any way with spike feresten talkshow with spike feresten staff or fox network and affiliates its just plain funny
