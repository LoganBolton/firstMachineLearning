this show was a pleasant surprise after watching mad tv on a saturday night spike is an excellent host that you can tell is still getting used to it but he is doing great adjusting to his new job i can imagine it being a difficult transition from writerseinfeld to host however unlike a lot of new talk show hosts he does not let airtime ride while trying to figure out what to do next he is quickminded and each segment and section rolls into one another smoothly it also doesnt hurt that hes kinda sexy in a nerdy type of way so hes not hard on the eyes like leno or letterman i cant remember the exact episode date that was my favorite but i especially loved the idiot paparazzi skit with a fake jlo and katie holmes great new show
