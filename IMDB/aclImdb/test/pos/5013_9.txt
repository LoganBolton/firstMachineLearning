by many accounts stu ungar was not a very nice guy he spat on dealers stiffed people he owed money to and was verbally abusive br br many filmmakers might choose to sugarcoat the man making him into some sports hero that would triumph despite adversity but high roller doesnt do that and thats a tough row to hoebr br instead we have to look very closely to see a man that never matured passed the frightened little boy from the streets of new york despite all his successes and the only real approval he ever gets is from death himself very brave because people wont get it and very touching when you dobr br what is also brave is the use of a scorsese feel aha how derivative people will say really but theres virtually no violence and stuey loved gangster movies maybe the feel reflects the man stu and not the director marty and if it really is a low budget film and looks that good bravobr br finally the linear flashback structure wow will that get hammered yet not only does it work it works exceptionally well even for those who dont see the connection to the seventh seal proof in ss knight plays game of chess with death in hr stuey says we can play a hand of cards for ya know death says never much good at cards damn great last linebr br no tricky effects or camera moves no shaky camera nothing trendy at all just solid tight storytellingbr br maybe that makes the movie too basic and somehow flawed but then again so was the guy and that makes it just about rightbr br 910
