stuey unger was a card playing legend he was quoted in an interview as saying some day i suppose its possible for someone to be a better no limit holdem player than me i doubt it but it could happen but i swear to you i dont see how anyone could ever play gin better than me theres a gin rummy scene in this movie that is so amazing you could have plopped it in xmen as a showcase for a superheros mutant power thats how incredible this man wasbr br i have a few minor problems with this movie as dark as this movie was stueys real life was darker poker pro todd brunson said during the last world series of poker bob stupak mike sexton and i had a drink and talked about stu mike told us how he could barely talk hadnt showered in weeks and how his fingers were burned black by a crack pipe in the film michael imperioli looked far too healthy to be stu unger in the final years of his life when stuey won his last wsop he looked like a skeleton but lets face it this production lacked both the time and the deniro to make that kind of transformation my other problem was that i wish there was more poker playing with actual hands and situations sure it might have bored the average non poker enthusiast but it would have been nice for the hardcores too bad the movie wasnt 6 hours or so longerbr br i watched the movie with 3 non poker players and they all thoroughly enjoyed it just like you dont have to be a former member of the colonial army to enjoy gibsons the patriot you dont have to be a poker player to see this gem cant wait for the dvd 8 out of 10
