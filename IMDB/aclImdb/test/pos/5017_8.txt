what is it about certain films that generates such polar opposite reactionsbr br some people here have called high roller disgusting some have called it extraordinary as would i actuallybr br why i think its because films like this dont make heroes out of jerks or glamour out of degeneration and some people just cant deal with that emotionally they need a hero and id also add that if theyre gamblers or poker players they might feel personally betrayed when their existence isnt justifiedbr br high roller in not a poker movie its a people movie its not perfect but it looks good is wellwritten and wonderfully acted and best of all it generates an emotional response and inspires reflectionbr br and maybe thats what makes some people so damn mad
