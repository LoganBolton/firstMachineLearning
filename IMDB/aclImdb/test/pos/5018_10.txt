its a movie with a theatrical message blended with some clever moments films like these are the stretching grounds of great actors they enjoy tossing the ball in open pieces like these the angel that wasnt what we see in old books and churches is quite a nice change it is echoed in kevin smiths piece dogma almost in the same slapstick veinbr br 0 watch this film for a good day after you suck it all in could it be that so many films are trying to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of films like this possibly one of the most fun pieces i have seen in a while i ran into this one on vhs in a trash can because someones basement was flooded this summer and i grabbed a handful of tapesbr br whether in a trash bin or on the silver screen mild comedies like this are fun you just dont have to tell everyone at a hip nightclub that you like it or a swank political party just keep it for yourself and ill bet plenty of people will borrow it from time to time
