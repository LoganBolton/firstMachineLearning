why would this film be so good but only gross an estimated 95000000 and have no award nominations john travolta knows what hes doing he knows hes michael a cigar smoking womanizing magical arch angel that came down to live with a dying lady and is now in a car with the staff of the national mirror and their dog sparky on the way to chicago it then turns into a road trip thats both horrible and great i dont even think the death scenes 3 to be exact make this a tearjerker the soundtrack is the best with heaven is my home up around the bend and chains of fools i have very great expectations about this and i say that it should have had a little more respect in the 90s read my comment bye
