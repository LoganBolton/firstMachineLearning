as an earlier reviewer said travolta stole every scene he was in recognize the character it was vinnie barberino all grown up and still a bit sleazy but still likable oh yes br br disappointing were william hurt and bob hoskins perhaps because their characters were badly written or they just didnt care i kept seeing one of the baldwins never can remember which in the hurt role so hurts incredible talents werent wasted br br andie mcdowell is a sweetie but not very believable partly the writing character development just wasnt a big thing in this film just watch it for travolta sit back and enjoy
