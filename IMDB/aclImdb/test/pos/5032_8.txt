michael is probably too cutesy for most action movie fans and too hollywood for the intellectual crowd but i found it both extremely funny and very touching despite it being both cutesy and formulaicbr br when three skeptics are sent to investigate a man claiming to be an angel they end up escorting him on a grand tour of the midwestern country side only to find that it is each of their own hearts that need investigationbr br when taking this film apart as with most films today there isnt a lot of new material but when taken as a whole it has a refreshingly original approach and is offbeat enough to entertain one all the way throughbr br while not being a family film it is suitable for all ages and a good film to share with the whole family or that special someonebr br michael isnt a great film but it certainly is a good film a touching film and well worth seeingbr br kwc
