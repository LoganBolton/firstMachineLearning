this is another of john travoltas come back movies and if he continues on with characters and movies like this one his come back will take holdbr br this is so sweetsickeningly so if youre not into the romance comedy scene if you are this is one innovative romcom every performance including that of skippy the dog was beautiful without much more than a trace of the irreverence found in dogma although as movies go i loved dogmabr br travolta is not nearly as brash in his performance as the previews would lead you to believe he is an angel and if you consider yourself to be well read then you understand that angels were far from perfect you will not therefore be insulted by this film even those who are overly sensitive to such things shouldnt be insulted by this work as nora went to great lengths to see to it that it was the least abrasive as possible given the subject matterbr br i love this and love it more each time i watch it its beautiful and sweet engaging and endearingbr br it rates a 7310 frombr br the fiend
