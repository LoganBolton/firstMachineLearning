caught this movie on tv and i watched it again i said to myself its been a long time since i watched this movie so why not and once again this movie thrilled me it is so easy so watchable and so human that i dont know why some people dislike it br br john travolta shines as michael his dance and every move angel that can hardly be related to this word he smokes drinks and he eats like some savage but hes got big heart on his way michael helps all people he meets dorothy winters andie macdowell in her singing and finding a right man frank quinlan william hurt in developing himself as a good and decent man michael even helped dear old pansy milbank jean stapleton  that last scene is beautiful when they dance on the streetbr br travolta had great help in other actors andie macdowell is so beautiful and likable william hurt is great as usual late robert pastorelli shows his talent jean stapleton and teri garr are also good but my favorite supporting actor in this movie is bob hoskins as the tabloid ownerbr br so weve got here a solid movie about people with a warm story also and attractive cast just dont take this movie seriously and i can guarantee youll have fun
