this is one of my favorite capraesque comedies this movie is just meant to be enjoyed not deconstructed microscopically analyzed its not religious commentary its fun its fantasy the surprisingly negative comments imho reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think must be a part of every moviebr br others have described travoltas role its the reason youll watch the movie over and over and the excellent supporting cast including sparkybr br sometimes a cigar is just a cigar sometimes a movie is just funbr br enjoy
