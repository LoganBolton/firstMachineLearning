i really enjoyed this movie for what it is a funny little film that doesnt take itself too seriously plot summaries are available everywhere so i wont go into details michael isnt about a complex plot anyway it just builds on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful road tripbr br john travoltas performance as a chainsmoking ladyloving barbrawling pieeating angel is just perfect and who doesnt love sparkybr br watch this if you want to have a few laughs and a overall good time highly recommended
