possibly the best john travolta role ever saturday night fever was a great movie  role but a long time ago i cant think of many of his movies or roles ive even liked and its easy to think of rotten ones he can do meanies like in pulp fiction but he makes the perfect funky angel and its hard to imagine anyone doing a better equally slobby job with it plot summaries are available everywhere but the plot isnt the point just go for the ride and enjoy the cleverness of the little funnies along the way there is nothing to dislike about this movie unless one is searching for something profound i wish there were more movies like this we need a break from deep or awesome or grisly or complex or hysterical
