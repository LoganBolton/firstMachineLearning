the title of the film seems quite appropriate given the persona of the lead character fanda hes an older man living in the late autumn of his life yet frolics about as a jubilant school boy whos just entered a spring meadow the frailties of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions to him his wife supports this idea when she observes fanda laughs at funerals and death in other words death is not something fanda takes too seriously he has more important things to do than worry about what already is inevitable life however and the pursuit of living life to its fullest is the philosophy that governs fandas existence he is not one to merely exist but must live for each day and each passing moment for tomorrow is not guaranteed br br the film seems to make a strong commentary about living as though there is no tomorrow let alone death too many people take life much too seriously and consequently miss out on the actual living part of life fandas wife for example shes so worried about preparing for death not in some religiously connotative way but in a far too practical even lifeless way that she forgets how to smile laugh and just have a good time her humanity seems to have transformed into zombie autopilot mode fanda to the contrary is perhaps too blithe and absentminded for his own good he needs a person like his wife emilie to help balance him br br its as though fanda possesses the invincible spirit of a child like a kid trapped in an older mans body he is introduced as the adventurous type he pretends to be people hes not in order to get gain squanders money factiously lies and is always up for a good laugh deepdown though he is a kindhearted and gentle old man who wishes to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife the two offset each other quite nicely though neither one of them truly appreciates the binary quality of their relationship until they metaphorically chance upon death meaning their divorce it is during this courtroom scene that fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love his wife emotionally recalls all of his flaws yet is tenderly drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior in this moment of her forgiving him fanda realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife bonkers and makes an internal commitment to make her happy br br ironically though after making this commitment he becomes what his wife later calls a living corpse the lifeblood within him drains away as he becomes more like hera zombie going through daytoday motions he doesnt seem to live anymore but exist for example he gives up his zany pranks doesnt squander money quits smoking on account of his wife not his health and overall just acquiesces to whatever she wants of him succinctly put he changes on account of wanting to make her happy thus the binary quality of their relationship begins to slowly vanish realizing that her husband is not who he used to be there is a part of emilie that misses the old fanda she misses her husbands aloofness and the fights they used to have because it was in those moments that they were truly living not just simply existing br br i believe the filmmakers were trying to get across a specific message here that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient but often times will take sacrifice and endurance to wade through the seemingly bad times the possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live for every moment life is often taken for granted but when threatened with deathbe it literal or figurativepeople awake from their ungrateful slumbers and are aroused to start living life to its fullest its as though they are scared that theyll never live again so they better make the most of it while they have it fanda and emilie had been married 44 years with fights along the way but it wasnt till they were both threatened with the possibility of deathlikeseparation that they began to show their true colors as the old maxim goes love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation they both begin to see what matters most in life and that is the people they meet along the way more importantly the intimate relationships they make with their significant others
