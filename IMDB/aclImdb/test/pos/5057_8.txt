this movie was an amazing tribute to whoever has gone through this type of pain and suffering the acting wasnt the greatest ill admit that but it was passionate about its message sending people into prisons without so much as an attorney or some type of trial is cruel and unusual they even had a damn trial for saddam so why doesnt every suspected terrorist have some type of fair and justified trial or hearing as to why they were tagged in the first place im getting off the movie but i think its worthy to note about this sick twisted idea the government has the movies way of telling the story and the backstory was a great mystery the whole movie i was trying to connect the daughter with the plot and its made very obvious in the end theres no doubt that the directing was incredible but the one thing i didnt care for was that there wasnt as much emphasis on reese witherspoons characters interest and fight in the ideal she held a lot of skipping otherwise it was actually quite entertaining and most of all it kept my attention and interest for the two hours it played
