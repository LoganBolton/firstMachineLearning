i came out of rendition with a list of flaws a mile long so how is it that my overall impression is that it was a pretty decent movie its definitely a film whose sum is better than its partsbr br those parts include a cast of big name stars not one of them giving a memorable performance omar metwally a relative unknown is the one youll remember serviceable if undistinguished direction and a screenplay thats both too complicated and too simplistic at the same time metwally is an egyptianborn american citizen who gets kidnapped by the us governments rendition program otherwise known as the process by which america tortures suspected terrorists into confessing information whether or not its remotely true reese witherspoon plays his pregnant wife who calls in the favor of an old college friend peter saarsgard who works for a senator alan arkin and helps to track her husband down meryl streep plays the head of the rendition program jake gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to the interrogation and whose conscience gets in the way meanwhile a whole parallel storyline follows the daughter of a top egyptian official who is allied to the american rendition program and her boyfriend whos in training to become a suicide bomberbr br ayyiyi thats a lot of plot to pack into a twohour movie and i was about to wash my hands of the whole thing especially the egyptian romeo and juliet subplot that felt like nothing more than a distraction but then near the films finale a twist of chronology brings all of the plot strands together in a way that makes you want to reassess everything you thought you knew about the motivations of the various characters and makes rendition a much more interesting movie than it seems like its going to bebr br witherspoon gyllenhaal and sarsgaard all look like high school students playing adults twenty years older than they actually are  gyllenhaal in particular usually a fine actor looks so bored that you wonder if hes going to muster the energy to deliver his lines and the screenwriter should be arrested for having an actress as good as meryl streep at his disposal and giving her nothing more to work with than this onedimensional dragon lady the movie of course strives for relevancy but instead of addressing the tangled web of arguments surrounding the national security issue it charges right down the middle of the debate in a predictable fashion there are moments when you think maybe the film will veer off in an interesting direction  what if witherspoon did actually begin to doubt her husbands past for instance what if metwally actually had been in contact with terrorists as his interrogators accuse but no the movie takes the path of least resistancebr br but like i said upfront i recommend this movie i know ive done nothing but list a bunch of its faults but its got its head in the right place and it is entertaining or at least as as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogation can bebr br grade b
