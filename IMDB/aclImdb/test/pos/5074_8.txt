think of it as an extreme form of detention without trial without commenting and taking a side on the us foreign policy the process of extraordinary rendition involves taking persons suspected of terrorist activities to a foreign country an opposite to an extradition if you wish to a place where torture is not a crime but a means to illicit information instead of staining your soil with blood of potentially innocent parties you do so on foreign land where such tactics are accepted interrogation techniquesbr br naturally given the severity of the tactics and attempts at breaking down a person sometimes you would get what you want once you pass the resistance or get nothing or worst of all get a confession just because the mind has been broken to the point that the subject will agree to whatever you say its an ugly process and what better way to do it when youre the champion human rights giving the nod to use whatever means necessary in the name of protecting more lives in an age where information is key to the battle against terror and doing so in a country where probably the rights record is questionablebr br rendition is this years syriana though in the run up to the new year we do have a number of political thriller contenders to take that crown with rendition first of all followed by the robert redford movie lions for lambs starring tom cruise and meryl streep again though now on the other side of the fence and the kingdom with jamie foxx and jennifer garner though this one would probably turn out to be more action driven directed by gavin hood who did tsotsi and will be helming the new wolverine spin off rendition is a decent thriller with a top notch cast in a narrative that has been proved quite popular these days  the split which provides for some ample differential perspectives to be presented through an ensemble castbr br anwar elibrahimi omar metwally a chemical engineer gets renditioned en route to going home under the orders of cia top brass corrine whitman meryl streep at a detention facility outside the us jake gyllenhaals cia analyst douglas freeman oh so prophetic embarks on his very first interrogation session no doubt being thrust into a position that he didnt sign up for back home a very pregnant reese whitherspoon searches frantically for answers to her husbands disappearance and sought after an exflame alan smiths peter sarsgaard assistance since hes working for senator hawkins alan arkin throw in jk sinmmons a terrorist plot investigation and a budding forbidden love story between fatima zineb oukach and khalid moa khouas you have quite a bit going on in a busy picturebr br given a number of casts locations timelines and the likes rendition wasnt confusing at all and it plays out with deft handling of the material never quick to judge presenting ideas and thoughts from both sides of the equation every character has their own agenda and the unveiling of this agenda engages enough not to bore nor to confuse you and the best part of it all is how very truly they bow down to selfpreservation in different forms and ultimately in various loselose situations unfortunately it kept you guessing as well  did he or didnt he and constantly played with your mind as to whether anwar deserved what hes getting it utilized one extremely smart sleight of hand which i didnt see coming until its too late so there goes the credit though it did succumb to the usual stereotyping of terrorist militants and without spending much time in depth to explore their motivations br br perhaps it didnt find a need to given so many movies out there already touching base on this issue paradise now day night day night syriana even while it turned out to be rather onedimensional personal tragedy to strapping of bombs to become a suicide bomber i felt rendition did right in not providing any saccharine sweet ending that this fight against negative destructive ideology isnt something that can be addressed in a two hour movie and im glad it steered clear such fairy tale implausibilities br br what we have instead is a well crafted tale that sets its gun sights on the issue of rendition and probably capable enough to spark discussion once the lights come on on which camp you belong to  do you support inflicting severe pain in interrogation yes or no this is the quintessential question of our time yes or no ok im already geared for lions for lambs
