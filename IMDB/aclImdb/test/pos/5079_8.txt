i liked this movie i saw it to a packed house at the toronto international film festival the day after the gala opener which must have gone over well the director gavin hood was supposed to be present for todays screening but alas his twins were born just hours before so he had to jet on a flight back 2 birthings in 24 hours was how he joked about itbr br rendition refers to extraordinary rendition  a term whereby suspected terrorists in the us can be sent without the legal consent of their parents nations to prisons abroad to be questioned and detainedbr br its fairly predictable  innocent egyptianamerican man wrongly accused of being a terrorist goes missing while en route from south africa to washingon dc he is sent abroad while wife at home reese witherspoon fights to find him and free him but what makes this movie special are some nice choices in storytelling 1 a humantouch story of what is going on in the locale where a suicide bombdetonated 2 the humanity of a cia agent trying to understand and be honest with what is really going on and 3 the chronology of storytelling which makes it a tight taut tale that moves and jerks at the right moments ah  relief and a mix of emotions that swirl around as the story fights for an endingbr br allaround strong acting with meryl streep as a standout vixen
