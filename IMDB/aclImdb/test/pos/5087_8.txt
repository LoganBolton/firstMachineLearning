though short lived the amazing spiderman was one of the best made for tv versions of a famed comic book hero only wonder woman lynda carter the best of the genre and the incredible hulk bill bixby lou ferrigno were betterbr br the amazing spiderman outclasses the 19661968 batman because the high camp elements of the latter often ruin the adventure spiderman outclasses all three television interpretations of superman lois and clark smallville and of course the george reeves superman which brings up the rearbr br the amazing spiderman was an action drama during the late 1970s the precgi era when stunts had to be performed by stunt men not in the database of a computer spiderman had its own very talented stuntman to perform the death defying daredevil acrobatics his name was fred waugh who donned the spidy suit for the action sequences nicholas hammond better known as one of julie andrews children on the alltime movie classic the sound of music was spiderman during the dialogue scenes hammonds spiderman also had his own secret identity as peter parker similar to christopher reeve superman clark kent adam westbatmanbruce wayne and of course lynda carter as wonder woman diana princebr br its unfortunate that the series only had thirteen episodes because when the first episode hit the airwaves in november of 1977 the entire country was watching it on cbs that wednesday night in all fairness cbs should release this pilot episode as well as the deadly dust the captive tower etc on dvd shortly spiderman was short lived but did have a cult following and in my opinion was a heck of a lot better than the movie interpretation of the famed comic book hero starring toby mcguirebr br cbs might be hesitant to release these episodes for two reasons a there might not be a broad market for them based on the lack of longevity of the series and a generation of children and young people who werent born when the series originally aired in the 1970s b one of the early spiderman episodes dealt with a terrorist with designs on the world trade center which was attacked twice many years after this show went off the air in 1993 and of course the devastating attack against this country on 91101 in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lostbr br however i dont think that it would be in bad taste to release this spiderman episode even if the show was adventure derived from a comic book and camp in nature the live action amazing spiderman doesnt have a large following but it has a cult following if and when cbs releases it out on dvd this cult following could be explained along with the episode in which spiderman saved the towers in 1978 but how in september of 2001 real life proved to be different from the movies i like to follow the news but i also like science fictionfantasy therefore i am eagerly awaiting the release of the amazing spiderman on dvd
