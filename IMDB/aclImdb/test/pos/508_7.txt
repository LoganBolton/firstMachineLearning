blade would be an extremely aboveaverage comicbook vampirehunter actionhorror if it werent for two minor flaws 1 i loved seeing the allbut invincible bladesnipes do his slicing and dicing but the whole yes fistpunch was literally a letdown 2 bad no make that horrible cgi Â– even for 1998 standards this is mainly in the last third but some sprinkled throughout okay despite those minor infractions i really enjoyed this movie all actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another matrix ripoff is hilarious considering this came out one year prior so maybe the matrix copied blade at any rate its a very movie for multiple genreloving audiences comic book geeks action fanatics and horrorvampire lovers so we have blade halfmanhalfvampire or daywalker and his accomplish whisler a la batman and alfred battling the undead who apparently almost out number humans who knew in a rare act of humanity blades more of an antihero our sword ninjavamp rescues a newly infected coincidentally blood specialistdoctor meanwhile trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants you guessed it supreme power and needs blade somehow to obtain it its not the most original concept if you read what i just wrote but still highly enjoyable you will want to see blade succeed you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms and you will know whats coming as this is the typical act 123 of a comic book introduction movie still watch this without trying to go too deep such as vampire spf1000 suntan lotion really what about the scalp wouldnt that still burn just like the money they burn for weapons uh okay i am going too deep once again sit back and enjoy the technocharged fun ride
