peter otoole gives a brilliant performance in this movie i have seen the original version with robert donat and i much prefer peter otooles performance and the movie in general even though it is a musical ive really never seen anything that mr otoole is in that i dont like he is a brilliant actor multitalented giving performances full of passion and depth petula clark also gave a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the part it is an allaround heartwarming movie full of tenderness and bittersweet fun i will always remember in paraphrase the line where mr chips regrets he has never given her children and she replies of course you have hundreds of them  all boys thank you for the opportunity to vote for this movie and to voice my opinion
