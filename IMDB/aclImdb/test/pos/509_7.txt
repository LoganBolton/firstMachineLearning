hope the summary line wont irritate you that much its a little homage to the chappelle showcharlie murphy but also to the character daywalker but ill try to put all the things i liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything i didnt like in another paragraph so it will be easier to read br br lets start with the good things the quote strong bloody violence which is used by rating boards to describe the content of a movie does fit here very well this is not a movie for kids or for the faint of hearted it has blade as a central character wesley snipes is phenomenal and a crazy enough story thread to holdjustify the action scenes the original idea is also very engaging and intelligent the action scenes are great here toobr br ok over to the things i didnt like the overall story is too thin its enough as ive written above to hold the action scenes together but there could be more and a character like blade deserves more imo the drama therefor isnt the best  also its use of clich√©s doesnt help some characters are underwritten  thats that o
