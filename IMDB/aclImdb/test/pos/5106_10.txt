i enjoyed the movie and the story immensely i have seen the original1939 i believe and enjoyed them both to really appreciate the story one must be familiar with english culture and customs the profpeter otoole was dedicated to his school and the boys in that school it was an english public school which we in the us refer to as a private school eg andover he is a very ascetic person and on the surface gives the appearance of being stiff stuffy uncaring and weak to the point of being effeminate he is strict in his educational standards because he does care for his lads ie he doesnt want them to get a cheap or weak education he meetsthrough introduction a dance hall girlpetula clark and is totally smitten in england at the time the reference to dance hall carried the connotation of extreme sexual promiscuity and was definitely lower class we find that the prof is in fact a very tough and courageous person as well as loyal to people and institutions that he loves andor respects clark becomes more than a lover and wifeshe leavens his personality and allows him to grow as a man and a person much to the benefit of his beloved school and his own happiness the first movie was set before ww ii this one goes through ww ii also it is 1969 weve had the british invasionbeetles etc clark had hits and was very popular thenstill is to me the music is great color and photography excellent i think otoole played the character perfectly there are dedicated people like chipsall around us but many do not receive the recognition very enjoyable movie and story
