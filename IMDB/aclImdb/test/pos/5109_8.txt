if you only see one ernest movie in your life make it this one this is by far the best in the series with its nonstop laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages the other ernest flicks were good too but most people tend to get tired of him quickly not me howeverbr br in this movie ernest p whorrel is assigned jury duty for a murder case the murderer nash just happens to look exactly like our bumbling hero ernest mr nash finds this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identities with him and so we get to see how ernest reacts in the slammerbr br a great flick if you havent already seen it watch it
