this is a really good flick with awesome humor jim verney as we know was very good with facial expressions and demonstrates a lot of it in this moviethis is definitely the best of the ernest filmsi would surely recommend it to any ernest fan out therei find myself to have great taste in movies and im sure anyone will enjoy this movie in the movie ernest plays 2 roles bad guy and good guy and plays them quite well i really enjoy exaggeration type humor where things just seem impossiblelike in the naked gun films for example and there is plenty of it in this moviei bought this movie right after i saw it good directing good script worth renting
