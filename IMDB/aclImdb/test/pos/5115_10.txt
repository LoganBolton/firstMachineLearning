this movie brings back so many memories for me i was very young when it came out but i remember the first time i saw it my dad and i would always watch the ernest movies together we hadnt seen any of them in several years and i found a couple of them really cheap we watched them and could not stop laughing i love all of the ernest movies but this one is my favoritebr br spoiler part br br the part i remember most is the magnet part my dad still does the electric chair scene br br end spoilerbr br this is a very cheesy moviebut a great one its perfect for families it isnt like a lot of the trash out there but at the same time adults can laugh too if you like physical humor like facial expressions and the way people move then this is the movie for you
