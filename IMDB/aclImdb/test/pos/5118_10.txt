if i had to decide which was the best ernest movie and dont act like that sort of thing doesnt happen all time it would be this onebr br all of the ernest movies are entertaining but the best ones are the ones that have jim varney doing a number of different characters additionally i am known to enjoy the comedy stylings of bill byrge and gailard sartain as brothers chuck and bobby tulip ernest goes to jail contains all of those elements as well as a funny script and a supporting cast that features several beloved character actorsbr br and that is why i have chosen ernest goes to jail as the king of all ernest movies disagree with me if you must but deep down you know i am right
