this film was not great cinema but definitely a good film to see with your family especially children from 1015 there are good topics of discussion brought up in this movie such as bullies the environment and working to make things right jimmy buffets music was a plus and the scenery was wonderful the young actors were excellent and this is a movie i would expect to see on the family channel or the hallmark channel except for a few words in the dialog a middle school could show this film to start discussions in the classroom hopefully it will be shown in driveins this summer so that more people get to see it it did follow carl hiassens book well and it was fun to see him in a cameo performance
