i must confess i was surprised at how good this movie was when i first watched it i had planned to see it in theaters during the summer but found out unpleasantly that it had already been and gone therefore i expected it to have been removed from theaters because it was bad then today i rented it and watched it and really enjoyed it the speed that events were occurring was questionable it could have been a little longer i found it was very true to the book however it left out some crucial parts mullet fingers real name etc i felt as if i hadnt read the book i wouldnt have really understand what was going on the acting was quite good another thing i had expected to be poor however the cop sorry i cant remember the actors name could have done a little better all in all i found this to be a very entertaining movie and would recommend it to all audiences
