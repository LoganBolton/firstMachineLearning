i read the book in a summer book club and all of us there loved it my friends from that club agreed not to watch the movie lest the book be ruined i didnt agree and watched it recently with my younger brother and my parentsbr br i was pleasantly surprised the movie was very true to the book without losing its own spirit the new kid theme was shown just enough so that we get a feel of it but thats not what the storys aboutbr br the acting wasnt the best ive ever seen but it was still good and the kids especially had a lot of energy the characters were interesting and the plot was cute and not too overstated it was a kids movie that works just fine for adults or teenagers toobr br i wish there had been a bit more toughgirl attitude from beatrice but she was still a great character mullet fingers was quite a bit like i had imagined him except his hair was a little obviously dyed with blonde hair and dark eyebrows roy worked very well as the little guy and the new kid especially interactions with his parents and friendsbr br the message and the ending which i wont discuss other than i liked it teamed up to make a great cheerup movie for a rainy day all in all this was a great film that you can watch again and again whenever you need reminding that the world isnt a horrible place after all
