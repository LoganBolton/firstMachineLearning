my family two 40somethings an 8 year old and my 71 yr old mother saw this at a sneak preview on april 29th we all enjoyed the movie very much the story was a good one and knowing it was based on reallife events made it that much more enjoyable luke wilson was a hoot pun intended to watch as was tim blake nelson and seeing neil flynn play something other than the mean janitor from scrubs was nice the kids in movie did well and im sure they will all appeal to a certain demographic on the heartthrob level the visuals were just lovely and the jimmy buffet music added to the florida feel ok maybe the story was a little too neat and well packaged for some adults but hey who cares i cant compare it to the book i honestly hadnt heard of it until the movie came out br br it was just a nice movie and it had a good message plain and simple
