i saw this at the 2008 palm springs international film festival there are some wonderful descriptions of this film from other commenters here and they seemed to have really enjoyed it so i wont too far into giving a film synopsis but you could see a little of woody allen and maybe a little of federico fellini in this films collection of some 50 short sketches or vignettes strung together with no real singular plot a few of the vignettes are related to each other in their character and plot lines however and a a corner bar is used frequently as a central scene where they are always giving last call the beginning and ending scenes have a common theme too that bookends the film it took three years to film this and much of the time must have been spent on finding the plainest and homeliest looking people in all of sweden to make the cast this is swedens official submission for best foreign language film for the 2007 academy awards its a nice movie but hardly worthy of an official submission for best foreign film last year swedens official submission was the very weak farväl falkenberg and the year before it was expensive looking but dull zozo so once again sweden will have no chance in picking up the oscar this film has its moments and would have made a good 2025 minute short film but it gets a little old and cold for a full length feature film roy andersson directs gustav danielsson is the cinematographer editor anna märta waern deserves a lot of credit for the work she must have put into this benny andersson of abba fame provides an entertaining music score its an interesting film with a lot of dry humor and i did like it but its nothing really special and could only give it a 70 out of 10
