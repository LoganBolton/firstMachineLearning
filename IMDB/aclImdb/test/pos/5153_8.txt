you the living 2007br br mordant ive never written that word before but it comes to mind here let me look it up well its part of itcorrosive but also funny as heck so corrosively funny this is a dour film for sure with so much dry dry dry wit and quirky humor its impossible not to like it on some level filmed in a very spare style often with a static camera and really balanced stable compositions like theater stages we see a short enactment occurbr br but that makes it seem ordinarywhich it is not ordinary life is shown to be frumpy ironic delightful coy and depressing and impossible we the living must live and since were alive we may as well take note something like that i think it was ebert who said you find yourself laughing and dont know why exactly and the promo material somewhere said it was a cross between bergman and monty python and what they mean is it has the dry silent probing look of ingmar bermans famous swedish films but it has the zany somehow touching elements of the british comedians br br id say definitely definitely watch at least half an hour of this there is part of me that thought i was through by thenthe rest continues in a similar assemblage of little skits and moments and they do gradually evolve but there is no great plot to follow or climax of the usual kind there are some great moments later even just the attention to the thunderstorm which takes us out of the mundane human events nicely br br the filming is gorgeous in its classical control almost like a series of gregory crewdson scenes and outdoing the photographer actually and the acting with all its very ordinary nonglam folksiness is right on a startling beautiful odd experience
