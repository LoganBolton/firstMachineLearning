you cant really call roy andersson prolific 6 films in 37 years nor can you accuse him of being conventional he doesnt do straightforward at least when it comes to narrative you the living his first film in seven years is like a surreal documentary in which a large number of characters are observed doing nothing very much and if that sounds offputting let me assure you it isnt this is a funny accessible and surprisingly warmhearted movie a sliceoflife far removed from that which we normally see on the screenbr br of course sliceoflife is hardly the proper moniker to apply to this movie since most peoples lives are unlikely to be anything like this the incidents on the screen run the gamut from the almost terrifyingly ordinary to the downright wacky and while characters may flit by sometimes never to be seen again others to reappear as if anxious for approval andersson bestows on them all a kind of benign affection that and some rollicking music ensure the time we spend with them is time wellspent
