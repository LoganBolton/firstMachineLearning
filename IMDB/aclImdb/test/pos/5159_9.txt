this film isnt supposed to be funny but it made me laughbr br it isnt designed to be sad but my heart felt heavy through a number of the vignettesbr br it isnt written as action adventure but my pulse raced more than oncebr br just like life this movie doesnt manipulate your emotions and tell you how to feel it simply is and you reactbr br if you dont find it funny or sad or moving i suspect that says more about you than the filmbr br it amazing and refreshing to see a director so wholeheartedly celebrate that we are all human and embrace that we are all trapped here doing this life thing over and over for as long as we mustbr br tomorrow is another day
