i really didnt see this one coming roy andersson had me pegged out i am the perfect sucker for a static camera long live king borowczyk and i was laughing hysterically for the first fifteen minutes of the film he hit me straight between the eyes you have to be a brilliant man to make selfpity hilarious andersson reminds me of the third mate on the pequod in moby dick flask a man who took the whole of life to be a practical joke that the good lord himself is playing on us and the web of egotism in this movie is truly hilariousbr br the level of satire is at fever pitch you have one deluded selfpitying dreamer harp on about the cruelty of the world and then totally ignore a spiritual selfreflection crying out in agony the very depths of egotism are plumbed i really never thought it possible to go further than bergmans the silence in this respect however the grotesqueness of the selflove and selfregard by every single character in this film is staggering we are shown an existence where the talentless and the idle rail against a world they believe has been unjust towards them they truly are legends in their own living rooms the human beings in this film make selfdeception and selfdelusion a great artform br br only one woman in the film appears to have any sort of understanding of what is going on an old woman who refuses to leave a chapel knelt down praying for the forgiveness of all mankind her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world i have ever heard she reveals through her prayers that what is wrong with the world is not to be fixed by mere tinkering there are not a just a few faults there is an abyss of corruption that can only be mended by immolation and judgement day watching this movie puts me in the mind of a naked monk stood waist deep in a cold river at midnight screaming out a thousand kyrie eleisons for the sins of humanity another grand jape is that it is clear that her prayers are futile and in fact she is stopping everyone going home at closing timebr br this is not a film for the smug noone is spared no idols are left on the altar no one group of humans is harangued to the glory of another group never has there been a greater more transcendent more astonishingly beautiful summation of our sins it is a film for the end of the world it is the grand jest the great hideous practical joke of human life br br from the catalogue of images it is too difficult to pick a favourite i slapped my thigh and almost fell off my chair in the cinema screaming with laughter as a man attempted to pull the tablecloth from under a set service i wont spoil what happens but the suspense builds up and something truly unexpected occurs it is probably the funniest thing i have ever seen in a cinema i am quite reserved and i just couldnt control myself that is the measure of the greatness of this filmbr br the shooting of you the living is impeccably formalist we are shown the palette of an artist dingy browns yellows greys and sky blues set alive by the shock of luminous brass textures there is never a tone out of place its like an hour and a half of symphonic whistlerian colourmeld the obsession that must have gone into putting that colour scheme in place is extraordinary and no shot is wasted as with all great movies there is not a spare inch of celluloidbr br perhaps the best film ive ever seen
