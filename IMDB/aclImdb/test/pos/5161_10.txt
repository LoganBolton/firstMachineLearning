there is no plot there are no central characters there are no moving cameras or closeups in fact this film does not follow any of the conventional storytelling techniques used by mainstream film however roy anderssons du levande is a remarkable piece of cinematic storytelling it is a touching look at the human psychebr br comprised of a series of vignettes roy andersson gives us an intimate insight into what makes us all human in perfectly framed static shots added with the perfectly in tune yet quirky music roy introduces us to a host of characters as they undertake their daily existence some bordering on tragic others hilarious we are taken on a nordic journey like no otherbr br it is a journey into the little things that make us human instead of overthetop storytelling or visual techniques everything is stripped down to the bare minimum so that our sole focus is on the characters themselves it focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are our dreams our desperation its through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individualsbr br the washed out colours and deathlypale makeup of the characters only seems to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them we are all alive there is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this film yet you walk out of the cinema with a sense of life much more accessible than his earlier film songs from the second floor du levande is a truly inspiring piece of cinema
