with all the misery in the world how can we not get drunk Â– miabr br a lovely aerial view of a major city turns ominous with the approach of a fleet of airplane bombers an irate hairdresser reacting to a perceived racial slur cuts a road through a businessmans bushy hair a man dreams of being dragged to an electric chair after a failed magic trick and a teacher breaks down in front of her grade school class because her husband called her a hag these and about fifty other vignettes that run the gamut from the outright depressing to the wildly humorous to the joyously uplifting populate roy anderssons you the living his first feature since his critically acclaimed if commercially unsuccessful songs from the second floorbr br you the living is filled with the same kind of imaginative setpieces as songs replete with black humor surreal situations and strange looking characters though a bit overlong and less focused than his earlier work what remains constant is anderssons unmistakable style with its stationary camera sterilelooking backgrounds and precise attention to detail if there is a theme that ties the sketches together it is that our time on earth is limited and tomorrows another day so lets treat each other with kindness along the way we are entertained by tuba and drum music from the louisiana brass band dinner guests at a banquet hall standing on their chairs singing a rousing song and a house that turns into a moving trainbr br the emotions range from the gloom of a daughter attempting to communicate with an alzheimers patient to a young womans ecstatic dream about marrying a handsome guitarplayer named micke to the cheers of a crowd of onlookers while there is no continuous narrative thread the theme of greed and desperation appears in several sketches the first of these threads features two corpulent individuals and their tiny dog sitting on a park bench the woman bewailing the fact that no one understands or loves her yet she blithely ignores the mans comforting and reassuring wordsbr br there is also a hefty admixture of irony during what seems to be an executive luncheon one man tells another on the phone that workers dont appreciate quality and how nice it is to appreciate money and the things that it can buy such as fine wine when he is not looking however a man at an adjacent table calmly lifts his wallet from his jacket on the back of his chair though anderssons cynicism is at times not very well hidden you the living has an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition it is a cautionary tale that looks at the mess we humans have gotten ourselves into but suggests there is still time to turn it around if we heed the warning of the poet goethe that opens the film be pleased then you the living in your delightfully warmed bed before lethes icecold wave will lick your escaping foot
