the joy and tragedy of the christmas season lies in the fact that it mostly revolves around family that is why some people call it the childrens holiday as we age natural attrition and progress removes the people and the things that gave us our special memories john denver in one of his sweetest roles plays george billings a successful nyc architect and new widower who lost his wife about a year earlier his life is focused around his 9 year old daughter alex both are still grieving their loss george is trying his best to make this a special christmas for his daughter enter his boss thomas renfield roguishly played by the wonderful col flagg of mash guy edward winters who sends george to georgetown co to explore a possible real estate deal lying to his daughter that the purpose of the trip is a vacation rather than work george and alex fly into town where theyre immediately met by a collection of loving generous but somewhat eccentric group of characters whose main eccentricity is that they all believe in santa claus georgetown is a picture book community wed all love to live in and wed love the people for neighbors george soon meets a love interest in susan jane kazmarek were it not for the grinch renfield it would be an ideal time but the fact is he is in town to find property for renfield to develop and there is a nice ranch near town about to be foreclosed and the dark edges of the movie revolve around the impending foreclosure and the reactions of the townies the rancher and the outsiders i wont spoil the ending for those whove never seen the movie its a typical happy christmas ending but its handled in a fairly subtle and believable way that shows the best in the human spirit without being too syrupy all in all this is a most pleasant way to spend a couple of your christmas tv hours john denver and jane kazmarek have nice chemistry and gennie james as alex does a real nice job ive always loved the work of mary wickes a recognizable character actress and all of the other cast members do a nice job with less meaty parts this is a regular christmas fare for my family i rate it 45
