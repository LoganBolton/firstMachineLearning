living just down the hwy from georgetown coi remember this movie well and thought it was great the story seems like something john would do even in real life but there is something that i will always remember most about the movie for those of you who dont live in denverevery christmas the city of denver co puts up a fabulous display of lights and decorations at the civic center in downtown denver wellas it so happened during the filming of this movie a nativity scene was needed soit was borrowed from the civic center displaywith permission by the way someone had forgotten to advice the powers that be and it was reported stolen a frantic search began with law enforcement for a few days finally someone spoke up and remembered loaning it to the film crew in georgetown it was returned and put back where it belonged as it turns outit wasnt featured all that much in the movieyou can barely see it during the christmas show with the children it did create quit a disturbance though
