i must confess that ive been a huge fan of the almighty david the hoff hasselhoff ever since he starred in the hit 80s tv series knight rider whether its his extraordinary debut as a libidinous high school basketball player in the hilariously raunchy revenge of the cheerleaders or his brilliant portrayal of a dashing prince in the schlocky scifi gem starcrash the hoff has proved time and time again that hes a simply terrific and shamefully underrated actor supreme the hoff excels here as gary a cynical and skeptical photographer who along with his repressed virginal writer girlfriend leslie attractive brunette leslie cummings investigates a seedy dilapidated haunted hotel located on a remote island off the coast of massachussetts theyre doing research on witchcraft throughout the ages and the hotels last owner was an actress who allegedly practiced the black arts a bickering family also shows up on the premises to check out the hotel pretty soon various folks begin to get bumped off in assorted gruesome ways by the mysterious lady in black an effectively eerie hildegard knefbr br granted the rest of the cast gives the hoff a run for his money the everperky linda blair projects her customary charming flair as a spunky pregnant woman who winds up becoming possessed natch legendary jazz singer annie ross bitches it up with gleeful aplomb as a snippy old bat poor annie winds up being incinerated alive after she has her lips sewn shut and shes hung upside down in a chimney and gorgeous blonde catherine hickland oozes considerable sex appeal from every fetching pore as a lusty slut fabrizio laurentis competent direction a suitably creepy atmosphere gianlorenzo battaglias slick glossy cinematography the fluid prowling steadicam tracking shots are especially nice the gaudy special effects carlo maria cordio and randy millers spirited shudderynspooky score and the gory sadistic violence are all up to par but ultimately its the tremendously dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only the hoff which makes this choice tasty chunk of tacky italian horror cheese such a winner he takes his shirt off once hubba hubba gets sprayed with blood and  warning major spoiler ahead  even meets a pleasingly grisly untimely end produced by none other than joe damato this picture overall rates as good sleazy fun
