i saw farewell to harry at the plaza theatre while in new york city and was quite taken the performance of william hall jr is tremendous this is a movie for the classic movie goer garrett bennetts direction reminds me of early barry levinson and robert redfords work the movie seems to transcend the typical independent film it has a soul and a visual power that is quite unique i saw this with a small audience 400 who were captivated from the moment of the first credit to the last and although i wasnt out and out crying like the lady next to me i do have to admit i had a little watering in the eyesbr br
