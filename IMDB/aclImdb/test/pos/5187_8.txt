i recently purchased this on dvd as i hadnt heard of it and like robert carlylebr br obviously this movie is not going to have hollywood blockbuster special effectsin saying that though the special effects were decent enoughand the acting was fine alsobr br i found the movie to be enjoyable and do not regret buying it at allat almost 2 hours long it is just the right length for this type of moviebr br do not expect thrilling explosive action from beginning to end thoughit is a fairly well balanced movie with a decent enough storyline
