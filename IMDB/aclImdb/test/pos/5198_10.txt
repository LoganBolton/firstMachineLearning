stalingrad is a terrific movie well acted and directed and rather down to earth in its approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and its politics this is together with das boot one of the best war movies together with the finnish vinterkriget the winter war in english i believe it depicts the ordeals of some of the german soldiers that fought  and died  in and around stalingrad during world war 2 no big time heroics no over bearing emotional fuzziness only the fear of every day death in war the mood of the movie is similar to the one in das boot and that should give you some hints on what to expect i guess so if you enjoy realistic nonhollywoodish war movies rent it buy it just make sure you see it finally a film buffs note for some of the previous reviewers information i only want to add that stalingrad isnt directed by wolfgang petersen who made das boot
