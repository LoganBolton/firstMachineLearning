witchery is a decent little eurotrash horror yarn david hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly hes one of the better actors linda blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays hoffs wifeshe is hilariously bad the plot of this film is ridiculous too its got some holes which you cant help but notice but it remains entertaining throughoutbr br the gore in witchery is freaking outstanding i loved the part where the old bag gets sucked into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast and the part where the lady gets taken advantage of by the devil was pretty damned disturbing id say this one is a must for gorehoundsbr br if youre looking for an overproduced wellacted flick look elsewhere but if you like oldschool style italian sleaze and over the top gore witchery belongs on your shelfbr br im surprised by the low rating on here what were you people expecting the exorcist 7 out of 10 kids
