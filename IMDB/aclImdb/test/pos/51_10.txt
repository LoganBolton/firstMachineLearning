this was absolutely one of the best movies ive seen br br excellent performances from a marvelous alist cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and backbr br i couldnt help but care about the characters ms merkerson will blow you away as will the young man playing the young leadbr br i also thought that the set design was toprate the viewer is really placed inside each era as its presented br br the music is a blast too nice selections to represent mood time and place the blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs br br this is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings take the time to watch it
