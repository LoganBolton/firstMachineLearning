this movie tries to run away to the typical im fighting because im obliged to defend the fatherland the nazis are all bad guys im against them typical of german war movies how by not talking too much about it and just referring the war and the pows nevertheless i would like to see a german movie which would be something between the extremity of come and see and the bad nazis das boot i say this because excluding this factor the german movies are the best depicting 2nd world war and the german side you easily see some of the german hierarchical relations very different from the ones in us armybr br this is a movie which tries to get a real sight of what was stalingrad and i was not there and i doubt most people were there now but if i would choose one movie depicting this battle for sure would not be the all american enemy at the gates why do i say this because even the best soldiers are not heros and given the conditions they may regard their own lives instead of the fatherland this goes for all the ranks and in the end you see von paulus giving the example
