simply the best and most realistic movie about world war ii ive ever seen not only because the german soldiers talk german and russian soldiers talk russian no english in a german or russian dialectalso because of the realistic decor in which the movie was shot the acting is outstanding no hollywoodsentiment at all even no love storystalingrad was supposed to be one of the most horrific battles during the war and in such context theres no place for sentiment or romantic scenes what you get is a movie which will make you thrill to the bone and which have one of the best unhappy endings a movie could have
