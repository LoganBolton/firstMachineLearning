linda blair has been acting for forty years now and while she will never escape the part of regan macneil in the exorcist few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such great effect as witchery does she plays jane brooks a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase they are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents catherine hickland and rick farnsworth and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer david hasselhoff and his writer girlfriend leslie cumming who are illegally squatting in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch hildegard knef it seems that a longago witchhunt resulted in her suicide and she was with child at the time unaware of the danger jane has recently dreamt of the witchs dramatic death and janes little brother tommy michael manchester has been more directly visited by her spooky blackclad spirit which he calls the lady in black the groups time at the island inn begins quietly enough unknown to them however the lady in black has already dispatched the captain of their hired boat george stevens before long the isolation and cold begin to affect everyone and it is during this period of moodiness and tension that the lady in black begins her reign of terror she plans to avenge her own fate by possessing jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vengeful curse  greed lust and the blood of a virgin as the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild she haunts them one by one in gruesome horrifying ways the island location is effectively scary and the inn is very creepy and hauntingly shot its such a colorful film that it reminds me of dario argentos work the lighting is excellent and the set decoration is perfectly spooky the soundtrack is very effective and unique the horror effects are extreme terrifying and unforgettable the cinematography is great and it is this that brings us back to linda blair the creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot lots of dramatic pushins lingering closeups that subtly detail janes incremental possession and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films there are hidden homages to rosemarys baby jacobs ladder the shining black sunday and of course the exorcist she does a great job and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance that isnt to say that the rest of the cast disappoints catherine hickland is sexy and very good and veteran performer annie ross is memorable as janes bitchy mother rose hasselhoff gives it his best but he is not essentially a film star and his television persona gets in the way of his performance blair and young michael manchester have a wonderful chemistry together the film is otherwise so violent and creepy in a good way that it desperately needs their warmth blair also played a mother in 2003s monster makers and her maternal scenes in that film have the same tender feeling to them lastly hildegard knef in one of her last roles plays a great witch and she has the most amazing voice and accent along with blair she was also perfectly cast but its blairs movie all the way jane brooks also seems to have some psychic ability and this aspect of the film hearkens back to exorcist ii the heretic i think witchery is up there with the exorcist exorcist ii hell night and summer of fear as blairs best genre work to date
