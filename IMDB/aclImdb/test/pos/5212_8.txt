this is a film that i keep coming back to for a variety of reasons as a testament to the suffering of the ordinary soldier on the eastern front in the second world war it is a powerful one there are a number of very powerful scenes in the film which help to capture the horror of war such as the tank battle for instance furthermore from what i can see the experiences documented in the film are by and large true  if you read a beevors book stalingrad you will know what i mean the film is also successful in the sense that it doesnt allow character or plot to dominate it  it is simply a tale of survival that attempts to depict the battle mainly from the ordinary german soldiers point of view ive read somewhere that the original screenplay had to be toned down which doesnt surprise me at all  if they tried to really show what the battle was like it would have been almost impossible to make im sure even so there are still some moments that are difficult to watch  this was made before private ryan but is possibly even harderhitting in places just one word of caution  dont buy the dubbed english version its pretty awful and spoils the film  try to get a copy in the original german version with english subtitles its far more powerful you may need to buy a region 1 dvd of the film in this case as i did
