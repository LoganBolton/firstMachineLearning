witchery or witchcraft as its commonly known in europe beings with jane brooks linda blair waking up from a nightmare involving a witch janes mother  father rose annie ross  freddie robert champagne are interested in buying an old deserted hotel on an island about 50 miles from boston renovating it  reopening it together with jane  their young son tommy michael manchester rose  freddie are planning to travel to the island with an architect named linda sullivan catherine hickland to check on the amount of work that needs doing they also meet up with the estate agent jerry giordano rick farnsworth  hire a local fisherman named sam george stevens to take them to the island once there they enter the hotel  begin to inspect the property while back on the boat sam is killed  the boat is let loose to sail off into the distance they discover two unexpected guests in the shape of a photographer named gary david hasselhoff  his virgin fianc√© leslie leslie cumming who happens to be researching a book that she is writing about the gruesome legends  superstitions surrounding the infamous island  hotel as the night draws on a raging storm outside isolates them from the mainland as a mysterious lady in black hildegard knef keeps popping up as the ancient evil that resides in the hotel seeks fresh victims for demonic possession human sacrifice  satanic ritesbr br the director of this american italian coproduced film is somewhat shrouded in mystery as the imdb lists fabrizio laurenti as martin newlin but there are rumours that joe damato did the honours either way to be honest despite its bad reputation i found witchery quite entertaining in a sobaditsgood cheesy sort of way the script credited to harry spalding  daniele stroppa on the imdb again is confusing too as the actual credit on the film itself is daniel davis anyway whoever wrote this thing did a decent job please stop laughing at heart its a haunted house horror but adds some gory deaths  a surreal feeling to everything the different sets of characters have reasonable motives  didnt get on my nerves as much as id thought they might its not plotted very well it doesnt make a whole a lot of sense  the dialogue isnt exactly top drawer stuff but as a whole witchery entertained me for its 95 odd minute duration plain  simple its reasonably well paced a little slow to get going maybe but there are plenty of surreal bizarre goingson  gruesome deaths to keep one amused one part of witchery which destroys some of its credibility is this socalled storm there is no storm in sight  the sea is probably calm enough to swim in witcherys supposed twist ending didnt really work for me either  just check out the dumb expression on cummings face on that final freezeframe the hotel provides for a good isolated location  adds a certain atmosphere to the film which has the distinctive indefinable horror feel throughout cheap horror at that technically witchery is not too bad at all it was obviously shot on location so it looks good throughout  while not exactly the pinnacle of filmmaking finesse its overall production values are slightly better than expected the violence  gore is of typical euro explicitness a woman has her lips sewn shut  hung inside a fireplace so she cant scream as the others light it someone is crucified  then burned alive impaled on a swordfish someones veins expand  pop  a woman is raped by a man with no lips witchery was shot in english so there is no dubbing as far as acting goes david hasselhoff  linda blair in the same film what more can i say yes ladies hasselhoff does take his shirt off  for the lads cummings takes hers off both hasselhoff  blair are a hoot to watch in this thing however the little kid is very annoying  really cant act at all i sure most sane filmgoers will disagree with my opinions but i still stand by the fact that i liked it  would happily watch it again witchery is pretty good fun  definitely worth a watch if your into bad films or your a horror fan in general
