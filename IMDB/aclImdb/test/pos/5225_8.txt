its quite revealing to see this today and appreciate how far weve come along in what we expect from movies and at the same time appreciate how many bedrock notions were establishedbr br here we have a fullfledged narrative talking film  the audio and the visuals are pushed to their period limits the framing is limited to about belthigh and up  no face closeups br br the compositions are remarkable theres an early overtheshoulder cross cutting scene to showcase the dialogue theres a treacherous descent into a canyon with some harrowing perspective angles a sunbleached skeleton lies in the dust as the wheels and legs march in the upper portion of the frame the tension in the showdown between the hero and the bad guy is visually captured by filming above the long axis of a large tree that lies between them and on and on  early visual treats aboundbr br today its unsettling to see the young wayne carry a film unencumbered by ego or mannerismsbr br i have to wonder if walsh recognized the selfreference the subject is the journey of a disparate group of pilgrims those who appear on screen are a disparate group of stage actors vaudeville comedians shell game artists and probably carny barkers and teninone show veterans they all journey together to blaze a trail for how movies would be madebr br this is worth at least one viewing to appreciate the source of so many visual ideas borrowed in later movies
