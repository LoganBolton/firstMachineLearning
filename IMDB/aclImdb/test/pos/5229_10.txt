i first saw this film in video form even on a television screen the vistas were impressive seen on the big screen in its full glory it must have blown people awaybr br as one or two other comments have pointed out the story of the early pioneers and how they got around the problems of terrain etc on the road to oregon is as authentic as any film can be it therefore shows that it is totally unnecessary to take liberties with the truth  something that todays film makers should take heed of  reality is enoughbr br the plot relies on the struggle of man against the elements and hostile natives subplots are few and simple but the basic plot is enough elsewhere i have reviewed paramounts rival to the big trail fighting caravans in spite of having a more sophisticated plot and having better actors fighting caravans lacks the breathtaking scenesbr br the big trail should be compulsory viewing
