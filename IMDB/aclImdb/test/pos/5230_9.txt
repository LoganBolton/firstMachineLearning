best cinematography i have ever seenconsidering the year the movie was made i was absolutely amazed and thoroughly impressed with the amount of attention dedicated to the scenes and with what appears to be authenticity though i am not particularly a western movie buffevery single scene is given the utmost detail and it is haunting there is a sincere connection with nature at times i am overwhelmed with the amount of action passing through the scenes but i am never bored i feel as though i am truly peering into a time machine and looking back into the old west i recommend this movie to anyone who is studying set design location planning and for that matter photography in general it can be a humbling movie to experience with regards to the visuals considering this era of digital touchup that we now experience
