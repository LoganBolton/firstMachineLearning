i never expected such an old film to be as impressive as this 1930 western turned out to be the scenes of the pioneers heading west in their covered wagons encountering storms and mud river crossings indian attacks and every manner of trial and danger are astonishing in their rugged believability much of the film was shot outdoors and the movie has a truly epic feel about it the actors must have experienced much the same conditions as the original pioneers did and the results are astounding the wagons the clothing every single detail looks and feels right the characters are simple but believable with a straightforward story that travels like the wagon train to its destinationbr br john wayne is slim and youthful in one of his first roles as the scout leading the wagons and he does a fine job as the idealistic young frontiersman hes up against a marvelously scurvy trio of villains including ian keith as a slick gambler charles stevens as a mexican sidekick and tyrone power senior as the growly bearlike trapper powers bearded snarling larger than life portrayal is both comic and menacing i keep picturing him with a bandanna gold hoop earring and black eye patch with a parrot on his shoulder as he grunts and growls various threats and insults his character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship with no difficulty at all he nearly steals the whole picturebr br tully marshall is delightful as a wily old frontiersman who is waynes best friend the lovely marguerite churchill makes a spirited heroine whose initial meeting with wayne is a hilarious mixup resulting in a long running courtship consisting of insults and feigned indifference on her part to aw shucks persistence on his the results are quite humorous and one is glad to see them finally get together at the endbr br the scenery is amazing with the wagons crossing real prairies and having to be lowered by ropes down cliffs indians who are clearly the genuine article and not white actors in makeup appear as both friends and foes and are treated with dignity waynes character tells an admiring group of young boys that the indians are his friends who taught him everything he knows about survival in the wildernessbr br the big trail is an uncomplicated tale told well by a talented cast and crew it will probably appear naive to many modern viewers but there is a quiet dignity about it that never lets it become corny there is a great deal of intentional humor including a rowdy rascal of a pioneer who makes loud animal sounds from hiding  every time the smooth gambler ian keith tries to con the beautiful heroine into marrying him his flowery speeches about the plantation he allegedly owns are interrupted by very realistic imitations of yowling cats and quacking ducks causing the would be seducer to look around in annoyance for the unseen creaturesbr br highly recommended both for western fans and lovers of old movies in general this is truly a classic film for the ages
