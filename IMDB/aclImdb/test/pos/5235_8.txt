one of the myths of the early sound era is that they couldnt make westerns because they had trouble recording sound on location in fact it was the financial restrictions of the depression that temporarily killed off the genre at least in the a budget bracket however in the period 19291931 before the economic downturn had really kicked in the a western flourished notable examples including the virginian billy the kid and cimarron the big trail was perhaps the biggest of them all  a gargantuan pioneer western shot in an early widescreen process appropriately titled grandeur thanks to a recent dvd release we now get to see the widescreen version alongside the fullscreen that was shot simultaneouslybr br the director was raoul walsh a man for whom the spirit of adventure lay in vast outdoor vistas and thus in many ways a perfect choice he makes great use of the wider frame to show off the western landscape at its most breathtaking very typical of walsh are a number of shots towards the beginning such as the one where a woman is chopping firewood most of the screen is tightly filled by the wagons and other clutter but in one corner we see the wilderness stretching out invitingly when the wagon train gets going the open plain is gradually revealed to us with wagons pulling away like stage curtains these shots are not so effective in the fullscreen version yet on the wider canvas walshs expression of the outdoors was never betterbr br but theres an unfortunate flipside to this when it comes to dialogue scenes walshs tendency is to place the actors in the middle of the shot as if they were in an imaginary fullscreen box the extra width becomes just that  extra it may seem logical at first because it means that heightwise we see as much of the actors as we would in a fullscreen picture however it makes the players look small and insignificant within the frame while all the background business dominates the shot  and there is a lot of background business in the big trail when widescreen formats reemerged in the 1950s many directors would make the same mistake before eventually realising that in talkie scenes it is better to frame actors from around the chest up losing some of their height but allowing them to fill the screenbr br its a pity because the big trail is a particularly wellbalanced and finely scripted effort the romance and revenge subplots are simple but well defined and do not threaten to overbalance each other or the pioneer story it could have been a great intimate epic but it loses dramatic weight because every time characters start talking to each other we get distracted by herds of cattle drifting wagons or whatever else is filling every spare inch of frame still walshs sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable there are also some nice comedy touches largely courtesy of comical swede el brendelbr br the big trail is also notable for being john waynes first lead role while wayne is another victim of the distant framing in dialogue scenes we do at least see his strong physical presence and hear his warm but assertive vocal delivery he betrays his lack of experience but the potential is clearly there sadly that potential wasnt widely realised at the time and he spent the rest of the decade slumming it in bpictures before he finally hit stardom also appearing in this picture is waynes buddy and later prolific character actor ward bond hes not credited but you can spot him in a number of scenes most prominently around the 80minute mark where he is stood to tyrone powers leftbr br the big trail is a glorious epic that manages to defeat itself as a drama and it was this stupendous scale that would put the western and widescreen to bed for some time and although the 40s and 50s are now regarded as the golden age of the western it was by then a changed genre with stories of individual adventure and heroism in an established west  no better or worse but of a different form the early talkie period was the end of an era in which westerns could be truly gigantic
