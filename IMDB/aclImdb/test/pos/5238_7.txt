sweeping and still impressive early talkie western of pioneering days other contemporary films in the same vein include the covered wagon 1923 the iron horse 1924 and cimarron 1931  none of which ive watched though i do have the latter on vhs it was simultaneously filmed in the standard fullscreen ratio and in an experimental widescreen process called grandeur but only the former has been released on the barebones fox dvd one can only surmise how it would look in a wider ratio but the careful framing  not to mention the splendid cinematography  is evident enough even in the standard versionbr br young john wayne is surprisingly commanding in the lead a role which however didnt lead to the expected stardom  as hed languish in b westerns for the best part of the next decade before john ford came to his rescue with stagecoach 1939 anyway he and marguerite churchill from draculas daughter 1936 make a nice couple  despite her somewhat tedious character supporting characters include a variety of stock types veteran westerner comicrelief sidekick with a penchant for making noises with his mouth burly and uncouth villain played by tyrone power sr his two slimy cohorts a mexican and a southerner the latter also filling in as waynes rival for churchills hand etc also among the members of the wagon party is a timid swede full of optimism for the promised land but whos continually put down by his irascible motherinlaw and later wayne regular ward bondbr br the episodic narrative resolves itself into a number of alternately cornball lyrical and actionpacked vignettes  as we see the prospective settlers combating the elements the indians and themselves the film however has a completely authentic feel to it which smooths over its essentially dated and static quality also the editing is somewhat choppy particularly during the second half  little wonder since the dvd edition of the film is only 108 minutes long against the complete 158minute grandeur version
