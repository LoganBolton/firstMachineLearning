i really liked this filmit features john wayne in his first starring performanceeven thenyou can tell wayne has a real presencealthough he wouldnt really mature into the icon he is known for until stagecoach9 years later in 1939its about settlers from all over the country heading to the new west to colonize itwaynes character breck coleman joins upbut for his own personal reasonsmost of the main actors were stage actors and had never done a film beforewhich makes the movie even more amazingthey managed to create believabledistinctive characters and there is quite an oddball mix herecimarron would come out a year laterand had a very similar storythough i didnt like it as much as this moviefor methe big trail is a strong 810
