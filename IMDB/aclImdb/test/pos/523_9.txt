during the making of this movie i once caught a statement on television about it something like is killingg√§nget now taking off nazismbr br so my comprehension of this movie was from the beginning to get a notion of nazism when recently seeing this movie in the tvversion i had this filter before me and it wasnt difficult to see thisbr br strangely enough i havent met this way of interpreting the film ever since i first heard itbr br these are the things i found in four shades of brown in all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disasterbr br 1 the crematoryworker shows no realistic empathy to the dead animals or to those who had to say goodbye to them in the crematoryroom in dealing with death and fire its almost like a cheerful game to him the seriousness of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and his boy accordingly in ignorance pushes a button that leads to the disaster that injures his father severelybr br possible lesson the importance of showing the young adequate emotions when they grow up they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to goodbr br 2the magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer just when she thinks she has begun to cut off the strings to the masters hand reaching for personality integrity and joy he pulls hard and she is back in desolation and despairbr br their son has tried to revolt in creating his own life with perfection and good taste in opposite to his parents bad taste the real problem he is carrying within is far from comprehensible to him his fathers behavior passes on when suffocating his own wife in his spotless environmentbr br possible lesson oppression breeds bondagebr br 3the father who was abused as a child passes on sadism to his children when he cheats them on their inheritance he robs them of their childhood and in the end even of their inheritancebr br possible lesson when no love given you cannot give anybr br 4the fathers abuse of his daughter creates in her a ruthless revenger with sadistic aggression here the ice cold nazisadism becomes very obvious in physical violence it gives a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation to the actions of young scinheadnazists behavior when oppressing others br br possible lesson  can nazism take birth in a pervert homebr br can the hideous consequence of ignoring empathy in family life in the long run be that room is given to sadistic nazism br br very seldom does a movie contains so much it reveals little by little as i meditate on it i consider it brilliantly painted and the actors are superb especially the niceseeming bloke played by ulf brunnberg that turns out to be the worst of all
