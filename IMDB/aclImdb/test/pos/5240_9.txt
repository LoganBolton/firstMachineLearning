i just recently bought the big trail 1930 its an awesome amazing film i knew it by reputation but never expected it to be so magnificent my version is the one shot in 35mm and ill speak of that again later when one thinks of the western myth in film the names that come to mind are john ford and john wayne well you have only half the team here but the entire myth is present raoul walsh has given us a remarkable epic in which the true plot is the struggle of the westward expansion of the nation br br there is a plot centering on a romance between breck coleman wayne and ruth cameron margaret churchill with the main villain red flack being memorably played by tyrone power sr but this has an almost incidental quality as the wagon train struggles forward against incredible obstaclesboth natural and human examples are the crossing of the river the indian battle and traversing the burning desert the aftermath of the battle is given a sombre touch when a doll is placed on the grave of a child killed while a faithful dog lies down on its masters gravebr br magnificent panoramas are filled with energy and activity the opening scene as the wagon train prepares to leave the square dance interlude and the great buffalo herds are some that spring to mind marvellous use is made of location shooting throughout another feature of this splendid film is the fact that men and women are given equal credit for their parts in the great struggle westward women work fight and confront the terrible hardships with the same fortitude and strength as their male counterparts the finale has a powerfully uplifting experience as coleman and cameron meet in the gigantic towering sequoia forest to start their new life br br the acting is quite acceptable throughout ive already mentioned tyrone powers scenestealing performance tully marshall is excellent as colemans sidekick and marguerite churchill convincingly portrays a woman who develops an inner strength as she encounters her own problems as well as those external to herself the comicrelief is the weakest aspect of this film but these scenes are not common and are swallowed up in the tremendous sweep of the filmbr br ive read much criticism of waynes performancesome even going so far as to blame his wooden acting for the failure of the film at the boxoffice i think this is unfair wayne was in his first major role and certainly had not developed the charisma of his performance in stagecoach but he still does a serviceable job in a role which is certainly going to play second fiddle to the great overarching theme after the big trail wayne played in a large number of lowbudget b westerns i have a number of these and one can see the developing actor in them when stagecoach came he was ready for it and the big trail was a significant part of that apprenticeshipbr br i mentioned earlier that my version is the one shot in 35mm its still impressive but to get some idea of the effect of the 70mm version i set the tv screen to 169 which doesnt cause any distortion while not having the complete effect of the grandeur version it was good enough to make me want to get the latter in addition the film shot in 70mm has a few extra scenes not in the form made for ordinary theatrical showingbr br allinall this film deserves to be in any list of the greatest westerns ever made
