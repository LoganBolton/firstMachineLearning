what some mistake for stilted dialog andor dismiss as archetypal characterizations accurately represents how people talked lived and were before world war ii let alone in whatever years the big trail represent on filmbr br the movie took my breath away the first time i saw it years ago reading the boards here helped me understand why it missed at the box office and why movie goers got the benefit of wayne in b westerns for another ten years wayne was in my opinion better in the big trail and the years of bs than most of his star turns after 1939 with fords incredible cavalry trilogy true grit and the shootist being big time exceptionsbr br what a shame theaters missed the boat on this in 1930 had this movie hit we might have enjoyed more movies with more realism and less hokum in my opinion this is not only one of the finest westerns ever filmed with accurate dialog and accurate character realization but among the finest representations of a passage of any kind ever put on filmbr br it still takes my breath away especially the dialog and accurate characterizations of types that simply dont exist any more some celebrate the surface homogenization of our culture that in fact hides the largest cultural degradation into people like us and people like them and political divide corporatists vs main streetists in us history but for me the big trail represents a time when our surface differences were more obvious but underneath them most folks wanted to work out the nations failures and most folks aspired to build a great culture and a great nationbr br the big trail is an epic of the melting pot in motion toward the american dream certainly the finest film on that path i ever saw that subject ever filmed
