john wayne is one of the few players in film history to have failed at his first big break and then succeed on the second time around of course everyone knows the second time was the classic stagecoach with john ford directingbr br but were here to talk about the big trail john fords fellow director raoul walsh spotted this tall kid on the set of one of fords films and thought he had potential he wanted to make him the lead in a big budget western that fox was planning to do the film as planned would be an homage to the famous classic silent western the covered wagonbr br in watching the big trail i was struck by how similar waynes character of breck coleman here is to the ringo kid in stagecoach both characters were likable young cowpokes but both were also on a mission of vengeance and of course both films were done on location and show the expense in making them no studio product here with a backlot western set br br i also dont think that it was an accident that wayne got this break at the beginning of the sound era raoul walsh im guessing looked around hollywood and probably didnt think a whole lot of movie cowboys would have staying power in sound thats something else walsh spotted in waynebr br according to what ive read the big trail flopped because after spending all that money to make the film in an early wide screen process some genius at fox realized that their theaters werent equipped with the wide screen to show it and when the great depression hit there would be no money to widen those screens at fox movie houses so the big trail got a limited release even in what we would call a formatted version and lost money big for fox filmsbr br marguerite churchill is fine as the crinoline heroine who duke wins loses and wins again from ian keith keith charles stevens and f tyrone power are the trio of villains wayne has to deal withbr br f tyrone power is the father of the famous movie legend tyrone power he was a big burly man with a grand background in classic roles on screen and on stage i wouldnt be surprised if his son who would have been 15 at the time might not have been hanging around the setbr br also look for ward bond though you might have trouble spotting him under a big bushy beardbr br watching the big trail now it is interesting to speculate where john waynes career might have gone if the big trail had been a big hit
