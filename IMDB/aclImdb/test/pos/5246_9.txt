john waynes first starring role just blew me away televised letterbox style on amc i had to check and make sure i had the right date sure enough this 1930 film was made using a 55 mm widescreen process aside from that it features some of the grittiest most realistic footage of the trek west ive seen wagons men and animals are really lowered down a cliff face by rope trees are chopped by burly men  and burly women  so the train can move another 10 feet the indians are not the pretty boy city slickers who portrayed them later theyre the real deal a river crossing in a driving rain storm is so realistic it has to be real in fact i understand that director raoul walsh nearly lost the entire cast during this sequence i could smell the wet canvas each day is an agony the various subplots are forgettable but the film as a whole is not i cant think of another title that can beat the big trail in evoking a sense of living history on the trail to oregon bravo
