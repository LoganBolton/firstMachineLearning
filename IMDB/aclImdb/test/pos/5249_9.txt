this is an extraordinary film musically it made me feel awful that rodrigues died in 1999 before i had a chance to see her live to know that she performed a marvelous lincoln ctr concert in 1991  that i mightve been there but wasnt is painful beyond wordsbr br i just purchased my first amalia recording while the musical recording is fantastic being able in this film to see her face  its tremendous expressiveness  passion as she sings these songs of terrible sadness is wonderful sort of like seeing the face of mary as she cradles jesus in her arms in the pieta watching her on film reminded me of being witness to a similar extraordinary concert performance by mercedes sosa in the mid 1990s at lincoln ctr as i sat listening to mercedes sing i felt i was in the presence of a tremendous spiritual  musical force that contained awesome primal power some of the art of amalias musical segments are touching such as caetano veloso paying tribute to amalia  singing one of her songs solo in front of a packed concert hall the musical segments also convey the incredible international sweep of her musical repertoire  the bonds she created w fans throughout the entire world there is one segment in which she claims that she has played in every single town in italy that has a stagebr br in another section amalia talks about her bout w mouth cancer  how she came to nyc to commit suicide in a hotel yet through watching fred astaire film videos she gradually persuaded herself that life was worth living  turned away from killing herself amazing later in the film she quite bravely  directly admits to the interviewer that though she mightve conquered the world musically her personal life was one of pure sadness she admits that she has never been happy this is unbearably sad to hear but perfectly in keeping w a singer steeped in the fado which she translates as bad destiny or bad luck tradition also one longs to hear more about her personal life what was in that made her so sad what were her disappointmentsbr br the art of amalia is a little disappointing in other major areas my quibbles to show 2030 full songs in the film yet to only provide an english translation for the very last one seems a waste unless the film was only intended for a portuguese speaking audience which i cant imagine to see the profound pain on her face as she sings  not to understand the lyrics is a let down as for the other minuses there is almost no biographical material about amalias family background there is one 20 sec snippet w her singing w her mother its absolutely grand there is one short reference to her parents moving fr the countryside to lisbon i wouldve loved to see film footage of the village she came from the interviews such as they are are almost solely w amalia herself  a few close friends she is a good but not great subject there are no interview subjects who are experts on fado or portuguese culture  society so we get no depth of understanding of her musical rootsbr br in short this is a wonderful film that everyone interested in amalia should see but its not a perfect or definitive work on the subject
