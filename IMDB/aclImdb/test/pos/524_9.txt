this movie must be exported to the rest of the world an absolute masterpiece with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in sweden the one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four odd story about love or career i would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended br br also the unique pause in the middle is something ive never seen beforebr br cant wait for the series if theyre doing one or the extended dvd apparently they had cut out a lot to fit it in to just 35 hours
