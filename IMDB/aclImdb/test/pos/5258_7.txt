i will freely admit that i havent seen the original movie but ive read the play so ive some background with the original if you shuck off the fact that this is a remake of an old classic this movie is smart witty fresh and hilarious yes the casting decisions may seem strange but they work br br im a staunch feminist and i wasnt offended in the slightest by this moviedespite what other women might be saying this is not a movie for men to see so please ladies dont drag your guys to see it with you thats just cruel women will get the jokes the situations and the relationships br br i was pleasantly surprised by the depth that annette bening brought to her charactershe did an excellent job debra messing was adorable and candice bergen was fantastic i was less impressed by meg ryanshe brought emotion to the table but her comedic take on it was less strong the allfemale cast is strong and it definitely a laughoutloud sort of comedy i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and fully intend to go see it again with my mother women will understand
