i didnt know what to expect from this hugely popular and hilarious swedish comedy  satire team as they released their first feature film more broad satire well we do get four contemporary exceptionally memorable tales of family pains generation gaps and fatherhood in particular but its drama thankfully and what drama epic in its scope as each episode is from carefully picked geographically different parts of sweden but each story could seriously carry a whole movie if expanded separatelybr br its dark twisted harrowing yet massively entertaining and breathtakingly executed script acting and cinematography are absolute world class as three hours seem to get by in a blink its four shades of mastery and easily one of the best films in the nations cinema history its swedens answer to short cuts or magnolia if you like and instantly on par with thosebr br 9 out of 10 from ozjeppe
