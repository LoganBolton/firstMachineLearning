the people who dont like this movie seem to have some academic vendetta against it  those of us who dont hold the original can totally enjoy itbr br my husband who had never seen the original said i dont want to see a girly movie i assured him that the women is just a great movie not a girl movie he had a great time he was very glad to have gone and enjoyed it more than the boy movie we saw the day before burn after reading br br spoiler i even think the new ending is better maybe not quite as fun but it was beautiful at first i couldnt understand why they had made certain changes to the plotbr br but when i got the end and debra messing gives birth and brings the first male into the movie i cried thats one thing to love about men Â– they are our sons
