a terrific comedydrama about the powers of friendship despite its a remake of a 1939 film of the same title it would probably be compared to sex and the city i would not compare to it totally the story starts with marymeg ryan who seems to the life most women would envy shes happily married has a good daughter great friends and a great home but marys perfect life isnt what it seems when she discovers her husband is cheating on her with crystaleve mendes from zachs mary is puzzled and doesnt know what to do but her four good friends sylviaannette bening ediedebra messing and alexjada pickett smith try to be there for her in anyway they can i really dont want to give anymore away but i found this enjoyable and im a man meg ryan is great it is nice to see her in on the screen again after a series of flops and the rest of the cast are also great including eve mendes as crystal just an enjoyable lighthearted comedy
