vidor shines as judith the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family her brother david is so downtrodden by their father that its a surprise hes able even to tie his shoes rather than asking dad to do it for himbr br other reviewers have already outlined the plot so i wont rehash it i will however point out that nan who is pregnant by david is also married to him this is not an outofwedlock pregnancy which would have been horrific by 1921 standards the two are secretly married but nans father having been paid by davids father tears up their marriage certificatebr br nans death scene with judith in attendance is a truly heartrending experience and highly charged with emotion this scene alone is worth watching the movie for but theres far more to the plot than that why on earth arent modern movies made with the same attention to the story
