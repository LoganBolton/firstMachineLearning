im impressed that hail the woman was made at all released just one year after american women got the vote this turgid drama makes an earnest plea against the sexual double standard which judges womens sexual behaviour more harshly than mensbr br slight spoilers ahead a prologue set in the plymouth colony in 1621 shows a pilgrim girl sentenced to the ducking stool for flirting with a boy the boy is not penalised now we come to flint hill new hampshire in the present 1921 oliver beresford theodore roberts is a bombastic biblethumper what we call in britain and australia a godbotherer beresford is determined that his son david lloyd hughes become a preacher regardless of how david feels about it as for beresfords daughter judith  well beresford is confident that women arent important enough to be anything more than wives and mothers apparently god told him this personallybr br davids evangelical career is compromised when he impregnates nan higgins the stepdaughter of the local oddjobs man tully marshalls character is identified in the credits solely as the odd jobs man but a closeup of a cheque reveals his name to be jake higgins the prejudices of 1921 require that he be merely nans stepfather not her biological parent to save his son from scandal beresford buys off nans stepfather with a cheque nan goes off to the big city to melt into oblivion as one more unwed motherbr br judith is naturally dismayed by the limitations imposed upon her by her gender or rather by other peoples perceptions of it she meets wyndham gray excellent performance by edward martindel an author who encourages her to transcend sexist stereotypes but judith is informally engaged to local lout joe hurd who wont put up with such nonsense hurd is played by vernon dent a burly performer now remembered solely for comedy roles as a second banana to harry langdon and as a villain in three stooges movies he gives an excellent performance here in a role outside his usual range sadly in real life dent spent his final years in poverty and total blindness due to diabetic retinopathybr br eventually judith ends up working at an orphanage this being 1921 i expected the orphanage to be whitesonly so i was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to include one chinese boy and unpleasantly surprised when hes used as the butt for a racial joke the movie makes one odd error here in a christmas sequence we see the orphanage mistress reciting a visit from saint nicholas  but in a dialogue title she credits santa claus with six reindeer rather than eight this is followed by a brief animation sequence showing santa with six reindeer hitched to his sleigh i assume that the animators either by accident or to save money left out two reindeer and the title card revised the poem to match the errorbr br lloyd hughes was generally a bland and unimpressive actor his most famous performance is his role in the lost world where hes easily upstaged by a rampaging brontosaurus for his climactic scene in hail the woman hughes gives a memorable performance as he finally rebels against his fathers tyranny in his performance as the gospelshouting father theodore roberts has been accused of overacting to the point of making his role a caricature i disagree sadly decades after this film was made i continue to encounter holy fools exactly like this man  willing to destroy the lives of everyone around them and firmly convinced they have gods authority to do sobr br in the central role of judith beresford florence vidor gives a sensitive realistic and intelligent performance i normally dislike vidor who tended to be cast in glamour roles but wasnt pretty enough to justify them here her characters physical appearance is less relevant than usualbr br this entire film is impressively directed by john griffith wray a director who deserves to be much better known sadly wray died at the onset of the talkies era in his midthirties had he lived another ten years he would surely have helmed several early sound classics in hail the woman there are several extremely beautiful screen compositions i was especially impressed by a scene in the new england forest when vidor and dent have a quarrel in front of an enormous uprooted tree i wonder where this was actually filmed hail the woman deals with unpleasant subject matter but it deserves to be much better known and ill rate this ambitious drama 9 out of 10
