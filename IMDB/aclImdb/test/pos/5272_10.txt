the phenomenon helge schneider defies easy description or quick categorization yet for the international audience not acquainted to him one could say hes something like a crude mix of weird al yankovich and andy kaufman adding a foible for jazz music and 70s outfits while his stage performances already are eccentric his movie works are simply hilariously outrageousbr br 00 schneider is in my opinion helges best movie he stars in the two leading roles  police detective kommissar 00 schneider and murderervillain nihil baxter and also in a precious smaller role as physician dr hasenbeinbr br in the opening scene we see how modernartloving baxter accidentally kills the circus clown bratislav metulskie from whom he has bought a malfunctioning used jaguar when a beloved sculpture slips out of baxters hands fatally hitting metulskie upon reading about the incident in the newspaper 00 comes back from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick lt koerschgen who is played by an elderly actor bearing the same name they pick up baxters track quickly and interrogate him at his weirdly decorated mansion one of the movies best scenes but initially fail to gather any proof the story winds through many turns with several scenes that dont always really contribute to the progress of the plot but are hilariously funny such as a daydream by 00 including the most unusual view on a running mans briefclad crotch in movie history a policedepartment party during which koerschgen gets into a row with the chief and has to be hospitalized and a visit at the already mentioned dr hasenbeins baxter then is finally caught attempting to escape to rio de janeiro on a planebr br always worth special mention is andreas kunze who in this case plays 00s wife as hes usually appearing in drag performing womens roles in helges moviesbr br so all you folks out there looking for new laughs i strongly recommend this movie the catch you have to understand german as i doubt theres an english version around
