okay if this film had been made much later in the history of cinema it wouldnt be particularly worthwhile however in 1898 films were in their infancy and they were almost all rather dull and had no real story to tellinstead just showing normal everyday folks doing everyday activities if seen today almost all of them are hopelessly dull and very very shortoften less than one minute long and so in light of this this short clip of a movie is pretty swell stuff and might just make you laugh two guys a miller and a chimney sweep bump into each otherfalling and throwing flour and coal dust all over each other as they tussle thats allthe film is over before you know it
