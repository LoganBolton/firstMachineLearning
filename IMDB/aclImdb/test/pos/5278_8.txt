rendered in beautiful water colors ponyo at the cliff is definitely a sight to behold vaguely remembering the trailer witch i didnt find that impressive i was surprised at how beautiful and detailed it was this film just washed over me with its puritybr br at the center is a young boy that comes into contact with a sea creature and its their relationship that carries the movie miyazaki is a master both at creating memorable imagery and showing young ones interacting in a believable way with their little quirks intactbr br there are a few parts that didnt sit well with me it would be an understatement to say that the music during a particular scene resembled ride of the valkyrians its a shame because such a precious film as this cant afford to take liberties and it hurt a otherwise truly great scene the antagonist and its backstory never interested me either but i guess it served more as a background then anything elsebr br anyway great film the boat trip scenario with all its imagery and seacreatures stood out me thinks pure and magical and yes handrawn artwork is more intimate then computer animated im really pumped for princes and the frog now
