my first exposure to japanese animation director hayao miyazaki and his studio ghibli production company was when an englishdubbed version of spirited away was released about 7 years ago what a wonderfully creative and unique film experience that was so on that note i managed to get my movie theatreemployed friend to see this new film of miyazaki with me especially since he loves all things disney this movies us distributor once again all i can say is wow what awesome visuals concerning the way water is depicted as the oceanand what about the title characters transformation from a goldfish toand seeing how some characters demeanor changesand well watch this movie if you want to know what im talking about oh and the voices being used for this americandubbed version tina fey betty white liam neeson cloris leachman and lily tomlin good choices all does everything make sense no but thats part of the childlike charm that permeates throughout theres plenty of funny scenes concerning ponyo and the boy and many other people they encounter oh i think ive written too much so ill just highly recommend hayao miyazakis ponyo
