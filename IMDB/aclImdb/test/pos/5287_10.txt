few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this abilitybr br no too many are focused on john lassiters amazing ability to steal other movies plots turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius    but i digressbr br miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues usually ecologically themed and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance still miyazaki almost never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies childrenbr br that said i am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability where else are you going to have a film where a three year old my nephew link will sit still throughout the move enthralled a 7 year old my niece amber loving it all her own and able to appreciate the star power of frankie jonas and noah cyrus a 12 year old my nephew aaron whos review was of course it was good everything miyazakisan does is good a 32 year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation er that would be me and a 58 year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother characters and im betting the older charas too and loving the cuteness of the child charactersbr br and that is what i respect most about miyazakisan he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker on the surface ponyo could be seen as a simple story about a little fishgirl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there a little boy names soske somewhat like the little mermaid but there is an entire different level at play here true to form miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters ponyos mother soskes mother the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willedbr br but the girl who takes the cake is ponyo herself once she decides that she likes the human world she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams her father is trying to keep her innocent and keep her a magical fish but young ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination br br once human she teams up with her friend soske whom she loves very much although maybe not as much as ham soske is asked to be the man of the house at age five when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by ponyo on her quest to become human frankie jonas yes hes related to the jonas brothers can we just get past that please gives perhaps the best performance in the film as young soske which is good since he has the most lines his character is also strong willed but also very respectful and friendly characteristics youre not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacificbr br in the end ponyos father fujimoto must cope with his daughters decision and his estranges wifes wishes to allow her to be human he hopes that ponyo and soske will remember him fondly and once again miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical bad guy although miyazaki has for some reason received some criticism for this it is honestly what makes his movies magical and yet relatable no one in real life is completely a bad person all humans are various shades of gray and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters br br and then theres the animation itself in a time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film especially the water miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means but every film in this was handdrawn and i for one was extremely grateful for that the character animation was extremely fluid and there even appeared to be some lipsync going on quite unusual for an anime film the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience this is what animation used to look like and what it should look like br br in the end i found ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable certainly not miyazakis best in my opinion that honor is still held by kikis delivery service but still a 10star fun movie for the entire family
