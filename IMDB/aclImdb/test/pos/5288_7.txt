hayao miyazaki has captured the imagination of audiences young and old across the globe and his most recent cinematic work of art is ponyo a childrens fairytale borrowing on story elements from the little mermaid of course like other miyazaki classics such as spirited away and his last film howls moving castle ponyo is full of a creativity that can only be truly appreciated by adults but this it is distinctly more a childrens story than those recent efforts its a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable aiming for charm instead of conflictbr br ponyo is the story of a bugeyed childishlooking fish of the same name the daughter of an undersea sorcerer who longs to escape the sea and become a little girl when she does she quickly befriends a young boy named sosuke in the process she gains a strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of balance between land and sea and a giant storm drowns most of the clifftop town where sosuke lives with his mother and it threatens to end the worldbr br like howls moving castle walt disney picked up ponyo for an american release and dubbed it over with an impressive selection of western voices even choosing homegrown products in the youngest siblings of disney band the jonas brothers frankie jonas and miley cyrus younger sister noah to voice sosuke and ponyo respectively also voicing characters are liam neeson fujimoto ponyos father tina fey lisa sosukes mother matt damon sosukes father cate blanchett ponyos sea goddess mother and a trio of hilarious elderly women are played by betty white cloris leachman and lily tomlin the effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to american audiences and disney is getting closebr br but voices are of little significance in a miyazaki film which is all about visual creativity a fan of transformations and animating liquid and fluid motion creating a fairytale taking place partly underwater mustve been a joy for miyazaki to work with and maybe even his entire motivation for choosing this story among the highlights are droplets of water that fujimoto sends after ponyo that move like living waves as well as a variety of other magnificent sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make ponyo as awing as any other miyazaki filmbr br as a childrens story however ponyo concentrates its efforts on being adorable the discovery of true friendship and love between sosuke and ponyo is heartwarming even if noah cyrus shouting childishly when ponyo excitedly embraces human life can get a bit annoying but as delightful as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships are theres very little antagonism or danger past miyazaki films have clear villains but the conflict in ponyo actually shrinks as the story goes along sosuke believes hes lost his mother at one point and in the background is the idea of the world going out of whack and that humans should be ashamed of polluting the sea but ponyo is mostly tension free most glaringly its climax is uneventful despite how overall likable all the characters arebr br ponyo will surely satisfy miyazakis fans in every way with its imagination and newcomers will still be smitten by his simple yet visually ambitious storytelling but this is distinctly more of a childrens movie best for families and others who love fantasy regardless of its form or target audience its not quite what youd expect from miyazaki considering his recent work but its sure to be remembered as another of his beloved stories steven cbr br visit my site at httpmoviemusereviewsblogspotcom
