like the 5year old protagonists of his latest opus hayao miyazakis ponyo enchants with its unbridled innocence as though the animemeister has become a child himself in weaving a narrative that relishes in its simplicity and emits an infectious charm in the process miyazaki recalling his earlier works paints a brightlycolored world obviously geared for the younger audiences and the raw effervescence gleefully strips off the grim thematic elements that distinguish its immediate predecessorsbr br ponyo voiced lovably by yuria nara a fish with a young girls face making her look like a cuddly child in a pink overgrown halloween costume escapes away from her underwater home and her school of siblings to explore the surface stranded ashore she is rescued by sosuke hiroki doi a fiveyear old boy who along with his mom risa tomoko yamaguchi resides in a house on the nearby cliff this initial encounter and eventually friendship has a profound effect on ponyo who now wishes to become human but by becoming so inadvertently tips natures balance and unleashes a maelstrom on land with sosukes help ponyo must pass a test to lift this curse and completely become a humanbr br despite the plot lacking the philosophical sophistication of say his most recent spirited away ponyo is nothing short of an astounding followup characterized by the extremely diligent attention to detail and masterful balancing of the real and the fantastic and of the simple joys and great fears its a straightforward tale that though at times stalled by its tendency to ramble like a toddler keeps in tune with its youthful pedigree to magically enthrall i will protect you sosuke tells ponyo matteroffactly a childlike assertion not unlike the manner in which miyazaki endows his story with artful spirit
