perhaps not miyazakis best work but i couldnt help but love it to death a fiveyear old boy finds what he thinks is a goldfish stuck in a bottle he saves its life and keeps it in a bucket as a pet but it really is a magical being the daughter of a human wizard and a sea goddess ponyo as the boy names her is taken back to the sea by her father who tries to discourage her from returning to land and becoming human but she gets into his magic elixirs and does what she wants to do the story is simple and cute where the film really comes alive though is in its tremendous artwork the drawings are more childlike than in any of miyazakis other works but theres beauty in its simplicity as with all of his films miyazaki creates this world of imagination that i was just so in awe of seeing it in the theater brought back memories of what it was like when the opening notes of jo hisaishis score for princess mononoke washed over me and gave me goosebumps just short of a decade ago the score here is equally as wonderful i wanted to live in this world and never leave it
