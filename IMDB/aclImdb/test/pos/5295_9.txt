it has been widely agreed that hayao miyazaki is a master at his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful story lines and similarly imaginative characters his movies from nausicaa totoro kiki laputa and mononoke to the recent howls moving castle are all not only gorgeously rendered in terms of art but in terms of moviemaking as well can this man do no wrong not really but it is impossible to expect everyone of his movies to always be five star marvels his newest film ponyo an unashamedly familyfriendly tale of a goldfish out of water is as lushly animated and alive with interesting characters as you would expect and yet this is the first film of his which treads into lesser territory dont get me wrong ponyo is not a bad movie by any means as mentioned it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as totoro and kiki the problem is that the story doesnt stay afloat to satisfy anyone eager for another engrossing indepth plotbr br for its opening hour ponyo is miyazaki storytelling at its finest in which a rowdy and overeager young goldfish who later becomes named ponyo makes a forbidden trip to the human world where she is subsequently adopted by a boy her own age named sosuke modeled interestingly after the directors own son this does not please ponyos father a mysterious wizard named fujimoto who is very angry at the humans for their destruction of the sea this environmentalist theme is not much different from miyazakis other films a problem he very much intends to rectify by creating jellyfish from the prow of his submarine he separates the pair and tries to talk ponyo into staying underwater with him the goldfish however has already tasted both sosukes blood healing a cut on his finger and some of the human food ham which she becomes inexplicably addicted to and of course steals into her fathers forbidden potions transforming into a hyperactive young girl who is the spitting image of mei from my neighbor totoro this triggers a dangerous tsunami which threatens to engulf the entire world with water conspiring with his wife gran mamare a diaphanous sea goddess who alternatingly shifts from supersized titan to humansize form fujimoto decides to test the two youngsters love for each other they do this by elevating the sea to the level of sosukes house prompting the youngsters to set out across their now oceaninfested world in an oversized toyboat made possible by ponyos own magical powersbr br it is at this point where ponyo begins to run out of steam although ponyo and sosuke are adorable and the scenes involving them are funny and cute they slow down the film where the film really takes on water unfortunately is at the climax in which sosuke must prove his love to ponyo presented in a way which is strangely anticlimactic and rushed bringing an otherwise charming tale to an abrupt halt this will likely underwhelm viewers expecting another instant masterpiece from the man who has delivered far more interesting finales for many of his other movies remember the destruction of laputa satsukis search for little mei kikis rescue of tombo porco rossos fight with curtis the rescue of the forest spirits head or even the test between chihiro and yubaba all those resolutions were far more satisfying and felt more complete than this onebr br on a technical level ponyo cannot be faulted the animation is absolutely gorgeous to look at produced entirely without a single shot of computergeneratedimagery and naturally joe hisaishi provides us with yet another breathtaking musical score the best moments being the rousing sequences underwater accompanied by a chorus and a soprano voice and the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed as any other ghibli moviesbr br having proved themselves worthy on translating and dubbing ghiblis previous movies into english with topquality results disney studios and pixar once again provide an english dub complete with a mostly capable cast of actors frankie jonas is surprisingly good as sosuke sounding very natural and believable throughout noah cyrus as ponyo on the other hand sometimes goes overboard in shouting her lines before eventually settling down toward the end leads aside the rest of the cast includes liam neeson as the overprotective fujimoto who manages himself unsurprisingly well in the character cate blanchett as gran mamare in an omnipresent tone which is not much different from her galadriel in lord of the rings matt damon as sosukes constantly seafaring father koichi who is good but nothing to write home about and tina fey as lisa of them fey is the best voice in the entire cast imbuing the character with just the right amount of spirit and personality her scenes with sosuke show real chemistry on the other hand cloris leachman who was spectacular as dola in castle in the sky is disappointingly wasted as one of three handicapped elderly women she barely has any lines who are also voiced by betty white and lily tomlin of them only tomlins character a cantankerous woman named toki shows any real personality but if i were casting the movie id switch tomlin with leachman probably the only really jarring drawback of the dub is a blasty technoremix of the films catchy but ridiculously repetitive title song which thankfully doesnt occur until midway through the closing creditsbr br on the whole ponyo is a good film a fine piece of animated work which is perfect for youngsters and family audiences due to the loss of momentum toward the end though it falls far short of classic status since miyazaki at his least is still better than a majority of other animated films though ill be generous and give ponyo a full star recommendation because any feature of his is still very much worth watching particularly on the big screen be sure to catch it in the theaters while you can
