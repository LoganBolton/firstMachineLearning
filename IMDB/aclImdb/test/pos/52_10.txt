this is a mustsee movie you will laugh you will cry and when its over youll wish there were more wellwritten and compelling this movie draws you in and holds on tight the casting was perfect the characters purposeful and the performances outstanding nanny is the standard to which all women should hold themselves strong forgiving protective and never judgmental nanny to me is the epitome of what a christian mother and woman should be a true pillar of the community if i were half the woman nanny is i might consider myself to be doing okay i would have been devastated if nanny had died at some point in the movie but since she didnt i will definitely buy this when it comes out on dvd i can only hope that the story continues and that ruben goes back to lackawanna to try to rebuild the town piece by piece and person by person
