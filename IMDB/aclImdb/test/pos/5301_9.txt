while hayao miyazakis movies have always been hitormiss with me with regards to story they are unequivocally gorgeous to the eye with characters of simple animation against a backdrop of artistic images ponyo sticks to that formula with a lead character so adorable i want a plush doll of her and scenery so pretty it wouldnt look out of place framed up as a picture on a wallbr br the story on the other hand i didnt enjoy quite as much as his last two widereleases spirited away and howls moving castle it was just a tad too juvenile coming across as more for kids and leaving adults to just enjoy the animationbr br i was also disappointed that the score done by joe hisaishi who also the scores for the abovementioned two movies wasnt nearly as memorable this time around while i cant quite recall howls score now i still remember it being one of the most beautiful i had ever heard ditto spiriteds  though i only remember it being very complementary to the movie maybe its because ponyo is more juvenile fare that the score isnt quite as haunting in any case this movie is still a mustwatch for fans of anime or miyazaki
