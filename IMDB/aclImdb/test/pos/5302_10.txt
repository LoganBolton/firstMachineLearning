this is the latest ghibli movie and it is also a major departure from the studios established style first of all this film was obviously aimed at young children much more so than any of their previous films it lacks the depth of the other films and features a brand new far less realistic style of animationÂ… and yet it is ever so entertaining even though there is nothing put in to attract adults i still found myself drawn to the screen and fully immersed in the story the movies secret is brutal honesty with regard to the plot and the characters the story and the characters are very upfront with their feelingsintentions etc but that makes them all the more endearing special attention was also paid to the soundtrack which is absolutely amazing despite being way different from previous ghibli soundtracks i find myself singing the cute theme song all the time as will anyone who sees this movie
