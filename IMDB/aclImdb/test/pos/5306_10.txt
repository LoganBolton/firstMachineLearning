whenever hayao miyazaki does the trifecta writes directs and animates a movie he makes a classic film for the ages he has done it again with gake no ue no ponyobr br the story is about a girl fish who is kept on a very tight leash along with her younger sisters by her father a bitter exhuman wizard named fujimoto the fish escapes from her father and rides a jellyfish to shore where she is caught up in a dredging operation and finds herself stuck in a bottle this underwater sequence must be one of the most elaborately drawn animated scenes ever undertaken and stands on its own as a reason to search out the theatrical release miyazaki who shows no fear of having a busy scene has outdone himself there were literally hundreds of individuallydrawn sea creatures of every imaginable size all in motion at the same timebr br when the fish escapes the dredging operation while still trapped in the bottle a fiveyear old boy named sousuke spots her in the water and is able to break the bottle saving her since she is the result of her fathers magic she is capable of magic herselfand her father actively tries to retrieve her the boy names the fish ponyo just when sousuke learns that ponyo can speak her father successfully retrieves her back into captivitybr br after a war of wills with her father ponyo manages to escape again with the ability to change herself into a human she meets up again with sousuke in a storm and the story continues from there in many interesting ways there is a cuteness factor in this film rivaling and arguably surpassing that of tonari no totoro joe hisaishi once again provided outstanding musical supportbr br the story itself is simpleas are miyazakis films in generaland should appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers while i havent viewed it enough to be sure the film doesnt seem to be one which will keep scholars in long discussions as sen to chihiro no kamikakushi did nonetheless this is the ultimate feelgood entertainment movie i gave the movie a ten out of ten rating
