the title comes from an alteration an adolescent inmate in a correctional facility makes on the front cover of his school book on government titled the united states he adds of his name br br many characterizations in this movie work well  the scenes between leland ryan gosling and becky jena malone pearl don cheadle and father fitzgerald spacey as well as with leland becky and sister julie michelle williams among many othersbr br but the central thread of this movie  the fulcrum on which everything hangs  is the character and motives of leland hes a somewhat shy passive nice high school student who daringly introduces himself to becky whom we find is going to an alternative school because of a past history of drug problems in beckys family she has a sister julie whos just graduating from high school and preparing to go on to college julies boy friend julies age and whose parents had recently died is also living with them br br leland lives with his mother his father kevin spacey and mother have long been divorced and his father is a famous novelist leland is very perceptive the young boy in the sixth sense saw dead people leland sees teenage lovers and recognizes that years later they will divorce that pain is going to follow many peoples present experience of happiness but for reasons that are never made explicit his prescient gift seems to operate some times for some people some relationships and not for others br br parts of the movie feel a bit like a derivative quilt  borrowing from american beauty the sixth sense the graduate and possibly some others i didnt recognize that wouldnt be bad if only the character of leland workedbr br i think gosling did a great job of playing leland but the script and the story imposed limitations would such an observant meditative young man ever be homicidal even for altruistic reasons nothing in the film gives a reason for this im a retired therapist with much experience working with families and teenagers while many of the reactions shown in the film work  this part this most essential element certainly does notbr br and there is at least one other element which in my experience would not fit with real life although its not as critical the reason for the differences between the sisters becky and julie are never hinted at but thats okay once two sibs begin occupying different roles one the all good girl the other the troubled one the roles themselves can begin driving each other to more extreme positions for the troubled one becky its kind of what do i have to do to be loved around here  give up being me and become julie and the pressure to live up to being the allgood parentpleasing child is no less intense on julie so why would she break up with her boy friend of longstanding and of whom her parents so obviously approvebr br don cheadle was good as lelands teacher all others were good in their parts 98 of the scenes were good what was missing was that crucial slip in understanding human naturebr br good acting flawed story and psychology worth seeing not a total loss
