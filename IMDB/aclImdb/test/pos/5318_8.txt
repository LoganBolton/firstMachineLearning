this has to be one of the most powerful messagesending movies i saw lately it was absolutely flawless all the way amazingly original and thought provoking story is unusual and original and the characters make this story very very powerful its about a guy who kills his exgirlfriends retarded kid brother and as he is sent to juvenile prison through many memory flashbacks you get a grip on a story and you dont let it go until the very end murder he commits changes the course of life for every member of his family and the family of deceased and as you watch and realize that everyone has its own story and its own dark side you just appreciate this movie even more its a total tour de force cause those actions cannot be described by simple words his motive of committing murder is left incompletely explained and it makes viewers think acting was pretty much flawless and the cast was very good it contains many familiar faces if you like the movies that are thought provoking and that just make u think during themeg donnie darko mulholland dr then the united states of leland is an excellent movie choice for you otherwise you should pass this movie and watch it when youre in the mood for serious thought provoking moviebr br 1010
