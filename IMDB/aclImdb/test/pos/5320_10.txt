leland follows the story of leland p fitzgerald ryan gosling a disaffected teenager who has apparently murdered a severely retarded peer the brother of a girl he was dating the issue is not whether he did it or not  leland admits to it straight away  but rather why interestingly rather than a crime drama leland becomes a character story examining why people do what they do  not necessarily the easiest ground to tillbr br and leland features the required indie group of screwedup people aside from the title character theres also pearl don cheadle who is his teacher at the juvenile correctional facility and who sees straight off that leland is different we meet lelands distant and egotistical father kevin spacey in an extended cameo who never seems emotionally stirred in any way by what his son did but the real flavorings come out when we immerse ourselves in the pollards the family of the retarded child first theres lelands girlfriend becky jena malone a drug addict who cant keep herself clean her sister julie michelle williams perhaps the most normal person in the film who merely seeks to get away from it all and allen harris chris klein a young man who lives with the pollards and is julies boyfriend lastly theres ryan michael welch whom all the others call goofball who cannot communicate and seems barely aware of his surroundingsbr br leland focuses primarily on its eponymous protagonist but the movie slowly  occasionally too slowly  burrows into everyones lives asking the chief question why do people do what they do while leland discusses it openly in a journal pearl allows him to keep examining notions of good and bad and personal responsibility all the characters at some point in the film face a moment where they must make the fundamental choice of their own happiness or anothers perhaps the most basic choice any human can make and the movie takes a good look at what goes into those choices and the consequences of thembr br in the beginning of the film youre simply struck by the depth of the cast spacey cheadle gosling michelle williams even chris klein  these are people who for the most part tend to elevate any film they are in and putting them all together makes for a heady brew for a space in the middle the film seems to stall sputtering along as it unfolds it looks for a while as if it will be content merely to ask questions and not supply any answers but when we arrive at the home stretch and the movie starts to hit its stride and come together leland becomes a quietly powerful piece of filmmaking lelands explanation of the world and his actions in the end bring every story into focus and all the investment youve made in the film pays offbr br saying ryan gosling is excellent is like saying a sunny day is nice at this point in his career its redundant  this is one of the finest young actors working today and it is a pleasure to watch him craft what could have been an unlikable character into a thoughtprovoking protagonist gosling employs such subtlety here that it hardly seems like acting he has to face off most of the film opposite don cheadle whom we know has the goods and he not only holds his own he elevates cheadles game as well cheadle himself is in top notch form imbuing pearl with a fullyrounded humanity  for good and bad spacey is kind of onenote but thats the character and he handles it excellently i was surprised by chris klein with this level of acting i thought he would be buried in the mix but he gives probably the turn of his career so far terrific work all aroundbr br leland is a bit of a downer and again its draggy in spots but it finishes strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer on this one anyway theres also a subtle commentary on racism in the film in lelands first day in juvenile hall class hes the only white person in the room that like much of the movie is very effectively handled i wouldnt go so far as to call this required viewing  some might find it too slow or too odd  but i thought it was one of the better films ive seen in a while far stronger and more satisfying than most fare out there id recommend it  with the above caveats  if for no other reason than to watch gosling further perfect his craft
