one wonders about the state of a society that produce a father like albert t fitzgerald who we first meet on a plane as he is heading toward the place he abandoned a long time ago and where he left a wife and a child who is now accused of murdering a mentally challenged boy when we first see him he has caught a headline in the paper the woman in front of him is reading rather rudely he asks her if he could have the newspaper and the lady offers other sections well thats not what he asked what he wants the woman to do is to give him the front section she is readingbr br matthew ryan hoge wrote and directed this disturbing film that reflects in many ways our society as it is today in fact mr hoge is pointing out exactly at what is wrong with itbr br the film presents leland a teen ager who cant even differentiate between fantasy and reality its evident that killing a human being even the sweet and innocent boy who hasnt done anything to deserve it will have fatal consequences not only for himself but for his own family and the family of the slain boy in fact leland seems to have no idea about what motivated him to commit the crime for he does not show any repentance about itbr br its obvious leland has been traumatized by his parents divorce his own father is an aloof man who couldnt care less about him its pearl the teacher in the juvenile detention center who sees the turmoil inside the young man and wants to help but unfortunately he doesnt have a chancebr br the best thing in the film is don cheadle a great actor who always delivers the ensemble cast does good work under mr hoges direction kevin spacey has a good opportunity playing the egotistical father of the accused murderer and makes us detest him for being an arrogant idiotbr br although a bit long the film leaves us with more questions than what it answered
