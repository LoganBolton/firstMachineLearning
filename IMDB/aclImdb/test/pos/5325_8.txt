there are subtleties in this film that i think a lot of people may miss if theyre not careful you really need to follow what leland says and read his character to figure out the intended why the movie presents at the end nothing it solid its not definite its about what the individual viewer takes out of it i think that was the plan from the getgo people arent meant to all understand it in the same way its almost about forming your own personal relationship with leland in order to maybe feel him a little betterbr br the storyline is interesting but its summary could never explain what the movie really is its dramatic and thought provoking a lot of heavy ideas but the pace of the movie is almost soothing even with its more intense scenes with yelling i think its probably leland hes just calm and almost serene even for all of his sadness the movie personifies leland in a waybr br of course it is captivating and draws you in if you let it but there are some recycled ideas i mean leland has a lot of impressive dialogue he is anything but typical but hes not a prophet everything he says is not a revelation many people i know have mentioned things he mentioned even i have observed a few things hes observed leland is the unique and attractive character he is probably mostly for ryan goslings portrayalbr br in the end the acting is all exceptional there are no real bad guys there is no way to psychologically evaluate leland only to maybe understand him and life a little betterbr br comparable to igby goes down i think not comedic but similar in its general outlook on life
