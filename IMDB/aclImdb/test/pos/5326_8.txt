before i saw this film i read the comment of someone who wasnt very fond of it this i must admit made me apprehensive to dedicate 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life to it but im glad i did ryan gosling is a fantastic actor i especially loved the believer don cheadle was also fantastic the film presented an interesting view on life and death it was very touching and very sad yet it kept me interested which most touching stories cannot do it is a film that reckless of whether or not you like it you should see it it was uniqueand i dont think that anyone will ever be able to duplicate it all of the young actors did surprisingly well given the subject matter and the emotion that must have gone into it i was pleasantly surprised
