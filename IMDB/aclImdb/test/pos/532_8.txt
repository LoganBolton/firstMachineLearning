im sorry but star wars episode 1 did not do any justice to natalie portmans talent and undeniable cuteness she was entirely underused as queen amidala and when she was used her makeup was frighteningly terrible for anywhere but here she sheds her godawful makeup and she acts normally and not only can she act good she looks good doing it im a bit older than she shes only 18 and i have little or no chance of meeting her but hey a guy is allowed to dream rightbr br even though susan sarandon does take a good turn in this movie the film belongs entirely to portman ive been a watcher of portmans since beautiful girls where she was younger but just as cute theres big things for her in the future  i can see it
