the first fulllength film featuring the aardman characters wallace and gromit manages to bring in elements of all the previous halfhour show which aired on televisionbr br wallace runs a company to humanely capture rogue rabbits from peoples vegetable gardens and has the bright idea to try out his invention on the hapless bunnies once theyre caught of course as in other wallace and gromit films things dont quite work out as plannedbr br similarly to a close shave theres a love interest for wallace in this case the village lady posh and a big mean villain with a bullish dog gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions making the character laugh out loud funny and of course peter sallis provides the voice of wallace again and is a perfect fitbr br and as in a grand day out cheese features heavily to great comedic effect as the film moves alongbr br on the negative side this film is a little on the long side there are great effects and some pieces which make you sit up and watch but perhaps this story would have worked better as another short subject rather than pushing it to featurelength
