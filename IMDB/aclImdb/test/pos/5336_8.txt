although it isnt half as hilarious as chicken run the new wallace and gromit comedy the curse of the wererabbit  out of  yields more laughs than most live action comedies british director nick park who created the wallace and gromit characters and codirector steve box rely on the oldfashioned stopmotion method of animationknown best as claymationto create several visually adorable characters in more than enough sidesplitting scenes about a monstrously mutant hare out to devour every vegetable in sight amusing as its whimsical storyline is the heart of the hilarity lies in the imaginative way with which park and company have painstakingly constructed characters and gags out of a brand of modeling clay called plasticine basically every shot that you see in the curse of the wererabbit required patient souls that made minor alterations in the clay characters for a series of individual shots that merge into a veritable montage of merriment hollywood pioneered claymation as a form of animation as far back as the silent movies of the 1920s before the industry turned its back on the complicated process aardman studio animators managed to crank out a mere three seconds of usable footage per day for the record the curse of the wererabbit took five years to make the lumpy looking characters with thumbprints clearly visible in their respective clay complexions look incredibly funny with their pingpong ball eyes and overbiting mouths interestingly gromit emerges as the funniest character a lovable mutt with no mouth but an expressively inexpressive face who says more than most of the talking charactersbr br wallace and gromit are respectively master and pooch as the human half of the duo wallace is a homily looking moron without a clue who somehow manages to construct machines that do some rather incredible things one of the funnier scenes shows master and pooch awakened by a system of chutes hatches and springoperated contraptions that dress and feed them meanwhile gromit is the animal half the running joke is that gromit shows more common sense than his genius of a master as good as his ideas and inventions are wallace could not succeed without the loyal gromit giving him a hand our heroes run a pest protection business called antipesto essentially they must protect every vegetable patch for miles around using an ungainly looking device called a bunvan 6000 that literally sucks rabbits out of their ground and into a huge glass container no wallace and gromit dont kill the critters instead they keep them as pets and wallace experiments with an inventionÂ—mindomaticdesigned to convert hares into carrothaters this frankenstein meets the fly approach plunges poor wallace into deep trouble when he swaps bits of his brain with that of a rabbit not long thereafter a mysterious towering terror stalks the vegetable patches on full moon nights and creates chaos for everyone as the villages 517th annual vegetable contest approachesbr br initially wallace and gromit appeared in parks oscarnominated film school project a grand day out 1989 since then aardman has released ten other animated shorts among them wallace and gromit a close shave 1993 and the oscarwinning wallace and gromit the wrong trousers 1995 curse of the wererabbit differs not only because it represents the duos bigscreen debut but also it runs a whopping 85 minutes the first twothirds of wererabbit contain better gags than the last third but park and company never miss a chance to slip in an adult joke that kids wont get but attentive grownups will appreciate wallace and gromit the curse of the wererabbit is hareraising fun
