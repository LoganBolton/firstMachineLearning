if you havent watched the movie yet but you do like comedy go out and buy or at least rent it the fact it won the animation oscar is not a coincidence i havent watched many other wallace  gromit movies in fact i think i only watched one other but the humor is very distinctive  and some would also say very british in a good way of course br br the story will only be an excuse for all the jokes to come but although its not the most elaborate one it still works by the way my niece did guess see one of the big surprises coming i didnt kudos to her o  i do think that after you watch this one youll go out and seek the other wg movies that are out there have fun
