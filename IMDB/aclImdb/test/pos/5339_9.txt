i was extremely amused to read some of the bad reviews on this movie first many have said that they have taken their 4 year old daughters and granddaughters to see this and they did not enjoy it first i dont believe that this is a kids movie at least not a movie for very very young children not 4 at least it has very subtle humor but it is not meant to offer quick amusement as seen in tom and jerry or something like this many people have also complained that it goes very very slowlyi guess those people are all used to quantity over quality while i have a small quality problem myself with this movie and that is that the movie was not as detail oriented as the short movies i still believe that it managed quite well for a full feature film and how can people complain about the jokes the jokes were sensible timely and well thought out never rude insulting or in your face wallace is extremely smart yet cautious and grommit is the most adorable smart and cute character that could be this was a beautiful movie and the theme was very appropriatefor adults that isespecially with the increase of obesity and metabolic disease in the world theres nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and fruits for onceand this was accomplished in a very tasteful manner in that while people are concerned with the aspect of vegetables that doesnt necessarily mean that the are healthier or that they eat more of thembut just that they temper with nature which is in fact what caused the legend of the were rabbit to come true and for those out there that complained about the religious jokes i saycame on are you for real many villages revolve around the local church and legendspremonitions etc are normal themes no harm done this movie was absolutely amazing yet some people had negative comments on it and i find this absolutely absurd
