going into this movie i was a bit cautious i have always been a bit iffy about claymation movies ive always enjoyed decent animated movies but claymation was always different to me but this one caught me by surprise wallace and gromit are extremely lovable characters and its a great story with jokes for all ages theres the silly burpfart jokes for the kids and the subtle but over the head of young kids jokes for us older people very neat claymation and while the story had holes it kept my interest beginning to endbr br its so rare to find pure and uncorrupted humor these days this movie was all the more refreshing wallace and gromit go doing their normal thing which is exterminating humanely the buggers that ruin peoples vegetable crops but this time they find themselves fighting some form of a freak huge rabbit that their humanely built traps cant even keep under tabs great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun if you have not exposed yourself to wallace and gromit i highly recommend this moviebr br the only reason i rate it a 7 and not higher is because its still a family movie and i dont have kids i enjoyed it but if i had been watching it with some little rug rats and my wife itd be at least a 9 for sure give it a shot
