wallace  gromit have been around for some time but this was their first foray onto the silver screen fans of the british tv series like myself were eager to see them and the film did quite well in the theaters much of the reason is that the film is fun and quite original in a world of cg movies like shrek and toy story this stopmotion film is a nice alternative to the trend in childrens movies as well as being totally unlike a cartoon plus compared to much earlier stopmotion films such as king kong and the ray harryhausen films such as sinbad the quality and movement of the characters are light years betterlooking very fluid natural and more alivebr br apart from the quality of the animation this movie also deserves kudos on every other level first the voice actors do a great job second the script is very simple but also very cute and enjoyablewith a few doubleentendres that should probably go way over the kids heads third they manage to make this not only a movie for kids but people of all ages as the film is neither saccharine nor aimed solely at the younger crowd in particular i was captivated by incredibly cute the film wasand especially the adorable bunnies i especially liked them in the closing creditswhich made me very happy i stayed to watch the entire filmbr br the bottom line is that unless you are a real stickinthemud you will enjoy this film its fresh funny and amazingly clever i hope we see a sequeland this is saying something as i usually hate sequels
