the folks at aardman have done a cool cute and wild adaptation of their short films of wallace and gromit to feature length as the man and his dog inventors who seem to have more of the intelligence or practicality for the latter in this case theyve invented a machine that can capture all of the bunnies that are eating up the crops all over a quiet english village in particular for mrs tottington or totty for those who are intimate much to the chagrin of victor quartermaine who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trust rifle wallace and gromit seem to have success with their machine but wallace has a mixup a machine hes made to make more food suddenly crisscrosses himself with a rabbit  the curse is on br br a lot of this is about as much lighthearted fun that a kids movie could ask for but it also tips its hat to the oldest tradition in classic cartoon slapstick looney tunes which in turn is indebted to much silent comedy and vaudeville granted the aardman guys nick park and steve box have a bunch more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material its never less than amazing to see how they put the stop motion to use even when a joke or a gag might be a little on the funny hoho not funny haha side a tired criticism but ill say it curse of the wererabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience in its warped story and sudden dips into exposition the golden bullet story is a doozy park and box and company never lose sight of glee in the materialbr br its fuzzy and warmhearted and completely offthewall for the kids even the very youngest will love the adventures and strange gadgets such as the truck wallace and gromit drive around in and for adults theres little barbs of funky absurdist tones in the midst of a classic english farce only and im probably a minority opinion here when compared to chicken run its almost a little slight a work theres less any plot than there is a series of running gags and of course lots of puns involving bunnies and monsters and carnivals and cheese and horrible men with egos in their guns like the fiennes voiced quartermaine but when it strikes best its one of the most entertaining films of 2005 it gives me a big goofy smile anytime its on tv
