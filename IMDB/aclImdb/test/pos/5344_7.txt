there was something about the original three films that made them so special and delightful  probably the length of them unfortunately this lacks the charm but it still ends up being a fun film br br the bright shimmering side is that our favourite plasticene figures are still doing a cracking great job there is good plasticene animation used there is a silly but wellstructured and entertaining plot an exciting fun adventure a good plot idea a wererabbit and a giant vedgetable competition and good new charactersbr br as well as lacking the original charm the only other slightly gloomy side of the film is that the humour though good is slightly overdone especially compared to the original filmsbr br the popular giant vedgetable competition is drawing near and wallace and gromit are helping control rabbits from eating any vedgetables now they are anti pesto they are doing a good job but soon there is danger afoot a wererabbit is nearbybr br recommended to all wallace and gromit fans and to people who like plasticene films enjoy wallace and gromit the curse of the wererabbit
