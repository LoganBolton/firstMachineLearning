who can ask for more taking my 2 and 4 year old children was a risk i admit but well worth it they were enthralled from credit to credit with their parents beside thembr br i have taken the kids to films before with mixed results too scary too boring too sophisticated whatever with this film however i was glad to see a smart film with wit style and a sense of passion emanating from the screen any film that takes 5 years of production to make good or bad deserves some respect for the bravery and the patience it takes to film a film like thisbr br ok im gushing a little then again why wouldnt i get excited looking through the movie listing today only reminded me of the poor quality of films that are distributed at least for the moment regardless w  g is a film well made perhaps the originality wasnt the most inspired nevertheless well told and well pacedbr br too much adult humour too many sex references maybe though my kids didnt quite catch them too young so in my case i didnt really noticebr br well needless to say i liked it
