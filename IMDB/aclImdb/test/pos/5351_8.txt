this was very good except for two things which ill mention at the end the animation is great highlighted by nick park and companys trademark of exaggerated teeth and mouths of the characters which make you laugh almost every time you see someone the color was magnificent toobr br the best part of the film however is the clever comedy woven throughout this is another of these animated films in which there is so much to see and hear each frame that it would require many viewings to catch all the gags its just a funny exaggerated look at the oddball wallace and his silentandsmart dog gromit along the way it pokes fun people who get carried away with their vegetable gardens something akin to how the obsessive dog lovers were pictured in best of showbr br my only complaints were two typical traits of todays films animated or not 1  lets make the cleric in the film look like a total idiot 2  lets overdo the final action scene with the predictable result but way overdone those aside this is still a very amusing film that should provide a lot of laughs to many people and a movie to enjoy multiple times
