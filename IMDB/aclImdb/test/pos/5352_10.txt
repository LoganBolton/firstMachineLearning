having just come home from my third viewing of the curse of the wererabbit i decided to jump on imdb and see what others thought i noticed a lot of brits loved it while those in america just didnt get it that really doesnt come as any shock as america doesnt get what english isbr br wallace and gromit are very english middle class english in fact with a hint of eccentricity throw in for good measure the film is a lot like our two heroes simple and unassuming it has a nice and gentle plot so the children dont get lost yet theres enough beef there to keep the adults amused too theres some light innuendo which seems have to have offended the evangelic  oh noes drama but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment when people get offended by a plasticine anus you know the worlds messed upbr br one quick note to those all american so far that i have seen who think chicken run is a better film chicken run was made to pander to your sense of humour and i think it suffered because of it curse of the were rabbit is witty english and intelligent thomas the tank engines film was ruined because it was made to please the americans and im glad nick park did not let that happen to another great british institutionbr br to sum up you can keep your chicken runs your shreks your madagasgas  that kind of crude crass slapstick comedy just doesnt compare to the wit and grace that is wallace and gromit in curse of the wererabbit english to the core and long may wallace and gromit stay that way
