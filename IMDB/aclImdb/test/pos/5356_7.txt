whatho this one is jolly good i say jolly good ol chap or should i say ol bean my mastery of british terminology is a little dusty anyway my biker boots and i walked into this screening with no prior viewing experience of wallace and gromit im happy to say that my boots and i walked out pleased to have made their acquaintancebr br while not as adultaccessible as toy story w  g still manages to be clever enough to provide the grown ups with a little humor that will most definitely soar over the heads of the young uns who are too busy guffawing at the wererabbits belches to have any clue that something is amiss i highly suggest that you pay close attention any time you see books or words on the screen because there are quick glimpses of puns that youll miss if you arent paying attention my favorite is a book of monsters that refers to the loch ness monster as tourist trappus if youve ever been known to say i can really relate to kevin federline or if youre just illiterate then not only will you miss out on these jokes but you probably should be spending your time learning to read instead of going to movies consider this a public service announcementbr br the most impressive aspect about w  g is its clay animation thanks to the tedious process it took five years to finish the film according to the press notes there were some days when the optimum goal was to merely accomplish 10 seconds of completed film folks i sometimes have trouble finding the motivation to finish responding to a handful of emails or adding captions to pictures for my reviews a point that is proved by a lack of pictures in this review so i cant even imagine having the required patience for thatbr br i really like the rough handson quality of the claymation figures the fact that you can see fingerprints in the clay is a nice personal touch how can you not be impressed with clay characters that show more expression and emotion than paul walker and keanu reeves combined the curse of the wererabbit is as director nick park calls it the worlds first vegetarian horror movie that should entertain both kids and adults alike relying on and as a male who prides himself in his shaggyhaired coolbearded masculinity i hesitate to use this word cute and oh man i probably shouldnt use this word either lovable characters rather than outdated mc hammer references w  g is proof that dreamworks can create entertaining animation when it chooses cleverness over the cheap joke
