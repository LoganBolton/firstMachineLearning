this first and hopefully not last wallace  gromit feature lives up to expectations there are plenty of jokes some a bit cheeky as well as some great tributes to past science fiction movies with the barrage of awful and formulaic movies being spewed forth from hollywood its great to see such a great film like this thats enjoyable for almost everyone if there is any justice it will be top of the boxoffice and be at least nominated for best animation at the next oscars the animation is wonderful the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are great fun this is one of those films that the whole family can enjoy charming clever fun and well made whats not to enjoy
