i saw it at a german press screening without giving too much away most critics really seemed to like it very much there was even applause afterwards which is quite unusual for that species from my point of view and until now it was the funniest movie of the year it keeps the charm and wit of the three wg shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies of course there are obvious allusions to monster and werewolfmovies especially to an american werewolf in london jaws king kong and even to peter jacksons braindeaddead alive but also to other genresbr br characterization was better done in chicken run but that movie had a complete new cast where introduction was necessary here you are already able to know the two main characters so the new wallace and gromitmovie is enjoyed best if you watched and liked the shorts already yet it also works on its own chicken run had the more convenient but also more storytelling plot instead this new aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more isolated feeling of the wg shorts children should also enjoy it very much especially because of the sweet rabbits if you love cute bunnies this is a mustsee for you and because gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show children also love dogs   but many jokes are thought for a more adult audience there are even soft sexual allusions in it the movie manages like shrek 12 and the incredibles to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family with adding a british and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of american animated moviesbr br the animation is  as expected  superb and they kept true to the aardman style because they didnt put in too many digital effects  i realized just a few when it came to wallaces inventionsbr br finally the score works fine in the movie although one of the main themes definitely is borrowed by randy edelmans dragonheart scorebr br the bad thing is it will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from nick park  co
