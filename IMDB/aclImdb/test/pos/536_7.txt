since i am a fan of natalie portman i had to see the movie i enjoyed every minute of it it plays out in a very sincere way throughout the whole movie at seemed as if natalie was the mother and susan was the mother susans character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of itbr br i heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving natalie and someguy hes in outside providence but natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed and i think that is great i think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the filmbr br natalie must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because i havent seen her in a bad film yet so any movie that has natalie portman will no doubt be seen by mebr br a good film 710
