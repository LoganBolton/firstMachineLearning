the 70s were a great time for horror movies the brotherhood of satan is yet another overlooked gem its full to the brim with great surreal unsettling scenes its also great to see stother martin and lq jones who also produced in decent rolesbr br some of it is a little dated and cheesy but the brotherhood of satan kicks butt over race the devil and many other 70s satanism flicks
