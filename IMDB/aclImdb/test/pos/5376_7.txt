i had been interested in this film for a long time especially after reading a couple of online reviews of the dvd edition however i kept postponing its purchase because of the excessive pricetag and utter lack of relevant supplements when it went outofprint earlier this year i finally gave in  but the entire order which included a number of other highlydesirable titles got lost in transit luckily the dvd has been reissued at bargainprice  and im sure glad i picked it up br br anyway this is one strange film and a genuine sleeper initially confusing but striking occult tale which manages to hit bullseye with respect to both its forbidding smalltown atmosphere and the inherent eeriness of the sinister goingson a small cast responds perfectly to a terse absorbing and intelligent script lead strother martin in particular makes the dialogue sound better than it actually is with his nuanced performance as the town doctorhead of the witchs coven lq jones and alvy moore both of whom also produced the film offer solid support as the nononsense sheriff and his comicstrip aficionado assistantbr br the plot merges elements of various earlier films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural and not only the obvious titles the fact that the town is held under a spell which cant at first be identified for instance brings instantly to mind the similar affliction of one specific bourgeois household in luis bunuels sublimely surreal the exterminating angel 1962 the possessed children angle was borrowed perhaps from village of the damned 1960 there have been many films  especially of a recent vintage  where the satanic rites of a witches coven are shown from the city of the dead 1960 to the devil rides out 1968 but since the proceedings take place in modernday america albeit in remote surroundings and revolve around elderly witches seeking a renaissance the film they recall most of all is rosemarys baby 1968br br the occult scenes accentuated as much by foggy exteriors as by the shadowy lighting of the garishlydecorated house where the diabolical events take place are presented in a completely matteroffact way as to make them unsettling and extremely effective  particularly the opening sequence involving an army tank crushing a car the rampage of a devildoll a concept which has been done to death over the years but here it raises an undeniable frisson a surreal dream sequence set inside the ice chamber where all the victims are kept since they cant be buried a sequence where the witches attack a doubting member of the coven a beheading committed by a horseriding medieval knight and the lengthy black mass finale with the witches accompanied by the respective child they will be taking over all dressed in red  except for a blackclad martin presiding over the ceremony which culminates in ritual mass suicide br br the film also has the guts to deliver a downbeat curtain its so refreshing to come across a title albeit a lowbudget production from a major hollywood studio columbia that contrives to go so completely against the grain like i said the film is quite weird  extending also to the editing and the score its odd too that such a classy  and cinematic  horror offering sic should come from a tv director most often associated with westerns and other family fare by the way the same theme was dealt with almost contemporaneously in the nth christopher leepeter cushing collaboration nothing but the night 1972 which lee produced himself  a film i foolishly missed out on some 20 years back when it was shown on local tv and which has been mia ever since br br ps this review of the brotherhood of satan will certainly contain spoilers but then the synopsis and artwork featured on the dvd cover manage to give everything away anyway
