every great once in a while you stumble upon a movie that exceeds even your wildest expectations given the imdb rating of 40 i wasnt really expecting much with the brotherhood of satan i hoped that at a minimum it might be cheesy fun like the devils rain or any of the other early 70s similarly themed satanic horror films i couldnt have been more wrong what i got instead was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast i really enjoyed speaking in broad terms to avoid giving anything away the films style and structure are much more experimental than the straightforward storytelling so prominent in the early 70s the brotherhood of satan doesnt beat you over the head with plot points and explanations a lot is left to the viewer to fill in the blanks as a viewer you know something is amiss but for the longest period youre just not sure what it is the unknown helps make for a far creepier atmosphere than most similar films the ending is effective with its surreal imagery i sat in amazement as the final credits began to roll those wanting a big slambang finale will be disappointed with the endings simplicity a lesser film would have tried to pull out all the stops and would most likely have failed miserablybr br there are moments in the film where its easy to forget the director bernard mceveety had primarily worked in television before the brotherhood of satan there are a few scenes that are so well setup lit and shot that even the most accomplished of directors could learn a thing or two for example ive seen enough films over the years to realize that directors can sometimes seem to have trouble shooting widescreen shots indoors not here the scene where the men are discussing their plan of action in the sheriffs office is amazing we see all five men at once Â– each doing their own thing as in real life in a lesser film we might see all the men at once but each would be motionless quietly waiting their turn to deliver their dialogue its a small scene but it looks so natural and is so beautifully shot that its one of my favorite moments of the brotherhood of satanbr br finally i mentioned the acting in my opening so without going into a longwinded speech ill just say that the brotherhood of satan features strother martin and lq jones any film with these two guys is almost an automatic winner with me
