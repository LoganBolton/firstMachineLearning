i saw heavenship himmelskibet at the 2006 cinema muto festival in sacile italy what a great movie this danish steampunk saga is the stirring tale of the first trip to mars in an era when wireless telegraphy hasnt been perfected the spaceship hasnt got a radio and the heroes are brought back from the landing field via horsecart even the intertitles are delightful  some of them written in rhymed couplets in the original danishbr br the actors performances are laughable largely handtobrow histrionics but the sets are astonishing easily surpassing anything done by georges melies a decade earlier or in die frau im mond a decade later of course the plot is simplistic the spaceships crew consist of seven thin guys and one fat slob guess which one cracks interestingly everyone in this movie except the dubious professor dubius ardently believes in god even the martiansbr br impressively the scenarists have the sense to acknowledge that a trip to mars is no doddle the title cards establish that it takes the scientists two years to build their spaceship which has an airscrew and six months to reach mars during the construction sequence theres one extremely impressive setup which must have been choreographed dozens of workers all hustle through the worksite in different directions with no hesitations and no collisions the danish scientists christen their ship excelsior packing materials and set course for mars even though the moon and venus are closer when the ship which flies horizontally not vertically lands on mars it is greeted by marsboerne  martians  who turn out to be nordic blondes all highlydeveloped pacifists and vegetarians as a highlydeveloped meateater i resented that partbr br conveniently enough mars turns out to have an atmosphere just like earths as well as equal gravity in an exterior shot of the martian landscape the suns apparent magnitude when seen from mars is the same as it is when viewed from earth i also couldnt help observing that all the wise elder martians are male in fact female elders are thin on the ground here both the earthborn hero and the martian maiden are motherless the martians speak a universal language wear ankhs on their robes and greet the earth visitors with a globe of earth  which of course they hold with its north pole upwardbr br that martian maiden is marya played by an ethereally beautiful danish actress waiter ill have some of that danish we see a martian dance of chastity which might have been twee or ludicrous but is actually quite touching and beautiful also the martian funeral scene features one shot which reminded me of a sequence in the seventh seal i wonder if ingmar bergman saw this filmbr br himmelskibet has a few flaws but its production design and its other merits very far outweigh its drawbacks the ole olsen who is named in the credits and who appears in a brief prologue is no relation to chic johnsons vaudeville partner from hellzapoppin i would give himmelskibet a 12 but the scale tops off at 10  so a full 10 out of 10 for this delightful trip to mars the blonde planet
