some may think imaginary heroes is a movie exactly like igby goes down but it isnt in imaginary heroes the director lets us feel for the travis family and the people around thembr br the movie itself is great and the acting is extremely well done weavers and hirschs acting is believable and helps make the movie what it is the actors directorwriter dan harris has made a movie that many people should see dont think this is just another teen movie it is a movie about a family and their problemsbr br i gave this movie a 1010 because i believe it isnt the best film which no film can be but its the closest it can get to perfect
