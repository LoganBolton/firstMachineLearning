imaginary heroes the remarkable work of the then 24 yearold dan harris is taglined people are never who they seem to be perhaps this is wisely chosen as a stratagem of marketing yet i rented this movie in spite of the tagline rather than because of it and im glad i did i found the move an insightful examination of tragedy i personally found it to be a movie about coping with dreams particularly those which are lost in the case of one son loss requires deep examination of what he had and didnt have in his life yet the central tragedy of the movie while posing enticing questions in its own right acts primarily as the backdrop against which different coping styles are set into relief i believe the film inquires into an important question how do we cope with our dreams particularly where heroes become imaginary
