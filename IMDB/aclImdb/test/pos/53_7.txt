this movie was very good not great but very good it is based on a one man play by ruben santiago hudsonyes he played most of the parts on paper it looks like stunt casting yes lets round up all the black folks in hollywood and put them in one movie halle berry even produced it the only name i didnt see was oprahs thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a hallmark movie instead this movie was not some sentimental mess it was moving but not phony the characters came and went with the exception of her husband pauline and the writer in question the movie revolved around the universe of nanny mrs bill crosby and how she raised the writer and took in people now being a jaded new yorker when he said she took in sick people and old and then we see them going to a mental institution to pick up a man im thinking looks like sister has a medicare scam going getting folks jobs and taking the medicarecaid checks but no she explains to lou gosset she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time i think that part was put in the movie just for us jaded new yorkers so we know she is not scamming the poor folksg it was written by a new yorker so he knows the dealg she almost seems angelic and looking through a little boys eyes i can see why she is married to a neer do well who is 17 years younger and fools around on her terrence howard was born to play these type of parts he was good but i would like to see him play something different markerson who plays nanny is also very good but for some reason the person who stood out to me was a small role played by jeffery wright where is this mans oscar he already won a emmy and a tony he was in shaft and he stole the movie i did not even know who he was in this movie he is a chameleon never the same i never seen him play a bad part yet this was a 5 minute role and he managed to make me both laugh and cry i rewinded the scene few times one time because i didnt know who he was his wife carman ejogo was excellent i have seen her in roles before mostly mousy stuff but she is so good here i actually know people who act just like her so it was very real to me macy grey who had one of the bigger parts was also very good i was very happy that they did not kill nanny off i thought she was a goner in the beginning of the movie but she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people there are women like that in most of our lives people we might know or even lived with thank god for them i do not know how they do it all of the time i have a friend who lost 2 children and been through a lot of stuff but whenever i am feeling selfishly sorry for myself i call her and she always puts me in a good mood this movie is a tribute to all of those people i only wish they they told us what happened to some of the characters like the the one armed man paulines boyfriend who is played by one of my favorite actors on hbos the wire omar rosie perezs character and richard the lesbian and delroy lindos one arm man he was mesmerizing in another small role
