so i was completely in love with this movie gaga for it even with all its plot twistsbut the one thing i found really disturbing was the connection between the two best friends in tim and kyle while the writer of the film gave us such a poignant moment between the two and their sexual experimentationconfusion he then gives us a plot twist that makes them half brothers although the subject isnt brought up in the filmand left unexplained and unaccounted for i just thought that it was in bad taste and the fact that it wasnt even discussed is even worse oops weve created a taboonow lets not address the situation because that wouldnt really be pc otherwise a spectacular film
