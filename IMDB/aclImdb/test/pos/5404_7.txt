this film does not have the outstanding visuals that american beauty or the ice storm offered and because it was made after those films it cannot be marked as very original either the music though subtly brilliant sounds very much like that of american beauty br br the story has some similarities with the ice storm in particular as well as sigourney weaver without intent perhaps the film seems to try to recreate the success of the two aforementioned movies too much at times the story tends to stay a bit more shallow than its bigger more successful brothers by having too much going on or by not delivering the most effective dialogs here the writing cannot measure with that of american beauty but that can be said about most movies ever made even the best and there is still a lot to like said music score and expectable given the cast effective performances of note is emile hirsch who would shine a couple of years later in the outstanding into the wildbr br overall i can recommend this film if you like suburban dramas though its not the first one on a list of mustsees which would be topped by 1 american beauty 2 the ice storm 3 little childrenbr br after youve seen and liked those check out this one
