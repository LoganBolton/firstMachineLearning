as salingers a perfect day for bananafish ends with the suicide of a prodigy this movie opens with the death of the star high school swimmer legend matt who shoots himself in the head with a revolver after in the opening scene but the death of matt travis serves as a key to unlock the door of another prodigy his brother tim who never in his life seriously bothered with the question what am i going to dobr br when he finds his brother dead his head broken like a dropped watermelon the travis family starts vomiting out its secrets one by one the film focuses on tim he is a victim of bullying domestic abuse family alienation heartbreak issues of sexuality and friendship br br tim reveals his wounds by physical bruises but these are not the only injuries to his person as we slowly come to realize as the script painfully unveils the origins and outcome of tim scars everyone who loves him hurts him hirsch plays out the character quite well revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body a host of conflicting emotions inside the soul of a kid whom no one seems to listen to or know very well unknowing and unaware of his depth of soul and prodigious talent br br two siblings sharing a doobie curled up on a red spinnable playground saucer tim asks penny what am i going to do with the rest of my life the scene is framed in a familiar recurring image of the film the comfortable playground where tim obviously feels at home filmed from a birds eye view because with every character tim feels comfortable to share a part of himself and we view these intimate moments he shares in the red spinnable playground saucer complete with childish graffiti carved in pencil from above after advising him curtly to pass the joint penny tells him tim well the secret to the success of life is to find something you love and you have to do that for the rest of your life  and you better hope to hell that youre good at it because if youre not then youll probably fail this simple line of advice from penny serves as the movies central theme the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure why does one person have a talent he cannot stand like matt who hated the attention his swimming fame brought but no one notices tims talent  no one  because no one bothers to ask him not even us the film makes us aware that we ourselves do not know tim as well as we thought we did when we first meet this handsome sad guy in our intimate understanding of tim as it progresses we are reminded that not everyone is as they seem to be this is the other side of the film the failure of those who should  parents friends teachers  whoever  to notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love not even his mother sandy played by sigourney weaver sees tims gift despite her love for her son weaver does a deft job of a middleaged woman grappling with her own inner demons as she haphazardly tries to play the roles of domesticity and support when tim is found to be bullied at school she storms the boys trailer threatening his life you can tease torture punch drive drunk with me i can forgive you hell i can understand it im a good christian you know i can forgive and forget but you mess with my kid and may god himself descend from heaven to protect you because as long as i live  and i will outlive you all  i will wake up and go to sleep at night just dreaming of ways to make your petty insignificant lives into hell on earth after flicking a paper cup into the mothers face she looks around the trailer and looking at them both the kid and his stunned mother comments nice trailer and leaves as quickly as she came weaver scores in her ability to match gusto with visceral wit that is acid and witty and tims father played by jeff daniels is blind to who his son is treating him like a stranger not telling his family that he took time off from the office spending his days in the city park listless a carved out soul and sleeping in matts bed tucked in with his high school letter jacket jeff daniels does a superb job of making us believe that he can be both a bastard and lovable because we grow to see that even an inept father can show his love for his son in an emotional scene tim confronts his father just when you think his dad is going to hit him he grabs for him to embrace him not letting him go he tells tim i am your father and youre are my son and im here okay but youve gotta talk to me i dont know how to do this by myself it is here at this moment in the film that a father tells his son you have to tell me whats going on inside of you you have to tell me who you are i want to know who you are it is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment the visual movement from tim angry and alone to his father embracing him as he breaks downs and weeps revealing the emotions hidden beneath his shell tim experiences this moment of cleansing with his dad as a catharsis especially when you consider the mistreatment manipulation disregard violence and betrayal he has been dealt in the long year the film encompasses i recommend this film
