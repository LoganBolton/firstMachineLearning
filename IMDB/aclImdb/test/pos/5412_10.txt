wow when i went to this film at the toronto film festival i had no idea what i was in for this movie takes you on an emotional rollercoaster in the best sense of the term sigourney weaver was better than ive seen from her in years emile hirsch was great and jeff daniels broke my heart i can see how this wont be every persons cup of tea as at times it deals with some pretty harsh things that can happen to a family dont get me wrong  its really funny too  at my screening the audience burst out in applause after laughing over and over again i just think if youre open to examining your own life imaginary heroes will sincerely touch you i cant wait until it comes out in theaters
