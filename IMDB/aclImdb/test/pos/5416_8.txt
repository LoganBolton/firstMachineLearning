its a shame that by garnering a restricted rating perhaps the audience that would find this film the most useful wont likely see itbr br imaginary heroes follows the life of a teenager after his brothers suicide not of course the most original story in the world however it does spend a great deal of time humanizing their parents the imaginary heroes that failed in their sons eyesbr br for teenagers who tend to put responsibility for their failures on their parents but yet refuse to accept any real responsibility on their own the movie sends a powerful message that in the end we all have our own troubles we need to deal with and that we all make our own pathsbr br but unlike other movies that tend to urge youth independence this one resolves the issues between parents and child and they become a stronger unit for it that the eldest child committed suicide is regrettable but not overlooked later in the film and the responsibility by all parties for the tragedy is thoroughly explainedbr br although the subject matter has been covered before it hasnt been covered quite this way  the film pulls very little punches now why this earned it an r rating is confusing  youre unlikely to get across to a teenager in this era without being realistic but yet providing realism restricts that very audiencebr br were my junior highschool class have been shown this film two suicides may have been prevented in this case the censors seem to have exercised extremely poor judgmentbr br 810
