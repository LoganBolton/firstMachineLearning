i was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script susan sarandon plays the part of a flighty irrational and possessive mother who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together she removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in hollywood the daughter is dubious but at first she has no choice the bond with mother is pathologically strongbr br in time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground she sees her mother go head over heels for a handsome seductive guy who loves em and leaves em she sees that the mother doesnt get it so how can she look to her mother for guidancebr br the mother directs the girl to a drama tryout and sees the daughter act out the part of the mother in such a way that a shockingly painful mirror is held up to the flybynight mother this causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified at the impact on the mother and is apologetic but the lesson takes holdbr br there is charactergrowth as the mother realizes her selfish claim on the daughter and eventually is persuaded to let the girl go it is a touching scene and a valuable lesson that parents however emotionally dependent have to let the child go and become her own separate person
