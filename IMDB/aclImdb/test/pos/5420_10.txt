this hugely entertaining short is considered one of the best shorts ever and i certainly wont argue with that even in a country where topnotch animated shorts are created with regularity this film still manages to stand out if you ever get the chance to view this film please do so its only ten minutes long and yet it contains a man who is obsessed with saws a woman who vacuums the bathtub and a nuclear war what more could you want in a film
