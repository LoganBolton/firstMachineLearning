this is a very strange little short film that initially didnt impress me from a purely aesthetic point of view the animation here certainly aint prettythough after a while you notice that the simple and silly drawings do possess a certain odd charm thats probably because with the script as screwy as this one the animation worksbr br the film shows an older couple sitting at the table playing scrabble at the same time they are fixated on this game or other bizarre pursuits such as the husbands compulsion to saw thingseven the chair and table and all of this stuff occurs as the television warns of pending atomic annihilationarmageddon is definitely here naturally the neighbors are screaming and running amokduring which time the couple obliviously continues with this idiotic game heck even their cat knows the end is coming as the couple begin bickering about who may or may not have cheatedleading to a very surreal ending indeed the film deserves kudos for both being unique as well as very funny while it did not win the oscar it was nominated for best animated shortwhich it richly deserved
