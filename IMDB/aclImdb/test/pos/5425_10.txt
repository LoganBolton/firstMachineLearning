richard condie is a canadian marvel and one that should be shared with the world be it for gutbusting early work such as getting started and the oscarnominated snit through the apprentice and the digitally made la salla condie is a treasured local hero but no singular piece of work puts a stamp on his career quite like the big snit and did i mention it was nominated for an academy award darn tootinbr br the big snit although clearly a dated messagebearer from the 1980s the short revolves around cold waresquire nuclear annihilation but dont worry  its hilarious as hell carries with it a larger meaning as is most of condies work in an understated sort of way while the planet scurries for cover from armageddon a couple bickers over each others annoying habits in true condie fashion he hacksaws the furniture while she shakes her eyes  literally and dont forget to watch it again and again cuz theres always something to look at condie loads this fella up with countless visual gags and memorable catchphrasesbr br i strongly encourage this incredible piece of animation be tracked down in canada its usually spotted in a national film board video that includes other stellar shorts including fellow winnipegger cordell barkers equally funny the cat came back americans will just have to dig a little deeper but keep at it  the reward is worth the toil
