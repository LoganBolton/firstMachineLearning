this film is all about humans this film stayed as my all time favorite short cartoon for yearsbr br isnt it the simplest things that make life so much more interesting we humans are so soft compassionate funny caring to each other one moment  we invent the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many people as possible with the least effort the next in our short lives we destroy our world each other and often our own lives than spend the rest of our lives trying to fix what weve destroyed sometimes there is nothing left to fixbr br this film can entertain educate and even help us realize what is wrong in our lives life is short and can be even shorter the ending is way too optimistic i am afraidbr br i love richard condies mind and what he makes happen with it br br enjoybr br hk
