this movie reminds me of great movies that temporarily wake me up with the realization that the emperor is indeed naked our election process is unclothed and dismal my awareness is heightened and i want to see the world change after a short while i am lulled back to my little complacency and bubble life in the best sense of film this work will ferment into an edible stew for me and like in network i want to be convicted to sayim as mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore but to whom my vigorous youthful idealism has been slowly reduced to concerned parent with quiet convictions or rather beliefs man of the year reveals how much i yearn for honest and sometimes humorous takes on our current political situation dobbs line  i did inhale because i thought what the hellits lit its in my hand ill inhale it was refreshing or wouldve been when clinton was president why cant politicians be honest and set that tone for debates we people must realize how much veneer is being put forth as real i am sick of this election process alreadyanyone else let take off the veils and set an agenda for our elected officials and take them to task not reelect when they continue with evasion and nonrepresentation of citizenry this movie can inspire us to increase our expectations of politicians that spew rhetoric great film
