robin williams shows his standup talents and boosts up his status as a comedian in this movie of whats wrongin american politics and how can hollywood try to make an influence without boring people of course hollywood uses movies with hidden or notsohidden agendas i think this movie is for people who likes standup and political discussion and the trailers of this movie were for everybody just to make sure as many people as possible will see this everybody knows hollywood is more liberaldemocrat than the bushco so they have to make these movies every now and thenbut this one was perhaps too obvious at least i thought so for making any real changebr br still great standup and fresh political issues and talksi enjoyed it and thanks to imdbcom ratings i was positively surprised when i walked out from the movie theater and yes i laughed many times sometimes you just have to let it go and forget all the seriousnesssee this movie if you like good and clever standup or politics and you will not be offended by the several references of how things are not good right now rent it if that doesnt match you
