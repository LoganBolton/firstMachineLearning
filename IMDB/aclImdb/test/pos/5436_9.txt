this film is a great comedy drama christopher walken is tremendous in his supporting role as manager and his commentary will keep you laughing robin williams plays a great role as a quick wit jon stewart and will amuse you if you are fans of comedy central the show is good because if the viewer has halfabrain they will see it as a very needed subcultural attack on the policies of the current republican government and a criticism on the american democratic process not to mention the means by which most politicians get electedbr br i was amused at the subplots and found the film to be very fast paced and entertaining without any of the usual ohbrothers i would agree the film is less comedy than marketed however without question better than 90 of the garbage in theatres at present just my thoughtsdon
