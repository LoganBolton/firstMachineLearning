actually ill admit im a political junkie so this resonated with me but the erratic nature of ms green yes i know what they did to her but the ending was such a copout and totally inconsistent with the film itselfbr br why cant barry l and crew just left us wondering what he was going to do let us debate itbr br instead they have this oh im not worthy bullshit ending and it just shows that when the chips were down its better to leave the table instead of doubling down stop the disney ending and putting a bow on it life isnt easy they should have had the courage to give the main character some backbonebr br we had to listen to the rhetoric the entire movie and then it turned sniveling and the stupid inane behavior by ms green when the crap was out of her system just made for a ridiculous near end of the movie that was icing on the cake
