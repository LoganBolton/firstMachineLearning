robin williams is a genius one of the best comedians in the world he really shows off in this one cracking jokes left and right as the talk show comedian tom dobbs from the previous this looked like it would be a sidesplitting laugh fest and it was funny but there were a lot of serious parts in the movie that i was not expecting i would describe it as a dramacomedy but its still worth the money to see and i still found it to be almost everything that i expected robin williams is at his best along with the famous christopher walken they play a very good team in this movie and i was actually shocked to see how well the two were able to work together i recommend it to anyone who is looking for a lighthearted movie
