now im a bit biased since im a big fan of late night television ive been a loyal fan of jay leno for about 6 or 7 years and think hes one of the funniest most talented comedians out there and david letterman is one hell of a comedian as well though i only watch his show unless jays a repeat during commercials or when he has a better guest than jay on the show daniel roebuck and john michael higgins are both fine actors and they very much resembled jay and dave but did they disappear into the characters nope roebuck barely nails down jays voice and expression mumbling at a high pitch sounding like a castrati marlon brando higgins nails down davids facial expressions for example his trademark squirm but he doesnt nail down daves voice those who arent big fans of late night tv might be a lot less biased theres a couple comedians who can do deadon impersonations of jay why couldnt they have selected one of them for the part and the same goes with dave id rather they had norm mcdonald play the part norm doesnt look a hell of a lot like dave but he did a great impersonation of him on snl heyyou got any gum that was so hilariousbr br however i learned a lot about the late night wars which i had very little knowledge of at first i never watched the tonight show prior to when jay leno was host so i didnt know about the struggle to finally replace johnny carson and the countless negotiations that finally convinced dave to move to cbs i knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and found the film very enlightening and kathy bates gives a knockout performance as the foulmouthed former executive producer of the tonight show she basically steals the film br br my score 7 out of 10 br br
