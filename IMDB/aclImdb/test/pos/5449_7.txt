i remember this movie getting a lot of flak from reviewers when it was new letterman and leno themselves had objections letterman called it paraphrasing the biggest waste of film hed ever seen and leno objected to the simpleton portrayal of himself but letterman had john michael higgins as a guest on his show so it seems he didnt take anything too personally a dvd rerelease with opinions and such from those involved could be interesting though i suspect the days when late night talkshow wars captivated the nation are gone and not returning soonbr br i preferred the letterman impersonation to the leno but could never buy in to either they never rose above caricature and i never simply accepted them as actors for comparison paul sorvino as kissinger in oliver stones nixon comes to mind as an impersonation which may have seemed laughable in the first few moments but which seemed at least plausible after the first moments of amusement wore offbr br the highlight of the show for me was treat williams as michael ovitz williams speech to letterman was not as great as but reminiscent of alec baldwins entrance and quick exit as blake in glengerry glen rossbr br they could have done more with johnnys role in all this i know he was mostly uninvolved in the events portrayed in this movie and most audiences will be familiar with his reputation such that johnny carson needs no introduction but more context about why dave and jay and all comedians revere johnny would have given this flick the substance it lacks in being a gossip filmbr br guess i should read the bookbr br rich little imitating johnny carson unfortunately came across as nothing more than rich little imitating johnny carsonbr br i tell you what after watching this movie then watching either the letterman or leno show all i want to do is crack open my johnny carson dvds and see the real thing
