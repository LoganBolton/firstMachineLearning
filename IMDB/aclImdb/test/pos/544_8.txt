regarded as another one of the recent overthetop dramas brought upon us by hollywood this movie excels where others have totally failedespecially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of natalie portman this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both susan and natalie share they seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family they go through so many motherdaughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities i feel that these two actress talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar full of cliches and really saved the suffering plot i would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such overthetop dramas
