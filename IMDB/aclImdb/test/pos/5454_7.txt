i read the book written by bill carter on which this movie is based many years ago the book is certainly stronger than the movie it provides more detail than a movie can possibly provide the end result being that i thought the movie seemed a wee bit sketchy on a handful of items all things considered though and given the limitations of the medium the movie provides a wholly entertaining and informative account of the battle between jay leno and david letterman in the early 90s to host the tonight show after the retirement of johnny carsonbr br the highlight is clearly the performances i can think of no more difficult performance for an actor than to play a character who is still alive and wellknown and on tv on a regular basis john michael higgins nailed the part of letterman perfectly watching him really was like watching letterman daniel roebuck tried valiantly to be jay leno but somehow didnt pull it off as effectively his whole look seemed fake and he just didnt seem natural in the role in a less central role rich little not surprisingly nailed the voice of carson although the look was a bit off in the book the most interesting of the central figures was probably lenos agent helen kushnick in the movie kathy bates was perfect in the role although not quite as out of control as carters portrayal of the woman in writingbr br in the end this is light and entertaining viewing the subject matter isnt especially important in the overall scheme of things but its a fun behind the scenes look at a memorable time in the entertainment industry 710
