the directing is brilliant the casting is remarkable though i wouldve loved to have seen a little more of aaron lustig from y  r fame who played paul shaffer i only have two minor quips about the film as subtle as they are one roebucks leno is excellent but his stage presence ie during what appears the taping of one of his late show episodes is a tad underwhelming two the distribution of the foul language i am willing to tolerate foul language so long as it is not used gratuitously and to a degree the film was gratuitous the language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce the pathos of bates otherwise wellportrayed kushnick by her frequent use of it and served to make roebucks leno a goodygoody by his lack of use of it of course if the characters really did behave this way kudos to everybody nonetheless the piece is an excellent one as far as television and video are concerned the film i feel had potential for the big screen but wouldve required recasting for the bit parts and probably a different director as well the aesthetic feel is that of the larry sanders show good for hbo mediocre for cinematic purposes
