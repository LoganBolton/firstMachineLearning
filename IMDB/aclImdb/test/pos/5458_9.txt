over the years ive watched this movie many times from seeing it on hbo and i now own a copy on dvd i must say its very memorable and entertaining in the meantime its interesting and educational too as any tv fan can relate to the time of the early 90s when the time came up to replace johhny carson the tv living legend of the tonight show whos it gonna be jay or dave this original film from hbo the late shift stays true to form and depicts the real events very well showing the behind the scenes battle between networks heads of nbc and cbs and even abc they were all fighting for the services of jay and dave the acting makes it seem real as very little actual tv footage is shown with real life people as the actors portraying leno and letterman make it seem so real i havent read the bill carter book so i dont know if it stayed true to the pages but i have highly enjoyed this film over the years from the moment when it starts showing cbs entertainment heads watching leno sub for johhny and they decide they want to get in on the late night game yet when carson announces his unexpected retirement nbc wants to stay loyal with leno yet conflict arrives when letterman wants a crack at the slot at 1130 too it was fun to watch the wacky meeting with michael ovitztreat williamswho makes all networks want to consider letterman for a show it was interesting to see the scene of johhny telling letterman by phone in a direct way to walk from nbc and consider cbs and by the way rich little was terrific as johhny carson his portrayal couldnt be matched and plenty of tense moments were provided by showing the bickering and firing of lenos talent manager helen which nbc heads pressured him to do overall great film that showed what tv is really like and it proves that networks are power and money hungry while showing thats its a cutthroat business clearly theres no business like show business great work from hbo very memorable and a watch anytime it showed the true story of the late night wars
