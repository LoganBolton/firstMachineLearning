i thought anywhere but here was a good movieit stars two wonderful actresses susan sarandon and natlie portman which when i heard they were in a movie together i resist watching itoverall it was a pretty enjoyable movieit had its moments where i felt as if they tried to hard and there was also some really overdone and wornout material but there wasnt anything in the movie that i absolutely hatedi even liked how they used the popup performance of the uncredited thora birch and all the little happysad moments are touching and effectiveif you want to watch this movie go ahead because even though i dont recommend it its not something you should avoid and a 59 rating seems unfair in my opinion
