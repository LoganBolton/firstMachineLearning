the late shift was an interesting made for hbo movie that took a detailed look at the power struggle that ensued between david letterman and jay leno when johnny carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him this struggle is now part of hollywood folklore but for those who dont know the story and are aware of where letterman is now it might be interesting to learn that david letterman wanted to replace johnny carson as host of the tonight show more than anything in the world but letterman found his dreams being derailed as frequent guest host leno had one of hollywoods most powerful agents helen kushnick in his corner and working tirelessly to get her client the job its not often that we get to see behind the scenes hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment value but for fans of these two late night superstars this movie provided a fascinating look at a very turbulent period in late night television according to this movie letterman was practically promised the job by carson himself while nbc had promised the job to leno and thats where helen kushnick came in the movie presents leno as sort of a milquetoast who allowed his career to be manipulated by kushnick and feigned ignorance to some of helens strongwilled manipulations of some of nbcs biggest power players and it presents letterman as this smart and savvy businessman who despite having carsons support was railroaded by nbc and kushnick john michael higgins and daniel roebuck credibly recreate letterman and leno respectively but it is the razorsharp performance of oscar winner kathy bates as helen kushnick that keeps this movie bubbling bates commands the screen in one of her best if not so wellknown performances as the venomous hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast there is also a wonderful turn by impressionist rich little as johnny carson but it is primarily a fascinating story and the powerhouse performance by bates that make this one worth checking out
