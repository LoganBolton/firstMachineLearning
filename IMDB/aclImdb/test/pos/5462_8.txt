alright so maybe the impersonations of jay leno and david letterman are not spot on but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen bob balaban and treat williams are excellant as warren littlefield and micheal ovitzbr br the movie doesnt go for joke and punchline but it is still funny kathy bates in particular is amazing as lenos managerbr br funny amazing interesting very watchable this is a good tv movie
