as a former tv editor i can say this is as authentic as it gets it even led to lettermans producer thought to be a source resigning eventually in real life letterman was outraged ok so one goofy thing is it has him throwing softballs at a tire swing on his estate total fabrication but the main information is hilariously true from the silly bidding war for letterman once he decided to leave nbc to lenos problems with an agent who was not ready for big time but who he let run the show almost to a disastrous exit out of his famed loyalty if any of you kids dont grasp the idea of why letterman is jealous to this day see this tape
