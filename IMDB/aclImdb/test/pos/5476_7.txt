what ive seen of wolfgang petersens films has been pretty good he knows how to direct action create suspense and get you interested eastwood tends to be great sometimes excellent this goes for both his acting and his directing they both hand in solid work here the concept isnt bad and the catandmouse game works well malkovich performs rather well and his and eastwoods playing off each other adds to the film i suppose this wont introduce anything new really but it never really claims to nor needs to its two great actors each playing a basic type of role that they have proved at other points in their careers that they can manage remarkably well and with a magnificent director at the helm really its entertaining welldone and it just plain delivers editing and cinematography are good acting and character writing is as well the film manages to be suspenseful and intense and if you let yourself you will probably be entertained and engaged even if there are superior films out there the pacing is pretty much spoton i recommend this to any fan of the principal actors the director andor this type of film 710
