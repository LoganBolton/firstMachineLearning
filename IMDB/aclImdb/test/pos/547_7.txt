the main attraction of anywhere but here is the superb performance of natalie portman she gave her rather thankless character a lot of muchappreciated emotional depth susan sarandon a fine actress is suitably sincere as the mother figure i thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script i am not saying the script was bad in any way i am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times i dont think it was the script writers fault the film did suffer from being overlong and became sometimes unfocused in the longer scenes the film does look beautiful with some good direction and excellent performances all in all watchable certainly but maybe more for an older audience 710 bethany cox
