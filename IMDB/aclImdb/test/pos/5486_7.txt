in the line of fire tells the story of the game between an old presidential bodyguard and a formergovernment assassin turned psycho the secret service agentbodyguard eastwood is on defense and the assassin malkovichis on offense the stakes the presidents livebr br i really like this movieive seen it numerous times on tv and have recently bought it on dvd yet its not an excellent movie the plot is way too thin and the attempts to thicken it are downright ridiculous the whole lovestory isnt very plausible and the way they brought an extra character into the story just to be able to kill it off is kind of insulting to the more or less intelligent viewer though i feel these mistakes cant be forgiven i can easily look past them to mr malkovich exquisite performance ive always deemed him to be a great actor but in this movie hes really on fire theres a reason why he got an academy award nomination rene russo and clint eastwood were okay but i dont deem their performance to be memorable theyre never at the best of their abilitiesbr br if you dont expect too much youll certainly like this movie its no masterpiece but john malkovich is really extraordinary and i dont think anyone cant enjoy his performance really worth the watch
