heres another entertaining clint eastwood actionsuspense film i am not a particularly fan of his but i have to hand to him he knows how to make entertaining movies this is one more example it didnt hurt either to have john malkovich as his costar now there is an intense actor in this story malkovich plays an assassin and he is fascinating to watch thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialog he was given he also has a interesting voicebr br rene russo is fairly lowkey for her but thats fine and eastwood plays the usual lonercop role not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all up in the end i guess he couldnt stop playing the dirty harrytype figures but he played them wellbr br there were some negatives this film however namely credibility in parts as there were a couple of times had this been reallife the killer would have done away with eastwood the climatic scene in particularly had too many holes in it there also were too many abuses of lords name in vain in herebr br overall however this is good escapist fare
