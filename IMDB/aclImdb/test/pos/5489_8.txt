wolfgang petersons in the line of fire is cunning and occasionally a truly whiteknuckled ride even if once or twice we might feel like weve been down similar roads before how could one not when clint eastwood right after allegedly closing the book on his western legacy likely closes the one on his gritty detective pictures dont count blood work in there but theres more than that because eastwoods character here a hardbitten demonridden and hard as nails secret service agent has a slightly charming side to him even the more romantic side that one never got to see in the pictures where he spouted his trademark lines there is some complexities going on here that dont rely on just the usual swagger and its noteworthy for how such a possibly contrived back story didnt save kennedy from being assassinated in 63 is made somewhat believable amidst the rest of his persona which more than likely hides his wounds most of the time eastwood goes to town to make himself a great presence in the film however and under the circumstances the character seems tailor made for himbr br but there would be the risk of his part in the movie being slightly conventional we still get the harry type scenes of him being smarter and as smartass over everyone else in the room and being scolded and told to back off by the top brass here a chief of staff including here protecting a president that wisely we never really see or know at all even the romantic subplot which is sort of undercooked if there for some machismo laughs would make the picture a little subpar if the other quasidirty harry aspect didnt come into the picture an indelible villain this time theres some extra hollywood suspense however brillaintly intelligent suspense almost smarter than the rest of the movie deserves with the john booth character played in an oscar nominated performance by john malkovich as someone whos described more as a predator than an assassin theres ways this could go wrong with the eastwood character but malkovich possibly trumps some of his former villain counterparts by being extremely cool and uncollected theres that devastating cringeworthy scene where he kills the bank teller and her roommate and as his past is revealed theres still that element of what the hell is with this guy that keeps the audience and eastwoods agent guessing and extra paranoid its a classic malkovich performance quintessentially creepy and always measured in the level of insanity and professionalismbr br its also aside from the conventional points just a sleekly made picture from peterson and company and they come pretty close to the spunky pulp realism of don siegel but peterson also has a couple of cinematic tricks up his sleeve that had me grinning at times anytime someone puts in such a blatant but exciting homage to vertigo jumping from rooftop to rooftop hero dangling from the ledge the twist it still provides some shivers down my spine theres also the phone conversations between eastwood and malkovich where we see the depths of the cat and mouse game probably another kick in the ribs to hithcock but in the end even with all the excitement and brutal danger and crisp formalism in the climax its also a characters picture in some ways throughout and everything is fairly realized to give the audience a fine amount to ponder over at least in the suspensemovie sense eastwods a great lead russo plays the female possible loveinterest sincere and mature and malkovich is top of the pops theres also a few notable supporting roles too and a fine studio score in there one of the better films of 1993
