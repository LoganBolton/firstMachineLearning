in the line of fire in my opinion is an excellent suspenseful and edgeofyourseat actiondramathriller i thought that agent horrigan clint eastwood and agent raines rene russo looked good in the attire they wore at the presidential dinner as for leary john malkovich he was a sick man who loved to toy with frank by phone he looked good in the tuxedo he wore near the end of the film though one thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between agent horrigan and agent raines before i wrap this up id like to say that the entire cast and crew did an outstanding job i loved the setting and i couldnt get enough of it now in conclusion to all you clint eastwood fans who havent seen this excellent suspenseful and edgeofyourseat actiondramathriller i highly recommend it
