this is another of eastwoods many movies mixing intrigue action and a dollop of romance along with the gauntlet firefox and so forth clints acting range by now is pretty familiar in this one hes taciturn and a bit outrageous especially with women and superiors there are no surprises in his performance but the film itself is something of a surprise its above average br br clint is frank a secret service agent who perhaps in a moment of doubt failed to catch the bullet that killed jfk he then took to drink which drove his family away and now plods along in the bureaucracy until he is contacted by john malkovitch calling himself booth who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability now this is rather an anfractuous set of attitudes for a performer like clint to project but he does rather well less robotic than usual and he does seem to carry around with him like a burden of stone the memory of that moment in dallas hes tested again halfway through this movie he is hanging from the roof of a tall building grasping booths hand and he pulls his pistol and points it at booth who asks him if he is really willing to shoot if he does of course he saves the president from an attempted assassination by a ciatrained murderer but he does so at the cost of his own life booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair and clint even has a short speech talking to renee russo about his failure to save the president in dallas if id have reacted quickly enough i could have taken that shot    and that would have been alright with me its underplayed but his voice chokes slightly his eyes water and his lip trembles its one of the few scenes in any of clints films that might properly be called moving we know from his newfound resolve that given another chance he would take the bullet this time the irony is that he doesnt like the current president who could he gives pompous speeches in colorado about how they carved a nation out of the wilderness didnt they do the same thing in las vegasbr br its often said that a movie is only as good as its villain it isnt true nothing is that simple but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case the reptilian john malkovitch with his tartar eyes is marvelousbr br talk about disillusioned okay he can ham it up a little sniffing with disdain even as he plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes but hes fascinating on the screen renee russo has little do to fred thompson as the chief white house aid is now back in politics a relief for moviegoers if clints acting range is limited thompsons is something less in every film hes been in he wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorderbr br the direction by wolfgang peterson is as good as it was in das boot which is pretty good there is a great deal of the usual suspenseful crosscutting in the final shootout and when clint and russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor  not only the usual garments but handcuffs guns beepers palm pilots dick tracy wrist watches and other impedimenta interrupted clint lies back on the bed and sighs now i have to put all that stuff back on againbr br well written and worth watching
