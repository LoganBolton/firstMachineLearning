quite simply a wellmade wellwritten and wonderfully acted movie eastwood is classic as grizzled secret service agent frank horrigan and rene russobr br holds her own as partner and love interest lilly raines but the moviesbr br greatness rests on the shoulders of john malkovich as booth he capturesbr br this characters rage and hatred as well as his humanity oddly enough br br personally i think this was his best performance and should have received anbr br oscar for it but i loved tommy lee jones in the fugitive as well that year overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassins mind and bebr br on the edge of your seat the whole way through enjoy
