in the line of fire is one of those hollywood films that shows up on tv quite a bit but although ive seen it a few times i usually end up sitting through the whole thing again why  its good clint eastwood is great as usual and the character he plays is interesting and more fleshed out than usual the character secret service agent frank horrigan is haunted by the fact that he was on the detail that failed to protect president kennedy in dallas and now hes forced to match wits with a professional assassin that is openly declaring that he will kill the president however the film doesnt make him a depressed brooding and obsessed character hes charming and personable and is realistic as a guy that has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his own skin hes even quite convincing when he flirts with the pretty younger agent played by rene russo the killer played by john malkovich at his best is cerebral deliberate and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death he even goes by the name of another presidential assassin john boothbr br  the film is consistently enjoyable and it delivers all the goods  suspense action romance and drama  all in their proper amounts its a fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it
