for some inexplicable reason jerrys movies often seemed to come in for diatribes from certain quarters although they were rarely box office disappointments its one of lifes great mysteries to me because his films have always had a feel good factor about them for me but this film is not only not bad its an exceedingly good and clever comedy to those who may be tickled by modern crude or cruel humour dont see this film theres nothing in it like that and youll be wasting your timebr br ive only seen this film once on the television ive waited ever since to see it again and thats been quite a few years youd think the idea of an arrogant millionaire businessman heading off to win the war against the nazis with his own small private army of subservient employees would be boring wouldnt you well only jerry lewis would dare try such a plot for an out and out comedy and it works i have to say brilliantlybr br i think that as with the nutty professor and most of his other films this movie is testimony to his comic genius both in concept and execution i think buddy love might have said you know true comedy can not only make a six year old hysterical itll do that for his dad too maybe a few nutty nazis generals with monocles and a limp would dislike this movie honestly if you only see one more comedy in your life see this one be careful though you might die laughing and im not joking
