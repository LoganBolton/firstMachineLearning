i think this movie is the most misunderstood film in jerry lewis career its little slow starting but after it gets going is very funny  jerrys use of irony like never before in his earlier films ie whos minding the store the nutty professor etc the idea is clear its a mock of the dirty dozen instead of getting soldiers on death row to do a suicide mission as in that film you have 4 4fs  2 tag alongs including the former la dodgers allstar centerfielder willie davis as linc hilarious love that movie
