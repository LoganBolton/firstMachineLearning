everyone told me this movie was downright not good and sick etc so i finally rented it and i was amazed  i thought the torture was gonna be much much worse but it did get shocking near the end but that was about it i wouldnt call it a horror movie maybe a mystery or something under the category of silence of the lambs andor kiss the girls it did get stupid at times but the rest of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat 710br br rated r  for strong torture violence language and sexuality
