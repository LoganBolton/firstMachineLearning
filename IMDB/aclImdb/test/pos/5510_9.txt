this thriller is one of the few film surprises ive had in quite some time everybody  and i do mean everybody  i talked to when it was in the theatres said it was awfulbut then i got to thinkingnone of these people really understand horrorthriller films or metal rock  so why do i listen to them in the first place this film kicks ass  but only if you are able to comprehend and enjoy this type of entertainment in short too late  see it with an open mind and it might just open your mind the soundtracks great too
