i enjoyed the film and the fact that it aimed rather high in dealing with some sophisticated material i saw the film in a preview screening and it wasnt ruined by any silly video boxes that spoiled the ending the performances were quite good especially andrew mccarthy in a more mature roll i also enjoyed the look of the film which gave it a mysterious forboding air i also enjoyed some of the twists in the plot and dont want to give too much away in case other countries video boxes dont give it all away the script was a little over the top at times but i appreciated the fact that the filmmakers werent afraid to challenge the audiences with interesting and puzzling questisons regarding the roll of faith in our world and while some might find the ending a little too openended i appreciated the fact that the movie refused to tie everything up neatly with a bow thats not how life works
