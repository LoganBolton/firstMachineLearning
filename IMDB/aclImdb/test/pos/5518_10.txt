this film was different it took a sort of typical thriller story and reached for a more interesting indepth look at an individual characters struggle with faith of course it helped that the main performance by andrew mccarthy was quite excellent the other performances were also quite interesting although not as consistent the ending was a bit of a let down but there were lots of good moments the filmmakers tried something different here  they didnt just go for the obvious chills and scares this is a dark film not for everyone but if you want to be entertained and not talked down to try this one
