i saw this movie on my local cable system under the title of beyond redemption i was searching for new material to watch since most of the reruns one saturday morning didnt interest me ive always been a fan of andrew mccarthy and michael ironside so i chose this movie i was pleasantly surprisedbr br personally i enjoyed the film rich roesing who posted a comment about the film being spoiled for him by seeing scenes from the movie on the back of a video rental box are well justified i did not have the disappointment of knowing beforehand anything about the film this led me to rate the movie higher than the average score listed on the pagebr br i like suspense movies and this one was no exception the movie kept me guessing until the very end i was surprised by the endingbr br the moments of reflection and remembrance of past experiences by the main character during the film only added to the suspense his reactions to those remembrances gave the film a sense of the humanitarian yet conflictual side of police work the struggle with his faith is also a welcome additionbr br if you like suspense films but also like films that expound on the characters feeling personal inflection side this film is for youbr br should you find this movie on your local cable or satellite systems guide watch itbr br however if you are looking for a rental video follow rich roesings advice and have someone get the video for you before watching it
