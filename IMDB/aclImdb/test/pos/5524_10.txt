the working title was dont spank baby br br wayne crawford went on to become a successful producer films like valley girl night of the comet and others even though he wasnt too terrific in this little gem and little known abe zwick should have gotten tons of work from this film but didnt filmed at moberly studios in hollywood florida on the same lot the early tarzan movies were filmed this film is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract the movie was originally shot with some nudity and much more graphic slasher scenes for reasons only known to tom casey the director the bloody slasher scenes were given a tab of lsd and the nudity was removed even though this version is worthy of a look for those so inclined in my opinion the original version would have packed the punch needed to make this a full on slasher 70s cult classic
