the gimmick as it were of this 1934 paramount comedy is the six comedy performers paired off into three manandwoman teams who all appear together w c fields and his frequent screen partner alsion skipworth appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as a smalltown sheriff and innkeeper fields seems to have been given the latitude to inject plenty of his own oneofakind brand of misanthropic surreal comedy into his part and it works wonderfully especially where he is allowed to do his famous pool table routine a digression that is totally welcome since it is hilariousbr br at first thought it might have seemed like a mismatch to conceive of a film to be carried by the subtle domestic comedy of charlie ruggles and mary boland next to the broad jokey vaudeville patter of the great husbandandwife comedy team of george burns and gracie allen but here it works perfectly because of the parts george and gracie are given in the script they are there are freeloaders hitching a ride to california on ruggles and bolands honeymoon trip and consistently find ways to annoy them at every step including brilliantly while they are each holding on to the side of a cliff for dear lifebr br making burns and allen comic annoyances to two sympathetic characters turns out to be a perfect way to fit their farout largerthanlife comedy characters into a real world setting  the comedy of people reacting to them in a believable way turns out to be as much as a goldmine as gracies famous naive delivery itselfbr br charlie ruggles deserves special mention for his performance as the fussy banker pinky whinney hes marvelously subtle and underplayed and draws laughs from lines that in another actors hands might not even have been heardbr br the script is wonderfully witty all through and most of the way its a perfectly extended comedy of frustration in which our sympathies are with the poor whinneys who cant get a moment alone and the extra bonus is that what frustrates them is just more firstrate comedy material from burns and allen br br for the precode watchers out there there is some rather suggestive material in some of the most amusing scenes as whinney tries to get across to george just why he and his wife want to be alone for a whilebr br there are a few signs of a rushed production here  the occasional jump cut one of the most obvious drop sets you will ever see in a movie right up there with w c fields own short the golf specialist and the knot in fields tie is constantly changing in shape these dont bother me though and they shouldnt bother anybody who is enjoying the filmbr br six of a kind is a real littleknown gem and one of the funniest movies ive seen in a while if youre thinking about whether to watch it the answer should be yes
