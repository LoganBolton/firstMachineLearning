being a freshman in college this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mom of course my situation doesnt parrallel with natalie portman and surandons situation but my mom and i have grown up with the typical mother and daughter fights there is always the mother telling you what to do or not being the kind of mother you want to be i was balling my eyes at the end of this movie surandons reaction of her daughter going to the east coast miles away after all theyve been through reminded me of how i felt being from a small city in the west coast going to new york br br the movie is meant for women who have children that are now all grown up it is very touching i was moved by the movie every feeling out of the characters in this movie was utterly real you didnt get any phony sentimentality i was sitting through the credits at the screening of this movie alone wishing my mother was sitting next to me so i could hug her and thank her for everything this movie is a bit corny of course but everything is trully momentous its all about what a mom can learn from her child and what a child learns from her mother 810
