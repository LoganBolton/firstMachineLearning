im surprised with the amount of negative reviews on this film if you dont like this movie for what it is  a silly overthetop mob story  then you are simply reading too much into it this film is a classic tale of a mob wife trying to escape the life and the troubles that follow her michelle pfeiffer is terrificly 80s jersey who is an uncertain uncomfortable mob wife while matthew modine is an anal retentivelike mob tracking cop who falls for her the plot is mostly predictable and cutesy and mercedes ruel steals the show as the queen of mob wives if you arent looking for something too dynamic and complex this movie is absolutely entertaining and an 80s cult classic you wont be able to stop watching if you start
