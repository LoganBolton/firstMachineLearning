the only problem with married to the mob is that it is not funny it dresses up exactly like a romantic comedy but almost nothing that happens is funny but if you can look at it as a film where almost nothing funny happens then youll have a really good time its a glitzy mob film too as per the title extremely glitzy but the director jonathan demme is one of the few prevailing cult directors who fully and completely embraced the 1980s in his work from that decade rather than understandably pretending it was still the 1970sbr br the opening credits combine 1980s animation italianamericanism and miseenscene lathered on top of each other at once from there despite 1980sness it feels about right the lighting by demmes frequent cinematographer tak fujimoto and jukebox soundtrack rife with widely varying pop and alternative jams are gaudy and that is indeed controlled and nuanced as part of the atmosphere demme is good at colorful instant characterizations in his visual and sometimes seemingly impetuous composition of a fun mix of styles a plot that couldve gone any which way where a smooth fbi agent played by a very bland matthew modine trying to infiltrate a mafia family sees a chance when a gun moll played with comehither allure by michelle pfeiffer tries to leave the criminal lifestyle after her triggerman husband in just what you would hope for in an alec baldwin performance is wackedbr br the way it goes works for awhile because demme seems to have a firm hand on the wheel he knows the significance of showing us the very subjective and relatable lifeathome scenes with pfeiffer as well as her cares and longings as a morally conflicted mom although her relationship with son joey is taken a bit for granted what mobsters son is listening to partypooper mom when dads boss played with dean stockwells trademark naturalness and by far the scenestealing standout of the cast is giving him such awesome gifts on the whole though demmes latheredon stylizations are easily viewed as a novel take on a fun crime thriller talebr br ultimately though we find weve been going the wrong way because inevitably modine and pfeiffer have to fall in love thats not inherently bad and every here and there it actually feels bearable but as a romantic subplot it is not handled interestingly or well hardly at all because it hopscotches across various sundry clich√©s which fulfill the initial expectation of a cheesy 1980s date flick and for that audience i think it has just the right impact but for someone who has found themselves genuinely interested in the story and the aesthetic approach it is a letdown into state of tediumbr br so its a decent movie with huge missteps at certain points but as a date movie or a nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the 80s perhaps saw a lot of date movies in the 80s the entertainment value is not as likely to fluctuate except for said deficit in true laughs there maybe a few scoffs and its very broadly tongueincheek but i wouldnt leave the comedy aisle with the high hopes with which id have initially entered whatever the case anyway there are additional joys in bit roles by great character actors who have by now begun to fade like nancy travis joan cusack and oliver platt
