if youre looking for a notsoserious mob movie with a female as the lead youre in the right place pfieffer has acted much better than this you can see she has matured beyond this picturebr br when i first picked this movie up i expected pfeiffer was poorly miscast however she plays her mob wife role to the hilt not a bad performance from baldwin eitherbr br if you dont pay attention to the hair you might enjoy this movie but dont take it too seriously
