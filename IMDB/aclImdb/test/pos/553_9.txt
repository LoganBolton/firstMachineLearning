the interaction between portman and sarandon was quite interesting and i was really sold on the motherdaughter relationship it is a family story that isnt dulled down by frills and special effects a story of how it really is i couldnt help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends the acting was quite exquisite and i hope well be seeing both portman and sarandon in familiar roles down the road
