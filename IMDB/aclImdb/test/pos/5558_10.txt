farscape totally rules in my opinion its very close to babylon five although there are only 7 main characters in the series spaceship included the humour is excellent and the writers manage to keep the show interesting though pretty much everything happens on the shipbr br what i really love and appreciate in farscpae isthat they dont use cgi for the alien characters or if they do its unnoticeable they use those lovable crappy rubber animatronic puppets very similar to the ones used in the original star warsbr br farscape is something you definitely want to look into if you already havent
