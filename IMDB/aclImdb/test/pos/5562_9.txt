having just borrowing the series one dvd collection from my somewhat obsessive brother i was expecting to get through the first couple of episodes and handing it back i have just found myself yelling at the screen for ending the first season on a cliffhanger  a mere week later and ive watched the entire season where i found the time for this i have no ideabr br this show is great it doesnt take itself too seriously it has likeable characters who are well acted and the special effects ignoring the odd tacky puppet here and there are special enough to give it that polished feel at first i didnt realise it was filmed mostly here and it seemed odd to hear so many aussie accents on a scifi show  it was most amusing for the main character john to land back in sydney midway through the first seasonbr br i believe this shows biggest strength is the vision that the creators of the show obviously had they have gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that have explain previous actions and the continue to smatter johns conversations with slang in an amusing and unforced way on top of that having watched the entire voyager and next gen series i see little plot ripoff  so it has managed to maintain a sense of originality throughout the entire first season i hope the rest of it is as goodbr br farscape is not like any other scifi that ive enjoyed in the past i heard that the fourth season wasnt as good as the first three and i am now quite annoyed that they cancelled it before the 5th i hope that they revive this show  with the same actors in either a movie or another series it would be a shame to leave so many plot lines unfinished as i imagine that with a show thats had so much thought put into it to have it axed without adequate warning will leave me feeling robbedbr br gotta go now heading back to my brothers place to snaffle the 2nd seasonbr br v
