one of the greatest crimes made against scifi television was the cancellation of farscape one of the most wellwritten wellacted and overall best shows ever to grace the airwaves it set new standards for scifi television once the flagship highest rated critically acclaied show of the scifi channel it defies explaination as to why shows like buffy tremors the series and even stargate sg1 have lasted as long as they have yes even buffy but ill save my buffy bashing for another time farscape was poorly treated by the scifi channel continually tossed around in scheduling reruns rarely shown and never really advertised but while the show has been cancelled all those involved in the production of the show want to bring the show back even henson company ceo brian henson there is also an extensive fanbased movement to bring the show back  overall things are looking far from dark and hopefully fans will get their season 5
