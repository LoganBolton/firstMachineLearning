this series is vastly underrated like many others i came upon farscape after the series had been cancelled bought season 1 and was surprised to find a smartly written drama infused with a balanced mix of suspense romance wit and of course scifi right off the bat it got a 10 for being the first series or movie to satisfy us how our hero  and every alien with whom he comes in contact  speaks english okay a few others have skirted the issue but farscape did it the best the point is the writers pay close attention to detail to make the show as believable as possiblebr br with so much bad programming out there its a shame that balanced entertaining series such as farscape dont get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production while we enjoy the four seasons and thankfully the fourhour miniseries maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show
