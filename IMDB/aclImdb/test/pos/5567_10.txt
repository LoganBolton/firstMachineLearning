farscape  is the one scifi show which restarted the interest in science fiction in mebr br but farscape is so much more then plain and simple scifi comedy drama and much more  the acting is very good luckily farscape survived also its cancellation and showed with peacekeeper wars that it is not dead yet  i hope there is a future for farscape  in my opinion it is also not problematic that some of the characters in the show are muppets you have to look behind that and you will see what a beauty farscape isbr br farscape set a new standard in television and i think it will be truly hard for new shows to prove that they can be equal or better than farscape i love this show br br saphirjd
