when i first saw the premiere episode of farscape i had no idea what to expect i was immensely impressed and satisfied with premiere subsequent rewatches however have made numerous flaws apparent to me that i missed initially premiere is not a great farscape episode but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the regular charactersbr br the episode begins with john crichton ben browder an astronaut and scientist preparing to launch into space in the farscape module a small space ship perfected by crichton and his friend dk crichton has a revealing conversation with his father jack crichton and then begins his test flight in space of course everything goes wrong and crichton is shot through a wormhole and winds up in a distant part of the galaxybr br after exiting the wormhole crichtons module is pulled on board a living space ship from here the characters and story line for the farscape series are introduced in an entertaining albeit rushed mannerbr br the regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode of course there is crichton played well by ben browder he offers a the audience a sympathetic character to identify with hes lost and has no idea how to do much of anything in premiere crichton has to choose between joining the prisoners or the peacekeepers he knows nothing at all about either side but in helping aeryn a captured peacekeeper pilot it becomes clear that he intends to help the peacekeepers he probably would not have ended up siding with the prisoners if it hadnt been for crais a peacekeeper captain declaring crichton to be the murderer of his brother this puts crichton in an interesting situation hes stuck with bizarre violent escaped prisoners in a faroff galaxy about which he knows nothing at all crichtons total lack of knowledge of the farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during farscapes first seasonbr br the supporting cast is just as compelling theres zhaan a blue delvian and former prisoner shes peaceful and reasonable as opposed to fellow prisoner ka dargo a powerful and hardheaded warrior virginia hey is totally covered in blue makeup allowing her character of zhaan to appear cool and convincing dargos megamakeup in contrast is belowpar he looks kind of silly with his giant tentacles and strange nose and there is something peculiar about his eyes they look as if they have had some sort of allergic reaction to his makeup farscape would give some improvements to his makeup in season 1 but the overall costume would for me at least remain as a problem until season 2br br the puppetdigital characters of rygel and pilot are to put it simply excellent rygel is a tiny hynerian dominar who floats around on some sort of hovercraft in premiere he is given some good dialogue but not much else pilot nearly steals the show as the liaison between the living ship moya and moyas passengers even in the first episode pilot gives off the appearance of being a real living alien he never once in the show seems to be a giant expensive machinebr br the peacekeeper characters introduced are quite interesting as well the peacekeepers are made up of a race called sebaceans who look just like humans the chief antagonist is introduced in premiere as captian crais who believes that crichton killed his brother in reality craiss brothers death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental collision with crichtons ship aeryn sun a pilot who crichton helps escape tries to explain that the death was an accident but crais just claims that she is irreversiby contaminated and refused to change his mind crais obsession for revenge warranted or not it should be clear to crais that crichton isnt responsible is mysterious in premiere but would be explained later in the season aeryn herself provides an extremely interesting character by being forced to leave the peacekeepers she changes her whole way of life and is in that regard in a similar though less severe situation as crichtonbr br the actual episode as mentioned earlier feels somewhat rushed and clunky so much happens that not enough time is spent on anything also dargo for now looks kind of silly running around in his mediocre costume trying to appear menacing still premiere is solid entertainment the special effects such as in the starburst sequences are impressive most of the costumes and the sets on board moya are original despite its flaws premiere is a mustsee for farscape fans 34
