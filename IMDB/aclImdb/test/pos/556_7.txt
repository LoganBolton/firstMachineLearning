susan sarandon and natalie portman play adele and ann august a single mother whos the working definition of the word dreamer and her solemn pragmatic daughter adele wanting to make a fresh start in a big city moves them from wisconsin to californiabr br decent if not exceptional or particularly memorable with some serious and sad moments it pushes some emotional buttons thats for sure best thing it offers is a solid cast and sarandon and portman are quite good in the leads  even if their characters are onedimensional at timesbr br could be better could be worsebr br i gave this one seven out of ten
