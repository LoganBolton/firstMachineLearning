after 2 years of using this site for movie reviews i finally registered with imdb just so i could give farscape a 10 the shows writers cast and crew have proven themselves the unambiguous masters of the science fiction genre even those who do not normally appreciate scifi should be encouraged to give this exceptional series a chancebr br farscapes virtues are simply too numerous to list but one of them stands out above all the quality of the writing is amazing i havent heard dialogue this good since blakes 7 in fact farscape feels a lot like a blakes 7 with good special effects and a bit more romancebr br everyone enjoy
