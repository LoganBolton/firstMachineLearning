i happen to love this show its a refreshing take on some older scifi feels and styles they arent afraid to shoot and when they do people tend to die far too many shows are afraid of this and end up just pointing the guns and then having it be a standoff farscape also comes complete with a large amount of heartwarming characters they all grow on you till the point where it confuses you to hear them discuss taking some of the animatronic ones out of their boxs to make the miniseries from beginning to end farscape leaves you with a feeling of hope and dispair as new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die surprising you every time worth a watch even if you dont have the time
