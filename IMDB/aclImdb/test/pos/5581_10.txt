somehow i missed many of the early farscape episodes so im seeing them in all sorts of orders as they are repeated on various channels i first caught it  entirely by accident  whilst lounging in a hotel room the first 10 seconds had me completely hooked  this is what sf is all aboutbr br the characters are strong and moyapilot the living ship is what lexx should have been the plots vary in quality but none falls below excellent in my opinion and i have to mention rygel  what a gloriously irreverent character none of your smarmy sugarcoated star trek aliens here this is the real deal  cynical selfserving and replete with disgusting personal habits rygel is the creation of a geniusbr br last week the scifi channel showed out of their minds the bodyswapping episode a true classic i couldnt stop laughing from start to finishbr br long may farscape grace our screens
