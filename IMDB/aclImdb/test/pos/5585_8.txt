i saw this film as a kid about 30 years ago and i havent forgotten it to this day i couldnt say whether its a good picture but in those days i instantly fell in love with jean simmons the memories concentrate on the very erotic feel of the movie but i still remember the plot simmons was very young then and there is another film that gave me the same feeling david leans great expectations and again it was the young jean simmons its a pity that blue lagoon is not available on video id like to correct my memories
