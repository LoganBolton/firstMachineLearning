i really felt the movie was ahead of its time the one potential daughterinlaw was such a strong career oriented woman she knew what she wanted and was diplomatic but firm with the overbearing motherinlaw to be the mothers role was played extremely well you just loved to hate her her need to control her sons lives was neurotically evil if youve ever been in a relationship where youve been judged and found lacking and everybody involved knew it this may hit too close to home its been years since i saw this movie and i remember thinking that this plot and dialog would work in a 50s or 60s movie it is difficult to watch because of the mother and sons dynamic but i would love to watch it again i keep hoping to find it on one of the old movie channels but so far no luck attempts to buy it were also futile i dont believe its on tape or dvd
