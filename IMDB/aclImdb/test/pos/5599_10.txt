in the book of life martin donovan plays jesus who shows up at jfk airport on december 31 to usher in the new millennium by battling with thomas jay ryan satan and deciding the fate of the world there is also david simonds kurt the accountant from amateur as a compulsive homeless gamblerbr br as usual hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary made strange and otherworldly flows through artfullyframed scenes and urbanindustrial landscapes filled with dazzling light and shadow as usual he introduces seemingly incidental details early then brings them back later in hilarious and unexpected contextsthe humor is simple but giddy and irrepressible hartley has an amazing ability to build toward small and rapturous moments of the simultaneously mundane and outrageous as usual he creates a tone that is jaded and worldweary but at the same time vulnerable open and honest he moves within minutes from uproarious humor into language that is metaphysical and poeticthe kind of writing that is so deadon and perfect that its difficult to hold back tears despite the lack of obvious emotion another awesome and highly entertaining film the book of life is shot a digital camera with a blurry effect a sense of the celestial handinhand with impending doom and a hyperawareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in its last moments all of hartleys films have a way of prioritizing the present but this unique effect compounds it as the images wash across the screen in a way that is at first jarring but becomes increasingly beautiful as you settle into it the final shot is spectacular all this may sound precious but the film is a comedy and it makes fun of itself even as it makes fun of the concept of armageddon judgment day and urbanity although it is actually quite profound moving and lifeaffirming it is for the most part lighthearted and playful the acting is flawless in terms of the kind of the subdued tone that hartley has developed in his films a tone that some people dont get and that prompts them to judge such acting as hollowthe same people who have a negative response to peter greenaway as always there are bound to be people who respond to this film with cynicism and scornpeople put off by hartleys abrupt shifts and what they see to be pretentious or mannerist techniques but who has time to consider the opinions of such dull and callous fools anyone who is a hartley fan will love this filmif they can get a chance to see it that is its hard to say what it would be like on video
