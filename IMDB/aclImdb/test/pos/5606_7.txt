though not hal hartleys best work my personal favorite is surviving desire there is still much to like about this movie especially for fans of hartleys dialogues even to audiences new to hartley i would definitely recommend this movie over the sophomoric dogma this movie is more intelligent truer to its source material the bible and more fun than any of the other premillennium apocalypse moviesbr br  this movie is actually part of the french 2000 as seen by 2000 par vu series as such it is perhaps even a lowerbudget film than hartleys other works while the need for simple scenes shot with digital camera is understandable in this context the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate overuse of the blurryjittery effect id be happy to never see this effect used in a movie again especially at the beginning it almost makes the movie unwatchable but overlook this flaw and youll be treated to a fine film especially notable is magdalena played by pj harvey relating how jesus saved her from being stoned to death a short scene i found surprisingly moving despite the fact that it was not mary magdalene that this happened to the woman in the bible was unnamedbr br
