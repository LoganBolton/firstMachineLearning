this is an extraordinary film as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening for brenton butler the consequences of this system could be devastating this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court in truth the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty or a guilty man being free every citizen has a right to justice whether a perpetrator or a victim but do they get it the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen
