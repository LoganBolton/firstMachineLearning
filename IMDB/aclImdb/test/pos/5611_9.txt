one of the many speculations about y2k was that the world was going to end at the stroke of midnight on december 31 1999 in the book of life writerdirector hal hartley takes a look at the possible ramifications of a new millennium armageddon beginning with the return of jesus to earth on new years eve Â‘99 the story examines the task of the son of god who must open the remaining three of the seven seals contained in the book of life now contained in a mac laptop computer in which there is also the names of the onehundred and fortyfour thousand good souls who will be spared on the last day jesus martin donovan along with magdalena pj harvey arrives in new york city to make the preparations necessary for carrying out his fathers will but he begins to have second thoughts must he judge the living and the dead do they deserve what must befall them it is a cup he would prefer not to embrace at this particular moment which gives encouragement to satan thomas jay ryan who fears that the fruit of all his hard labor is about to be washed away at midnight for he can only continue his work so long as there are people around who cling to their pitiful hopes and dreams an artistically rendered high concept film hartley presents the story in an intelligent thought provoking manner taking great care in dealing with the sensitive subject matter so as to make it inoffensive even to the most ardent fundamentalist the dialogue between jesus and satan is intriguing and stimulating as is the effect of their presence upon those they encounter during their corporeal stay in the city its an engrossing meditation on the spiritual side of mans fragile existence and a contemplation of that which has been prophesied in the revelations of st john in the apocalypse the last book of the new testament and there is logic in hartleys approach to the second coming he maintains the aesthetic of the contemporary setting while employing altered film speeds which visually give the film an ethereal quality christ inconspicuously wears a suit and tie effectively blending in with the populace while satans attire is a bit more casual his appearance somewhat scruffy he sports a bruise above his left eye donovan is well cast as jesus lending a benevolent mien and a sense of restrained urgency to his character that is very effective it is of course a unique portrayal of the saviour and possibly the best since max von sydows in the greatest story ever told he successfully conveys a feeling of inner peace and tranquility of serenity that is the essence at the very core of the character and ryan is thoroughly engaging in his role of the prince of darkness he has a distinct manner of speech and a resonant quality to his voice that make him absolutely mesmerizing to watch his eyes are darkly penetrating a trait he uses effectively with furtive glances and captivating stares hes the guy who could sell you anything in exchange for your soul before you ever knew what hit you its a memorable performance that contrasts so well with donovans portrayal of jesus the supporting cast includes martin pfeffercorn martyr miho nikaido edie dave simonds dave dj mendel lawyer james urbaniak true believer katreen hardt lawyers assistant and anna kohler hotel clerk in his own inimitable style with the book of life hartley has crafted a perspective of the last days that is interesting entertaining and truly unique he has a way of capturing life as it is just off center a method which works especially well with a film like this comparatively short for a feature film running time of 63 minutes it nevertheless is one of hartleys best and more than worth the price of admission its a film that will stay with you and perhaps make you think about some things you may have tucked away in a corner of your mind for later and that is part of the attraction of this film it makes you realize that later most likely is now i rate this one 910
