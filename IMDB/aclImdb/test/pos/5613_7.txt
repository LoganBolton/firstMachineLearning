i thoroughly enjoyed this movieand i watch it from time to time still ive used it in my music classes at the school where i teach the kids seem to enjoy it although they wish it were in colorbr br the best thing about this movie is for me who grew up after heifetz had died is the chance to actually see the master violinist work his craft i was surprised at how up to date the story line is although references to reform school are outdated a boy whose father had died and is being raised by his mom and stepfathermost of our kids today are being raised by stepparents although the movie makes it seem like most stepparents are cruel i get very angry when his mother doesnt take his side and defend his actions against the stepfatherbr br also the musical selections are difficult to believe i find it unbelievable that a child who looks to be about 8 can play the minute waltz or that a 13 year old girl could sing an aria from rigolettobr br other than that its a really fun feel good movie and i do recommend it i wish it would come out on dvd
