chris smith is a superior filmmaker with the seldomseen talent for spotting a good story then getting the hell out of its way smiths american movie is the truetolife record of filmmaker wannabe mark borchardt a loser intent on milking his elderly uncle for cash to complete his horror short but never under any circumstances to pursue gainful employment or support the children hes conceivedbr br such is producer smiths skill that mark appears more sympathetic than otherwise even as he entices uncle bill with sugarspun dreams and executive producer credits it is his desperation to be somebody to have his name coupled with the likes of scorsese and spielberg that touches usbr br american movie also belongs in that rare often attempted but seldom achieved sub genre that successfully blends hilarity with horror the humor comes from borchardts ed woodstyle belief in his own genius from his appalling attempts at acting from his substituting his less than filmsavvy mother for a missing cameraman and from his employing sweet but braindamaged friend mike whenever hes short an actor or crew memberbr br the horror comes from seeing what borchardt cannot it is this very american attitudei want therefore i am entitledthat keeps him from seeing just how much he has to learn about his chosen craft he is so confident he cant fail that failure is guaranteed
