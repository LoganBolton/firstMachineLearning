the subject matter of this film is potentially depressing a man about thirty with no job little education three kids from a failed relationship living in his parents house but with a dream of directing feature films but about a halfhour into the movie you realize that mark borchardt has a bottomless supply of drive and ambitionits just that its all channeled into his need to direct movies and nothing else will make him happy the movie jumps all over the emotional spectrum but in the end you come away feeling happy because youve just gotten to know some wonderful people go to see thisyoull end up wishing it was longer
