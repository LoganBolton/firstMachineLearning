anyone that is looking for an episode of law and order or csi would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this casebr br a murder took place and all the police did was to grab a 15yearold boy off the street and take him to the only witness  a 65yearold man  and say is this the guy who did it sure the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently he must have shrunk reversed his age by 510 years and changed clothesbr br the police made absolutely no effort  and they admitted it the did no forensics on any of the evidence they questioned no other witnesses and they beat a confession out of a 15yearoldbr br the saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred right down the road in jacksonville florida let everyone now start talking about southern justice
