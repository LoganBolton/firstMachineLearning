i rented this movie for two reasons the first was all of the good things that i read about it i definately was impressed and couldnt agree more with all of the reviews i read the second reason is because i know these guys i dont know mark as well as i do mike he hasnt changed much from the years we knew each other i know him as the reaper from a local milwaukee radio station wmse the way he is in this film is genuinely mike 100 he once gave me a table that he made it was a little one about 15 high that said metallica on it the odd thing about it was it only had two legs sometimes its the thought that counts and mike always has thought about others first
