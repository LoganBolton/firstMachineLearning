what gives this movie its personality is the knowledge in the end that it is all true while it is a compelling and humorous documentary that does border on mockumentary in some parts are they staged or is it really happening humorously it does seem to get a bit long towards the endbr br this movie is funny in places it needs to be and flows relatively well reminiscent of christopher guests movies if you liked those or adaptation then i recommend you keep a look out for this onebr br b
