for me the best  most memorable movies are often those which on first viewing i know nothing about american movie is a perfect example of just such a gem watching tv late one evening i spotted the one  only good review among the dross  thankfully i settled in for a real treat american movie is a documentary following the unforgettable mark borchardt pronounced orchard i believe a highly articulate  charismatic wisconson lad as he struggles to write direct and produce midwestern a gritty lowbudget horror movie on which he has been working for years in mark we discover a young man filled with contrast his appearance is of the classic trailertrash stereotype  skinny bumfluff mustache 80s heavy metal styling mullet hairdo etc to camera however mark reveals startling wit  insight as he philosophizes upon life love movies  the american way as the movie unfolds it sadly becomes clear that marks lack of discipline  heavy drinking are relentlessly sabotaging his creative efforts american movie is a charming watch filled with hilarious moments  vivid characters chief among these is marks lovable buddy mike schank a softspoken reformed stoner who having conquered an addiction to scratch cards is now dependent on soda pop i absolutely loved american movie it generates real empathy between the viewer  principal characters and provides hilarity without feeling exploitative i would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone
