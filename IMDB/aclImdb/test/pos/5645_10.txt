this is probably the greatest war film and certainly one of the greatest films theres no sentimentality no patriotic agenda not even a hopeful message of universal brotherhood in this bleak glimpse of what we can only call hell its this quiet rigor and lack of manipulation that give the film its astounding power there arent any attempts to make a hero out of ichikawas protagonist tamura either hes just a poor doomed sap trying to stay alive in a world of horror who hopes but isnt sure he can hang on to his humanity in the process ichikawas fierce lack of cant and illusion make fires on the plain stand alone ichikawa died february 2008
