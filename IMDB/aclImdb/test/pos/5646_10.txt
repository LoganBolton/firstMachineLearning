my first ichikawa in many years and the first of his war films that ive seen this was gripping and brutal from the very getgo in the very first scene nominal hero tamura is told that he cant continue on with his unit to which he has returned from the hospital he apparently has tb  but he is not sick enough for the hospital to take him given the quantity of warwounded they have but his old unit wont take him back either his co gives him a grenade and tells him that if he feels truly hopeless to blow himself upits the honorable thing to dobr br the phillipines 1945 and the situation really does seem hopeless for pfc tamura and everyone else nobi is an odyssey through hell or rather hells  denuded forests dead rocky plains and the dead and dying japanese soldiers hoping just for an end through peace or death ichikawas film is photographed in stunning bw scope which serves to highlight both the desolation felt by tamura and those he meets on his journey towards his doom and to show how truly small and naked they all are amidst the immensity of the mountains and the foreststhis small affair of humans will end soon the earth seems to be saying but i will survive and barely notice itbr br tamura travels back towards the hospital but is not surprisingly rejected there and spends the rest of the film trying to stay alive stay human and get out of danger he doesnt manage to do very well on any account slowly starving and eventually committing some fairly repellent acts eventually he hooks up with two other desperate men who have lost or survived their units and have resorted to cannibalismand in his weakened state facing other armed men finds that the only way to live is to break with everything that he believes inbr br ichikawas film is as brutal uncompromising and intense as any war film ive seen there are moments of humor and tenderness but they are fleeting and dont stick in the memory such as the scene with the man on the mountaintop who practically begs tamura to eat his fleshthe recurring blackcomic bit with tamura exchanging his ragged shoes for the better leathers of a fallen comradethe degradations that humans will endure to survivethe truth that this is any war all wars all mankind as long as we continue thus a masterpiece that i probably wont watch again for a long long time watched via the beautiful criterion collection dvd
