this film is a knockout fires on the plain referred to is the burning off at the end of harvest time a happy memory for tamura he relives this in his mind many timesand at the end of this bleak film like a man dying of thirst he believes he is home and this last illusion is all he has left billy wilders the big carnival ace in the hole is the only film that comes to mindthat is as bleak as this little masterpiece by kon ichikawa while i think the whole film is brilliant two scenes that come to mind are when a platoon of japanese soldiers trying to escape crawling on there bellysare ambushed by americans and massacredtrue horror and as an american soldier and a pretty philippine girl soldier are having a cigarette on the side on the road she smiles as she flits with the yankthen her face changes to rage as she sees two japanese soldiers trying to surrrender she grabs a gun and kills them with joy the american soldier attempts to stop her but has no chance  to me this speaks volumes at the atrocitys committed by the japanese in the philippines all in all a great film if you have the stomach for it
