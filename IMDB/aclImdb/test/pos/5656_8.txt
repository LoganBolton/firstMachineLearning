this is undoubtedly the most harrowing blackandwhite war film that ive watched as a matter of fact the only western director during this time to remotely approach its level of intensity and sheer visceral power in his work was samuel fuller by the way i had attended a kon ichikawa retrospective at londons national film theatre in september 2002 but only managed to catch some of his work made between 1960 and 1973br br the film is certainly as depressing as its reputed to be however it also displays welcome touches of black humor throughout  the dead man who wakes up to answer a querying soldier and promptly dies again the deliciously ironic shoe exchange sequence a moribund eccentric telling the famished hero which part of the body he should eat etc incidentally the script was written by a woman  natto wada the directors own wifebr br ichikawa is a versatile and prolific filmmaker whose reputation may not be as high as it was during his peak years 195665 but his direction here is often striking  the startling precredits sequence the hero is violently rebuked by his superior officer for being discharged from hospital earlier than expected the death of a surrendering japanese at the hands of a guntoting philippine woman the bombing of a hospital with the medical staff running away to save themselves leaving the wounded soldiers behind to crawl out of the shack at their own limited pace the automated march in the rain of the disillusioned soldiers which also involves the aforementioned business with the shoes that actually recalls a similar scene in all quiet on the western front 1930 a hill littered with the bodies of soldiers attempting to climb it the finale etc surely one of the films major assets is the stunning cinematography of the unforgiving and desolate muddy landscapebr br the film is notorious for treating the taboo subject of cannibalism almost 10 years before it became a staple of horror movies but ichikawas approach is not only subtle but highly effective the flesh is actually referred to as monkey meat while the hero is seen partaking only once and promptly spits out the piece along with most of his decaying teeth conversely when the weak underling soldier played by mickey curtis who despite his name was a japanese pop idol of the time rabidly indulges the ground nearby is splashed with bloodbr br in the supplements ichikawa remembers that methodpracticing lead actor eiji funakoshi whose portrayal is unforgettable by the way arrived on the set at starvation point  with the result that production was forced to shut down for two weeks until he recuperated donald richies perceptive interview favors the nihilism of the film over the underlying patriotism behind such gutwrenching recent hollywood fare as saving private ryan 1998br br fires on the plain is universally considered to be one of its directors top efforts and out of the several films of ichikawa ive watched the closest to it in spirit are the burmese harp 1956 another characterdriven war film but with a spiritual tone and which is also available on dvd from criterion and enjo aka conflagration 1958 which was actually given a limited theatrical showing locally as part of a foreignfilm week a couple of years ago personally i also have a particular soft spot for the directors stunningly stylized color extravaganza an actors revenge 1963 which ive actually caught twice at the nft in 1999 and the aforementioned 2002 retrospective
