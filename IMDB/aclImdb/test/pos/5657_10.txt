this is one of the most antitraditional war movies about was i have seen instead of the typical films that stress glory and perhaps superhuman characters like john wayne this film is the exact oppositestressing the dehumanization that also happens in war the story concerns the japanese who are stranded in the phillipines after the us returned in late 1944early 1945 by the time the movie begins the japanese have clearly been beaten but because of the insane logic of bushido they cannot allow themselves to consider surrender at one of many poignant moments the lead character is told at the beginning of the film to report to the hospital since he isnt capable of fighting due to his tb the problem is that the hospital wont accept him so his commander tells him to once again go to the hospitaland if they wont accept him he should blow himself up with a grenade well this happens just in the first five minutes of the moviea lot worse things befall this soldier and the few stragglers because they wont surrender plus there is a case in the movie where a soldier does try to surrender but is gunned down this happened a lot later in the war because so often the surrendering japanese soldiers boobytrapped themselves to blow up when they came near in addition the film shows the most vivid depiction of starvation and the accompanying madness of any film i have seen in addition cannibalism cowardice and betrayal all accompany this very gritty realistic and depressingly realistic film you simply couldnt have made a better film of this type horrible but great
