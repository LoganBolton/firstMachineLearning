i watched this on hbo because it won the oscar a week earlier it compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramasbr br the story is of a 15yearold black kid placed on trial for the jacksonville fl murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victims husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coercedbr br about half the footage is of the trial its supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers two public defenders explaining their case interviewing witnesses and visiting key locations this is edited with a minimum of needless repetition and placed in logical order the camera work is pretty solid and theres a mildly surprising epilogue
