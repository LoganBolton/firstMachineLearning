i finally managed to see this movieafter so many years of expectancybr br i was so curious to see if this movie it is as bad as some people saybr br and my opinion is that this movie it wasnt bad at allon the contrary it was amazingbr br i enjoyed every second from itfrom the beginning until the endbr br the actors were great they sent me the feeling that i was living the story at the same time as the movie was playingbr br the landscapes were so beautiful were the film was shotand it did charmed me also the music was extraordinary and i have nothingbr br to reproachbr br i think that the plot was very original i dont think that i saw a movie like thisbr br it is a shame that it isnt recognized all over the worldto bad for those who didnt get the chance to see it i give this movie 1010
