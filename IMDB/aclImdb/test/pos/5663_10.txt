i think its incredibly hard to write any kind of fullscale review to giorgino merely because its one of those viewerdependent complex poetical and philosophical movies that are brainwearing if while watching them youre trying to enjoy their shell and get to their core simultaneously yet there are several things which are certain and beyond any doubt for any man of art which i hope i am the first thing its a certain masterpiece even of that kind of art which remains through a long long time the second its one of those rare dark movies in which darkness is poetic even romantic attractive and much more sad than depressing like the art of pieter brueghel or caspar david friedrich as to the core of the movie someone called it kafkian though i dont agree with that because actually its far beyond kafkas misanthropic logic and much more like edgar poes parables dark and scary but through that touching the most gentle strings of our souls actually on the poetic side which is much more important than the narrative giorgino is a tale about eternal peace and love which can be achieved only through eternal childhood of soul those who have such souls are usually branded as crazy by our society but from another point of view they all have the virtue all the others lost when become grown the virtue of gods love indeed giorgino is a very christian movie be like children mt 183 is its real hidden tagline though the movie never deals with any kind of moral and concentrates only on the christian philosophy for dare to suppose true god is beyond any human moral yet i think that boutonnat is too harsh portraying grown people as a sort of demons trying to steal childhood from rare survived souls but its his point of view and he has a right to think so while watching giorgino dont try to look for some hidden symbols though there are some better look for thoughts expressed through characters and their behavior and do learn from them also i cannot mention that the movie looks astonishingly through excellent photography especially through rational use of color filters incredibly apposite editing wonderful acting of all the cast and of course due to the atmospheric beauty of winter mountains that reminded me of the brueghels hunters in the snow also interestingly enough the scene with death in the form of an old woman with sunken blackringed eyes riding a cart instantly reminded me of pesta plague from the series of drawings by the norwegian painter theodor kittelsen depicting how a black plague is sweeping out the population of a small town in the mountain valley is it a coincidence
