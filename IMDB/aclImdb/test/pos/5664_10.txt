thats certainly not the best film ever but thats certainly worth seeing for people with a special kind of mind so the one who loves sadness and depression and scary fairytales at night and wolves and real madness  welcome if you find a copy of course as for me i could stand it only once but since that the wolves and saintlucy and childrens drawings and a headless christ live in my nightmares
