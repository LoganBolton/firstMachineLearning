br br giorgino is a strange dark obsessive object the casting is impressive the plot is powerful reminded me of edgar poes tales probably not a masterpiece but it does leave us with the remembrance of strong images fine music fear sadness confusion and a sentence that says it all  the wolves are coming giorgino is quite forgotten now and when it was released nobody seemed to appreciate it thats a shame if you ever have a chance to see this well give it a try
