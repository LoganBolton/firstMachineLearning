black water is a movie that in a way surprised me and definitely exceeded my original expectations black water is truly a very well structured unpredictable thrilling well directed and well creepy movie the plot is actually somewhat original and will definitely keep you intrigued with it one thing i love about this movie is the direction because mainly on how it surpassed my original expectations my original expectations of black water was that it was a crappily made acted directed paced and boring movie it really wasnt well the acting is nothing to praise because there were times were i feel they didnt show enough emotions and there are some lines that feel just so scripted however i love the direction because all of its shots seem predictable but arnt like when watching it say the camera gets a slow shot of the water and it goes quite youre like the crocs about to attack however the crocs attacks are very unpredictablewhich was bad for me who doesnt handle films like this all to greatly and this does make you jump plus i just love that its one of those horror movies that dont rely on the sudden big sound blast to make you jump but instead the actual movie i also like how the story is about people who are trapped in these trees it made it seem very real and definitely kept your eyes on the screen i must say i didnt think the opening 20 so minutes were done well and i think they made the boat a little heavier than it would have been in real life plus i didnt like how they tried their absolute best to make the characters situation seem entirely hopeless when it really wasnt also again i just dont think some of the characters actions were realistic for example i wouldnt have gone anywhere near the water knowing their was a crocodile in it let alone a killer one however these problems really arnt that major and i was still able to enjoy the film overall as far as movies go ive seen better but as far as animal attack horror filmsa genre i get easily scarred at its one of the better ones youll see and sure its not perfect but that doesnt mean its not worth a shot
