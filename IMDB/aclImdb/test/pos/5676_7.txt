when i read the synopsis  3 people lost in the wild battling against a huge crocodile  i wasnt exactly drawn in it sounded like the typical yawnmovie horror formula of a bunch of people stalked by a monster  except in this case there are only three of them so we wouldnt even get the macabre joy of watching them get picked off one by onebr br however i watched it couldnt sleep nothing else to do and it turned out to be much better than expected the acting is great the atmosphere tense and you really get that rare sense of a low budget winnerbr br horror as it should be done firstrate filmmaking its not perfect but its well worth seeing i give it a 7
