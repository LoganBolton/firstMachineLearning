like most i thought another crocodile movie so far weve had primeval and rogue in the last 12 months what can they do thats new where both those films were about action and violence this ones about fear and tensionbr br the performances arent oscarworthy when theres nothing going on but in times of distress or terror these people suffer so much its like torture there are holes in the plot and maybe crocs dont really behave like this as others have pointed out but the fear is so effective its a stretch to say youll enjoy this movie itll leave you feeling as uncomfortable as the passion of the christ
