ive read many unflattering comments regarding this film and the only things i have seen that they all have in common are boring and unrealisticbr br first of all they used real frickin crocs how much more realistic can you get no cgi no animatronics no miniatures just a croc and a piece of meat have fun fellasbr br there is no question that this film gets off to a slow start character development what little they had anyway does take a bit of time and i think this is primarily where this film lacksbr br however when the film gets going i found the action picked up dramatically i dont mean to say that there is a lot of action if anything there are more moments where the croc cant be seen at all and the people are just waiting however we know that there isnt going to be any relief and that the croc is just biding its time this had a similar eerie feel to other films that achieve their horror through nonaction such as open water another film that has been criticized by some viewers as being boring personally i think that viewers who find themselves incapable of feeling the suspense have had their attention spans surgically removed at birth but thats just mebr br finally the characters feel real and the situation is such that it really could happen to anyone in the right circumstances furthermore the deaths are completely real and at times its a little tough to watchbr br all in all this ones a winner
