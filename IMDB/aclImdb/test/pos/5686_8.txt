black water codirected and written by david nerlich and andrew traucki is very simple in its execution yet effective the film is a lowbudget australian movie that will unfortunately not get the recognition it deserves because as far as creature features go this is one of the best out there the setup is rather basic grace her husband adam and her younger sister lee are touring some mangroves in the northern territory when a saltwater crocodile flips their boat and leaves them stranded in the trees the whole movie is about their survival while the crocodile is lurking below waiting to strikeunlike greg mcleans rogue another killer croc movie released earlier in 2007 black water is not about the audience having fun guessing whos gonna be eaten next it is about hoping and praying that the three people will get out safely br br the three unknown actors do a great job with pretty demanding roles considering it was filmed on location with a real crocodile instead of cgi the characters act realistically in the situation and the dialogue seems natural and not forced suspense is built up throughout the entire film we do not see a lot of the creature but just knowing it is near is terrifying enough this is edgeofyour seat stuff and highly recommended if you enjoy original and most importantly scary horror filmsbr br 45
