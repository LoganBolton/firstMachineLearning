id never heard of this aussie horror prior to michael elliotts enthusiastic review in fact after having read it i decided to check if the dvd was available at my local rental outlet and it was albeit a german edition ie sans the r1 extras so i opted to check the film out immediatelybr br while i wouldnt go so far as to give it full marks  only a select few titles get them from me let alone an obscure modern flick  i have to say that i was quite impressed with black water rather than looking back to previous crocodile movies such as alligator 1980 and lake placid 1999 it evokes the memory of two which saw a small group of people who go on a trip get lost and find themselves at the mercy of the elements and the creatures inhabiting the place  namely long weekend 1978 itself a littleseen but impressive australian production and open water 2005br br the compact simplyplotted film involves a couple and the womans younger sister who decide to go fishing in a remote and forbidding part of the australian wilderness known as crocodile territory very soon in fact before even 15 minutes have elapsed their boat is capsized and the guide killed by an alligator  so our luckless adventurers take refuge up a tree the dvd talk reviewer believes the film suffers from spending too much time in this one location  with the three arguing about what they should do attempts to retrieve the boat seeking a way out of the jungle through the trees only to be met with nothing but water and the occasional attack by the monster however i think the makers take the situation as far as it will go without slipping into tedium this is due to the palpable suspense and as michael said the believability of the characters particularly the two womenbut also the fact that the crocodile here makes for one of the scariest and most memorable in recent memory i wonder how they got it to perform br br i also agree with mike that the film contains some really effective shock moments  the alligator leaping out of the water to take a bite at the petrified heroes its head suddenly emerging in front of the women as theyre making for the boat even though one of them does reach the vehicle the monster manages to lift its massive weight and get in the boat with her towards the end as the same girl manages to find a gun on the mangled body of their guide loads it and lies in wait for the alligator to appear the latter sneaks up from behind her incidentally the creature is bestowed with the craftiness of the shark in jaws 1975 with this in mind the finale is just as crowdpleasing though on an obviously smaller scale as that of the classic spielberg blockbuster  even if it has a downbeat followup another definite asset is the films sparse score  which is generally rather lovely but becoming unnerving at just the right momentsbr br at the end of the day black water emerges as a breath of fresh air in the face of the demoralizing slump into which horror cinema has fallen of late for this reason alone it deserves greater exposure so as to remind us that theres hope yet for our beloved genre without the real necessity of resorting to the gimmickry of a cloverfield 2008 to command attention
