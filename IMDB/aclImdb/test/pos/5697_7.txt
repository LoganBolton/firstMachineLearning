br br as i am a teenager i have about one hundred years of movies to catch up on i try to see a mixture of classics mainstream arthouse and other movies the 70s is one of the most important decades for films its when the average common classical films changed into full of messages and antisocial behavior it became like nothing anyone had ever seen before what a decade under the influence basically shows is how important all of the movies from around the graduate to about star warsbr br richard lagravenese and the late ted demme are the primary interviewers in this documentary which interviews such people as dennis hopper francis ford coppola martin scorsese robert altman and jon voight among others about how those few years changed cinema forever its a very professional polished documentary and its even financed by ifc films however as this is a very professional one i would think that they would at least edit out the noise of someone behind the camera laughing to me that took out a lot of how neat and clean the whole thing wasbr br on the other hand its a very interesting documentary about film by the people who make it of course they arent bashing their own films or anything of the like but theyre portraying honesty on what they thought of the films and what they meant i dont know much about film but i want to be involved around it when i become an adult so i feel like to someone like me this movie is a huge asset i have seen a good number of movies that they mentioned like chinatown and one flew over the cuckoos nest but a little more insight into those movies were very informativebr br the main reason however i didnt love influence is as slickly as it was edited it seemed to take its time in the beginning and be quite relaxed therefore not having enough time to get to everything that they wanted to show they crammed in star wars and jaws in the last few minutes when they were two of the most important it seemed like they tried too hard to show lots of clips and thats fine but some of them were unimportant such as an extended one from networkbr br overall though influence is a very enthralling informative documentary that helped me at least learn more about a second golden age in american cinemabr br my rating 710br br rated r for language and images of sexuality violence and drug use
