when i tuned in to my local pbs station last night to watch the war that made america i was expecting a dull documentary instead i got a very good and believable reenactment of the major events of the time now i see the reasons for the american revolution and the part the indian wars played larry nehring is george washington and he is perfect for that part the narrative to the camera also work fantastic im looking forward to next week to see the rest its good to see pbs really using the hd format to bring the 1700 right in to our living roombr br i hope larry nehring is seen more in the future since he is such a talented actor
