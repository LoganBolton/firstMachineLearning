i never saw any of john leguizamos standup before i watched freak and after seeing it again on hbo comedy recently it was better more enlivening and with things that at the age of 14 i couldnt understand quite before spike lee did a wonderful job directing keeping the visual angle up to par with leguizamos theatrics and the style of personal storytelling its substance and style merging together but unobtrusively we get leguizamos rants about race and sex the bits about sex are classic but a lot of it is about family and what sticks still fresh in my mind is about his father even when things get dark in some of the stories theres something fresh or crazy or random that leguizamo pulls out to get a laugh and it works more often than not if something does fall flat for me at any rate it might be his personality tics here and there but overall its the kind of fun material that isnt heady but is so true to itself that it stings find it if you can
