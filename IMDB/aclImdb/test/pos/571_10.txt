i dont need to say much about how good this documentary isits truly an amazing piece of true narrative the story is simple enough a white senior citizen tourist is murdered by a young black man in florida and the boy who is arrested is mistreated and put on trial with only the public defender and his family on his side its very enthralling and the public defender is a joy to watch in all his human waysyou cant help but pull for the triumph of justice and the ending fulfills more than could be expected of a true storybr br its a shame more people havent seen this documentary but hopefully you will find a way to watch it for those interested in race relations in the united states and the actual workings of law enforcement and the legal process its well worth your time and effort to find this documentary i give it a 10
