i have always been fascinated by silent films there is something about seeing actors and actresses from 100 years ago performing jaded by todays hightech special effects i always try and imagine what it was like to watch a particular film at the time of its original release it helps to appreciate the crudeness of early cinemabr br the life and passion of jesus christ is a very charming production from pathe originally filmed in 1902 but expanded and finally released in 1905 imagine a series of famous religious paintings coming to life separated by title cards and you will have a pretty good idea of what this film is like for example the scene in which mary and joseph rest as they are escaping to egypt is almost identical to luc olivier mersons 1879 painting rest on the flight to egypt right down to mary sitting on the famous sphinx while some might find these living paintings an unimaginative copout i found them to be very charming and very nostalgicbr br the sets and costumes appear to be right out of a stage production of the life of christ possibly from and elaborate passion play of the day the makeup on the cast is very theatrical so much so that a closeup of jesus is almost comical again where others might be bothered by the cudeness of them i was quite charmedbr br having been filmed over a period of 3 years the continuity isnt too bad the biggest flaws are in the casting changes made over that time the characters of john the apostle and the 12 year old jesus change in mid scene much to the audiences surprisebr br the best unintentional humor of the film is in the birth of jesus scene the baby literally appears as if by magic in the manger between mary and joseph maybe it was simply my frame of mind at the time i viewed it but i laughed out loud if only child birth were that easy to top it off the actress who plays mary looks bored through the whole scene actually through the whole movie as if this sort of thing happens every day my how times have changedbr br as simplistic as this film is compared to today its really a wonderful window into the past i recommend itbr br
