tempo di uccidere time to kill by guiliano montaldo is a bit of a strange film but its good in its own waybr br i wont bother with a summary of the plot most that ive read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who wrote those didnt really understand the film and you need to understand it to some level even if you cannot describe for yourself what its actually about this film is strange in a once upon a time in america way only shorterbr br many hollywood stars whatever that may mean have played in lesser known italian productions its known that many actors who are past their prime or slowly rising to it do this cage was not yet a real star when this was made im not a fan of him hes very good in some roles raising arizona bringing out the dead and weak when he plays the hero i dont really know what to think of him in this one but he sure doesnt portray the typical hero main character this film could have done without him but the fact that he starred may be the only reason this one ever made it to dvdbr br the supporting cast is good not one of them looks fake and they act as if they are really there solid supportbr br i have seen 3 films by montaldo marco polo saccovanzetti and this one and i think he is one of the greater directors of this time unfortunately nobody knows him this movie was his last in a long time a break of 19 years i think that this movie might have failed at the office but from the way it is done i think that for montaldo it was a personal project that he really likedbr br the production is great its always enough the dusty army camps the claustophobic cities and the magnificent landscape all play a great part it all feels very real in some scenes you can almost feel the heat the sound itself is nothing special but the music by ennio morricone is very good its not a piece that you will whistle when in the shower but it sure works greatbr br so this movie looks feels and sounds just right it doesnt serve the lessons learned from it on a golden platter but that may be the biggest difference between hollywood and eurocinema all around it might sound strange to give it an 8 and not recommend it to people but that is what i do if you are looking for action avoid this one if you are looking for a well made apocalypse now in a different time and setting but with a bit of similar journey into a state of mindsorry if this sound corny but i dont know what else to call it you just might enjoy this one a lot
