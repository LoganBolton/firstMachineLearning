ok on the whole this three part documentary will bring most interested people up to date with goings on in the world of physics and the last 300 years of discovery of our universe if you have read stephen hawkings brilliant book a brief history of time and understood it then you might benefit from the visual description of certain conceptswhich i did to a certain extent greene is bearable but obviously for the sake of the masses tends to explain things in a slighty patronising way this is of course deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who watches this seriesbr br the guest scientists were good no hawking but i suppose he has his own dvds  i kept waiting for him to appear but they rotate through the same ones for almost 3 parts very american weighted here with a few brits and one antipodean i bought the nova 2 disc edition ntsc and there were a few inclusions that really detracted from the overall experiencebr br 1 the this is brought to you by at the start of each part was a necessary evil for the first part but seeing it 2 more times before it was over was very ordinarybr br 2 cant be helped i suppose but there is quite a bit of overlap at the start of 2 and 3 which had me reaching for the ffw button a few timesbr br 3 this disc set was straight from tvie ads what happen last show for those that missed it and frequent goto pbsorg for more  appearing throughout the presentation quite unlike bbc material which is unmatched for presentationplanets the blue planet etc my 710 is based on content alone the niggles were there but i got over them if this had have been done with that classic british accented presenter you know the one it would be a perfect disc set in my opinionbr br if you have seen this and want morethen i highly recommend hawkings book  a brief history of time i wish it was a movie toobr br happy viewing
