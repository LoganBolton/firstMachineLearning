bit of a curates egg this one i started off hating it with its predictable old dark house setup its constant references to recent us horrors and regular trips up and down dimly lit corridorsbr br but it does get going and has its moments of originalitybr br i began to wonder  once the killing started how they were going to last out with only a cast of six but then we get flashbacks to a previous visit to the building and see a whole slew of gory killings which is pretty effectivebr br naschy is fine and by the end its been an enjoyable enough movie it just does not jump up and grab one hard enough
