a group of teens decide to take their slumber party to an abandoned school where 27 years prior a horrible massacre took place unfortunately for them the person responsible for the slaughter still lurks the halls of the derelict school and he is not happy with their presencebr br this film is not like most modern teen slashers weve seen its much darker much more suspenseful no wisecracking murderer etc and i liked it for those reasons from a filmmaking pointofview its not great the acting is below average the writing was pretty bad and quite full of clich√©s containing randomly tossedin references to american horror films some that didnt even make sense like   have you seen scream 3 a girl asks yes i have and it had nothing to do with walking through the doors of an old school so it in no way relates to this film but hey its a slasher flick those are part of the fun also the underutilization of characters was heavily exhibited in this film there were six main characters not including the security guard and to be honest only three or four were really used two characters the token black guy and some other girl that wasnt important enough to get a label barely spoke between them id estimate about five or six lines total also the girls other than one werent formed well enough to differentiate them from one another they couldve replaced each of the girls with one another repeatedly throughout the film and i wouldnt have noticed the difference the pacing however works well as the horror begins right from the start and rarely ceases the atmosphere is utilized well and the direction reveals some truly chilling moments   although the overall appearance is a bit cheaplooking due to what i assume is lowgrade camera equipment and operation the ending though i liked the idea they were going for was fairly poorly done it felt rushed and without explanation enough to make it effective with the amount of time they spent running around looking for nothing they couldve spent a little bit more time on the conclusion to make sure it didnt feel like some random event thrown in for no good reason which is a flaw many modern horror films are afflicted with however ignoring a few irksome issues and trying to focus on the first 98 of the film rather than the ending this is actually a rather good modern slasher that should be checked out especially if youre a fan of spanish andor atmospheric horrorbr br obligatory slasher elementsbr br  violencegore theres a good bit of blood and gore realistically done but not buckets the violence is extremely well done not to excess but pretty brutal at pointsbr br  sexnudity little bit and with the hottest girl in the filmbr br  cool killer well security guards are hardly considered cool but this guy is pretty wicked his creepy smile was chillingbr br  scaressuspense the suspense is topnotch   very tense very well done there are also some extremely creepy moments that fused jump scares and the spooky atmospherebr br  mystery none at all reallybr br  awkward dance scene of course between a couple of guys and a halfunwilling female in the flashbackbr br  classic quote of the film one more trophy br br final verdict 710 this may be stretching it but fans of session 9 might want to check it out simply for the similar tone and atmospherebr br ap3
