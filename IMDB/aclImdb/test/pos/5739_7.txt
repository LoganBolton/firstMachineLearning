paul naschy as a ghostly security guard in this is scarier than most of his furandshoepolish werewolf guises the story is not unfamiliar a bunch of kids going to party at an abandoned school the thing is that one of these kids fathers did the same thing years ago but hes now deceased and the latest group of kids seem to be reliving an event from 23 years ago this is fairly well done for films of this type and theres an air of mystery to whats going on because apparently what happened to the kids before is somewhat of a mystery and perhaps the truth wasnt revealed so no not just your standard slice and dice this moves along at a fairly good clip and doesnt let you lose interest like a lot of films do and the oddball story is compelling enough to keep you interested too and theres some suspense which is lacking in a lot of films these days the ending is rather abrupt and i suppose is left mostly to your imagination but then again it doesnt outstay its welcome either 7 out of 10 check it out
