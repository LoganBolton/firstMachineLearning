forget samarasadako and jasonbr br horror has a new name  granny the plot is simple but efficient the actors are good two thumbs up for michelle and the killer and the dialogs are even quite clever from the beginning to the end the action will leave you breathless you just cant escape it there is blood awful murders funny moments and a sense of perversity that goes far beyond any rule deja vu  surely not  granny is not another slash movie its truly a classic of its own it deserves the success it had and theres even more success to come with its rerelease congrats
