this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face im a christian and liked the film in one way it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see it can be a bit longwinded but the film has some quite nice cars that rescues it from a lower rating from me as a christian film it was quite good but maybe a bit righton in the message the film works best on a big screen spoilers the fighting scene with the two brothers can remind you of the fighting scene between the two brothers in the christian thriller mercy streets starring eric robertsend of spoiler i give it a 710
