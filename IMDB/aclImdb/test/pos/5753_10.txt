my god this is funny stuff yes its puerile in the extreme but also rather witty heres the page with all the wines on it its a little early for us im afraid well what are you doing up then and the fight sequences are second to none despite what you may have heard the laughs do keep coming and at a surprisingly generous rate the sheer comic abilities of rik mayall and adrian edmondson help keep it riotously funny wringing every drop of comedy from the script i can only compare it to fear and loathing in las vegas  you either find that film hysterical throughout or not at all the same applies here its probably the funniest british film since withnail and i but to say its an acquired taste is something of a gross sic understatement
