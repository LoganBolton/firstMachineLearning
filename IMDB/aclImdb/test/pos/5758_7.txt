i had been looking for this film for so long before i found it i had seen it when i was younger and loved it after my second viewing i still loved it and i still dobr br this is a lovehate film if you like bottom young ones the comic strip then you will find this funny if you dont like that kind of humour then dont bother i love this film and have grown up with these comedy programmes for me this film is simply placing their comic genius on the big screen it is not an award winner by any means but if you just want good wholesome slapstick then this is itbr br the film lacks the quality of the tv series and this is usually the case with films but it still has enough material to keep you laughing even if a lot of the jokes are pretty similar to their previous workbr br yes the humour is a little childish and not to everyones taste but sometimes you just need that in a film
