i saw this when it first came out and found it to be a work of some genius but i must confess i was clearly in the minority at the timebr br for me the progressive lunacy of the proprietors of guest house paradiso just gets better and better throughout the film with one of the most hilarious climaxes to a film everbr br but i wouldnt recommend it to motherbr br lovers of grossout comic book style humour will appreciate this movie there are subtle jokes hidden away but they are usually quickly flattened by a comedy frying pan rik mayall and ade edmondson are superb and the deadpan unsuspecting guests are also excellent
