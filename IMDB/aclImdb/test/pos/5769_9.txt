a sign of what to expect in this film came when i spotted that this was the first and probably the last film to have in its credits a vomit technicianbr br in what is a couple of hours of silly gags hilarious violence and excellent slapstick humourbr br this film was just what youd expect from the bottom boys and it is great to see them back in their best form after rik mayalls life threatening accidentbr br richie mayall and eddie edmondson are too similar to their bottom characters if we can have any criticism at all and edmondson does a surprisingly good job in directing the film alsobr br this film has already spawned the predictable comparisons to fawlty towers that just arent there and the guest house paradiso itself is hardly torquaybr br watch out for some excellently crafted dialogue amongst all the violence and mayhembr br if you dont like bottom youll probably hate this  but i loved it
