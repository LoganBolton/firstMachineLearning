a truly scary film happening across curmudgeon james kunstlers rants led me to recentlyformed web logs like life after the oil crash latoc energy bulletin and the oil drum and the data behind the theory of hubberts peak like this film latoc and kunstler paint a grim picture of dieoff or dieback i hope theyre premature but in mid2005 rising gasoline prices rising oil prices chevrons will you join us campaign bp becoming beyond petroleum and even t boone pickens lend credence to the idea that we are at or near a peak of oil productionbr br after copious research of limited data oil investment banker matt simmons has suggested that the saudis may no longer be able to increase production in their immense but aging fields in the face of increased demand primarily from the us and china the saudis have not responded with higher production despite previous assurances stated world production from 2000 and 2004 indicates that light sweet crude has indeed peaked which means that refining will become more costlybr br the film seems aimed at baby boomers but younger people our children also need to understand the implications of an energydepleted future
