i have the good common logical sense to know that oil cannot last forever and i am acutely aware of how much of my life in the suburbs revolves around petrochemical products ive been an avid consumer of new technology and i keep running out of space on powerboards  so i know that even the energy crunch associated with peak oil will change my life appreciablybr br the end of suburbia shows in a rational and entertaining manner just how much my whole familys lifestyle will have to change in my lifetime i am particularly concerned for the future generations who will have to pick up the tab for our excesses however the filmmakers do offer a glimmer of hope in that they acknowledge human resourcefulness and determination  and the sense of community that tends to be engendered by shared hardshipbr br there is no point in trying to pretend that peak oil is baseless propaganda  or in treating it like the approaching radioactive cloud in on the beach ie with suicide pills at the ready even with our best efforts times will get harder all over and im hoping theres enough compassion and humanity to go around
