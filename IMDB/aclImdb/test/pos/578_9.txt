first of all before i start my review i just read every review for the muppet movie here and i cant believe that someone could give a negative review to a movie like this fortunately there was only one i mean i can understand how someone may not like star wars due to the whole scifi genre but to not like a movie starring some of the most lovable puppets in the history of mankind is almost sad br br okay i will step off my soapbox now and review this moviebr br the muppet movie came out when i was seven all of my friends wanted to see this as their birthday movie so i think i saw it about four times in the first month in theatersbr br as a child many things attracted me to this and all the other muppet movies  tv shows the singing was probably the main one most of the songs in the muppet movie are classics from rainbow connection to im going to go back there someday theyre entertaining and thoughtprovokingbr br as an adult i see the muppet movie in almost a whole different light yes the things that thrilled me about it as a kid are still there but its the little jokes and such that are just plain hilariousbr br i mean when you think about it jim henson is a sick man br br kermit is a frog and that is in love with a sweet pig that wears purple gloves and could karate chop you into two pieces fozzie is a standup comedian bear gonzo is a whatever that is infatuated with chickens then you have two old guys that heckle a pianoplaying dog a rock band with a maniac drummer a swedish chef that you cant understand and a number of other characters that are just plain eccentricbr br yet for these reasons and more henson has entertained millions of children and adults giving us all something special to watch and remember him by br br the muppet movie will always remain in my heart for many reasons but i think the biggest one is because its a movie unlike a lot of recent childrens movies that i feel comfortable to have my kids watch plus i dont get bored out of my mind with jokes that are dumbed down to my kids levelbr br its a great movie that is sure to be remembered forever
