the show was amazing and very professional madonna is a nonstop dancing and singing for 2 hours the opening was pretty good when she came out of the disco ball and also jump was a really good performance the entire show was full of energy so its kind of hard to say which were the highlights because every song had something special and unique i saw live couple of her previous tours drowned world and reinvention tourthey were good but you cant compare with this one the dancers were fantastic the lights and the whole show were just perfect madonna still looks very good if you havent seen it yet i highly recommend you to see it youll enjoy the show from the beginning to the end madonna is still the dancing queen
