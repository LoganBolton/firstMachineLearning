hammer house of horror witching time is set in rural england on woodstock farm where stressed musician david winter jon finch lives with his actress wife mary prunella gee  is currently composing the music for a horror film one night while looking for his dog billy david finds a mysterious woman in his barn calling herself lucinda jessop patricia quinn she claims to be a witch who has transported herself from 300 years in the past to now obviously rather sceptical david has a hard time believing her so he locks her in a room in his farmhouse  calls his doctor charles ian mcculloch to come examine her however once he arrives  they enter the room lucinda has disappeared charles puts it down to david drinking too much but over the next few day strange  disturbing things begin to happen to david  marybr br witching time was episode 1 from the short lived british anthology horror series produced by hammer studios for tv  originally aired here in the uk during september 1980 the first of two hammer house of horror episodes to be directed by don leaver episode 13 the mark of satan being the other i actually rather liked this as a series hammer house of horror dealt with various different themes  were all unconnected to each other except in name  unsurprisingly watching time is a sinister  effective little tale about a witch the script by anthony read benefits from its slight 50 odd minute duration  moves along at a nice pace the characters are pretty good as is the dialogue there are some nice scenes here  i liked the way it never quite reveals whether david  mary are going crazy or not i think its a well structured entertaining  reasonably creepy horror themed tv show that i enjoyed more than i thought i wouldbr br being made for british tv meant the boys at hammer had a lower budget than usual if that was even possible  as such there is no gorgeous period settings here as in their most well know frankenstein  dracula films although the contemporary english setting does give it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a bit more another tv based restriction is that the exploitation levels are lower than you might hope for theres some nudity  gore but not much although i didnt mind too much as the story here is pretty good its well made for what it is  hammers experience on their feature films probably helped make these look pretty good the acting is good as well with genre favourite ian mcculloch making a bitpart appearancebr br witching time is a good start to the hammer house of horror series as a 50 minute piece of british tv its pretty damned good now why dont they make shows like this over here anymore
