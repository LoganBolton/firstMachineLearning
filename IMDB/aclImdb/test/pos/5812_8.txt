this was my first look at this shortlived british tv horror series but i had seen a couple of hammer horror films horror of dracula captain kronos vampire hunter and thought highlyenough of them to give this a lookbr br this first episode was a shocker  not for the horror but for all the nudity was this regular tv in england in 1980 if so it showed a lot more skin than what we see in north america there were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts one scene where a guy put his hand on one and another scene with man a top of a woman faking intercourse hey im not complaining br br the story is a simple one a witch who had disappeared in the 17th century comes back to her old house and makes life tough for the married man the latter jon finch as david winter wasnt much of an actor but his wife wasnt bad and was a really beauty she was be prunella gee as mary the husband suspected her rightly so of having an affair and that plays a part in this storybr br patricia quinn was entertaining as the laughing witch lucinda jessup who comes back with a mean streak in her and has a good time tormenting the couple until things go wrong at the end as a man id say it was particular fun to see the two women going at it this starts off slowly but once lucinda starts stirring up things it gets very entertaining
