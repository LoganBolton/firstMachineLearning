life is crazy youre crazy im crazy were all crazy were all a little bit minnie and a little bit moskowitz sometimes it does seem best to be sensiblebut then what might you be missing out onbr br you gotta be you you dont have to park cars and semirandomly yell at people but you cant hide yourself behind a veil or dark sunglasses and pretend and act like everything is okay and sometimes you really do have to throw caution to the wind because why else are you alivebr br im not going to rate this love compared to cassavetes other movies because they are all absolutely 100 unique works and each their own individual act of expression and exploration of our lives in that sense they are all great and comparisons are odious for sure this movie has that one crazy sometimes maddening but ultimately wonderful and freeing quality that all his movies have you never know whats going to happen next and you never know what the characters are going to think do or feel next neither do the characters themselves and do we really want to live our lives any other way unlike moskowitz you can have a great job and judiciously sock away money into your ira but still live the life of an adventurer inside in your feelings your spirit and your very experience of life yeah we can have it both ways thats what cassavetes shows us thank god somebody did
