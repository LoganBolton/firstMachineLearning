one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode youll be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with mebr br the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word go trust me this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence its is hardcore in the classic use of the wordbr br it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary it focuses mainly on emerald city an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards so privacy is not high on the agenda em city is home to manyaryans muslims gangstas latinos christians italians irish and moreso scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far awaybr br i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldnt dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romanceoz doesnt mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i couldnt say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards wholl be sold out for a nickel inmates wholl kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewingthats if you can get in touch with your darker side
