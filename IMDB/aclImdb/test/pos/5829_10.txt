one of the best tv shows out there if not the best one why simple it has guts to show us real life in prison without any clich√©s and predictable twists this is not prison break or any other show actually comparing to oz the show sopranos look like story for childrens profanity cursing shots of explicit violence and using drugs disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes all this and more in oz but this is not the best part of oz the characters are the strongest point of this show theyre all excellent and not annoying despite the fact we are looking at brutal criminals the actors are excellent my favorite are the actors who are playing ryan oreilly and tobias beecher because theyre so unique and changing their behavior completely and most of all the dont have no remorse for their actions overall oz is amazing show the best one out there forget about csi and shows about stupid doctors this is the deal oz
