this is a hard show to watch its not something to sit back and relax to it kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons people get screwed over raped tortured and die like flies there are male organs everywhere there is excrement puke and blood oz is a brave show it brings up issues like racism homosexuality prisoners reality and most of all capital punishment it is in my opinion also successful in doing so unlike for example the singletracked mediumbr br it bored me sometimes it had some weird story lines and they spent to much time on characters that just didnt interest me strangely enough i found season 1 to be quite boring if i had watched it while it aired i think i wouldnt have continued to watch it i love seasons 2  4 season 5 and 6 are watchable although i think it shouldnt be allowed to utter the words cyril and death row in the same sentencebr br there are so many marvelous characters to root for the old guys bob and busmalis who i absolutely fell in love with from day one said adebesi pancamo and schillinger four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way augustus hill whos monologues tied the episodes together so efficient the staff with people like sister pete and ray mukadaalso brilliant also minor characters that was only in for a couple of episodes or a few seasons but left a good impression as wellbr br my favorites are the oreily brothers their relationship was the most gutwrenching and warmest i seen on television if there is anything i will always remember about this show its them there will never be another pairing or what to call it that will make me ache so much thats why when the ends come for them as well it almost hurt to much i wish it would never have happened i wish i had never watched itbr br but good one fontana i do recommend it
