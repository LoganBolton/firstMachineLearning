harrowing series about life in ozan experimental prison where they try to rehabilitate prisoners theres gay sex rape torture mutilation killings humiliation tons of male nudityall in your face and going full forcebr br it also is easily one of the best written dramas ever put on tv and almost all the actors are just great since this was on cable there were no restrictions on what they could say or show theres plenty of racist comments flying in here but its for all races in fact the white characters come off pretty badly especially the aryans and the black characters come off better the peaceloving muslims the hispanics dont have a strong role and there are no asian prisoners at all all the prisoners seem to be backstabbers and willing to kill anyone at a moments noticebut you still find yourself sympathizing with some of them even the guards counselors and doctors at the prison have serious issuesbr br i heartily recommend this but rent itdont buy it i have the whole collection and to be totally honest i dont think i ever want to see it again its incredible tv but so grim dark and depressing guess i gotta sell it all onlinebr br i give it a 10
