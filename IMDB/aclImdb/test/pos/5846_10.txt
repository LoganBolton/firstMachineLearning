okay so ive read most of the reviews on this movie as well as comments left by visitors to this site and the feeling i get is that most people who wrote reviews really didnt like this movie thats why im writing nowi represent the minority because i did i admit i went to see the movie because i am very impressed with ryan goslings compelling abilities and the projects he has been a part of lately have been nothing less than incredible he is an amazing actor that aside i wanted to see this movie because it seemed intriguing to me why because its a whodunit where you know whodunit from the start and thats kind of unusualbr br as the plot goes two teenage boys endeavour to commit the perfect crime because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only through committing acts of crime are human beings truly freethe uninhibited and lets remember guiltless acting out of ones will the relationship between richard and justin was complex hinted at homosexuality and was brilliantly acted by ryan gosling and michael pitt gosling was the manipulating controlling smoothtalker and pitt was the extremely booksmart socially awkward outcast enter sandra bullocks character who it seems most people didnt particularly appreciate i think when people see she was the executive producer they automatically assume any role the actor has in it is a selfglorification thing i didnt see that as the case here without cassies personal history about the exhusband that nearly killed her who not surprisingly shared similar traits with richard hayward she never would have pursued her instincts about justin and richard the case was seemingly airtight against ray the unsuspecting school janitor and friend of the boys even when the boys are questioned near the end of the movie neither bullock nor her partner have much solid evidence about them other than the fact that they lied about knowing each other and the vomit justin left at the sight therein lay the genius of the movie because the philosophy the boys were trying to prove through the act of killing the guiltless acting out of will as true freedom ended up working against justin who ended up having a conscience after all and ended up leaving part of his conscience at the body dump site without that crucial piece of evidence they almost had a murder by numbers and to readers out there who have puzzled over the title as much as i have i looked in to it and found that something done by numbers such as a painting suggests careful and critical planning and exacting theres also a song by sting called murder by numbers but thats beside the point br br many readers questioned the necessity of the relationship between cassie and her partner but i think it really meant to show how cynical and manipulative she had become because of her history like it or not her history does play an important role in this movie because without it she would likely have never followed her instincts about justin and richard yes it was a bit of the cliche women scorned woman acting out vendetta in every facet of her life plot but i think without the depth of cassies character you have just another movie about teenage killers and they just may have gotten away with it theres no movie therebr br and to the reader who commented that the teenagers obviously didnt commit the perfect crime because the police were on to them from the beginning can i remind you that the reason was because of the purposely placed and totally traceable shoe prints the boys wanted to be involvedit was a game they were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first hand the difficulty the investigators would have in uncovering what they think is the truth what they didnt expect was that cassie mayweather had an overactive case of instinct working on her side a little unbelievable maybe but many crimes have been solved by police officers who have followed their instincts however this is a moviebr br i saw this movie in theatres about three times and each time it revealed a little more to me and i liked it a little more the more i watched it the more i was captivated and frightened by the psychological depth richard haywardthere are people really like this my main complaint about the movie would be that they should have had justin and richards interactions a little more central because lets face it there lays the intrigue in the entire film and my main props go to characterizationeach character was very distinct and interesting in hisher own way it was very well acted although i would have given ben chaplins character a little more depth to work with hes a good actor and maybe pared down bullocks character a smidgenbr br i think everyone should keep in mind that for a hitchcock type thriller like this to basically tell you the whodunit at the beginning it poses a very big challenge for the writers to keep the attention of the audience until the very end i think they did so quite well by utilizing a few small plot twists throughout slow revelation of the different character dynamics and by lighting up the screen with some really emotionally charged performances by the young actors ryan gosling and michael pitt i think if we remove our innate cynicism and attempt to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are we may be able to look beyond any apparent plot holes and see the real texture and quality of this movie if only in the characters who were brilliantly portrayed especially richard hayward not that im biassed
