not bad but could be loads better also seems to follow a staple diet for crime drama youve got sandra bullock as the cop who finds it difficult to work with others youve got her placed with a new partner theres a closed case but a cop who works on it anyway and theres so many corney lines in the film it makes you want to screambr br however if you can look past the formulaic elements there is a good film hiding underneath its gripping and the subplots worked for me well worth a rent but maybe not a purchase
