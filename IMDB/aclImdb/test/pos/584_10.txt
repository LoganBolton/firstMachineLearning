the muppet movie is an instant classic i remember the opening scene with the birds eye view of the swamp and kermit starting into in my opinion the most loved song in the history of songs at this point my mom would always sing along with kermitbr br watching this title as a young adult it makes me smile i can still sing along to my hearts desire like many muppet films there are in jokes for adults that are in my opinion still funny today my favorite line of all time is actually from this film its the last line spoken by my green goggle eyed hero kermit lifes like a movie  write your own ending thats what i intend to do thank you jim henson
