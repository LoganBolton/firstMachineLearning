sandra bullock paints a believable picture as the troubled detective though seeing her as a cynical maneating victimturnedpersecutor requires a leap of faith or two the two creepy troubled kids are portrayed adequately by ryan gosling and michael pitt br br i do have quite a bit of trouble getting ben chaplin into the equation same problem arose when watching the truth about cats  dogs httpusimdbcomtitlett0117979 i mean when you put an englishman into an allamerican movie shouldnt there at least be a reason to put him there shouldnt there be some story leading up to the fact that an englishman is serving as a detective on an american police force shouldnt there be some dialog pointing out and explaining that rather obvious fact or even some jokes about him being that english br br he looks out of place here as he looked out of place in the truth about cats  dogs producers really should take notice it distracts and annoys the audience at least me nothing wrong with chaplins acting its just a matter of making an actor who is out of place believable and not putting him somewhere without a good reason or a storyline br br the movie itself well thrillers especially those dealing with solving a complicated crime require some suspension of disbelief this ones no different actually it requires quite a bit more effort than usual in order to make bullock smart enough to crack the case despite of all the pressures requiring her to let go of it some unrealistic assumptions are being made about the evidence and im sure a lot of people who watched it had a few moments of come on this is highly unlikely under the circumstances or even hey you cant brush evidence aside like that to wrap this movie up br br like i said reasonably entertaining and watchable just dont use this as required viewing for detective exams there are no shortcuts there
