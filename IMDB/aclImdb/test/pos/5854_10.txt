this is an excellent suspenseful murdermystery movie not only was the plot full of suspense and intrigue but you get to see gorgeous ryan gosling for a couple hours whats not to love also sandra bullock is good in this movie  ive always been a fan of hers i just wish she hadnt decided to be in the lake house which was horrible but thats another story altogether obviously since there are thousands of other murderhorror movies out there there are bound to be similarities between them no need to bash this movie for having some similarities to at least a few that have already been made anyway this is a great movie for those of you that actually enjoy scary movies its a little dark and twisted but overall a great movie
