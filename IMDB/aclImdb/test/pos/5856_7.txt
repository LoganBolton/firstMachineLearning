now i know that sandra bullock produced this film but she needs to learn that sometimes you need to make certain sacrifices in order to advance the storylike not trying to make the whole movie about her characterbr br the story is about two high school students one rich and popular the other smart and antisocial who formulate a plan to commit murder and follow it by the numberjust to see if they can get away with it enter sandra bullock and ben chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case the boys have planted evidence created alibis and cleaned up after themselves so well that the cops fall for the whole act but sandra has a feeling that all is not as it appears to bebr br this movie could have been a great little hitchcockstyle thriller but the movie spends too much time on getting to know sandras character rather than focusing on the actual crime itself you see something happened in her past that keeps haunting her throughout the film and we get to know all about itall about it it just gets rather tedious after a while especially when you are right in the middle of an intriguing murder investigation and then have to stop that investigation to hear about what happened to her in the pastbr br ryan gosling and michael pitt are the real winners in this movie they play their characters convincingly and with just the right amount of malice if the script had spent more time focusing on these characters and kept the detectives there to just do their jobs this could have been an immensely entertaining thriller with the way it is most of the thrill is lost they should have cut out all the stuff with sandras character and made that a separate tv movie for the lifetime channel but i digress its still an entertaining movie nonetheless i do recommend this moviebut wait for the videodvd
