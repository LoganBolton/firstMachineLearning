i knew little of this movie when i entered the theatre for an advance screening i gathered from the ads that it was a thrillerbr br what we have is like compulsion meets matlock two teens decide to commit a perfect murder a victim is selected at random and then carefully executed so that no traces of the actual murderers is found then a bunch of false leads are planted that point to an innocent bystander innocent of the murder anywaybr br enter sondra bullock as the investigating officer imdb says that shes fbi but i dont remember that i thought that she was a regular cop shes frustrated by the inconsistency of the killers profile the profile doesnt fit the profile and by the power and influence of the father of one of the boysbr br shes also has demons of her own which figure prominently in her decicision to become a cop but this is the only character that is really more than onedimensional all others are pretty flatbr br for a thriller there are really no big thrills its mostly a catandmouse game like an episode of matlock which shes watching at one point in the film the twist is that there are two involved in the killing just who is the real murderer justin or richard itll cost you eight bucks to find out
