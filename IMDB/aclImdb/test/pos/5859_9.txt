i can get very tired of murder mysteries with the exception of a few really excellent tv series otherwise there are just too many of these murder plot themes i dont like the theme of the two overclever selfish youths killing as an intellectual exercise ive no interest whatsoever in hitchcock who appears to have been associated with this in some way i dont intend to find out about but dont misunderstand me the theme is in itself excellent the whole movie is so well done and of course sandra bullock is superlative as always br br sandras character is as in miss congeniality not rated by the male team she works with in spite of her obvious skills and the boss mostly ignores her ideas eventually forcing her aside and giving the case to her male partner of course sandra works out whats going on and nearly gets killed in a very dramatic denouement its intriguing how the boy who worked out the murder plot cant allow her to be killed by his colleague  he has a conscience of some sort and perhaps could be saved while the other is a true psychopathbr br sandras hard shell is caused by misery in her past thats tied in poignantly with the murder case her colleague realising that sandras solving this case in spite of being balked by the dense superior finally discovers what happened to sandra herself in her teens that she must now face up to and exorcise and the last scene shows her starting  we hope anyway  to do just that br br i can see from the few other reviews ive had time to read that this movie would attract a broadish group  those interested in the two spoilt boys whiling away their time with their grisly philosophical determination to trick the police and get away with the perfect murder the relationship between them thats so cleverly depicted the ghastly links to the heroines past a police theme and some smokes and mirrors  as well as for hitchcock fansbr br for those whove queried why bullocks character has to have a problematic past really i think this would be a far less interesting movie if she had been just a detective trying to fathom what was going on with a willing sidekick helping out and a malechauvinist boss the link between the murder victim and the detective is necessary to show the detective becoming too involved or otherwise how would she lose her arrogant bosss confidence and thereby nearly lose her life thats hardly an original theme in fact its usually an extremely irritating theme as this male chauvinist boss brutally tells his frustrated but obviously inspired operative to get off the case and leave it to someone who clearly doesnt have quite the skills to solve it nice though the sidekick is i was getting very worried towards the end re what might happen to sandras character as her emotional involvement in the case and special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime dangerously drove her on with this case by herselfbr br i wasnt disappointed re the relationship between bullocks character and her sidekick that goes along interestingly and at times very poignantlybr br the relationship between the two boys is definitely intriguing if thats what you were interested in watching i felt it was kept low key in some ways either because the moviemakers didnt want to get into boyboy friendships too much or because we werent supposed to think emotion ruled their relationship the movie cleverly makes you wonder which boys in charge of the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their underlying immaturity at various stagesbr br there one thing i wish had been clarified and thats what happens after the movie ends when sandras character arrives at the court you need to see to movie to know why shes therebr br very well acted by all i certainly cant agree with those who complained against bullocks acting  she was superb the part suited her very well indeed the story is gripping even if murder mysteries arent your thing and they arent that often mine
