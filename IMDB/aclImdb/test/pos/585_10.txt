why are there so many songs about rainbows and whats on the other side kermit poses this relatively simple double interrogative near the beginning of the muppet movie while singing his signature song the rainbow connection as time goes by the question and the movie only gain profunditybr br im going to forgo the review of this movie as a childrens comedy but look at it instead as a classic for every generation to love with serious ideals and a heartwarming message that gains more warmth with each passing yearbr br as the milestones in my own life come creeping up on me i hear more and more the evocative strains of that elementary ditty and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to anyones life because we all dream and that is what this movie is about its not just a bunch of puppets its a bunch of puppets having the strength to pursue their dreams which is a good lesson for everyonebr br and while the humor and mirth of the film always feel good theyre not a fair judge of the movie only the rainbow connection and the powerful emotions it will realize and it all fits in rainbow connection is the muppet movie and vice versa its existentialism meets childrens entertainment theres no simpler way to describe it
