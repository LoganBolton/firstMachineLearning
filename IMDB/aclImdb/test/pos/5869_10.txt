i was recently given this film on dvd as a gift and was unsure at first if it would appeal although one of my favourite actors has a leading role in fact its on its way to becoming a favouritebr br first of all thankfully its not the same as the book the ending of which i think is excessively melodramatic secondly its one of the best films ive seen about the first world war what you may ask its not a war film true we see no battles or bombardments no trenches no gas but it shows the cost of war the damage done to the lives of the men who fought in it and the impact this had on those close to thembr br we first see helen sarah miles a baronets widow awaiting her release from a mental hospital all the women in the film appear to be widows some from the war but helens mucholder husband sir thomas we see him later in a photograph was taken ill and died while she was at a party hence her guiltstricken breakdown she is lost and lonely the wire around the hospital grounds evokes pow camps and the trenches like many of the men in the outside world helen is suffering from a kind of shellshockbr br out of hospital she has to find her feet in the outside world again a world we experience through her eyes as bleak desolate and unfriendly her mother is unable to provide her with any real support herself a widow she has put up her own emotional defences behind which she hides to avoid dealing with her daughters distress like many people especially in that time she seems to find mental illness embarrassingbr br ledbetter the hired driver becomes a supportive presence and helps helen begin to adjust to life again but she does not realise that he is becoming dangerously obsessed with her this is a superb performance by robert shaw ledbetter is a former regular soldier an exsergeantmajor who runs a boxing club and has set up his own carhire business superficially he seems tough and strong dependable but there are cracks beneath the surface he has not really adjusted to civilian life he invents for reasons he later explains a family and home life he does not have he has brutal outbursts with colleagues and affectionless sex getting close to helen  a woman whom even with the greater postwar social freedom he could not realistically have hoped to marry  exposes psychological faultlines that tear him apart these days one might diagnose ptsdbr br the same is true of the other man in helens life aspiring politician captain hugh cantrip peter egan he is ambitious handsome but also very young tellingly his girlfriend connie caroline mortimer mothers him combing his hair and making sure he has a clean handkerchief before he goes out he is known to both ledbetter and helen the former had served under him during the war and helen had met him in political circles and had thought him a popinjay however he and helen now begin a relationship with helen intending to support his political career financially and emotionally peter egan fresh from his stage success as stanhope in r c sheriffs journeys end makes hugh more than an immature cad there is a revealing understated scene in the back of the car between helen and hugh in which they quote brookes the old vicarage at grantchester she asks of his war experience was it very bad he cannot answer she says well youre back now but his softlyspoken reply  am i sometimes i wonder  is the key to his character as light and shadow flicker across his face we know that there are some horrors that cannot be put into words the disproportionate casualties suffered by junior officers of his sort  straight out of school or university and expected to lead from the front  are wellknown in a nervous speech during which helen reassures him to local political folk at a dinnerparty he reveals that he will stand as an independent no longer as a liberal the party which had taken the country into the war his emotional life is as damaged as ledbetters he cannot easily extricate himself from connie who depends on him emotionally and financially reading between the lines she is probably a warwidow perhaps of a former comrade with a child whose drawings we see on the wall of her homebr br spoilersbr br the crisis between the trio builds slowly with a frightening scene between helen and ledbetter in the car and ledbetter listening in to hugh and connie when he is driving them as hugh tries to persuade connie that even as his relationship with helen develops they can continue theirs that he will at least continue to support her jealousy obsession and his belief that he must protect helen from a duplicitous golddigger lead ledbetter to confront her and hugh violently in her homebr br the ending is entirely different from that of the novel and is better for it it is dramatic but less melodramatic and maintains an unsentimental tone we began with one character recovering from a mental breakdown we end with another suffering one helen one senses is now wiser and stronger than both the men who have been unable fully to adapt to the socalled land fit for heroes to which they returned from the nightmare of total war the new ending is open one feels that she at least will cope with whatever lies ahead without illusions in this it reflects well the reality of the time in which women helen connie and so many others had to pick up the pieces of a world in which too many men had died or had come home with varying degrees of mental and physical damage br br well youre back now  am i sometimes i wonder
