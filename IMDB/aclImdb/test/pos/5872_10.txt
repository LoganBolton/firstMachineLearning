i first saw this film as a teenager im now in my 40s and have long considered it to be my favorite movie the story is enormously moving without being sentimental the acting especially by march and loy is deadon and the fact that dana andrews is too old for his role doesnt take away from the believability of his romance with theresa wright whom i believe is the only major character in the film still living this could have turned out to be another postwar melodrama but the script and cast are simply too good for that to happen
