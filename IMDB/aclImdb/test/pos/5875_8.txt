this film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt a triumph in the postwar period it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema recently it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most evenhanded representation of soldiers integration into postwar life ever made and that most definitely includes films such as the deer hunter i like it but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremesbr br the tale is a simple one three very different servicemen who have mustered out after world war ii the big one fly home to their midwest town and try to resume or create civilian lives one has a disability one has a cushy job waiting for him and the other has nothing to go on but determinationbr br there are some good but unfortunately uneven performances fredric march won the best actor oscar for playing an old sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank personally i think jimmy stewart deserved it for its a wonderful life which also deserved the best picture award but clearly this film touched a nerve with the postwar audience as i said it was fashionable march has one fantastic scene a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real wwii hero pappy boyington and otherwise is solid but unspectacularbr br i am going against the grain here but i thought that myrna loy who played marchs wife was justly ignored by the academy i detected barely a hint of warmth from her in fact i kept thinking she was going to slap frederic march for annoying her she practically grimaced every time they were together something was definitely missing there in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than joyfulness i think all this nonsense about her being the perfect wife is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal you may disagree with that but the academy voters apparently did not she is a major problem with this film terribly miscastbr br dana andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero then winds up behind the counter again is amazing he is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons and his future looks bleak but then he chances upon marchs daughter peggy teresa wright in a fantastic turn and fireworks explode both are great but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film some moments of pure soap opera intrude punctuated by the alltime classic line im going to bust that marriage up the romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war that of returning servicemen finding love upon their returnbr br speaking of uplifting now we come to harold russell he has a naturalistic quality to his acting or is it nonacting that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then taking a nononsense approach to his situation he is an inspiration his best scene one of the best in all cinema is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition im lucky i still have my elbows unlike some of the boys truly great stuffbr br the film has some moments that soar it also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps take the good with the bad and see this one for the high points
