i enjoyed the muppet movie very much it was the first of the muppet movies and is by far the best because its so creative and fresh with later films the ideas just didnt seem quite so original but here we get to see kermit and miss piggy riding bikes an incredibly difficult scene an excellent ensemble cast and just a lot of fun i loved every minute the muppets were performing and i would have rated the film a lot higher except for one serious problem in this and most subsequent muppet films some powers that be felt there was a need to include lots of nonmuppetsin particular many many cameos by stars some worked fine such as charles durnings but many just seemed irrelevant and slowed the picture to a grinding halt probably the worst of them was with edgar bergan yes he was an amazing man who inspired jim henson and the rest of his crew but the tiny scene hes in just wasnt needed nor were most of the cameos still despite this big complaint its a great film for the entire familyfrom the kids to even the most demanding adults
