the best years of our life is often compared to its a wonderful life they never should be their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives it is hard to know what value individual life may have how many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century what a statistic we have to live with also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years we have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just especially the ones that have been fought recentlybr br i have been a life long pacifist i oppose all war not long ago i had that position tested it occurred while i was on the uss lexington which is permanently anchored in corpus christi texas the ship required a crew that is 3 or 4times the community in which i live it is a powerful experience moving around on her decks she had seen a great deal of action someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply boughtbr br i cannot watch the best years of our life without thinking about things like the lexingtonbr br each of the three veterans paid their dues and they paid mine as wellbr br no one of them got off any easier than any other the navy air force and army paid equally although in different ways each had problems directly related to the war and each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties it took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war because each had to do it on his own each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others ultimately no one could helpbr br the moving part of the film this could be the beginning part of the spoiler is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice the obvious case is when derry told herald to marry the girl dont hesitate do it tomorrow it is hard for harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war but to his credit harold listensbr br the other is when al tells derry to stay away from his daughter the meaning was clear mend your relationship with your wife Â– standard fair for 30s40s films derry did not debate the point he felt he was not fit for als daughter so he agreed the truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about derry real emotions from real people i think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor i sometimes think we believe these values do not exist thats perhaps why people looking at this film have problemsbr br al is not free of advice he does not totally want any time his boss talks to him al gets tied in knots and rightly so there are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles arebr br all of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped stacked stored discarded and soon to be recycled their function worth and pride as translucent as derry himself he can overcome that translucency which he does making him fit in his mind for the woman he lovesbr br i gave the best years of our lives a 10 and there are few films i feel that way about this is not a film for popcorn it deserves our attention we are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people we ought to be careful that we dont abuse that privilege
