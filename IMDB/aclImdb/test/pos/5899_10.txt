i watch this movie every time it plays on tv a simply brilliant film three men return home from war and try to return to civilian life with great difficulty all three led opposite lives during the war executive banker became an army corporal a soda jerk became an air force captain and the high school football hero loses both his arms in battleand now each must reconstruct his life and connect with a new reality the homes they return to with grown children and independent working women along with a depressed economy only add to the strife its the scenes just off camera and the unspoken dialog which resonates the most loudly however the awkward intimacy of frederich march and myrna loy and his struggle to return to his place as leader both at home and at work are heartbreakingbr br dana andrews is riveting as the handsome decorated captain who struggles to keep his life together without the uniformbr br the film is filled with honest characters and each is portrayed by a gifted actorbr br this film however took on a whole other level after seeing saving private ryan the reality and magnitude of what these men lived through for love and countryand obviously it didnt end on the battlefieldbr br this is an essential for any collectionbr br
