ive seen the beginning of the muppet movie but just the half because i only watched it at mrs kellys friends house the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious they learn that if they believe in the end of the rainbow anyone can make it no matter how small no matter how greenwhich was included in the trailerbr br kermit is my favorite protagonistwhich means it describes the main character and so are the other muppets mel brooks was amazing when he played professor max krassman the scene where miss piggy saves kermit by doing kung fu on those guys it was so coolbr br the muppet movie is the best jim henson film with the most hilarious characters and people will cherish for his successful film
