in 2004 i wrote the following statements on an imdb message board when a user wondered if the best years of our lives was a forgotten movie br br  to me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule i think in many ways the best years of our lives is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the us in the mid1940s after wwii i believe coming home and the deer hunter both released in 1978 were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in the best years of our livesbr br what really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when i was in college around 198081 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the moviebr br this movie still packs a wallop and im very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time br br im very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on imdb and afi also though it was in competition with what eventually became a christmas classic its a wonderful life arguably the best years of our lives oscar wins including best picture were very welldeserved br br ive just seen the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years the best years of our lives is still a powerful beautifully acted and wellcrafted motion picture
