i saw this film when it first came out and have never forgotten it my uncle antoine is much much greater than the sum of its parts the movie loosely is about a preadolescent who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in canada there are adventures that seem more or less typical but underneath there is a current building mua has a leisurely pace but have patience the reward is coming i believe the film was subtitled and as with all nonenglish speaking movies ive seen it is well worth avoiding any dubbed version inevitably dubbed movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors with the additional necessity of lipsynching lines that dont quite fit the english speaking amarcord is a travesty for example while the subtitled version sings my uncle antoine is well worth the time to find and watch it in french
