ive seen jimmy stewart in all the regular roles but the spirit of st louis was reported to be one of his favorites a poor boxoffice performer when released this film has been largely forgotten today telling the wellknown story of lindbergs famous flight in 1927 stewart seems to be badly misscast at first and his well known voice never lets you forget who youre watching it feels like george baily all over again but stewart obviously worked hard on the role and he does everything right so before long you dont care anymore that stewart was 20 years older than the man hes portraying stewarts lindberg is so goshdarn allamerican applepie likable that you get caught up in the story and you realize that stewart intended to portray lindberg with all of the awshucks yankeeknowhow he could muster up lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the us and stewart seems determined to keep up appearancesbr br flash backs are cleverly used to keep what is really a rather dull story moving along and i was struck by the subtle references to faith that were scattered through the film lindberg trying to teach a hopeless priest how to fly only to be confronted by the priest on his beliefs or lindberg refusing to carry a proffered st christopher medal to save weight on the plane only to find the medal hidden in his lunch bag after hed crossed the atlantic for me this is a film not about a mans epic journey into the unknown but his realization that this life is much bigger than the things we can see and feel
