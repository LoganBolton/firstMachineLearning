everyone knows that lindburgh succeeded in the first transatlantic flight so how can there be any suspense or intrigue in this film well there is dont ask me how but there is partly due to the directors expert telling of the tale but mostly due to jimmy stewarts thoroughly engaging performance we are drawn into the story as if it were unfolding for the first time right before our eyes despite the fact that half the movie is filmed in a cramped cockpit it is as dynamic as any action flick out there so if you are apprehensive about seeing this movie because you think you know the story already give it a shot i think youll be impressed
