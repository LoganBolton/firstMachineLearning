stewarts age didnt bother me at all in this movie although he was portraying a much younger person i still recall my fascination with lindberghs story and while i was thoroughly adult by the time this biopic was made i had to see itbr br not only does this boast a great performance by stewartit also gives a lot of fascinating technical datamaking it understandable to those technically challenged such as myself and the look of the plane itself was greatbr br i quite loved this depiction of a period before my birth and reawakens the childhood love i had for airplanes and for the idea of air travel
