its a thoroughly successful example of a 1950s biopic it has the stalwart and handsome young hero  well not so young anymore on screen superb if unlikely direction by billy wilder a stirring fully orchestrated musical score of uplifting scales and when required heavenly strings by franz waxman strong supporting players a gripping story stunning photography by hitchcock favorite robert burks and a narrative about a singular historical eventbr br the film begins with jimmy stewart as charles lindbergh trying to get some sleep in a long island hotel before his epic solo flight across the atlantic from new york to paris and he cant sleepbr br the flight itself is filled with flashbacks to lindberghs personal history and the purchase and construction of his unique highwing monoplane the spirit of st louis st louis missouri is the home of the partnership that sponsored the flight even in 1927 money talked anyway the movie had to have multiple flashbacks and stewarts narration whats the alternative observing the unities thirtythree hours of watching jimmy stewart sitting silently at the controls of his noisy airplane while days and nights come and go i found the script and the direction impressive for their time unpleasant things are of course left out so as not to introduce more ambiguity than the contemporary audience might managebr br my bet is that the howling mob that surrounds lindbergh at le bourget ripped the airplane to pieces for souvenirs and of course nothing about the pilots relief tube though it would have added more opportunities for humor some of todays viewers will find some incidents corny if they think too much about them aloft stewart chats with a friendly hitchhiking fly that in its own quietly concerned way wakes him up by landing on his cheek at a critical moment later the st christophers medal that father hussman gave him taps gently against the glass crystal of one of the instruments just as stewart is desperately trying to land the atheist stewart is saved twice  once by a fly and once by godbr br but never mind that its an impressive film that landing at le bourget with an exhausted stewart behind the joy stick confused by searchlights sweaty with fear and collapsing with fatigue is really convincing im going to tear this airplane up he tells himself and we can believe himbr br flying a light plane is not at all like driving a car there is no smoothly curving highway to tell you where to go no lanes to provide guidance youre busy every second you must watch the instruments check each wingtip to see that they touch the horizon ditto the airplanes nose and constantly watch up down and sideways for other traffic although that last wouldnt have been much of a problem for lindbergh he was all alone over the oceanbr br why in one of the movies folksier moment stewart and murray hamilton two gypsy barnstormers of the 1920s are lounging near their airplanes in a midwestern field what is it what makes us love flying so much asks hamilton no answer later his financial backers try to talk him out of the flight five other aviators have already died trying it but dont you understand it has to be done says an impassioned stewartbr br well thats not much of an answer either why does it have to be done now and why by lindbergh why not wait ten years and stop wasting lives in the meantime the answer dear socrates lies partly in our glands pilots are a placid and confident lot given to occasional arousal jags their chief problem may be an addiction to an internal rush of adrenalin just kidding some of my best friends are pilots still lindbergh must have been quite a guy he deserved to be treated as a hero not just because of the flight itself but because of his later demeanor  quiet modest a family man we can easily forget his admiration for hitler since he more than made up for it by testing corsair fighters in the pacific and advising the navy on how to tweak the airplanes and get the best performance out of thembr br see it if you have the chance if nothing else its a history lesson told with visual splendor
