this is a great story although there are some jimmy stewart cornball parts for the most part it is a compelling tale about an individual with a compelling drive vision and sense of adventure  to say the least the bottom line is it is one of my favorites to watch and ive done so probably dozens to times  that is until someone stole it our of a bag i brefly left on a plane on a flight to californiabr br some have commented about too many flashbacks but i dont know a better way to keep a long flight interesting for those of us who actually fly flight can be hours of boredom punctuated by moments of terror i wouldnt have wanted to see the flight shortened at all the oppressive need for sleep and the drone and surrounding loneliness is part of the storybr br there are many parts that i particularly like including the takeoff from long island and landing at night in paris wow things have really changed with us and the french since then the airplane building scenes and the recordbreaking flight from san diego are interesting as is the incident over the atlantic in ice which i understand is not completely true but did happen on the san diego flightbr br one gets the sense that one of lindberghs biggest assets are his enlightened supporters as well as his persistencebr br some of the lines that ring in my head now and then include pull the chocks on the takeoff scene and i hope i dont have to use it that way when describing the submarinelike periscope to the lady who lent him a mirror so he could better see his overhead instrumentsbr br this movie is not for everybody but it certainly is for me i hope they make it on dvd soon so i can replace my stolen version
