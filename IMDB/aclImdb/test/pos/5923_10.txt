a great movie about triumph over all the naysayers who try to kill your spirit achieving the impossible i wont go on about it other than to say that i liked to reflect on the this film when im facing something particularly daunting and realize that if lindberg could do what he did i can certainly face the task before me definitely a feel good moviebr br see it you wont be disappointed
