1st watched 10102009  8 out of 10 dir  billy wilder spectacular rendering of lindberghs famous flight by james stewart as lindbergh and director billy wilder there isnt really a whole lot of background built into this story but thats ok because wilder makes the event really remarkable as it comes directly from lindberghs perspective since he used his book as the basis of the movie this early movie about flying has to be one of the best about the act itself as well stewart talking and thinking to himself during the flight gives you so much insight into what lindbergh went thru in this 33 hour solo flight across the atlantic and he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before  which is amazing there is a little backstory about how he purchased the plane and got the financing and some flashbacks about his life during the flight but the movie is mostly about the flight the story is also beautifully made and photographed and is a joy to watch despite its age i appreciate the fact that they didnt throw in a lot of fluff and just let the story tell itself well done throughout this is a classic movie that should be viewed by all
