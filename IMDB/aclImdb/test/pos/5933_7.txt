the royal rumble has traditionally been one of my favourite events and ive been a wrestling fan for a good few years now the other shows may have better matches but ive always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitementbr br im not going to reveal the winners of any match as i dont see it as fair to ruin the results on a review i will comment on the quality of them thoughbr br we have the standard 4 matches and then the big rumble event two from smackdown and two from rawbr br shawn michaels and edge open up for raw this proves to be a good match from two talented guys this is a match id recommend watching its hard to sum up without giving away the winnerbr br next we have the usual undertaker against some big nasty monster be whoever it is giant gonzales yokozuna kamala well this time its heidenreich its also a casket match typical undertaker fare watch if youre a fan i have to admit i am purely for the entertainment factor it can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling matchbr br the next two matches are the title matches for once smackdown manages to upstage raw their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable but with a anticlimax and let down to end it raws match is a pretty dull and boring affair which is a pity as im a fan of both guys involvedbr br now to the main reason i love the event the rumble its a pretty good one this year coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win and it may not prove a big surprise but hey its very enjoyable there are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated there is the token guy who doesnt make it to the ring the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant it has its usual highs and lows and i loved the ending in particular the vince mcmahon entrancebr br id recommend this show not the wwe on top form but its still good add it to your collection
