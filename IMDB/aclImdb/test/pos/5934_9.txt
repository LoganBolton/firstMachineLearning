shawn michaels vs edge8 kind of hard to believe shawn michaels is in the opening match but still a great match by both men edge whether you like or not is a great performer in the ring and shawn michaels is just ageless when it comes to his performance the undertaker vs heidenreich casket match2 ok after a good opening match now this what a crappy match undertaker has given some great matches at the royal rumble and 1998s royal rumble against shawn michaels was the same type of match but this is way worse then that matchbr br kurt angle vs big show vs bradshaw triple threat wwe championship6 its alright i feel all three men could of given a better performance this just really didnt show them at their bestbr br randy orton vs triple h world heavyweight championship9 triple h gets a clean win can you believe it sure he takes out the sledgehammer but doesnt use it randy orton did great when acting like he got a concussion but how he got the concussion is really ridiculous i really liked this match this was the best performance ive seen from hhh in foreverbr br the royal rumble match7 this was highly entertaining and i usually dont score the royal rumble match this high the winner is again very predictable but just this had a lot of moments that were very entertaining to watch the segments with flair and guerrero are hilarious the best segments ive seen in a whilebr br overall this is a great ppv and a must own for wrestling fans
