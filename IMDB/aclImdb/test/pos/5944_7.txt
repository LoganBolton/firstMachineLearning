if youre going to spoof james bond its a brilliant idea to find a leading man who resembles both sean connery and leonard rossiter so step forward jean dujardin who captures perfectly the connery sneer that masquerades as a smile plus the selfdelusion of rossiter thinking he is suave dujardin plays it like a clouseau who can hold his own at karate the plot has him looking for our man in schtook who has disappeared mysteriously and includes such improbabilities as a nazi cell concealed inside a pyramid if there is a jarring note it is the leading lady berenice bejo who has all the sensuality of a suet pudding and is eclipsed  but only just  by aure atika its good for one viewing but thats about it
