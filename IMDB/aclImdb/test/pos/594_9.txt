a bunch of fulllength movies featuring the muppets created by jim henson  co have been made but the muppet movie was the first one of them all and the first in the original trilogy which also features the great muppet caper and the muppets take manhattan it was released seven years before i was born so i obviously didnt get to see it at the time nor did i get to see its two successors when they were first released however i saw a lot of the muppets during my childhood mostly after hensons premature death in 1990 i finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the midnineties after hearing the soundtrack unsurprisingly i liked it at the time and revisiting it in recent years hasnt exactly been disappointingbr br one day while kermit the frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing rainbow connection a hollywood agent named bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in tinseltown kermit takes his advice and goes west he soon meets fozzie bear an unsuccessful standup comedian in a restaurant and convinces him to come along the frog is also noticed by doc hopper the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants kermit to be his mascot as a frog kermit is disgusted by this so he refuses and leaves with fozzie on their road trip across the country kermit and fozzie meet other muppets who join them including miss piggy who soon becomes kermits love interest and gonzo unfortunately as they all try to make their way to hollywood doc hopper assisted by max is willing to do anything to force kermit to become his restaurant chains mascot so kermit finds himself in increasing danger br br one thing many people praise this film for is the songs and i can understand why there is of course the oscarnominated rainbow connection at the beginning and more good tunes follow such as kermit and fozzies catchy road song movin right along and im going to go back there someday a poignant ballad sung by gonzo never before never again the song miss piggy sings when she first sees kermit is the only one i would consider rather weak and their romance seems awfully sudden the muppets in this movie are generally lovable just like they are on tv and some of them provide a lot of the humour including fozzie making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his standup and well if youre familiar with these famous muppets you should know what to expect from each of them some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny such as dom deluise as bernie the agent and steve martin as the insolent waiter also its not 100 comedy there are serious parts of the film which they also did wellbr br watching this original muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing muppets from space one of the muppet movies made after hensons death released in 1999 for the first time last year i was very disappointed when i saw that film which had never happened before when i watched any film or tv show featuring the popular puppet characters not only is that movie not very funny i also think its a tad too dark and cruel for the muppets as i stated in my review of it however i cant say i think the same of any of that movies predecessors including this one released twenty years earlier the muppet movie seems to be the most popular of the bunch and since it has so much to like not just for kids thats understandable i highly doubt theres much left to say about the muppet movie that hasnt been said at some point in the past thirty years but today it remains good family entertainment
