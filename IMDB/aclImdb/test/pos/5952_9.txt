oss 117 was fun from start to finishbr br its difficult to define why one film touches or connects with you or not and i wont try to analyze such perfect comedy so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to it br br everything is old fashioned here from womens clothes sigh mambo dance the hero singing bambino sounds like an italian canzonetta sung in arabic br br hubert is physically imposing but dumb as hell from all the 007s he looks like sean connery but is definitely more sympa because hes silly speaks his mind all the time giggles even has some homoerotic fantasies and there are rumours about him in short as an anti hero he rocks  sometimes he only raises his eyebrows or frowns and thats all it takes to make you laugh br br bérénice bejo is the true queen of the film graceful treacherous but with ideals aure atika to the contrary is reduced to a femme fatale of sorts its surprising to see her that sexy bomb thoubr br you just cant compare it with austin powers i agree with amazons d hartley seattle wa on it being respectful to the genrebr br which is your favourite scene one of my favourite scenes is the fight of the chickens with the masked villain but the truly perfect one is when chatting at the cocktail with his contacts how they all mutter platitudes with confidence this scene alone makes the comedy genre worthwhile
