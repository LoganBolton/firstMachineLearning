jean dujardin gets connerys mannerisms down pat the adjusting the cuff links when entering a club as all the women turn to admire him the nonchalant straightening and smoothing down of the tie the swaggering steely gait its uncanny and you come to realise just how much of bond in the sixties was connerys creation and not really ian flemings character br br the cinematography is a nod to those early films the movie takes off from russia with love and thunderball mainly the main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is not just in terms of sexism but nationalism and colonialism and how he puts noses out of joint when he is sent to egypt br br its not perfect  about 20 mins in it seems a onejoke movie and bits of it remind one of spoofs of the day of which there were plenty morcecambe and wises the intelligence men had suspectlooking men in fezs following their heroes around too and thats going back a bit unlike sellers clouseau or baron cohens borat dujardin doesnt give his character that layer of realness or genuine pathos  he is too busy perfecting his connery mannerisms it doesnt do enough with the credits or a big song and theres no funny or serious villain like mike myers dr evil or ricardo montalbans naked gun nemesis for the hero to go up againstbr br but the scene where oss117 wakes up in cairo one morning had me laughing out loud in the threequarters empty cinema and the whole thing looks wonderful plus youll never get a chance to see operation kid brother on the screen and the women are ace crumpet really hot its a bond spoof without falling into the mad scientistken adam sets or funny gadgets routine throughly recommended
