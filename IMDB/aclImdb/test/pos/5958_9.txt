seems like mhazanavicius is backthe man behind la classe américaine comes back with a really fun and clever sequel to those oldfashioned oss117whereas directors tend to overactualize sequels of old classics remember the avengersurk hazanavicius chose to work on a really cheap hero oss117 a kind of lowbudget french 007 and decides to do it in a oldschool waythe photography the body attitudes the fights choreography and the fx everything is like an homage to the way films were made back in the 50sand it works as the tone and jokes of the movie are really good jean dujardin embodies perfectly this stupidarrogantmachoselfish french spy lost in a country he understands only in terms of folklore and inferiorityyes thats it just the way the occident uses to consider its colonies back then and oh no i wont say it has anything to do with what happens nowadays in the very same areaah ahhe just looks like an unfrozen lino ventura with something like 40 pounds less which is perfect for the rolethe other members of the cast fit perfectly as well with all you can dream of russian spies egyptian independantists and former nazisand of course the women as there has to be femmes fatales in any good spymovies the plot is good maybe not brilliant but really good enough taking place between actual historical facts and remembering us in a funny way how france and the others treated its colonies back in those days it all starts in 1955 with a british spy disappearing while tracking a russian cargo full of weapons in suezthen france sends his best friend agent oss117 to discover what happened to both the shipment and the agent the fact is that this agent is really as dumb as can be and he slips through the story without even understanding it solving it in a very clouseauesquire way i have to say i had a bad feeling about the movie as the publicity made around it was quite frightening and as french humor tends to be quite populist and flat forget about les bronzés 3 or camping but i was really surprised and in the good way i highly recommend it whether you want a good parody of bondesquire movies much more fun than in debs for example but less skirts or youre a fan of that genuine and candid way of filming they had back in the 5os yes thats it clever and really funny youve got the point once again mr hazanavicius
