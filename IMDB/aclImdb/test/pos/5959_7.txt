just saw the movie its actually pretty good the trailersd left me an impression of either yet another dujardin onemanshowturnedfilm Ã  la brice de nice or an expensive stupid french comedy surprisingly its neither secret agent oss 117 is stupid but at least he sort of knows it whereas ive always found that james bond was stupid but acted like a smart arse dialogue is witty with a lot of tongueincheek humour that one would expect from a british rather than a french movie the women and the music are beautiful a refreshing trip into the past when the bad guys were exnazis or soviet brutes cars were shiny and france had colonies
