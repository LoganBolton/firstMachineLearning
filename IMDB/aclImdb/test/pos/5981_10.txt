this is one of the very very few films that are so overwhelming that you are very unlikely to watch it more than once or twice in your lifetime other examples are claude lanzmanns documentary shoah and come and see by the directors husband elem klimov  which covers much the same unbearable territory but in a very different waybr br i suppose this is just as well given the difficulty of ever seeing a printbr br apparently its extraordinarily overt christian symbolism and admission that there were active russian collaborators ensured that it was hardly ever seen in the ussr  and of course postsoviet russia has very little interest in films of that erabr br the one time i saw it in london was in a festival of russian movies shown during the glasnost era ie probably c1988  however it apparently has been shown several times in the uk more recently so at least one subtitled print must exist herebr br as far as i know it has never been released in the west on dvd or video so if you havent seen it your best chance is probably to join a film society and endlessly nag them to find a print and screen it
