i was glad that this movie did without all the supposed depth of all too many pseudoserious interracial movies race was one issue yes but so was classand loyaltyand honesty etcbr br i also loved the idea that the love affair wasnt couched solely in the decorative aspects of either characters appearance arent our divorce courts on both sides of the atlantic i daresay filled now with enough couples who thought looking good together is all it takes to make a solid marriage in any case the tenderness and sensuality of both characters was thick enough to cut in love scenes that would have brought a rainbow to any dreary day in other words a lighthearted movie thats by no means a lightweight
