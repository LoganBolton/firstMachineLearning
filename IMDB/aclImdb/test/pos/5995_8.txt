br br this film has some really impressive action scenes the humor and action are blended well though the intensity of the film does not sustain itself till the end the last scene is a slight anticlimax in terms of action quality and astonishing explosiveness of the scenes preceding it the humor doesnt seem to be so ridiculously clumsy as in many other hongkong movies and this film is of totally other class than most american actioncomedies of recent years lau chingwan acts as a typical intuitive policehero who scoffs at invalid orders from incompetent police superiors the dialectic of the film is built on the superhuman coolness and ruthlessness of the drug gang humiliating the police force while providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with a variety of machine guns leaving plenty of corpses in its wake yu rongguang is especially impressive as an ultra cool merciless gangster in this woolike piece of action where tough guys are truly diehard
