i always felt that ms merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills familiar to millions as the lt on law and order she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases always in a supporting role hbos lackawanna blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as nanny successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration but the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in lackawanna new york a suburb of buffalobr br the story could be set in any major africanamerican community of the 50s and 60s from atlantas sweet auburn to new yorks harlem but the segregationintegration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at nannys boarding house the story revolves around nannys relationships with all kinds of people played by some of the best actors in the business i purposely did not say black actorsthis ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black except for jimmy smits of course i recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day
