lemuel gulliver ted danson is a doctor who goes missing at sea leaving pregnant wife mary mary steenburgen behind eight years later he turns up disheveled and seemingly mad  babbling about his adventures in the lands of the tiny lilliputians the giant brobdingnags the floating island of the intellectual laputa and the houyhnhnms a race of intelligent talking horses who have to deal with the yahoos  a race of bestial humans  among many other adventures the notsogood dr bates james fox who has designs on lemuels wife has gulliver incarcerated in a mental institution and lemuel mary and son thomas tom sturridge must find a way to prove his sanitybr br a splendid adaptation of jonathan swifts satirical novel this film is a magnificent adaptation on so many levels the story the satire the characters the visuals the brilliant cast its simply a treat to watch and its almost amazing considering that it was a madefortv filmbr br the film does a brilliant job of capturing swifts vicious satire which cuts like a hatchet through british society of the time but still resonates today the wise brobdingnags and the houyhnhnms are almost perfect individuals who find it virtually impossible to understand why gulliver speaks with such pride of the vices and corruptions of his society the scenes where gulliver struggles to prove himself different from the yahoos are perhaps the best with biting satire in describing how they pick their leaders they seem to pick the worst among them   who rules until they find someone even worse go to war we only go to war for a very good reason  such as they are weaker than us or we want all of their land etc the scenes involving laputa are also effectively done  the intellectuals are so wrapped up in their specialized fields that they have no time for anything else and really possess little common sense and the addition of the asylum plot line enhances the story greatly  dr bates is truly nasty character and when he gives a speech to the inquiry on gullivers alleged vices its quite clear that hes describing his own faultsbr br the film makes use of beautiful and fairly convincing cgi effects depicting the very diverse settings of the novel with great effect the contrast of sizes is done in a very skillful way and all of the worlds depicted in the story are convincing in their own way the cinematography particularly that concerning the asylum and the costumes are brilliantly done the editing of the present with lemuels memories is a device which could be awkward but works very wellbr br the cast is truly wonderful a veritable whoswho of british and american talent ted danson gives an excellent multilayered performance as gulliver showing effectively his transformation from a person bewildered by his strange surroundings to the lunatic state he was in when he reappears to his rational intellectual personality at the end most wellknown for his work on sitcom danson shows that hes more than just sam malone with this wonderful seriocomic performance mary steenburgen is effective as his wife and james fox is absolutely repulsive as bates the rest of the cast is made up mostly of cameos with peter otoole omar sharif warwick davis kristin scott thomas geraldine chaplin alfre woodward edward fox and sir john gielgud being the most memorable  but even the smallest parts are very wellplayedbr br while not 100 faithful to the book gullivers travels is a triumph of story and images its not to be missedbr br 910
