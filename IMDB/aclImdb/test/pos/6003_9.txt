i remember when this nbc miniseries aired when i was in high school after reading the novel i thought id check out some adaptations didnt expect much out of a tv miniseries but now i might have to check out some more this is actually excellent and the best possible film version that could be made writer simon moore who wrote the teleplay for the original traffic miniseries upon which the soderberg film was based came up with a brilliant narrative conceit which helps the story flow very smoothly he frames gullivers adventures as flashbacks with the actual story beginning as gulliver first returns home everything having happened on one journey gulliver played by cheers ted danson is sort of crazyseeming when his wife mary steenburgen welcomes him back into his home unfortunately the house is now owned by the local doctor james fox who has designs on steenburgen gulliver seems merely disturbed at first but when he starts telling stories of tiny people thats all the evidence fox needs to throw him into an insane asylum all four of gullivers travels are related in this version in the same order as the novel the only time this has been done on film i love the way his present situation reflects his flashbacks gullivers small son whom he has never met before reminds him of the lilliputians the doctors who observe him in his cell from a mezzanine loom above him and remind him of the brogdingnagians and the doctors scientific inquiries remind him of the insane scientific experiments and theories of the laputans and the professors at the academy finally when he is put on trial he is reminded of the houyhnhnms and the yahoos the cast of this thing is amazing and includes peter otoole ned beatty alfre woodard john gielgud kristin scott thomas omar sharif and warwick davis the biggest flaw of the miniseries is that the acting is really uneven you have all these fine actors but the lesser characters are often played by actors who were probably fine in episodes of la law but dont do well in a costume drama ted danson isnt especially great although he has a few sequences where he excels its probably better that he didnt attempt one but all the other characters of the film speak in an english accent steenburgen is actually pretty good at it and is quite good overall another flaw the series has is that the adventures happen a tad too quickly its not believable that gulliver spent eight years away from home as is claimed but in general it captures swifts tone and purpose very well while with its structure adding a new emotional level
