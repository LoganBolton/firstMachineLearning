despite its many faults hallmarks 1995 version of gullivers travels is still the finest adaptation of jonathan swifts satirical classic  largely because it not only includes all of gullivers many travels but also includes the satire thats often overlooked unfortunately the twin problems of the books highly episodic structure and a television budget even a fairly lavish one remain the book is a somewhat rambling collection of travellers tales moving simply from one surreal landscape to another but simon moores adaptation tries to impose some order on the chaos by providing a parallel plot that sees gulliver returned to england clearly deeply traumatised and trying to prove his way out of the insane asylum where the rival for his wifes affections has had him committed the england scenes at once mirror and comment on the travels elements of which occasionally spill over into the real world the trouble is that for the first hour or so it acts more as a distraction constantly pulling you away from the story just as it starts to get interesting the lilliput scenes suffer worse here with the feeling that the home scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the more expensive setpieces  this has to be the only version where we dont see gulliver pulling the blefescu fleet behind himbr br yet once gulliver makes his escape the tone becomes more consistent as he finds his situation reversed and himself the pet of the giants of the utopians of brobdingnag a guest of the wise men of the floating island of laputa who are so engrossed in science that they have no common sense left the guestprisoner of a historian who leans history directly from the source offered immortality with all its terrible consequences before finally finding a world he wants to belong if only he can convince the sublime talking horses the houynhnhms that hes not an uncivilized yahoo each new destination convincing him of what an absurd and petty species humanity is for the most part its a darker set of travels than expected with only gullivers curiosity and commonsense and disappointment keeping it from plunging into irretrievable bleakness  and even this is offset by the scenes in the asylum where it becomes more obvious that even if he is telling the truth it may well have driven him genuinely insane its in these latter scenes that ted dansons gulliver really shines never more so than in an extraordinary speech where he turns his trial into a disappointed judgment on the whole human racebr br being made for television the yahoos are rather less literally scatological here than on the page but for the most part this is a more adult treatment than you might expect with no real dumbing down the star cast is certainly impressive and for the most part wellused if somewhat briefly in a few cases  mary steenburgen james fox peter otoole edward woodward omar sharif shashi kapoor edward fox ned beatty alfre woodard kristin scott thomas and isabelle huppert among them its hard to imagine the upcoming jack black version even coming close to being a fraction as impressive as this
