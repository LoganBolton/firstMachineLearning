i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year of junior high i was riveted to it i loved the special effects the fantastic places and the trialaspect and flashback method of telling the storybr br several years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say i think that while its not as perfect as the book for social commentary as a story the movie is better it makes more sense to have it be one long adventure than having gulliver return after each voyage and making a profit by selling the tiny lilliput sheep or whateverbr br its much more arresting when everyone thinks hes crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway as a side note when i saw laputa i was stunned it looks very much like the kingdom of zeal from the chrono trigger video game 1995 that also made me like this miniseries even morebr br i saw it again about 4 years ago and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of sweeps miniseries for nbc who followed it up with the solid merlin and interesting alice in wonderland
