swifts writing really has more in common with kafka and orwell than with fantasyadventure writers so its curious that gullivers travels has been deemed a childrens novel lucky kiddiesbr br the same applies to this movie there have been some really awful versions of this story which must be why people are reluctant to look at this version i mean its a tvmovie and it comes from muppetteer jim henson so how should we expect anything but cutenessbr br look again  beauty turns up in the oddest places children love this movie enough to sit through all three hours of it but it also takes the time to get swifts dark vision right i hate special effects but here they are used to carry the story forward instead of just dazzling us please note that the producers took the trouble to recruit classical actors like john gielgud and peter otoole who perform their eccentric roles with perfectionbr br dramatically the romance between gulliver and glumdalclitch is rendered touching and poignant as well as funny shes a little girl but twenty times his size the framestory has a theme about absent fathers that many children will relate to and the part about gulliver in the asylum introduces an element of horror dealing with the abuse of authority apparently deriving from val lewtons bedlam 1946 another forgotten masterpiecebr br the vhs is always turning up in the bargainbin for a few cents which is an insult to the many great artists who put this thing together i encourage audiences to recognize a good thing by getting this movie and inspiring others to watch it although it has a lot to offer children grownups will find that it stands up nicely to such classics as aguirre brazil 1984 and other serious fantastic works
