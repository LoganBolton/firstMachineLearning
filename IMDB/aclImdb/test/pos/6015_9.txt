and i for one think that is a good thing ive just never been a rosalind russell fan although the original was my favorite rr movie but i love bette and was thrilled to hear she was making thisbr br as for the rest of the production i think it was slightly less than the original movie one of my favorite minor characters in the original was mazeppa with her scratchy fingernailsontheblackboard voice belting out hey it takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah and although i missed it i was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copybr br i also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre not just at the moviesbr br i think the other thing i liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song let me entertain you which becomes completely annoying after about the 5th time you hear it
