gypsy is possibly the greatest musical ever written so its too bad that its film version was such a disappointment to make up for that we have this remake which if not flawless is an enjoyable and well done adaption of the musical the script is completely accurate all the songs included and the staging remains close to the original jerome robbins staging bette midler is a deft choice for rose her singing and personality mermanesquire and her acting splendid peter reigert is a fine herby if not a great singer and cynthia gibb is a straight forward natural louise in truth a live taping of the 1989 revival with tyne daly might have been a better idea if only because gypsy is simply more exciting on stage but this film is a fine translation of a great musical
