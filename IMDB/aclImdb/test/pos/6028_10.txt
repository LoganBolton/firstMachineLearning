i must tell you the truth the only reason i wanted to see this movie was because of rose mcgowan i think that part definitely worked outpretty well actually however the film was very good too some parts of this movie are really goodbr br the film has great action also the mystery is pretty hard to figure out and rose mcgowan does some oscarworthy acting towards the end of the film but i dont want to give anything away adam beach and jurgen prochnow are also great in the movie along with some of the other starsbr br if you like mysteries or action movies or just like rosei totally think you would like this movie
