after repeatedly saying how brilliant so many columbo episodes are its time to honour an episode with maximum points etude in black is not 100 percent perfect but its certainly more than 90 percentmaybe 96 or 97 br br last week i reviewed just married and compared it unfavourably to meet the parents well heres one of the parents blythe danner in a much earlier role as the wife of famous orchestral conductor alex benedict played by the legend that is john cassavetes alex has been having an affair with jennifer wells a girl in the orchestra not his first affair one suspects she is blackmailing alex to leave his wife but as his wifes mother holds the purse strings for the orchestra alex doesnt think itd be such a smart move to destroy his career and marriage overnight instead he hatches a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murder his young lover while making it look like a suicidebr br enter columbo and guess what it takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide it doesnt take much longer for columbo to connect alex to the victim and soon hes following him around wherever he goes even though columbo is certain alex is his man it actually takes quite a while and a few false leads none of which columbo really swallows before he has the vital piece of evidencebr br along the way there are some topnotch extra characters ranging from the precocious young neighbour of jennifer wells and the english mechanic who sounds like he would be more at home on coronation street through to the bedraggled looking brass player who nearly finds himself fitted up for the murder he had also been seeing jennifer wells the busy girl and theres even a brief cameo from commandant lassard from the police academy films as with leslie nielsen in lady in waiting its impossible to take him seriously i bet youre thinking of that speech he made at the podium arent you br br but its blythe danner john cassavetes and peter falk who steal the show here blythe is absolutely divine as mrs benedict from the moment she spots alex dialling jennifer wells number from memory she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was its a masterful performance as she struggles to trust alex despite her intuition telling her something is very very wrong columbo doesnt help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about alexs relations with members of his orchestrabr br as for john cassavetes well its a shame he didnt make any repeat appearances as columbo villains because he could have been up there with jack cassidy and patrick mcgoohan as one of the alltime greats of the show but this performance is superb hes another one who falls into the highly irritated category losing all patience with columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him despite this when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge columbos geniusbr br well its a really really fantastic show it loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music as highlighted by many of the posters here but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations and at least the music is good dramatic and excitingbr br finally if you havent come across it there is an absolutely amazing clip of john cassavetes and peter falk on the dick cavett show from the early 70s im totally convinced steve coogan watched this clip and based alan partridge on it everything about the clip resembles knowing me knowing you from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of cavett by his guests even the orchestra get in on the act playing circus music while falk cassavetes and their friend ben gazzara fool about and ridicule the hostbr br it might not be strictly relevant to this review but the cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between peter falk and john cassavetes its clear to see from the quality of etude in black just how well the pair worked together
