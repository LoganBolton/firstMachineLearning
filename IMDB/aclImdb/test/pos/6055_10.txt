i first saw this film in the late 60s and try to see it every time it comes on tv which unfortunately isnt often now that i have tcm and fmc i hope it will be on at least once a year like louis gossett jr in an officer and a gentleman jack webb delivers an unbelievably great performance as a parris island drill sergeant with the classic screwup recruit and the story line in this one though dated is touching and very well acted and having real jarheads in the cast certainly helped in the realism of the film as well its a great film with topnotch acting and a superb story see it if you have the chanceits well worth the time
