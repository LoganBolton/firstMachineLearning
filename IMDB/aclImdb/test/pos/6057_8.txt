i was a marine at camp pendleton when the di came out 1st marine division 11th marine regiment 3rd battalion ibattery i still remember standing in line with a bunch of other marines to see the movie at the star theater in oceanside californiabr br we did not remotely expect the movie to portray everything we experienced in boot camp but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was the idea of using real marines in the movie was a great idea i believe they were all real drill instructors too as good an actor as jack webb was he just couldnt call cadence like a real marine drill instructorbr br all of us got a laugh when the problem recruits mother came to boot camp to talk to the captain never in a million years would this have happened but thats hollywood and we didnt let that episode keep us from enjoying the moviebr br i went through boot camp at mcrd in san diego during the summer of 1956 and at that time there was virtually no limits as to what the dis could do to you the ribbon creek event at parris island had not yet affected boot camp at least not at mcrd  san diegobr br i agree with what a lot of the other reviewers have commented on concerning sgt moores stiffness around his girl friend i believe this was just webbs acting style and although they could have deleted this part of the movie it didnt really hurt the production that muchbr br one minor note the character uncredited of pvt rodriguez was played by one of my drill instructors sgt peter j oneill sgt oneill used to tell us that some day he wanted to be an actor we secretly laughed at this but he surprised us all he was a great drill instructor and i thought he did well in his bit part also he really did enjoy throwing knives he often demonstrated his skill to us that summer in boot camp i have often wondered if he is still alive
