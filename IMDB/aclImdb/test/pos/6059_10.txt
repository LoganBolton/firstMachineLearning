i had the good fortune to be at perris island in the fall of 1959 the di showed one evening at the outdoor theater directly in front of our barracks plt 162 b co 1st bn 1st itrbr br although we hadnt been there long enough to even think about seeing a movie we could hear those that were laughing its one of the many indelible memories of my thirteen weeks at pibr br at some later date i got to actually see it in a theater im still convinced that to date it remains the most realistic portrayal of the experience in the late 1950s ever done no one has done it better than jack webb
