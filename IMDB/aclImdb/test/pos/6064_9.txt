this is one of the best nonenglish series i have seen it weaves interesting single and double episodes of crimesolving together with a personal aspect that you just dont get in csi the individual characters all have personal lives that combine well with their day job and occasionally interfere additionally the characters all manage to naturally evolve throughout the episodesbr br the casting is superb and it was taped all over denmark giving a good example of the highlights that majestic country has to offer unfortunately only 32 episodes were made however they are topnotch television heres hoping they consider making some more episodes of the same caliber
