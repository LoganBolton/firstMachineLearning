first off im an american  i havent seen any comments on imdb about this series yet from a us viewer secondly i work in the television business in development so i wallow in much of the sludge that comes out of american broadcast programming unit one is an example of television thats a throwback to what i would attribute as 70sstyle scripting featurewise namely those films made by young autueurs who had free rein to make the dramas feel more realistic and to allow for organic character development it tacks more along the lines of stellar british dramas like cracker and prime suspect as well as australias brilliant underbelly unit one features standalone cases that are committed then solved each week the mysteries arent extraordinary or particularly byzantine they usually center around one single twist clocking in generally at the 40 minute mark and resolution is neatly wrapped up in the 15 minutes thereafter what makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it features main characters that you are hooked on and find relatable by episode 2 these are real breathing alive characters that have personal baggage yet its not a talky batty type of baggage that american flotsam such as greys anatomy or desperate housewives spoons out these are realistic individuals whose backstories unfold leisurely over the course of the series as if you work with them on a daily basis after the mindless decade of csis nciss and criminal minds along with their subsequent spawns its refreshing to actually sit down to watch friends you want to spend time with as is the case with unit one the quippy banter the unemotional wooden dialogue and the overthetop jeopardy that those american series i mentioned bludgeon us with each week are absurd compared to the nuance and the quiet resonance you get with this remarkable danish series im on episode 7 of the first season but ive already bought all four seasons and am in for the long haul if you need explosions and farcicallyhopped up testosterone along with music by the who and fastcutting neonlit jittery palsycam action with cipherlike main characters as your main diet of television drama viewing i suggest you stay away from this series if you are an adult with a hunger for subtle poignant thoughtful and yes sometimes straightforward procedural crime dramas i urge you to check this show out
