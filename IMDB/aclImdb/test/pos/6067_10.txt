have just seen the last episode no 32 though the site says only 30 episodes were made and i must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and i would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crimecop stories supposedly all 32 were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes this has at times been a gritty well acted believable and dare i say entertaining series the fact that the powers in denmark decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their work so well and in the series at least never failed to get their man its a definite 1010 for me
