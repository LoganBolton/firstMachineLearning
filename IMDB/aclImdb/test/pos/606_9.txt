minor spoilersbr br misunderstood classic remains one of hensons finest and most personal films it may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one misunderstood but people do seem to remember this one mostly for jerry juhls snappy screenplay and paul williamss knockout songs now while these things are admittedly great as is the movies formal playfulness screenplaywithinthescreenplay film break etc what distinguishes the muppet movie from the other muppet films is the serious wistful thread that runs through the picture its a road movie all right but like most road movies the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of the characters goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again throughout the film we are shown the down side of show business even before the muppets have made it piggy abandons kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of a performers life on the road in his haunting im going to go back there someday and worst of all kermit is continually tortured and tested by doc hopper who wants him to commercialize his art for the unholiest of purposes one can only wonder what henson would have made of his familys management of the company after his death kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene and the final magic store number questions whether its all been worth it before concluding that it probably doesnt matter either way all this is punctuated with the expected muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful jokes and of course the serious stuff wouldnt work if it werent but the muppet movie isnt just another jokefest as the rest of the diminishingreturn muppet films would become no its a lovely gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business and its every bit as effective today as it was 25 years ago 95 out of 10
