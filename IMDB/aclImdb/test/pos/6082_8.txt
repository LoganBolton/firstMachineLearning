one of the most charming and for me at least the most powerful elements of anthony minghellas enthralling best picturewinner the english patient is that in the mid 90s when hollywood was in the initial stage of having lost its nerve for grand new projects a film was created that brought back tracesvery powerful tracesof the sweeping wonderful majesty that crafted movies such as lawrence of arabia 1962 and the ten commandments 1956 the english patient contains very much of what made those films so powerful it has that glorious feeling a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all and fascinating characters with pasts and storiesbr br the english patient based on a novel by the same name by michael ondaatje is like the godfather part ii 1974 in the sense of how its constructed its a blending of two stories the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character an english patient in the post years of world war two ralph fiennes plays the english patient who has been scarred for life by a plane crash and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played marvelously by juliette binoche apart from bonding with her raspyvoiced troubled patient binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger willem dafoe arrives and the two men appear to know each otherbr br thats just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film the other one told in flashback is the patients past before he was scarred and dying in a bed the story of the present mixed with the patients past and his love affair that tragically changed his life foreverbr br to be blunt the english patient is a love story blended with a sweeping epic sensation and it blends magnificently what i really admired about the love story between ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas was how passionate how obsessive how enchanting it was shown on screen usually in love stories such as minghellas later cold mountain 2003 the romantic elements seem far more lustful than obsessive to me some of the love scenes feature elements that may tend to be associated more with lust than love but still because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of proportion we can believe that there is a sure true love between these characters it reminded me a lot of vertigo 1958 in how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love with each otherbr br performances all around were great i was especially enthralled by the performance by juliette binoche who took home the oscar for her performance the following year i also liked willem dafoe playing the sort of cynical questionable character that hes always quintessential at playing and of course i cant leave out fiennes and scott thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate loversbr br despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic i would be dishonest if i were to describe it as a perfect film there are two flaws that i cannot glance over number one it is a little too long and the reason for this is my second complaint there are a few unnecessary subplots i was not enchanted or particularly interested with the second love story between binoche and a bomb specialist played by naveen andrews my research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book and im sure it worked perfectly in there but in the film it just seems a littledistracting and the relationship between the two characters didnt fascinate me i was far more interested by fiennes character and his relationships with his two leading actressesbr br nevertheless these two flaws are easily forgivable even if they do slow things down a bit those put aside the english patient is an extraordinary achievement of filmmaking to me it was sort of like an insane mix up between casablanca 1942 and lawrence of arabia 1962 two remarkable and better films and this effective blend proved to be well worth my time it is a real shame that anthony minghella has left us for he was a truly gifted filmmaker this is all the evidence anybody needs
