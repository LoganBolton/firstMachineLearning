i watched this movie when it was released and being really young and not too much into cinema it was one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences i ever had and it really left a mark inside meat first i didnt quite understand the story and probably failed to make the necessary correlations between past and present as the movie presents them to the viewerbr br years after i first watched i managed to watch it again and this was the time that i fell in love with the english patient it touched me so deeply and for me it became the best film ever madebr br anthony minghella made an absolutely stunning film all the locations are amazing and through his camera he manages to create unbelievable emotions inside youbr br of course the music of the film is such a big part of the whole emotional journey of the characters and the film would not be the same without itbr br but personally the best thing was the fragile performance that ralph fiennes gave in this masterpiece he plays so well the man that falls in love slowly but so deeply with katherine cliftonopens up his heart and dives into this prohibited affairbr br the most heartbreaking scene for me will always be the one where hurt katherine is carried by almasy towards the cave of swimmers and she wears the thimble that he bought hershe says i always wore iti always loved you and at that moment he starts crying with such pain flowing from inside himbr br juliette binoche is also amazing in her performance and really deserved the oscar she wonbr br overall this is a film that anybody who proclaims himself a cinema lover should watch in their lives
