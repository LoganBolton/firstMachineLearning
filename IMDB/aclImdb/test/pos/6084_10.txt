i wont go to a generalization and say its the best love story of all time as some have said thats fine people feel very deeply about this film you either love it i believeor you simply hate it i dont want to say the best of allbecause that is simply too broad for me to make a statement like that however i feel very passionately about the english patient as well as millions of other people do br br the awards say it all br br i dont agree with critics on many levels however the ones that picked this one i couldnt agree morebr br 9oscars br br 41winsbr br 37other nominations makes this love storyon the top of the bunch br br from the director anthony minghella the story that bursts onto the screen and as mr peterman from tvs seinfeld said elaine i simply cant take my eyes off of it in this instance i dont agree with elaines response but the story builds and takes the right time needed to make its case beautifully the cinematographyjohn seale won multiple awards as well as it ought too i have not really paid much attention to juliette binoche until now well not entirely true i loved her performance in sabrina lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship next to harrison ford but this was simply an incredibly differing character for her and as deeply talented as she is she simply shined in her own subtle and graceful way she was just what this film was looking for im truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress ralph fiennes was also spectacular in portraying count laszlo de almasy i had a new respect for his ability after seeing this one what can you say except see this picture again
