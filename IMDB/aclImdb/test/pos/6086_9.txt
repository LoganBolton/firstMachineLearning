it is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see the english patient again after anthony minghellas death most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point the endless moral struggle of those who consciously walk a very thin line in the talented mr ripley minghella moves away from patricia highsmiths amoral tom ripley to give the murderer a conscience in breaking and entering minghella gives jude laws character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving here in the english patient the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt ralph finnes and kristin scott thomas are extraordinary they strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us the audience juliette binoche is quite simply spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful naveen andrews are filled with a minghellian sensual innocence anthony minghella gave us films that wereone way or another that elusive mix of art and commerce he was true to himself but thought about his audience he knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own there is something clear honest and startling about minghellas opus i miss him already but im grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind
