this must be one of the funniest danish movies ever made ulrich thomsen and thomas bo larsen are hilarious as they drive across sweden i dont know how ulrich thomsen does it but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way but if you dont understand danish i am not referring to your pastry here dont waste your time on this Â– i dont think it would work with subtitles
