this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it is about true love and friendship about turning your life around and doing something good for someone else thomas bo larsen may play the same role he has done in so many other movies but recently we have seen him in other roles which he does great too but so what if he plays the same role that he has done in other movies  hes perfect for that role ulrich thomsen does a great job too these two criminal lowlifes are the best friends ever they share everything and they do everything for each other no matter what the costs are when they find out that peters daughter is being abused they put everything on hold things you cant put on hold unless you have to make even more criminal acts and takes her to a better place they do the best they can  these two men are not masterminds but they have their heart in the right place all i can say is that peter and carsten are my biggest heroes too
