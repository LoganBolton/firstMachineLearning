boasting the title for the sickest film ever made pink flamingos is an undisputed classic sure the camerawork is shaky and offcenter the story is muddled and slowpaced and every single character in the movie is repugnant and despicable but pink flamingos has a certain playful charm and brilliant satiric wit that no other movie can matchbr br while this film is indeed an offensive one reading descriptions of what goes on in the movie is much worse than actually seeing it only john waters can succeed in making rape murder sadism cannibalism coprophagia and just about every other form of human debauchery known to man seem absolutely hilarious this movie must be seen to be believed
