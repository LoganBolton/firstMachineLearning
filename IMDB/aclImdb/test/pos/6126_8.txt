whats there to say about pink flamingos it is beyond criticism or even explanation because it doesnt really aspire to be like any other movie youve seen you will either get it or you wont laugh at it or roll your eyes in disgust or both john waters is an odd filmmaker putting that mildly mixing both innocent childlike humor with shockingly offensive moments intended towell who knows what his intentions were it is like a form of assault albeit a funny onebr br the thing that makes waterss humor so infectious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that can seem both alien and completely familiar to the viewer like the petty rivalries that form the plot of pink flamingos surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point but almost certainly the matter at stake was not the title of the filthiest person alive what makes the movie compelling viewing for me is the way that waters creates giddy selfcontained environments and doesnt let you in on the joke right away the people in his films are completely in tune with one another for instance when cotton tells babs that she doesnt want to accompany her into town because crackers is bringing his lady friend out to the trailer babs reacts with a knowing smirk and says to her in a conspiratorial aside that little sheds just perfect at this point we do not know yet that crackers plans to take his lady friend out to the shed to thrust live chickens at her naked body while cotton watches orgasmically through a window but this weirdness is totally commonplace and understood by the characters in the fictitiously degenerate world that waters createsbr br another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and channing the marbles deviant butler the first time we see them waters cuts jarringly from a scene in connies cozy office to channing descending into the basement where we see that there are two women down there one dead and one very much alive and ped off susan is not a cowering victim but is enraged and abusive to channing leaping up to launch a fullscale verbal attack on her jailer they both have a weird understanding of the bizarre situation and she is not so much intimidated by her kidnapping as she is violently insulted and righteously furious she does not let up for one second while channing is in her sight and the two scenes that feature their delirious banter are two of the comic highlights of the film later in the film when divine and crackers break into the marbless home and discover their crimes of keeping abducted women in their basement it represents the total lack of support that divine and her family have for the brand of depravity that the marbles are panderinghere is something divine is unfamiliar with a corruption devised by her newfound rivals and she despises it furthermore while kidnapping does not seem like something divine would think twice about she is indignant that the girls are being held down there and happily sets them free relishing the revenge that they take on channingbr br at the other end of the filth spectrum waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the real world the first time we see connie she is belittling a minor character named sandy sandstone who has never heard of divine cookie on the other hand reacts with a hilariously matteroffact evaluation of divines title as the filthiest person alive revealing that she inhabits this world of unspoken and understood lunacy as wellbr br something also must be said for the way the players are in touch with their respective roles especially divine who doesnt miss a note not once does he falter in the ridiculous garb and character hes been given and it takes pink flamingos to a new level or weirdness people actually believed divine was like this in real life and its easy to understand why because while watching the movie youre not really thinking about the movie youre thinking about these people who made it since theyre really doing the outrageous things in the script you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentarybr br but even more so pink flamingos is not so much a movie as it is an event or something that happens to you even though its shock value is mostly gone for me now i say mostly because the ahole scene and the chicken scene still make me wince i still find this film to be hilarious and habitforming
