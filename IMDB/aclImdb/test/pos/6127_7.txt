a very strange disturbing but intriguing film i dont think i ever needed to see what a human being can do with his butt and i doubt if ill ever want to see it again that said there is much to be amused by like divines take on jayne mansfields classic walk in the girl cant help it and putting slabs of meat between her legs in a grocery store a gritty feel very much like a russ meyer film generally poor acting with the notable exception of divine
