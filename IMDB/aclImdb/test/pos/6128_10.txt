my 1010 rating of course applies only if youre willing to get completely and utterly grossed out because you know that only john waters can do that in pink flamingos his directorial debut he portrays two families locked in combat to see who can be the filthiest person alive what divine famously does at the end pretty much answers the question but even aside from that the movie is basically an excuse to shock people beyond what anyone would usually imagine you had better have a very strong stomach to watch this movie even some of the lines are rather mindblowingbr br otherwise avoid this movie like you would the ebola virus
