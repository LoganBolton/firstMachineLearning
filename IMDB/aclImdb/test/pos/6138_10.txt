i watched this on tv in 1989 and regretted not taping it i was very intriguing and suspenseful it is amazing as the events unfold and this mans past catches up with himbr br the acting is first rate and the story is exactly what the title claims twist of fate but no one could run away from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie
