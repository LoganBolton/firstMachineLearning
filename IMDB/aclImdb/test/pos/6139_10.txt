william m thackeray once said a good laugh is sunshine in the house when i watched take away i must say that the sun did shine in my house this film was superb the opening was very cleverly done the story held together well in a nutshell two fishn chip shop owners who normally enemies are forced to form an alliance of sorts to engage in a david and goliath struggle against a fast food chain which builds a restaurant on their street the ending was hilarious even though i have found many who disagree with me on that onebr br the film was though very discreetly portraying contemporary australian ethnic stereotypes in particular the collision or culture clash if you will between the traditional anglo australian and italo australian stereotypes and how they found a sort of unity though adversity very nicebr br i found vince colosimos performance as tony stilano an italoaustralian fish n chip shop owner in his thirties to be firstclass his acting was very genuine and convincing through his performance he managed to really bring to the surface the essence or i should say the soul of the italian australian stereotype which in reality is not too italian but not too australian either colosimo found that balance breathed into its lungs and gave it lifebr br the cinematography could have been better more shots of the local area wouldve been nice from what i can see it was in melbourne but where in melbourne to me it looks like somewhere between ivanhoe to bullen though i am not 100 sure on that onebr br i dont know why so many people are comparing this film to the castle though they have similar themes running through them take away stands in a league of its ownbr br i think the film was excellent with a capital e it has everything its funny the jokes are great it deals with contemporary issues facing australian society the story holds well i loved it i highly recommend it
