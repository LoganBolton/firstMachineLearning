i hadnt planned on seeing this movie however i wasnt disappointed when a friend dragged me along although there are no real surprises here the guys do reasonably well with their obviously modest budgetbr br if youve seen the trailer you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and theres a pretty constant stream of jokes here with a couple of classic moments with the highpoint probably being an excellent flashback to what the guys were like in the 1980s also ive read elsewhere that the ending was a disappointment but i found it refreshingly different from what i had expected from this genrebr br overall this movie wont change your life but its got enough laughs there to keep you entertained throughout
