though several scenes of wirey spindell can be described as over the top i thought that it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of neartaboo twisted comedybr br wirey spindell is a great film with great dialog i wouldnt say that this film is for everyone but the film is on my top 10 listbr br if you can look beyond its occasional offensiveness and watch it for the film that it is i would hope you could see it in the same light that i do
