i like the earlier description of this movie as a life poem i caught this totally at random on the movie channel last night and was captivated enough to stick with it the whole way theres really just a toally unique voice to the film a poetry of narration thats meaningful without straying into pretension theres also many hilarious moments from wireys middleschool days that are crude without being potty humor its sad that this movie is so lowrated the fact that there are so many 1s makes me think the numbers are cooked i cant see how anyone could see the movie as that abysmal sure this is by no means a typical romantic comedy but it is a very unique viewpoint of a very unique life of a man whose very appeal comes from his detachment a detachment he must overcome before it destroys him give this flick a chance it came out of nowhere for me and i feel the richer for it
