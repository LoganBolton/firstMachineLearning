as i watched wirey spindell i couldnt but laugh at what was taking place on screen wirey sure got a lot of play from both boys and women but i was confused as to why the actor that played wirey in hs was 10 years old then the actor changed age to like 20 to play wirey when he was a senior in hsbut whatever i thought it was funny
