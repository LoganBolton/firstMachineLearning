i disagree with the imdbcom synopsis that this is about a bisexual guy preparing to get married its more about all the crap we go through  selfinduced and because of our parents  that we have to get over when we grow up like the linda mccarriston poem says childhood is the barrel they throw you over the falls in this movie is much more like a narrative poem its about life and the mistakes we make and hurt we inflict and experience over the years and how in the end its all about love im not trying to be hypersensitive or schmoopy and finding and being with one special person
