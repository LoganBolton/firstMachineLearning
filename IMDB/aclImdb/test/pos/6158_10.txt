along with having minor flaws to it this film is a masterpiece and most definitely the best war film ive seen not the mention its one of the best films ive seen in all genres i might have written this for no mans land before but now i think this ones better its very sad in the ending and i almost cried after the two shocking scenes that came within 5 minutes close to the films final br br karels performance as the main character was fascinating although hes supposed to be a rookie considering his age this film makes you think a lot makes you cry or at least gets you close to it and makes you hate any kind of war and political bs the flashbacks to the prisonhospital make the film even more delicious br br one tiny flaw about the film is the nonbritish accents of supposedly british people most of the british people on screen were actually british but how about the ones who are supposed to be british and speak with a foreign accent that really didnt fit into this adorable film but its pretty much the only flaw ive noticed effects could also be a bit better but then again we all remember many films from one particular land that have tremendous fx and absolutely nothing else br br briefly this film is a total masterpiece and every single individual should see it if you want to travel to the czechoslovakia of 40s and if you want to virtually witness a tremendous amount of emotions at once this film is for you if you dont want to do those this film will make you want to do so
