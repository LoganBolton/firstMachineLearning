this is such a beautiful movie not only does it portray war it also has friendship  love the life of slama is filled with sadness every aspect of his life fell apart i can only imagine how he would feel when his friend make the ultimate sacrificebr br i see a slight similarity to pearl harbor which is also about two pilots falling in love with the same woman however this film is much better made because this does not portray the woman to be unfaithful  easygoing the friendship between the two men is also much more convincing  well builtup i definitely recommend this movie to all people
