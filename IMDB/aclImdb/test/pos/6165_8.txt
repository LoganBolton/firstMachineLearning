compared to battle of britain this is a real film with real characters and a real plot battle of britain is basically a documentary with the occasional lawrence olivier and michael caine but the real protagonists are the spits the hurricanes etc here on the other hand you have two wellwrought characters actually three and a real plot i strongly recommend it to anybody even to those who are not particularly fond of war movies its well filmed and i wonder what the director might do if he had the big capitals behind him and i do not think that its oversentimental its only that in the fighters you have real people with real feelings and a real lifeas real as any fictional life in any great film
