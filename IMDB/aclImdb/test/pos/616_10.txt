im just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur ozon ive seen only 4 films so far and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions not a single nonlonely female character out of 12 and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundingsbr br this film is probably the only one out of four where this impact is for goodbr br the gay theme is an almost standard part of background for ozons films so it doesnt grab the accent although the looks of the characters might watch for the feelings not for their objectsbr br very nice and fleeting truly like a summer romance and while being a relaxation to thought and mind it gives some food for the soul
