im czech and soldiers not only pilots who escaped czechoslovakia after nazis invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad are true heroes and bravest men in our history for me this movie from director of academy award winner kolya 1996 is a tribute to these men its first bigscreen movie about czechoslovak wwii soldiers since nebesti jezdci 1968 i think dark blue world is a good movie  good acting good special effects nice music etc movie is half in english and some actors are britons but greatest thing about this movie is its pure existence its great chance to show people all around the world and to many people in czech republic too that czechoslovak role in wwii was not only as occupied country but as an active member of allied campaignbr br leading characters are older and wiser frantisek and young karel they escaped together from czechoslovakia they are flying in the same squadron and they fell in love with the same woman maybe its a clich√© but fortunately this storyline is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes including great dogfights i dont want to compare dark blue world with pearl harbor someone will like ph more and someone will like dbw but if you like happy ends dbw is not for you so i think its very good movie for everyone who likes this type of stories and very good movie who wants to get to know something about this chapter of czechoslovak historybr br btw main theme dark blue world is from czech 30s and 40s composer jaroslav jezek he wrote this theme when he lost his eyes
