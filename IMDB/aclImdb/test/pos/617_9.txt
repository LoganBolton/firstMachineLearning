this is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind one knows its going to about a mute one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentimentbr br well forget it the movie starts with a little black humour and then gets started from then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of moscow all right it must be said the unexpected twists are expected and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder but this movie doesnt let you gobr br its like the old gangster movies but then without any glamour at all and in russia and thats one of the most important aspects of this movie its situated in russia this does have a great impact on the movie according to me it makes it better everything becomes simple and basic life is without nonsense this could be a great potential for more movies in the future gangster movies about the russian mafiabr br it is a beautifull and terrifying movie its horror but you cant feel but sympathy for the little mute one last advice dont look this too late in the evening if you want to sleep well
