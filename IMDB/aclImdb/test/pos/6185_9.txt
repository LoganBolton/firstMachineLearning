ernst lubitsch gave us wonderful films like design for living ninotchka the shop around the corner to be or not to be and other wonderful films but people usually put bluebeards eighth wife as one of lubitschs weakest filmsbr br but i consider this film as an important film this film began the collaboration of charles brackett and billy wilder charles brackett billy wilder and walter reisch wrote the screenplay for ernst lubitschs ninotchka of course lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process after that charles brackett and billy wilder worked together they together wrote the screenplay for famous films like the lost weekend and sunset blvdbr br there are lots of funny moments in the film i thought the taming of the shrew was very funny there is a famous expression called films are slices of life and here is a great example from bluebeards eighth wife 1938br br at the first session of the scripting process lubitsch posed this question how do the boy and girl get together billy wilder promptly suggested that the opening scene should be the mens shop of a department store the boy is trying to buy a pajama he extemporized glibly but he sleeps only in the tops he is thrifty so he insists on buying only the tops the clerk says he must buy the pants too it looks like a catastrophe then the girl comes into the shop and buys the pants because she sleeps only in the pants ernst lubitsch and charles brackett were enchanted it wasnt till months later they discovered that billy wilder himself is a topsonly sleeper and that he had been nursing the idea for months waiting for a chance to use itbr br i got this information from a book i think this film can be considered as the return of ernst lubitsch right after this film he made wonderful films like ninotchka the shop around the corner and to be or not to bebr br i thought gary coopers performance was good i think lubitsch casted gary cooper probably because gary cooper played long fellow deeds who inherited the fortune in frank capras mr deeds goes to town but this is just my opinionbr br as for me i highly enjoyed the film i rate this film 9 out of 10 lubitsch films are different because his films are slices of life
