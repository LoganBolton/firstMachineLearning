years before prenuptial agreements became a regular thing ernest lubitsch made a screen comedy on which they are the basis bluebeards eighth wife involves gary cooper as a multimillionaire living on the french riviera whos been married seven times and now marries claudette colbert for number eight but coopers a good sport about it he always settles with his exwives for a 5000000 a year as per an agreement they sign before marrying him sounds like what we now call a prenuptial agreementbr br of course claudette wants a lot more than that and she feels cooper takes an entirely too business like approach to marriage shed like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable lengths to get itbr br bluebeards eighth wife has some really funny moments the original meeting of cooper and colbert in a mens store where cooper is insisting he wants only pajama tops and colbert looking for only bottoms and of course my favorite is colbert trailing and blackmailing the detective cooper sends to spy on her herman bing has the best supporting role in the film as that selfsame flustered detectivebr br ive often wondered how back in the day hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are nonfrench in a film like this of course cooper is an american and colbert of the cast is the only one actually of french background though david niven is charming as always having him be a frenchman is ludicrous he is sooooooo britishbr br nevertheless bluebeards eighth wife is an enjoyable film and a great example of what was called the lubitsch touch back in the day
