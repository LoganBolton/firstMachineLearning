first half of the movie scared the hell out of me and normally im not easy to scare but second half of this thriller didnt work quite a well but still very scary a good thriller than use simple ways to make good horror lowbudget set in russia unknown cast and made in europe but still great fun and yes there is a few laughs throw in for good matters as well
