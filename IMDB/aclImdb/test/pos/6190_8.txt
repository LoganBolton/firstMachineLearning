to be completely honest i completely intrigued by the original concept of sleeper cell having watched the best part of the series on fx channel uk my sky got broke meaning i missed the crucial finale but what i did see of it i assumed it to be a great story line good acting and as i dont watch 24 i thought it was great and its been confirmed for a second seasonbr br one of the best tv programs i have seen much more realistic and believable than 24 excellent character development and plot line does not bash islam but gives a thoughtful and considered approach showing the difference between radical terrorist islam and true islam everybody should see this showbr br stringy xx
