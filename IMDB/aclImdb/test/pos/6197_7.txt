if you watch this series you will get an interesting 10 chapters about a sleeper cells story and each characters and more intense with a fbis infiltratebr br nice story nice characters and performs but something is wrong for me of course the final is wrong you wait ten chapters hoping a great final it doesnt matters if they fulfill its objectives or not but well i think is not enough its a small final for a big series also i hoped more definitions about characters storiesbr br but i repeat its and interesting miniseries if you dont want to wait with large series 2224 chapters watch it i give 7 of 10
