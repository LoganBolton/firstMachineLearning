be warned of possible spoilersbr br a friend told me to check out this series and im glad i took her words for itbr br i read the synopsis on the dvd cover and i was immediately intrigued the main protagonist is muslim no way this is a first its about an fbi agent who is under deep cover to penetrate a possible sleeper cell in la and get this  he is a practicing muslim i was a little skeptical at first halfexpecting some hero or the antagonist to spout maybe silly gratuitous and mindless holierthanthou fanatic drivels lets face it a lot of shows have been guilty of thisbr br but then i watched the first three episodes and i thought okay this is good it wasnt until episode four scholar when i was well and truly impressed i would like to commend on the great writing and also superb performances from the actors i just love how complex every one of these characters  theyre not straight out twodimensional cardboard cutout good guysbad guys michael ealy gives a wonderful and believable performance as the muslim fbi agent darwyn alsayeed treading the fine line between being the good muslim and being a man with flaws oded fehr gives his character farik an interesting depth  farik is not the typical oily middle eastern stereotype but simply someone who truly believes in his cause and doesnt see himself as a fanatic but a man willing to do whatever extreme measures to justify his beliefs hes very charismatic and authoritative but i would say that it was alex nesics performance that clearly left an impression in me in scholar his portrayal of his characters emotional struggle was amazing  torn between the softly spoken words of a muslim scholar encouraging him to return to the nonaggressive way because it is the only acceptable way in gods eye and fariks persuasion to believe otherwisebr br im looking forward to watch more shows like this and not some ridiculously highoctane one man show series its clever and openminded
