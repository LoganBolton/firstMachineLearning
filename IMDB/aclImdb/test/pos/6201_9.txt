i dont understand why this show didnt go on there couldve been various ways to continue on the line of darwin and farik after season 2 obviously darwin couldnt have been the uc agent infiltrating cells and sabotageing them from the inside but still they shouldve given this show at least another seasonbr br the show is well casted believable and views the islamic religion from both the normal and the extremist point of view it touches controversial subjects in detail and it has a dramatic meaning that can be said of very few shows nowdays im actually sad that i didnt know about this show until late 2007
