i watched sleeper cell with a bit of trepidation worrying over whether the terrorists would be glorified this mesmerizing series not only handled the subject matter responsibly it created depth and substance to almost every character oded fehr just gobbles up the screen in every scene hes inand even though his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell he still has hypnotic appeal michael ealy held his own well though in some scenes i wondered why he wasnt shot on the spot because of the scowl he wore on his facebr br the pros of the series are the two leads fehr and ealy the well written charactersall of which were believable and tragic and the disconcerting issues addressed in the story having been married to a muslim myself the atmosphere created was quite realistic the cons for me personally were that the female ta was overkillmost seemed gratuitous as well as some of the sex scenes despite that it is a raw gripping series that will make you think somebody give fehr more juicy roles like this one and let him run with it hes got incredible screen presence and a strange kind of innate power emanating off him
