mute witness is a modest yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves the film  written and directed entirely by anthony waller  is a tense actionpacked thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences no pointless mumbojumbo or endless plottwistsjust straight to the point mystery mute witness handles about the vicious topic of snuffmovies and is effectively set in russia  spoilers  since the production costs are cheaper there a us film crew temporarily moves to russia for shooting a horror film an old hangar is used as film location the female makeup artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuffmovie shes caught and tries to escape but since shes a mute she cant cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly the girls life is in real danger now since theres a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they dont want the witnesses to be alive  end spoilers  mute witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end regarding the similar topic id say its definitely better than the more famous 8 mm directed by joel schumacher and starring nicolas cage the acting in mute witness isnt great but the leading actress whos russian herself looks really cute sir alec guinness makes a special appearance too and a very cool one i may say surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares
