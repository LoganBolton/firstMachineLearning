i suppose it depends on when one actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it isbr br i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it such was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality when shows like search ufo and 6m man were showing a child of 12 of what the world could hold in their future adventure and technologybr br you got to see shows only once and that was when the network aired them the only way people could slash your shows was by making their own parody of it they didnt get to take your show and add in their own comments over itbr br i did not know what this concept of a pilot was i saw the movie and was hoping thru out that stryker would get home did not know that there was a possibility of it continuing beyond two hoursbr br back then would i understood what so many people hate about the movie now i doubt it because i dont remember it as such do i understand now not really for to understand the story one must not see it from their perspective but rather from that of the characters in the moviebr br if one is watching as an american it might be humorous about the lack of security in a police statebut if one is a subject in that state then compliance could be expected and security can be less when things are suppose to be perfect perfect to an extreme degree perfect that one is not suppose to doubt then one is not likely to question as quickly when things are out of orderbr br the subplots of the movie are interesting such as the old man who remembers the time before but watches his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere or that the police state values knowledge to some extent for they are careful about how they control or harm their brain powerbr br these days one is likely to know exactly what the movie is about before they see it so much of the suspense surprise is lost but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr one gets quite a distance into the movie before it becomes apparent that such a possibility is the least of his concernsbr br this is the primary difference between the stranger and doppelganger the latter can be considered timeless since any comments it has about the ussr are comparatively minor and lost early on in the movie in the former those links are through out the movie supposedly directly in the beginning and then as a theme variation after wardsbr br all that said despite my fond memory for the movie it is rather easy to see that it would not have made it as a series each week stryker would make friends benedict would chase stryker would get away eventually benedicts society would get rid of him someone else would pick up the chase a rut would develop there might be a jab at something new such as perhaps another crew member from strykers mission showing up but it probably would not be enough to keep the show goingbr br if one goes in with the knives that others have used to slash the movie odds are they will slash it as well but if one remembers that this was made during the cold war and what fears and estimations of the other side were during that time of what the popular environment contained for the viewer then they may find some entertaining and intellectual themes in it
