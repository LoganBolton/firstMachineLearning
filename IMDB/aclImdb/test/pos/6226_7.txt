tourist trap 1979 is an entertaining horror movie from the late 70s the movie is about a bunch of young friends who get stranded on an old deserted lane by a creepy old waxwork museumbr br the owner of the museum seems like a strange but harmless old man but things take a very nasty turn when members of the young group start getting killed off who is responsible for the murders is it old man slausen or is it his collection of creepy mannequins who seem to be alive and hungry for blood this film was good stuff it was fast faced the performances were very good from the actorsactresses tanya roberts was very sexy and the film was never boring and like i say it had some very creepy scenes so be prepared to hide under the covers definitely recommended to horror movieghost story fans i give this film a highly respectable 72 out of 10
