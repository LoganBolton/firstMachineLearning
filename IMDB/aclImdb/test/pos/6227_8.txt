i have to admit thanks to this movie im now afraid of mannequins hahahabr br but yes first off the acting in this movie at least by my standard is pretty swell most of the actors are pretty decent in their roles the script also seems to be pretty good too sure some cheesy stuff in there but also some decently written character and some damn scary scenes i still get shivers thinking about that one scene with the dude and the mannequins brrrbr br yeah ill say you should check this movie out its pretty good and very entertaining a good watch 810
