tourist trap is among my favorite late 70searly 80s horror flicks a group of young people are heading somewhere one pair in the car ahead  that car has a flat and our film opens with the young man woody pushing the tire along looking for a service station he finds a seemingly abandoned place and yet hears voices and investigates and ends up with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts along comes the rest of the young folks in a vw thing and they pick up woodys girlfriend and find this very same place slausens oasis or some such thingand then mr slausen happens along while the girls are enjoying a dip in the stream of course the vw thing has mysteriously died at that point so odd mr slausen chuck connors offers his help mr slausen has a museum with lots of wax figures and he lives in the museum but behind is a big house where he says davey lives and who is davey why davey crockett he saysbut if it were davey crockett theyd all probably be safer the girls are left alone while slausen goes to help with fixing the car but of course curiosity gets the better of one  she goes to investigate and finds the house full of creepy mannequins and one rather animated one nameddavey what follows is a rather creepy night of terror as one by one theyre taken prisoner by davey who says hes slausens brother one girl kidnapped earlier is treated to a plaster facial which results in her death when it covers up her air supply at any rate theres somewhat of a twist to this and kind but weird mr slausen is not exactly what he appears to be a good creepy late 70s horror flick and lots of mannequins make for a very creepy atmosphere 7 out of 10
