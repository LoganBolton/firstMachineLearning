i really really liked this one i know its rampant with what are now clich√© plot lines and plenty of overacting but it was hell of a lot of funbr br in our quest for 70s and 80s horror cheese we come across many flicks that are so bad theyre good we also have some that are so good they suck and then we have some that are so bad they are just bad this is definitely so bad its goodbr br some teens traveling come across an oasis in the middle of nowhere a forgotten slice of roadside america and they decide to check it out they cross every line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay for it they pay dearlybr br i would not normally give a movie like this a 9 but the girls in this one are the type that we miss from the 1970s ditzy scantilyclad and fit these arent the anorexic broads from todays horrible horror they look awesome in booty shortsbr br i give it a 9 out of 10 kids
