this is a bizarre oddity directed by the guy who edited the texas chainsaw massacre chuck conners gives a hilariously overthetop performance as the owner of a roadside wax museum which our doomed teenagers happen to break down near the wax figures look so real one of the teens points out heh heh hehnot so much a slasher film as a weird mix of psychological horror and old fashioned house of waxstyle terror i can think of many many horror films that are worse than this one
