like one of the other reviewers might have been  amazon i was first introduced to tourist trap by the beloved decrepit old wor9 in ny around january 1983 devil dog the hound of hell which id been waiting to see since it debuted on halloween 1978 had just ended and i thought id had my horror fill for the day quit laughing  that three eyed borgost sp monster ike eisenmann draws up in his room is scarybr br for as much as i still enjoy richard crenna wearing his madefortv horror hat it was the first 10 minutes of tourist trap following devil dog that day that really left a mark  and months later it ended up being the first movie i ever taped off tv wor used to play this fairly frequently often as the saturday afternoon million dollar movie as others have observed its one of those offerings that delivers a powerful horror punch up front a veritable left hook  and then practically starts over with the rest of the cast dances and jabs putting the opening scene a larger context along the way then moves on to the real climax see night of the living dead re animatorbr br two paragraphs and i havent mentioned a single mannequin face it  the damn things are scary enough without the music and the script i too can remember some scary dress dummies and the like in various relatives attics and basements and say what you like about how relatively straightforward schmoeller and carrolls approach is  no one before or since has played it this well in real life a good mannequin will make you do a double take  and here thats about the last thing youre likely to see if you happen to be stuck at slausens defunct wax museum and roadside stand yes there is a point i loved her very much where chuck slausen connors is trying to pass for vincent price yes the plot might have taken up all of a paragraph in the early stages i cant see the script being all that thick it doesnt matter from direction to competent acting meryl streeps emphatically not in attendance and here that helps instead of hinders to another useful and effective pino dinaggio score see carrie and various other de palma movies to various lighting film stock use of varying sound levels  i could go on  every element of this low budget production comes together and you get a work very much greater than the sum of its partsbr br did i mention its scary as hell stephen king talked this movie up in danse macabre a year or so after its release and with good reason like much of his work it may not be great art but it sure does tell a scary story and does it well the rest of the cast may be relatively unknown wasnt jocelyn jones in that texas car chase movie as well but chuck connors and tanya roberts were and are just familiar enough to audiences to make you think  stephen king style  that this could happen to you or people you knowbr br comparisons to psycho plot and the texas chainsaw massacre overall look and feel even if they arent the first associations in my mind are valid i only wish i could comment on the dvd which i look forward to buying as tourist trap has become notoriously hard to find on video since the nearcomplete extinction of independent video rental outlets where it had a home aside from wor and cable in the 1980s though tmcshowtime appear to have picked it up and play it regularly now no no spoilers here im afraid no plot breakdown  go see it yourself all right there may be a tiny little one below so scroll away if you like  better safe than sorry the mannequins are damn scary and id rather show than tell  br br for the record tourist trap is also chock full of great lines from we are going to have a party how do i look huh how do i look to youre so pretty you cant hurt me i shouldnt have to hide it  it feels good listen for that vincent price inflection again there the inevitable youre crazy delivered at the right moment and in the right tone  and try  just try  to keep the hair on your arms down when you hear the mannequins head screaming molly  especially once you realize whose head it used to be  br br p s  charles band was the producer on this i believe and likely owned the rights to dinaggios music band from what i understand was the brains behind full moon entertainment which might explain both the musics subsequent use in puppet master and well the 40 commercial approach has characterized full moon throughout from the enjoyable puppet master and subspecies franchises to uhhh  trancers and bad channels sorry boc
