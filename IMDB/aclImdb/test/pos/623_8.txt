superbly crafted lowbudget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at and plenty of ghoulish humour along the way as wellbr br the cast play it very well although richards selfcentered movie director is a bit hard to take at times the tiny twoscene cameo by sir alec guinness oozing menace as the crime czar of moscow is simply the icing on the cakebr br well worth repeated viewing but not on dark nights when youre all alone
