dont you just hate them slashers that never seem to get started it sometimes takes them a full hour of lame red herrings before some real action takes place tourist trap isnt like that if its typically gruesome slashing you wantthan its typically gruesome slashing youll get plenty of it and constantly from start to finish this movie contains what is probably the greatest opening sequence in 80s horror cinema when a teenager on a stroll after engine trouble is trapped in a deserted house and assaulted by a creepy collection of wax statues four other lambs to the slaughter arrive at the house and encounter an utterly insane maniac that looks somewhat like a mixture of leatherface from texas chainsaw massacre and one of those mad sculptors from old waxmuseum movies tourist trap is exciting horror entertainment with some genuine suspense grisly images ultimate weirdness morbid humor and terrific makeup effects the plot twists arent always original and the acting is pretty lousy but seriously who cares the fast pacing and the groovy killericon caused this tourist trap to earn a spot amongst my 5 favorite slashers a bit surprising is the total lack of nudity though too bad because all the girls look ravishing and after only 10 minutes the obligatory line who needs a bathingsuit is spoken
