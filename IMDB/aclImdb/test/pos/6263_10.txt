a lovely little film about the introduction of motion pictures to china captures the amazement of films first audiences pretty much as its described to have been worldwide and uses actual lumiere films for most of the actualities i dont agree with other people about bad acting on the british fellows part  i thought he was fine but the chinese lead really stole the show in any case i found myself with a smile on my face through most of the movie people who fear subtitles might note that a lot of the film is in english which for some reason is given subtitles as well as the chinese on the dvd
