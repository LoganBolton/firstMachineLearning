miles okeeffe once again assumes the role of the mighty ator in this the first sequel to the original filmbr br what can i say  this pretty much represents bmovie nirvana br br the plot is ludicrous the script is terrible the acting is hammy throughout the special effectswell lets not even go there  all in all this movie is a veritable delight br br highlights of the film include ator and thong his mute companion not his undergarments being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave certainly saved on the fx budget there ator battling what has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid and of course the infamous hangliding scene br br theres one question i have thoughat the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when ator supposedly destroys the geometric nucleus as the narrator tells ushow in the hell did ator destroy it and manage get out alive did he fashion some form of primitive timerdetonator or something br br oh well such an illogical ending really only adds to the movies overall charm  they just dont make them like this anymore
