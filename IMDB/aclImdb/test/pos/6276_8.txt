the jazz singer is one of a number of films made in the late 1940s and 1950 about the jewish experience in the united states other than crossfire1947 and gentlemans agreement1947 which dealt with antisemitism they usually had a musicaltheatre background these films included the jolson story1946 jolson sings again1949 the eddy duchin story1951 the eddie cantor story1953the benny goodman story1956 and margorie morningstar1958 the leading actors in these jewish films were always played by nonjews for example larry parks a nonjew played al jolson and gene kelly played noel airman in marjorie morningstar this casting was probably done to make the jewish theme palpable to a mainly nonjewish audience the jazz singer1952 is no different danny thomas was a devout catholic and peggy lee was certainly not jewish although she plays a nonpracticing jewess in the film the clue to her background is when she attends the goldings family meal before entering she says i havent been to a sader passover service since i left homebr br the film is about a cantors son who has just left the service after seeing action in korea his dilemma is whether to become a cantor a family tradition or to be a singer in musical theatre his choice of theatre leads to an inevitable conflict with his fatherbr br however there is much more to this film than this this film was made after the rosenberg trial during the mccarthy whitchhunts and the hollywood blacklist therefore in this film the jews are shown as good loyal citizens andbr br are quintessentialy american the synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice the cantors friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is a major league umpire the synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and george washington is said to have visited therefore jews are presented as part and parcel of american society nobody in this film has a eastern european accent peggy lee appeared in very few feature films in this film you get to see her sing lover and just one of those things wonderful danny thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings the part very well the comedic routines could have been left out yes the film is schmaltzy and sentimental but it is well worth seeing i enjoyed it very much
