by 1952 hollywood decided to remake the al jolson firsttalking classicbr br this time the cantors son was played by danny thomas coming home from the army it is expected that he follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives by becoming a cantor however young mr golding has quite a zest for show businessbr br at this time he meets peggy lee an aspiring singer she acts very well and her rendition of her favorite song lover is remarkable the film writers were smart not to plug the obvious jewish guy and nonjewish girlfriend relationship if anything this is glossed over in his anger for betraying his pledge to become a cantor his father makes the traditional jewish sign indicative of a loss in the family this would not be done under circumstances of breaking a pledge it would be done if among the orthodox an interfaith marriage would take placebr br thomas does a really good job of playing the cantors son his singing is up to par as the film ends on a positive notebr br am surprised that technical advisers did not realize that women do not carry pocketbooks into synagogue on the sabbath or at all during that period
