ive waited 9 years to watch this film simply because i never saw it advertised on tv eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait its much better than your overhyped scream or last summer garbage because its all at a fairly quick pace with no drawn out creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but dont let that put you off in any way what lies beneath  over hyped and crap mute witness  low budget not hyped at all and very good
