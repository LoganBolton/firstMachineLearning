this is the only pauly shore movie you should ever see ok its the only one ive ever seen and i think ive made good choices i normally find shores shtick kind of tired but he is very funny in this movie actually the script is pretty funny and shore doesnt overwhelm the other actors with his  what do you call it tomfoolery anyway this is a funny if ultimately forgettable film frink3
