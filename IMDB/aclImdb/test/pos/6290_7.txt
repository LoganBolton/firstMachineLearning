despite myself i really kinda like this movie pauley shore is invariably laughoutloud funny and here is no exception he is just excellent at playing the weirdo with a heart of goldbr br his performance in this although nothing out of the ordinary for him is so good it seems to lift other cast members performances perhaps this is because hes the kind of guy its easy to bounce off ofbr br the clich√©s about country life in this movie are hilarious and the way shores city boy crawl is so at odds with the way of life is funny too but its not only he whos a fish out of water comedy also comes from the fact that to any ordinary person or people crawl is a freakish nightmare of a person thats why this movie works in such a great way we love crawl hes a breath of fresh air but we can also sympathise with the warners he is one hell of a culture shockbr br although this movie is classic pauley shore so theres no great brain power needed to enjoy the movie enjoy it you do and theres even a never judge a book by its cover type moral here somewhere not bad not bad at all
