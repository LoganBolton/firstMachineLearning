i didnt expect much when i decided to watch this movie so i was surprised to find myself thoroughly enjoying it a couple of scenes had me laughing almost uncontrollably the characters were engaging no pun intended however the story is predictable the fun of it comes from watching crawl shores character a ditzyyetwise california dude a country college girl brings home for thanksgiving trying in his awkward yet endearing way to fit in to their lifestyle i was also surprised that in all this there was a message if you have a chance see this movie
