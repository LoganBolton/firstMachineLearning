i love it i love pauly shore it seems some people dont agree its humor and hes not like everyone else the movie is great i love the story line and most of the people in the movie its funny from the first time she meets him at school i like the fact that she chooses him over the guy back home i like that tiffani theissan isnt a bad girl in the end all the secrets are let out only the people you want to see are left in the end except for those of you who dont like pauly shore even if you dont like him there are funny parts and her family tortures him through most of the movie shes country girl gone wild and needs to be heard she finally makes it its got just the right amount of love and romance i give it an 8 out of 10
