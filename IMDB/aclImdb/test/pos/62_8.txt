fun entertaining movie about wwii german spy julie andrews falling in love with american pilot rock hudson while trying to get secrets from him for some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970i cant see why its beautifully shot has wonderful costumes and interiors and exciting aerial dogfights also it has andrews doing a striptease strictly pg material and singing a beautiful songwhistling in the dark the movie does have problems andrews and hudson did not get along during the shooting of thisand it shows their love scenes lack spark and they have zero sexual chemistry still they turn in ok performances the film is a little long even in the 105 min directors cut i saw and gets way too dark and serious at the end still worth catching try seeing the directors cutthe other one runs half an hour longer
