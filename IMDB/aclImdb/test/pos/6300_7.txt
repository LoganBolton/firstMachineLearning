the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into itbr br its hard to place this movie under one label its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesnt necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combinedbr br but just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and its more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie it doesnt make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute mustsee in parts the movie also feels as if its trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifullybr br it features some great camerawork and some unique storytelling which makes this an original as well as a great film to watchbr br 710
