i saw this interesting film back to back with the chinesefrench film 2046 at the recent dubai film festival both were intelligent works made the same year 20042005 both had the main characters living in a hotel in both films the hotel is more a metaphor of exile than a location both dealt with love between a man and a woman both had wonderful music and riveting performances what a coincidence and yet how the two films differ in treatment of the subject somewhere at the beginning of the film a man walking on a pavement turns to look at a woman and in doing so hits a lamp post the audience erupts into a volcano of laughter innocently but isnt that brief shot the synopsis of the film that entertains you for 2 hours while the film is a wonderful blend of black comedy eg using a stethoscope to listen to neighbors conversation the film builds on what buster keaton and jacques tati had introduced to cinema earlierstoic faces that leads to comedy quite in contrast to the equally intelligent world of robin williams or the heartwarming danny kaye a sudden frenzy of activity transforms an otherwise stoic character while moving money from the hotel to the bank is reminiscent of tatis worksbr br but the film is not mere comedy the antiautomation statement cash counting and the reaction of the bank staff to the statements relating to it the dummy that acts as an ineffectual warning to the speeding lady the reference to moulimix as the fictitious company he works for etc are several cues that the director is offering a loaded comedy to the viewer laugh yes but reflect on it and enjoy furtherbr br the movies strength lies in is brief staccato script by director paul sorrentino that offers comedy that is mixed with philosophy truth is boring dad is dead but nobody told him bad luck does not existit is the invention of the losers and the poor then the director goes on to provide you with a fascinating lecture from the main character on insomniacs you will not sleep through this lecturebr br sorrentino provides entertainment pegged to the subject the italians know bestthe mafia it is an existential mafia filmbr br since truth is boring the director provides a dessert as part of the fine meal of superb acting toni servillo good music clever camerawork luca bigazzi a beautiful enigmatic actress magnani granddaughter of the great anna and powerful script the dessert is for the viewer to figure out whether what preceded in the film was the truth it would have been boring if it was wouldnt it
