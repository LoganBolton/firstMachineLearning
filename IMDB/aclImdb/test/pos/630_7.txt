this is without doubt one of my favourite horror films ever i really cannot believe that it didnt gain much more popularity when it was released especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual wes craven sequels and copycat horrors mute witness has all the style suspense and quickfire plot twists of a hitchcockdepalma movie coupled with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot it never promises to be any more than a good popcornandhotdog movie but it is difficult not to just enjoy the film for what it isbr br the plot centres on billie hughes  a mute girl working on the set of a horror film being made in a russian factory by a series of events she finds herself accidentally locked in and stumbles on the filming of a snuff moviebr br one of the best things about the film is the lack of screaming that seems to invade every horror film ever made as the main character is mute she cannot make a noise  something which is a blessing at some stages of the movie and a curse in othersbr br the director seems to have studied his hitchcock very well even the opening scene is a tongueincheek nod to both hitchcocks psycho as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenesbr br while the acting can be hammy at times the whole film does hold it together not only throwing in a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat but a few neat little questions about how the film is going to endbr br all in all a hugely overlooked wellpaced and action packed psychothriller which i would recommend for any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual freddyjasonscreammichael myersdamien regurgitations at halloween
