well where do i startbr br as one of the other reviewers said you know youre in for a real treat when you see the opening shot  minutes and minutes of film time spent on a guy standing on a travelatorbr br i wont repeat rubins excellent summary of the story what i would like to say though is that this film gripped me more than any film i can remember i sat openmouthed and on the edge of my seat all the way through the camera work sound track and fantastic performances particularly that of tony servillo draw you to the screen and wont let you look awaybr br its italian so of course everyone looks fantastic but it is by no means merely an exercise in cool style this is a film with lots to say about luck loss and lovebr br go and see it
