ok im italian but there arent so many italian film like this i think that the plot is very good for 34 of the film but the final is too simple too predictable but its the only little mistake the consequences of love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack id like very much the lighting work on it the best thing on it is a great great actor you know if your name were al pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance but its only a great theater italian actor called toni servillo yes someone tell me this film and this kind of performance its too slow its so boring so many silences but i think that this components its fantastic its the right way for describing the love story between a very talented young girl the granddaughter of the italian actress anna magnani olivia and the old mysterious man toni one of my favorite italian films
