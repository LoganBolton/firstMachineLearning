this is a very visual film by that i mean that the dialog is sparse almost to the point of being a silent movie for some very long takes beginning with the opening shotbr br the silences however are broken by a stunning sound track that ranges from discordant staccato beats to a haunting mix of violins and interspersed with vocals that sound like dreams its a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes one of the early visuals being a man walking along a street so preoccupied with his interest in a shapely woman that he walks into a lamppost one of the consequences of love and a metaphor for what lies in storebr br a long time ago another movie  love story 1970  said that love is never having to say youre sorry this narrative turns that idea on its head in a number of ways beginning with the main character titta toni sevillo a seemingly innocuous longterm resident in a plush hotel somewhere in switzerland everyday week in week out he sits at the same coffee table enjoying the passing world his cigarettes his coffee his solitude  and hes been doing it for ten years he sits he observes and once a week he engages in three very surprising activities that youll find out about when you see this little masterpiecebr br love is explored in another way in a direct counterpoint to tittas solitude and reserved nature two older residents of the hotel are still much in love but the man wants to die in a spectacular manner when his time comes while his long suffering wife berates him for cheating at cards with the other guests one of whom is titta now titta knows about their squabbles their love the mans cheating his apologies to his wife and his whining how in a surprising and blackcomedic mannerone of those surprise activities i mentionedbr br but this is no comedy in reality although it does touch upon the idea of the human comedy in a balzacian sense the irony of life and what to do with it that decision had been made for titta ten years earlier when he left his wife and began to live in the hotel he keeps in touch occasionally and it is clear that he still loves his children now grown up and the sorrow in his voice speaks volumes but theres something more than just sorrowbr br such a life as tittas would obviously seem to be utterly boring and it actually is from many perspectives it is only when we learn what lies beneath his almost deathlike countenance however that the horror of his situation hits the viewer between the eyes but not before we know that the female bartender sofia olivia magnani is very interested in titta and goes out of her way to pique tittas interest in herbr br and thats when things start to unravel for titta he eventually succumbs to her femininity and in doing so discovers once again the consequences of love ironically in doing so he finally realizes what he must finally do with his life and in a most spectacular fashionbr br i know that all of the above is somewhat cryptic but to say more would spoil the film and story for you if you like italian cinema  i love it  i urge you to see this one the acting is superb the sound track chills the spine the camera work is truly innovative the direction shows the maturity of a true artistbr br i know ill see this movie again and again
