although i totally agree with the previous comment regarding the marvellous acting of toni servillo as titta di girolamo i would also like to add the beautiful filming and montage which turns this movie virtually into a painting the young director paolo sorrentino had the courage to experiment with different types of camera techniques which reminded me of darren aronofsky requiem for a dream they both used the same mtvstyle filming combined with modern alternativetechno music making the film Â– le consequenze dellamore  stand apart from the other crimemafia movies in its genre even though the movie may start of very slowpaced almost sec compared to the faster hollywood productions it should be enjoyed cause of its serenity marvellous character portray and splendid ending definitely a must see for people who enjoy the europeanitalian cinema ps toni keep on acting like this we need an encore
