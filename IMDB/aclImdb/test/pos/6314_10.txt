i saw this movie in the rotterdam film festival and i was pleasantly surprised the photography is just so stylish and beautiful and the story its just not your average mafia movie actually that storyline is pretty much in the background its more the personal journey of a middle age man that is trapped in an existence he was forced to live the actor toni servillo is superb he excels this quiet man the girl olivia magnani is the granddaughter of italian actress anna magnani and lives up to the family surnamebr br if youre expecting your typical italian movie where everybody is screaming to each other in big families this is not your movie there are not youre average clich√©s and its definitively worth seeing this one
