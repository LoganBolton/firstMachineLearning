the consequences of love there is really something special about this film but its very hard to put your finger on it is a love story of sorts but not really one ive seen before it has several love themes running throughout the film one mans love for a younger woman a younger mans love for his older brother the mafias love of money at all costs these are just some that intertwine in a story that has you guessing or rather not knowing where and how it will end the cast are all superb from sophia the teasing barmaid to the straight facedness of titta the films central character with simple yet affective camera work bounced off an everchanging soundtrack that mixes lowfi trip hop with lush orchestral pieces the style of the film changes beautifully using several styles without ever getting cluttered love has never looked so diverse and powerful as the tales we are told rumble towards various conclusions the director has married old and new into a rich italian classic
