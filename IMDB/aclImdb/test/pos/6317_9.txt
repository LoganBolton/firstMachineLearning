i saw le conseguenze dellamore on the 2005 rotterdam filmfestival it was the first of ten films i saw therebr br le conseguenze has left the most powerful impression of the ten films from the first shot you know the movie is going to be something special the beautiful cinematography left me in awe of what can be done with a camera the music is also on par with the visuals complementing the colorful and stylish architecturelike imagesbr br toni servillo plays the main character in the film titta hes a tax expert gone wrong who lives in a hotel every week he brings a suitcase with money to a bank and the story plays around thisbr br he is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion to anyone looks calculated and welldressed he has a habit of ignoring people who are of no significance to him for example sofia played very nicely by olivia magnani who works as a barmaid in the hotel where he lives although shes been working in the hotel for two years he never greets her even if she does greet him on one day she confronts him with this and the next day he sits at the bar instead of his usual spot at a window from here the story really begins and will unfold in a strong tale of love sacrifice and the mafiabr br i wont spoil the rest of the film see this film if you love stylish movies like ones from david lynch the godfather etc dont see this if youre an actionbuff
