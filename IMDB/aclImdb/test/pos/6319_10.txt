while this film might not be the next evil dead  hell who knows maybe it will it has only been out for a year it is worth a look dont expect a 10 million film cuz youll be disappointed do expect to be entertain to laugh and to enjoy the experienceall in all this film is much better than many if not all of the low budget horror films out there i have seen films that spent more than 10 or 20 times what this film cost to make and turned out 10000000000 times worse the effort that was put into this film far out weighs the set backs it faces by having a limited budget movies are meant to entertain and this movie sure does that in fact this film might even open up new doors for you in movie watching its available on netflix if not your local video rental store so watch it then decide
