i just recently discovered this fantastic series and i just cant seem to get enough of garners laid back pi the shows continually display excellent level of writing and suspenseful episodesbr br this episode sleight of hand is a little different forsaking humor in favor of a more serious turn for rockford as he searches for his missing girlfriendbr br the mystery is great and its unraveling is convincing enough its based on a book cant remember the name and it could easily have been stretched to a feature length episode garner excels here as rockford gets tough and really means business this has a noir feel to it all the way the dark lighting and overall mood echo the great dark thrillers of the 40s and 50sbr br really good episode in a class a series easily deserves a 10
