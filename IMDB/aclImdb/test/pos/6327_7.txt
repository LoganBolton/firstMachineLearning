barely three and a half years after just scraping out a months run 731 oct 1953 at broadways coronet theatre on west 49th street since renamed the oneill mgm relied on the earlier solid london success of the play to lavish a wonderful cast and  for the most part  carefully opened up production on a sadly trimmed down screenplay of this slyly subversive boulevard comedy and were rewarded with a modest hitbr br ava gardner is the increasingly frustrated wife of stewart granger an internationally successful and entirely complacent workaholic before the term had been coined using the perpetually frustrated david niven to attempt to rekindle passion in her spouse when the second honeymoon cruise gardner inveigles granger into leaves the trio and grangers dog marooned on a south sea island were there other survivors thats for later plot developments granger continues right on managing the world around him  building a big hut for himself and his wife and a little one of the title for niven  or the unattached malebr br the core of the actual plot of the play only gets going about half way through the film when niven proposes that granger and he alternate as tenants of the little hut  sharing the only female on the island as granger has been willing to share the only pair of shoes hisbr br reason which granger considers his strong point reigns and frustration reigns supreme  for a whilebr br david niven and ava gardner are superb in their appointed roles of suave wouldbe seducer and seductress and stuart granger  usually called upon merely to be handsome and virile in action roles and the odd miscast specialty a crowing prettyboy as apollodorus in shaws caesar and cleopatra in 1945  gives one of the better acting performances of his film career as the husband who may actually be as smart as he thinks he is 33 years later he would again show this suave urbanity opposite rex harrison in grangers first and both their last broadway engagements in a hit revival of somerset maughams the circle which only ended with harrisons death wed be far richer if granger had used these skills more oftenbr br as promising as the menage is this is after all a very british boulevard comedy and hollywood in the 1950s which is to say that unlike the source play very little sex actually goes on to be frank if you dont give yourself over to the ideas driving the contrivances it does get a bit silly the same basic plot is far more satisfyingly developed three years later in the cary grantdeborah kerrrobert mitchumjean simmons stewart grangers actual wife the grass is greener based on an even less successful play but for some reason that superior trifle failed at the box officebr br as lavishly as mgm set the piece there were unfortunate lapses  the silliness which ends the stay on the island is cartoonishly presaged in what should have been a moment of genuine excitement  the sinking of the yacht that puts them on the island ultimately we only get about three quarters of an hour of the real little hut but ninety good minutes of david niven ava gardner and stewart granger that make the film a fun diversion not high culture but a worthy guilty pleasurebr br we even get some very nice garnish in walter chiari reputed to be avas actual lover at the time as one of his better speeches goes boola boola
