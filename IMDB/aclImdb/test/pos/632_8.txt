i dont know how this film went unnoticed for so longbr br i saw this film on tv i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film i missed the first probably  10 minutes but that does not matterthis film literally gripped me it is a real spine chillerbr br the absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effectu do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new u never know when they will get killed or what they are up to so it is all the more tenseeven though there are many new faces their performances were top classbr br the filmmakers play with your mind just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest the shock fear horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the filmbr br the well written situations n twistsfast camera movements slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller this film actually switches between the genres  horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed undoubtedly comparable to hitchcock br br i could not even move from the tv even during the commercial breaks  i was the helpless mute witness to this superb film
