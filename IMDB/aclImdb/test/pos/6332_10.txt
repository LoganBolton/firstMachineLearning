ive been watching buffy the vampire slayer and really didnt begin to love the show until season 4 started this episode hush was view by me alone in the dark just after midnight with my windows open and the wind blowing through furiously by an after storm the writers of this episode did an excellent job scaring the heck out of me i was in awe the entire episode which i just finished 2 minutes ago amazing doesnt touch the surface of what this episode accomplishes with almost no dialogue if youve never given this show much thought at least watch this episode if this doesnt impress you then no episode probably willbr br btw my heart is still racing
