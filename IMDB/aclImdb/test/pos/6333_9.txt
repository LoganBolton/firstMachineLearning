having seen the movie years ago and been disappointed by its squandered potential when i heard that it was becoming a tv series i flatly refused to watch it my best friend became a rabid fan immediately and knowing my love for horror movies could not believe that i wouldnt watch a single episode i told him that the movie had scarred me for life as far as anything buffy was concerned and he told me to forget that the movie even existed he insisted that i give two episodes a shot once more with feeling and this onebr br both of them are why i am a buffy fan today he was right  i was hooked immediately i have never seen a show with the guts to dare try an episode that has next to no dialogue and nothing else couldve pulled it off with the panache and the pure creativity of buffy i think x files mightve gotten away with it if theyd thought of it first but im glad that buffy did it instead br br it is a credit to everyone involved that you are riveted for the entire hour sometimes hanging onto the edge of your seat and when it was all over i craved to know more about every character so i went out and bought the season one boxed set and the rest is historybr br i guarantee you that if youve never seen it either youll want to see more if you make this episode your first br br the only reason im not giving it 10 out of 10 is because im reserving that score for once more
