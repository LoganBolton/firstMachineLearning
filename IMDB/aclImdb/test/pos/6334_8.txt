this is a good episode but its not my favorite a lot of people love it and on a creative level its brilliant most of the episode has no dialog which is such a cool idea and hush handles the silence really well plus this episode introduces tara who i like a lot but i dont like riely or the initative or maggie walsh and they seem to get a lot of screen time in hush plus i dont think the gentlemen are that scary and i get tired of watching the float around sunnydale i know that im in the minority but i tend to fastforward parts of hush of course there are other parts of the episode that i think are great so if youre watching on dvd i recommend seeing this episode it really is a classicbr br hush revolves around the entire town losing their voices skelatal looking demonguys called the gentlemen arrive to gather seven hearts from human victims but if they hear a human scream they die so they steal the voices of everyone in town buffy and the scoobies try to figure out whats going on while the initative also start investigating meanwhile xander comes to realize how much anya means to him and willow meets a fellow witch named tara buffy and riely finally come face to face while fighting the gentlemen they are both stunned about what they learn hes a commando and shes the slayer in the end buffy saves the day but she now has to deal with her new knowledge of rielys secret lifebr br really the creativity of hush cant be seen in a basic outline of its plot its the overwhelming silence of the episode that makes it so great the characters try to communicate in different ways whiteout boards pantomime obscene finger gestures etc and it all just works really well after a while you forget that theres no dialog because theyre all so good at expressing themselves during the talking parts of the episode there are a lot of references to the importance of really hearing each other anya claims that xander wont really talk to her giles ignores spike and xanders protests and insists that spike move into xanders apartment buffy quickly substitutes the word petroleum for patrolling when she talks to riely so she wont have to explain her calling and then at the end when buffy and riely really do learn the truth about each other they sit there with nothing to say its all pretty coolbr br there are a lot of good parts to this episode i love that people keep forgetting that they cant talk buffy and xander both try to use the phone riley cant use the voice recognition thing in the initatives elevator people try to scream its basically what everyone would really do if they suddenly had no speech and i think its hilarious that spike has to move in with xander theyll also share an apartment for a little while in season seven xander and spike have a fun bickering childishness thats just hilarious also i like the beginning of tara and willows relationship tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and willow are pretty cute together its nice to see them just starting outbr br on the downside i dont understand how the gentlemen are choosing their victims they just seem to float around dorms and pick random people also i dont like riely ive never liked him but from hush on im pretty much just waiting for angel to come back to town and beat him up finally what happens to olivia after this it seems like we just met her she and giles have a relationship everythings going fine and then shes suddenly dropped i dont get itbr br my favorite part of the episode giles who are the gentlemen lecture to the scoobies the whole scene is wonderful and his overheads are just hilarious he makes some similar looking flashcards in season sevens first date pretty much anytime giles starts drawing monsters its just gonna be fun
