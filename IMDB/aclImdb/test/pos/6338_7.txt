apart from being a clever and wellmarketed variation on the nowadays hugely popular horror genre and a splendid formula to attract potential new fans in general i always somewhat considered supernatural as a massively giant homage towards the genre through the decades although not always noticeable to younger viewers andor people who only have an interest in more recent horror films each and every single episode contains a few obvious and subtler references towards classic and influential titles from that point of view it was only a matter of time before the writers would pay tribute to the creepy vehicle without a driver type of films and even more specifically the 70s milestones duel steven spielbergs acclaimed debut and the car being an avid fan of these two films i enjoyed route 666 a lot even in spite of its flaws and shortcomings the episode opens tense and atmospherically on a remote missourian road where a black man is hunted down and eventually killed by a menacing monster truck with seemingly no driver behind the wheel the victims daughter cassie happens to be deans exgirlfriend and she calls the winchester brothers in for help the brothers cant prevent two more similar accidents before discovering the ghosttruck sudden presence relates all the way back to a racial dispute of the 60s involving both of cassies parents as well as several more prominent inhabitants of the little town some of my fellow reviewers around here tend to label route 666 as one of the weaker entries in season one mainly because the script is too preachy regarding racial issues and shows a different and more emotional side of deans character hes usually the strong silent type whereas here hes confronted with unfinished romantic affairs from the past here to a certain level i agree with the racism debate but it didnt bother me that much really the writers eventually had to give an explanation to the presence of the ghost truck and racial conflict is an acceptable one as far as im concerned concerning deans emotional vulnerability i can only state its admirable to see how the writers continuously attempt to provide depth and detail to the main characters deans behavior towards cassie sheds a whole new light on him in fact besides what really counts in this episode is the wondrously sinister truck and its virulent attacks its an impressive and overpowering vehicle producing blinding lights and grisly engine noises in case you worshiped the brilliant aforementioned duel you will definitely find some amusement in the compelling chase sequences depicted in route 666
