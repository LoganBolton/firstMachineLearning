i just watched return from lonesome dove and it was very good ive seen a lot of negative comments about it and i dont think the viewers are being real about it in the television movie business it is hard to get all the actors back for a 2nd sequel or 3rd part we are lucky to have another miniseries that ties into lone d faithfully this production was top notch with the original music score and the actors put their hearts into ityou can tell if you want to watch lonesome d with robert duvall and tommy l j then watch the original return to ld didnt have as much wit and takes on a more serious tone but is totally captivating none the less from the touching moments to the villains this one is a winner wonderful
