let me begin by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original lonesome dove than i both the pulitzer prizewinning book and the towering miniseries adapted from it stand alone in my experience as moving dramatic believable and engrossing works there is no comparison between lonesome dove and any western film at least not since the legendary collaborations of john ford and john wayne it was with real reservations that i sat down to watch this new miniseries what with mcmurtrys nonparticipation and the missing original cast members after watching the first episode it was clear that this is no lonesome dove in almost every measurable way this sequel falls short of the original but so what i wasnt expecting it to measure up taken as an effort of its own this film is engaging entertaining and of a very good quality if it were done as a new story not as a sequel to lonesome dove there is no question in my mind that it would not have received as many negative ratings jon voight did a creditable job as call barbara hershey was a terrific clara and the new characters like gideon walker and agostina vega were well rendered and believable louis gossett jr deserves special mention as the horse wrangler isom pickett the film made me care about the characters and i dont ask any more than that from an actor it is unfortunate that this worthy effort stands in the shadow of its predecessor it is worth viewing in its own right
