let me say first off that i am a huge fan of the original series lonesome dove and the book it was based from i have put off watching this sequel for the better part of 10 years due to the bad reviews id heard about it if tommy lee jones wasnt playing capt call i didnt see the point if larry mcmurtry wasnt involved why should i care how wrong i wasbr br this is in so many ways a worthy sequel to lonesome dove maybe even more so than the dark mood of streets of laredo the story acting production cinematography are all topnotch of course the script isnt as colorful as lonesome dove but it has its moments and much to my surprise there are bits of lonesome done in this series the relationship between july and clara completely dismissed in the prequel is brought up here almost identical to the book a most welcome surprise the story isnt all roses it has its surprises too by far the biggest surprise is jon voights interpretation of capt call while not a direct copy of tommy lee jones his is both faithful and unique to voights credit the cast is fantastic all across the board and i dont think rick schroeder has done a better job of acting than in this series oliver reed practically steals the show here he is superb in a role that makes you care for his character as equally as you hate himbr br it is worth it to watch this if you havent due to bad criticisms especially that the dvd is so affordable i got the 2disc set for 1099 you can probably find it cheaper it is in no way the disappointment that dead mans walk turned out well it was for me and mcmurtry was involved with that one
