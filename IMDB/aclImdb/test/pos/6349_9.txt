a rich experience is to be gained from watching this filmbr br this is a seemingly simple story of a gifted pupil yiu kwok who later becomes a teacher of classical chinese poetry he is married with two sons and things at home seem normal he still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage and his sons alternately fill him with pride the elder one and disappointment the younger onebr br his passion for the poetry makes him an object of infatuation for a senior student in one of his classes the student choi lam draws pictures of him during class significantly one of him with a flower coming from his mouth she teases him more with her intelligence than her sexuality although that too is an element he of course is not immune to her attention though he tries for a while to keep the demarcation line between teacher and student in placebr br the reason why he doesnt succeed in the end is complicated firstly there is a real depth to the communication between him and choi lam it becomes clear that she genuinely likes him and its mutual secondly there is a longstanding problem in his marriage that is brought to light when an old friend of both his and his wife becomes ill the consequences of the wifes involvement with this friend both past and present are almost too sad to bearbr br nothing is treated trivially in this film all the characters have a vivid internal life and an easily discernible history the two leads jacky cheung and anita mui are outstanding as are karena lam as the student choi lam and shaun tam as the elder son on yinbr br recommended without reservation
