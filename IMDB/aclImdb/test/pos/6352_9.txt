excellent introspective  interpersonal piece that really had some teeth to it without feeling hopeless or worse manipulative  artificially gratifying might be a good double feature with american beauty as well best performance to date that ive seen from anita mui and every actor in this seems like a powerhouse hats off to ann hui for the direction and ivy ho for the brilliant script seriously one of the best dramas ive seen in a while especially if you have a taste for classical literature ala poetry again excellent
