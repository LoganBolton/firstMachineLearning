hummmmanother keystone comedy set in the park it seems that the number one location spot for shooting was in this same local park as so many of chaplins and arbuckles films are set there and while this is yet another one it is different enough and well made that i still enjoyed itbr br fatty is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting mabel normand i think shes supposed to be a little younger though in her mothers eyes she is too young to be interested in men well fatty does not share her feelings and soon he and mabel run away for some innocent fun things get complicated when the mothers watch is stolen fatty finds it and gives it to mabel as a giftand many problems resultbr br decent pacing and the fact that this movie did not rely too much on cheap slapstick but a reasonable plot make this a cute and enjoyable little film
