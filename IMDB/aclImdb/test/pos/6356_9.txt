this film is an excellent example of what an independent film can be the director does an excellent job of riding the line between emotional and physical violence but in the end he remembers what so many indiefilms forget  he tells a good story when watching this film i was reminded of how timid and mundane most bigbudget hollywood films really have becomebr br especially notable is an exceptionally strong performance by the films lead  jorge cordova as an villainous thug on his way to the top of the crime heap cordova plays a conniving brutal conceited devious and sleazy sob but he is so likable that he keeps you entertained the whole time br br i read somewhere that these guys were part of the new wave of latino filmmakers in los angeles  called la nueva obra or something like that either way this film makes you look forward to seeing more of their workbr br
