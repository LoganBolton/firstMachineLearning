first i must say that i dont speak spanish and usually do not enjoy spanish speaking films but two coyotes is an exceptional film there is enough action and hard drama that it doesnt matter that its a spanish speaking film the subtitles were easy to read and didnt block the action  or the dramabr br i would tell fans of spanish speaking films and nonfans of spanish speaking films to go see this movie the action and drama are worth every pennybr br
