to say i wasnt expecting much sitting down to watch the couch trip is an understatement i had no idea what it was about  i thought it was going to be a journey into the realm of sexuality when i heard chevy chase played a condom man and the movies title involves the word couch trip wink wink then i figured out that it had something to do with a mental institute and a patient escaping my expectations dropped even lowerbr br i was literally expecting a grin movie  the type where you grin once and walk out feeling a bit cheated and in a way this is cheap comedy  it doesnt have the greatest gags the plot is ludicrous but you know what i had a big dumb smile on my face the entire time i was watching itbr br dan aykroyd plays john burns a patient at a mental hospital who may or may not actually be mental he gives the psychiatrist lawrence baird david clennon plenty of grief and misery which leads us to believe he is a sane person after allbr br following a little bit of a riot in the mental institutes cafeteria burns is awaiting a tonguelashing from baird in his office when the phone rings burns picks it up pretends to be baird and finds out the caller on the other line harvey michaels richard romanus wants the real dr baird to come fill in for a radio shrink named george maitlin charles grodin who is taking a vacation with his wife vera mary gross michaels wants baird so bad he has even booked him a ticket on an airplanebr br burns escapes the institute with the help of a receptionist and drives to ohare he gets dr bairds ticket gets on the plane and eventually poses on the air as dr baird his show is a phenomenal success people love him one man says and the other man replies its because he actually cares about thembr br donald becker the late great walter matthau is an exmental patient who recognizes burns clothes to be confinementissued pants and shirts to keep him quiet burns promises becker a percentage of his income the secret is kept closedbr br meanwhile maitlin and his wife get in an argument he flies home to end his vacation short and realizes that the man on his talk show is not in fact dr baird after all but no one believes him he gets the real dr baird but unfortunately he has lost his id so the police take them as nutcases and dont listen to their storybr br let me name just a few of the plot holes i noticed while watching this film burns poses as dr baird but is never asked for his id even when claiming his plane ticket he was robbed he says but they would still make sure he is baird if burns becomes so very famous how come the real dr baird in chicago never heard people talking about him word travels and finally why would the police ever arrest maitlin and baird the real baird that is without following up on their storiesbr br to be frankly honest i couldnt care less i went into this movie with a closed mind and it surprised me  i really liked it it entertained me its ideas are essentially ludicrous and not at all realistic but dan aykroyd gives a truly spirited performance as a halfaloon that makes the couch trip a trip worth taking br br 355 stars br br john ulmer
