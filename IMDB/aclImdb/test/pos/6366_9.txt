i would agree with the comments already posted to this site by the previous raterbr br i first stumbled across this movie back in the 80s when i was employed at a psychiatric hospital unfortunately many of the barbs aimed at the psychiatric profession do hit home i especially enjoyed the ending where the psychiatrist would speak thru the door to the hospitalized grodin trust me its fairly accuratebr br of course doors at most psych hospitals are not locked nor are straightjackets used much these days and any hospital must be licensed to have a padded roombr br but a wonderfully underrated film and certainly one that is quite amusingbr br jeff
