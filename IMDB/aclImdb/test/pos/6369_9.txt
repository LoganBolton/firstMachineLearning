as a fan of dan aykroyd i watched this film when it was recently shown in the middle of night on tv i wasnt expecting much so it came as a big surprise that i loved it so muchbr br this is the type of film that dan aykroyd seems to love to make a chance for him to ham it up and not take things too seriously if you loved him in the blues brothers or ghostbusters youll know what i mean and youd be wise to check out the couch tripbr br avid fans of aykroyd will also have fun spotting all the tiny links to his other films in the scriptbr br i cant describe this film without spoiling it for you so all i can do is tell you to check it out i cant praise this film highly enough and it must surely be time for a dvd release
