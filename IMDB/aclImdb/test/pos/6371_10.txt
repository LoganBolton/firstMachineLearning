i loved complete savages why did they cancel it anyway they should have made a second season and so on god they always cancel the good shows and leave all the boring stuff nothing interesting at tv since complete savages is gone this show was a great idea a single firefighter father with five crazy sons and a lazy dog each and every one of them has his own madness in that house tj is always the kidalways the smaller one kyle rocks he breaks everything he touches hes always on detention hes always doing the wrong stuff but still hes so funny by all the things that he does sam is the smart one hes always shy and stupid when it comes to girls finally he ends up by dating angela chris is the sports guy who doesnt have much to do with school studying and stuff like that hes always funny and finally jack the rock of the show the oldest of all the macho guy the rock star but still as crazy as everybody else nick ishelpless with these guys oh and i almost forgot uncle jimmy hes the man hes like a 30 year old kid hes like doing the same stupid things that the boys are doing i always wondered how did he end up by being a firefighter and the dog is the image of all the savage family the thing is this show had everything to become something really big it had everything man but of coursethey canceled it
