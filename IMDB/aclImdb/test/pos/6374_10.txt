each show is excellent finally a show about something other than why it sucks to be married or good looking people talking about why they are like normal people shame it got canceledbr br mike scully and julie thacker formerly of the simpsons wrote or executive produced some of the funniest episodes of that series and a lot of the similar style humour seeps in here take officer steve cox and think troy mcclure however it does come with its own unique brand of humour and lets face it a teenage girl will love it just by on the faces alonebr br what is it with television that cancel most good shows and we are spoonfed with such abominations as who my mother almost slept with or whatever that show is called please learn a lesson not everything has to be about cuteness or romantic travails or especially reality shows on how to demystify every aspect of life some people actually like to laugh and not have to think afterward well my griping is done for the day now back to the simpsons when is it on oh yes all the time
