i saw teen devian in 1993 telecasted in doordarshan on a friday night and could scarcely believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in bollywood it was mind blowing  a film with a modern storyline superb music three lovely ladies and my fave superstar dev anandin this unusual storyline dev falls in love with three women  the simple nanda the ravishing kalpana and the sophisticated simi they too are enamored with him and want to marry him this puts dev in a dilemma which is the crux of the storyline whom to marry he consults a hypnotist who asks dev to gaze into a crystal ball dev finds the answer and marries nanda beautifully directed most probably by dev saheb himself  not by amarjeet the official director the bw classic has evergreen music  some of sd burmans helped generously by rd burman best compositions uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth is the probably the most sexiest song ever composed in hindi films credit should also be given to majrooh sultanpuri for penning the memorable lyrics teen devian is a breezy musical which completely suited the style of dev anand and he did full justice to the role unfortunately teen devian has never received the recognition  popularity it richly deservesbr br a must see for any hindi film buff i will rate the eternal favourite 95 out of 10
