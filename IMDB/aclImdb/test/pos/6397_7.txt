this show was crap when it first came on the first actress that played the daughter didnt fit the role the writing was hit or miss and damon wayans clearly wasnt comfortable doing such a cornball family friendly show the chemistry between himself and tisha cambell theyre long time friends as are all of the wayans clan with tishas husband and will smith and jada pinkett did work so they retooled the show once it returned they recast the daughter made the son much dumber a la eric from boy meets worldand made the youngest daughter into a geniuslater they gave her a little genius boyfriend to do comedic guest appearances the show while if often rollercoasters from over the top buffoonery to being corny walks the line enough to keep it as a show that you can see damon wayans be comfortable in his own skin on the set especially since the main writers directors and consultants were all members of the wayans family and in his character once everyone had been on the show for a while they worked to everyone in the casts strengths and were able to make a consistently funny show on the airbr br however there is too much buffoonery too many over the top antics and oftentimes too much chaos happening in the life of the kyle family they made junior too stupid they also made the eldest daughter an attractive clumsy idiot from time to time and the youngest daughter wasnt even spared by the writers i feel they jumped the shark and signed the shows death warrant when junior got his girlfriend pregnant she moved in and he married her and her parents were introduced juniors wifes fathers character makes me wince just thinking about him the show remained funnybut it was a upn show on abc if that makes any sense to the readerbr br the reruns are funny enough but im relieved its overthere was nowhere left to go with it when its bad its really bad it tends to be cornball at times but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom make it to syndication on a major networkwho can say that for themselves now given the cw merger and the brownout on tv networks lately that is one
