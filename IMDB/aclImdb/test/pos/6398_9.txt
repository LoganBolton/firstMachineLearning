my wife and kids in my opinion is an absolute abc classic i havent seen every episode but i still enjoyed it there are many episodes that i enjoyed one of them was where junior george o gore ii got his drivers license if you want to know why youll have to have seen it for yourself before i wrap this up id like to say that everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were welldesigned and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen in syndication now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
