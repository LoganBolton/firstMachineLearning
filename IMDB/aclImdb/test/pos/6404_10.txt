i am right now watching the big chill on dvd one of its actors is meg tilly i looked it up on imdb which led me to reading megs bio which mentioned and reminded me of megs sister jennifer tilly whose filmography included key west which was one of my wifes and my favorite shows i then read this entire thread of reviewsbr br wow i really loved that show also and agree with all of the sentiments about the quirkiness and uniqueness of the characters and situationsbr br as most everyone else i wish it was on dvd or otherwise availablebr br the last reviewer says he watches it on reruns so i wish i knew what network channel day times it is onbr br so if anyone knows how we can watch episodes of key west please let us know
