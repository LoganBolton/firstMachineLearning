compared to this tarkovsky is a speed freakbr br compared to this bela tarr is mtvbr br compared to this the movie russian ark is a rollercoaster ridebr br ive just described 3 of the sllllowwwwwesssstttt experiences ive ever known and this one tops them all but thats not saying its bad on the contrary i really liked it but it was a chorebr br i wont describe the plot because you can easily find that elsewhere suffice it to say that the plot is insane its one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since becoming john malkovich i believe the interesting plot is the main reason i kept from nodding off also the humour was nice thats something we rarely see in slow artsy filmsbr br here we see a bizarre reversal of the norm most movies have little plot  little substance yet they fill 90 mins with a lot of eyecatching images to keep us enthralled but the hole has 100 plottheme without much to please the eyes in that respect i suppose its a truly intellectual experience much like reading a painfully verbose novel like thackarays vanity fair which ive never been able to finishbr br if you have a tremendous attention span i think youll really like this film despite its molassessy pace its highly creative and imaginative its like jeanpierre jeunet on quaaludes and with a drab dusty camera lens best of luck
