in the middle of the hole i emailed a friend of mine to summarize it not sure if the film would break down into a series of submissive gestures i felt a little uneasy recommending it but then i saw the ending its perfect ive been living in korea for 6 months and this film could just as easily summarize the strange ennui and frustration of any asian metropolis as it takes on taiwin here it uses the myth of hong kong musicals the same way godard or hartley use western musicals but takes it to an extreme its gritty world and occasionally kafkaesquire logic make it all the better i really feel like the holes closest comparison is hal hartleys surviving desire but have a kinda bleak edge to what are ultimately hopefully and strangely metaphorical films anyway this is what i wrote to esther hope you like the hole toobr br heybr br watching a move called the hole taiwanese i think seems a bit to weird for china unless its hong kong its worth seeing so far its about a guy and a girl in an apartment complex the guys ceiling caves in and the girl starts to get annoyed and well its kinda a weird metaphor for the simultaneous pleasure degregation and pain of a rather intense crush theres also a kinda zombievirussubplot too and a lot of weird little scenes where the girl acts out her desires through rather innocent and kinda fun 50s doowop sequences worth a look
