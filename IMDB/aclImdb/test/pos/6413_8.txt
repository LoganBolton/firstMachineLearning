its less visceral than the only other tsai film ive seen vive lamour but the idea of doorways holes into others emotions and existences is vividly portrayed here as tsai sets up long shot after long shot usually with long takes suggesting a sense of alienation in taipei the musical interludes inspired by grace chang are perplexing but welcome milemarkers that add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between the young man upstairs and the woman downstairs its not necessarily an easy film to watch although its not heavyhanded by any means so id warn any casual viewers who are looking for some indie entertainment like tarantino or guy ritchie but if youd like to know something about isolation among citydwellers in taiwan and something more universal about city alienation and romantic yearning then watch this film immediately
