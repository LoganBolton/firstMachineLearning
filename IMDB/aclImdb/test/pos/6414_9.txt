the description of the mood of the movie may be considered as a spoiler  because there is not much action in factbr br great onebr br is it for my peculiar interest for the dystopias and utopias is it for the atmosphere of the movie or is there some more magic if yes it is for sure the utmost human onebr br this film is no doubt extremely artisticartificial depends on taste i can imagine most of the people who hate to watch slow movies and those of tsai ming liang who i didnt enjoy other times are one of the slowest that i know suffering during the movie yes people are unable to slow down and to let time pass  and to watch it without feeling they waste it one can take this piece as torture or as a therapybr br the topic at the surface the lack of communication  even if we live in rabbit cages  one next to each other  but not really together people are tired sick of something and unable to describe it  just dont want to meet touch talk confront the others like if they had disappeared the big block of flats looks void and the rain falling constantly evokes the strange melancholy inside and sometimes it must be something abnormal unexpected some unwanted decay as a hole in the floor of concrete  that allows us to reach each otherbr br one of the possible ways to look at it is this dont survey the inner world of the characters  consider the whole moviespace to be inside of yourself and ask  why is it there where could these depressive states and moods come form is there a place for them they dont have a right to be here and search for the answers if you need them among the walls and halls of the block  instead of inside hardly transparent mind of a manbr br the key to understand is nottounderstand  to let a movie borrow us  as a subject of study  inside itself  and at the end safely return us to our more colorful and normal looking realitybr br then maybe you will reach  like me  the feeling of real possible nonpathetic hope that in core we are still humans and this state of mind can help one much to live in this world
