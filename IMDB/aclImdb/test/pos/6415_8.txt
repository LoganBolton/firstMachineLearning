minor spoilersbr br need any further proof that tsai mingliang ranks among the most original and provocative filmmakers working anywhere today see this filmbr br working from slight variations of a theme running through most of his work the hole represents a study in alienation and loneliness  in this case between a man and woman who are upstairsdownstairs neighbors  and how varied structures real or psychological of modernity wall people off from one another here the woman the downstairs neighbor attempts to endure as her apartment is flooded by a prodigious leak from upstairs a plumber attempts to locate the source of the problem then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor already isolated and desperate both characters are among the few residents of a housing project who havent fled in advance of a mysterious nearapocalyptic epidemic the hole linking the two apartments functions first as yet another in a long line of indignities but soon begins to take on a significance of nearmythic proportionsbr br tsais sense of humor and sense of cinematic history is displayed with a bit more overtness than usual  as the womans occasional daydreams revolving around her upstairs neighbor are visualized as musical numbers set to the music of grace chang which explode from the screen in brief bits of sensualistic surreal romance and humor  quite reminiscent of the bigscreen pennies from heaven and for all of the ennui and alienation on display here tsais skewering of late 90s premillennial tensions is funny absurd and gives this film a very appealing strageness the final scene is extraordinarybr br meanwhile tsai  in typical fashion  subverts most of the usual expectations or preconceptions westerners bring to asian cinema with a nonchalant casuallyrevealed directness focusing on both the absurdist tendencies of the human mind and the most absolute of mundanities theres an utter nonchalant demystification of almost everything about his characters sidestepping backstory or most cultural signifiers which does amplify the isolation of the characters making the hole  and his other films  rather disorienting but also always fascinating and insightful
