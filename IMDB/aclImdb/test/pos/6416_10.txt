in the final days of the year 1999 most everyone in taiwan has died a strange plague has ravished the island supposedly spread by cockroaches the disease sends its victims into a psychosis where they act like the insects eventually they die the hole takes place in a crumbling apartment building which is especially well created kudos to the set designer its two protagonists live right above and below each other the woman is on the lower floor and the pipes above her apartment are leaking fiercely threatening to destroy her food supply not to mention her sanity she calls a plumber to go check it out and he accidentally pokes a hole through the floor of the mans apartment the two have never met before and they come into contact through the holebr br the script is quite brilliant few films are simultaneously this funny while remaining completely human deeply exploring the human condition especially feelings of loneliness and despair tsais direction is simply beautiful like a lot of other taiwanese directors he uses a lot of long takes but unlike say hou hsiaohsien tsai doesnt overuse them in fact i dont know if ive ever seen them used better theyre always effective and never tedious br br it would be wrong to review this film without mentioning the musical numbers yes the hole is also a musical and a great one at that in the films best scenes  which is saying something considering how good all the other scenes are  the man imagines that the woman is a singer almost a cabaret singer these numbers are fully choreographed often with backup dancers and singers in a stroke of genius tsai has these elaborately produced numbers take place in the crumbling building the signs of apocalypse and decay unhidden this provides both a sense of pathos and absurditybr br the hole is a film that begs to be seen it ought to be a cult classic if nothing else before i went to see this i was told that it was a decent film but probably tsai mingliangs least good one well if that is true i just cannot wait to see another one 1010
