i first heard of this one while searching the net for reviews of another italian giallohorror effort the contemporaneous the perfume of the lady in black 1974 whose r2 se dvd from raro video by the way i recently acquired  where its referenced as being in a similar vein but also just as good having watched footsteps for myself now i can see where that reviewer was coming from  in that both films deal with the psychological meltdown of their female protagonist stylistically however this one owes far more to arthouse cinema than anything else  in particular the work of alain resnais and michelangelo antonioni and specifically last year in marienbad 1961 and the passenger 1975 respectively accordingly some have accused it of being deadly boring  an epithet often attached to such pretentious read cerebral fare br br anyway the film involves the quest of a woman florinda bolkan to determine her movements in the preceding three days  of which she seems to have no recollection following a series of cryptic clues she travels to the mythical land of garma nearby locations then bear the equally fictitious names of muda and rheember  where she encounters several people including lila kedrova as an aristocratic regular of the resort who ostensibly recall the heroine staying there during her blackout most prominent though are a young man peter mcenery and a little girl nicoletta elmi from mario bavas baron blood 1972  the former always seems to happen on the scene at propitious moments while the latter apparently confuses bolkan with another woman sporting long red hair and a mean streakbr br while essentially a mood piece this is nonetheless a gripping puzzle inevitably vague events transpire at a deliberate pace  and where much of the films power derives from the remarkable central performance which can be seen as an extension of bolkans role in the fine lucio fulci giallo a lizard in a womans skin 1971 however theres no denying the contribution of cinematographer vittorio storaro who provides any number of sweeping camera moves and an effective color scheme  adopting orangeredblue filters to create atmosphere and coming up with a saturated look for the disorientating bizarre finale and nicola piovanis fitting melancholy score the composer is bestknown nowadays for his oscarwinning work on roberto benignis holocaustthemed tragicomedy life is beautiful 1997br br with this in mind its worth discussing how footsteps was presented in the version i watched well being apparently hardtoget in its original form i cant be sure whether its uncut here or not except to say that the film ran for 89 minutes while the imdb  lists it at 96 this edition is culled from a fairly battered englishlanguage vhs the dubbing is surprisingly good given the international cast with burntin swedish subtitles to boot besides the divx copy froze for a few seconds at a crucial point in the story around the 82minute mark still we do get a welcome bonus ie a 9minute highlights from the soundtrack in mp3 formatbr br i realize i havent yet mentioned the moon mission subplot to which klaus kinskis presence is restricted incidentally around this same time he had a similarly brief but pivotal role in another good arty thriller with scifi leanings and also set in a distinctive location  namely lifespan 1974 as i lay watching the film i couldnt fathom what possible connection this had with the central plotexcept that bolkan mentioned a recurring dream about a movie she had once seen though not through to the end called footsteps on the moon a somewhat misleading alternate title for the film itself  amusingly she at first recalls the picture as being called blood on the moon which of course is a classic 1948 western noir with robert mitchum and directed by robert wise that said i took this diversion in stride as merely one more outlandish touch to the film given also bolkans former employment as a translator at a conference discussing earths future  and certainly didnt expect the astronauts to turn up on garmas beach at the very end to pursue the female lead where the sand then turns ominously into the moons surface br br the films plot will probably make more sense on a second viewing  though to be honest this is best approached as a visualaural experience and one shouldnt really expect it to deliver a narrative thats in any way clearcut and easily rationalized for the record the only other bazzoni effort id managed to catch prior to this one was the middling straight giallo the fifth cord 1971 starring franco nero which i had recorded off latenight italian tv some time ago i did get hold of his spaghetti western rendition of carmen titled man pride and vengeance 1968  also with nero and kinski  as a divx after id already missed a matinée broadcast of itbut the conversion had somehow proved faulty and consequently the disc wouldnt play properly
