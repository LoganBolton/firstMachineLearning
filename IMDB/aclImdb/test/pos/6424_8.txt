footprints on the moon is almost certainly the strangest most convoluted and most atypical giallo ever made it may come as a restraint to some of the sub genres fans but this film doesnt feature many of the regular giallo trademarks like bloody knife murders preferably committed by a masked killer wearing black gloves ravishing scantily dressed beauties and unpredictable red herrings however to compensate for all this  and much more  footprints benefices from the most indescribably mysterious and nonstop compelling atmosphere i ever experienced in this type of film the level of mystery in this movie is so high and unbearable it literally makes you feel uncomfortable and scared like the female protagonist alice cespi herself you absolutely have no idea of whats happening or why and this feeling of utter powerlessness is unquestionably the films main strongpoint as a viewer you crave to help this poor woman understand the things that overcome her but you simply cant alice has a successful career as an interpreter but her quiet and peaceful life gets brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly begins to realize she has absolutely no recollection of the previous three days she finds a torn apart photograph of a hotel located on the holiday island gama and decides to go there in order to investigate what happened on the island several people including a lonely little girl seem to recognize alice only she used the fake name nicole wore a redhaired wig and acted like she came to the island to hide from an unknown danger meanwhile even the poor girls nights are restless as she has reoccurring dreams of astronauts hopping on the moon surface and an uncanny scientist called dr blackman the plot of footprints is truly bizarre and slowly brooding and particularly the cosmic sub plot is really difficult to link with the rest alice assumes they are just images from a scifi movie she saw long time ago which sounds like a reasonable enough explanation but you sense theres a deeper meaning and actual connection to all the other events fans of tensiondriven and stylish italian cinema cant afford themselves to miss this film really this is directors luigi bazzonis psychological tourdeforce with staggeringly beautiful photography and mindaltering music in spite of the lack of violence or maybe just because of it the film is genuinely disturbing and the mental agony alice goes through honestly affects the viewer emotionally as well as it is sadly too often the case in giallicinema the climax suddenly comes rather abrupt and nearly doesnt give a waterproof explanation of all the awkward events you just witnessed for the last hour and a half still the content of footprints will keep you contemplating long after the film has finished and its powerful impact will only increase florinda bolkan is sublime as the tormented leading lady and receives excellent feedback from the limited supportive cast including the young nicoletta elmi the eminent eurocult star klaus kinski receives topbilling as well but his role is merely an extended cameo this film is actually a lot better than director bazzonis more acclaimed and much easier available giallo the fifth cord so heres to hoping footprints will soon receive a fancy dvdrelease as well
