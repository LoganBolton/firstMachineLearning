an amazing piece of film that was wellconceived and kept me on the edge of my seat brilliantly orchestrated in its timing and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release the acting was generally welldone the director shouldve asked alec guinness for acting lessons and the shot selections were impressive as in elongating the hall as billy tries to race to the door in the studio this movie didnt let up since the opening scene
