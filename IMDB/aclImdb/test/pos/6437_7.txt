i first saw this film when i was about 6 ish  my grandma thought itd be a nice kiddies film to entertain me and keep me occupiedhowever every time i watched it i had nightmares the same night yes it masquerades as a kids film but even now i find it really dark in places particularly the haunting music that is played each time the guardian angel woman is on the screen and her rather hypnotic eyes and voice the actual baddies of the film ie the sharks mr grimes etc didnt scare me at all i just always found the whole film rather creepy and dark this is obviously something i can appreciate now that im 21 years old but speaking from experience there is no way i would show it to my kids
