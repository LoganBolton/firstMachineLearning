like many i first saw the water babies as a childyoung teen in the late seventiesearly eighties it has remained with me since then with its catchy tunes memorable portrayals lessthensuccessful animation and a story full of heart coldness and ultimately good vanquishing evil recently i sat down and saw it again after at least two decades passing and i noticed this time around its striking similarities to the wizard of oz no these arent blatant likenesses but hear me out in this one we have a boy and his dog  having personal problems at home running away from something and in the scene right after they run away changing the substance of their appearance in this one the boy and dog become animated in the wizard of oz dorothy and toto are in color in this one the boy and dog are told they must find the water babies for answers and then ultimately the kracken for guidance and he has the ability to let tom go home if he shows he has courage etc in the wizard of oz dorothy must also find an authoritative figure that tests her before he will allow her to return home in the water babies tom meets three characters that will help him on his journey to the water babies  dorothy has three helpers as well when each helper is met we are entertained with a rendering of hi hi hi hi hi cockallorumwere on our way in the wizard it is were off to see the wizard dorothy has a good witch sort of look after her tom has a woman with many rolesbillie whitelaw do the same if you look closely at the two there are many other likenesses that being said the water babies is not a knockoff in any way i was just commenting on the eerie likes between the two this film has some solid performances from bad guys bernard cribbins and the always fascinating james mason the kids playing tom and ella are good the supporting cast of joan greenwoodlove her voice david tomlinson and the vocal talents of john pertwee and lance percival add greatly to the mix i must confess that the animation is less than sterling even for its time but is adequate enough to the challenge the three animated characters that help tom get home are all likable i always have trouble picking my favorite between the french swordfish and the john inmanmr humphries like seahorse the scene where we hear this guttural maniacal laugh from a shipwrecked vessel only to see a seahorse with a huge polkadotted bowtie bob out always has me rolling the water babies is a lot of fun sure it is more of a childrens film but it has and always shall have a fond place in my heart the bulk of the credit for what successes the film does have must go to director lionel jeffries jeffries is a wonderful comedic actor and his sense of humor is clearly evident throughout
