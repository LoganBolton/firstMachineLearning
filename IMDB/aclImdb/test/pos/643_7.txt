this may be the most tensionfilled movie i have ever seenbr br in fact its so nervewracking i havent been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago but i will since i have the dvd there were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watchso if youve got problems and need to escape for an hourandhalf this film will get your mind off anything else br br the russian actress marina zudina did a super job in facial expressions alone which she had to do since her character in here is a mute she plays a cute and wholesome makeup artist for a sleazy filmmaker after the days shooting is done and billie is about to leave she hears something she takes a peek into the room where they were filming and discovers they are now shooting a snuff film and actually killing someone billies eavesdropping is discovered and she runs for her life as the killers go searching for her in this big warehousetype buildingbr br there are two extended scenes in which our heroine is running for her life and both of them will wear you out the first i described above the second scene the climactic one goes on too long and isnt as well done as the first in fact the film should have been trimmed a bit but overall since its so good at keeping our attention then it served its purpose as entertainment
