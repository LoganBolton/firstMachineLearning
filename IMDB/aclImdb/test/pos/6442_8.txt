for years ive had a distant memory of watching this film  i looked on the net to find it somewhere and couldnt find it anywhere so i thought it must have disappearedbr br untilmy gran showed me a box set she sent off for in the daily mail and i though nah there wont be anything decent in there but to my great surprise there amongst other gems was the water babies i hadnt been that excited ina long long time its a great light hearted film the songs arent memorable probably if i was a child during the time it came out i would have stuck in my mind more sadly it was just a film i watched at my grans 10 years ago when i was a little spud and watching it back now the animation is terrible and the rerecored voices they do to get a richness to the sound in films is totally off but who cares when your a kid you never think of those things even if they lead boy is about 10 and sounds like a boy in the middle of pubertybr br great classic kids film
