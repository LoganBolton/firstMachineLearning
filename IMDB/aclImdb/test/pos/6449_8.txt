when i first saw the ad for this i was like oh here we go hes done high school musical but he cant coast along on that so now hes making appearances on other disney shows personally i love the suite life and im a big fan of ashely tisdale but for some reason im not too keen on zac efron although all my friends think hes the best thing since jesse mccartney but he really annoys me anyway i watched the show taking a break from english coursework and was pleasantly surprised the performances were good all round especially from the regular characters on the suite life and zac efron wasnt as bad as i had anticipated all in all a pretty good show
