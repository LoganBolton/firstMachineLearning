if it had been made 2 years later it would have been banned the number one must see recommendation of the day the best rouben mamoulian film i have seen this far have but have not yet seen jhbr br theres no wonder why this film got less than 200 votes a bigger greyzone that could not care less about whats proper would not be seen again until the 60s as morally ambiguous and dark as 70s grit but with a certain charm as well of course this had to lay low in the later 30s and sadly it does not appear to have been rediscoveredbr br seriously this got it all great actors gary cooper sylvia sidney and the this time not so lovable guy kibbee and a mighty good director this far i havent been rms biggest fans but i have liked his films a lot and with this he steps into a new league one of the best 30s films i have ever seen this is something i never thought even existed 9510
