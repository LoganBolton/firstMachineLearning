i saw this film last night at a precode film festival and i have to tell you that when gary cooper turned his head for his introductory closeup the entire audience gasped he was just that beautifulbr br coopers looks aside this film displays rouben mamoulians directorial artistry to perfection wonderful scenefades creative camera angles symbolic allusionsmamoulian just keeps exploring the directorial medium and coming up with innovationbr br this was sylvia sidneys first role in hollywood after her success on the new york stage and she is just as lovely as a gary cooper leading lady ought to be its nice to see her in a role with a harder edge than many she was givenso often she looks like shes afraid shes about to be hit by someonebr br there are lots of familiar faces in this film including the wonderful wynne gibson most striking is guy kibbee best known for playing fatuous rich men as a grinning and mendacious hitmanbr br there arent nearly enough of these precode films available on vhs or dvd so if you cant find a precode festival near you try campaigning turner classic movies for a broadcast as for the reviewer who believes gary cooper was too stupid to have dialogue more complex than yep or nope he should perhaps consider coops performance in films such as mr deeds goes to town or meet john doe although heaven knows anyone who looked that good shouldnt have to be smart as well
