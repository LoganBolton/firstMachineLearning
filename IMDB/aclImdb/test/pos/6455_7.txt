clearly patterned after the first gangster movies that warner produced the same yearlittle caesar 1931 and the public enemy 1931this gangster movie is one of the better efforts ive seen although not quite in the same league as the previous mentioned classics it has a powerful performance by young sylvia sidneyshes magnificent and delivers her lines more natural than perhaps anyone did at the timegary cooper is better than usual at this stage in his career and shows signs of what would follow the next few years when he rose to the top the movie has some fascinating villains in paul lukas never seen him this detestable and guy kibbee what a shock to see him act the hoodlumthe direction of rouben mamoulian is very inventiveprobably the first voiceover to show a persons thoughts appear in this movie if you get the chance to see this little gangster flick dont let the chance go by
