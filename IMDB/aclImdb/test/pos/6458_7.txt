axel nordman cassavetes shows up on the new york dockyards looking for a job but with a hidden past he gets one on condition that he pay a kick back to surly crew boss jack warden while there he strikes up a friendship with black man sydney poitier that unfortunately leads to a gutwrenching moral dilemma for a man who we learn typically runs from his problemsbr br the movie looks like oscar winner on the waterfront feels like on the waterfront and most importantly plays much like that 1954 kazan production however its racial theme is groundbreaking for the time the black poitier and the white cassavetes are treated as equals in every respect it might even be called the first of the blackwhite buddy pictures that would later dominate so many action filmsbr br it helps that the two leads play so well off each other nonetheless the movies central flaw is failing to indicate why crewboss poitier pushes a friendship with the dour cassavetes in the first place he really goes out of his way to befriend the newcomer but why he would cross racial barriers to do so is never really suggested one possible explanation is that poitier wants to use cassavetes as a pawn in his rivalry with other crewboss warden but then comes to genuinely like the guy theres a hint of that in some of cassavetess suspicious reactions but beyond that the relationship appears unmotivatedbr br if theres a single stage shot in the entire movie i couldnt spot it everything is done on seedy new york location without the usual movie extras in that sense its an antihollywood production carefully deglamorized even down to the night club scene which itself looks like a real afterhours crowd i suppose sociologists would dub this rather raw sliceoflife a glimpse of the working poorbr br yet for all its virtues which are many the film remains too close to the brandokazan movie for comfort here a fine unknown actress kathleen maguire gets the role of the redemptive girl friend warden the role of the corrupt labor boss while cassavetes like brando must suffer a bloody beating before regaining his moral standing and doing the right thing still and all despite the derivative nature the gritty urban drama retains enough of the original force to merit a looksee
