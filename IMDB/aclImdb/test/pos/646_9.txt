love this little film that reminds me somewhat of the original japanese gem shall we dance not the overblown gerejlo remake luckily i found it and taped it when it was showing on a starz promo weekend because as far as i know its not available on dvd ill watch just about anything with yancy butler anyone remember the shortlived tv series mann and machine  in it and she positively shines in this she does a dance routine to a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy hot loved all the other characters in it especially the ones played by patrick stewart and leslie caron wheres she been all these years this is one of those films that i take out from time to time and always come away smiling after watching it recommended highly
