knute rockne led an extraordinary life and his story is told rather well in knute rockne all american we follow rocknes incredible journey from young norwegian boy to iconic american football legend produced in 1940 the film may at times seem a touch dated and at times downright hokey and the filmmakers do lay it on a bit thick at times as rockne is glowingly and lovingly portrayed you may come away thinking rockne should have been nominated for sainthood when in fact he was after all just a football coach but it is undeniable that he had a great impact on the game of football as well as having a tremendous impact on the lives of so many of the young men he coached this film shows the great impact he had and gives you an insight into why he is so revered to this daybr br playing rockne pat obrien gives an impressive performance its unquestionably obriens movie to carry and he makes the film and the character his own the reallife rockne was renowned as a great inspirational figure and obriens performance will make you understand why the only quibble comes early in the film when obrien in his early forties is playing the college student rockne in his early twenties all the makeup in the world wasnt going to make that believable and the effect is rather jarring but as the rockne character ages and begins his legendary coaching career obrien fits the part perfectlybr br as for the rest of the cast one name jumps out and that is of course ronald reagan playing the young charismatic but ultimately doomed football star george gipp in the grand scheme of the film its not really a large part with reagan appearing for no more than 1015 minutes but the performance has become legendary thanks to reagans famous win one for the gipper deathbed speech its a brilliantlyplayed scene chockfull of emotion reagan may not have been on the screen for very long in this film but he certainly made a tremendously positive impact in a winning performancebr br the rest of the film strikes a balance between football and life in general with rockne having great lessons for his young men in both areas for football fans and history buffs there is a rare treat as actual archival footage from notre dame games of the rockne era is interspersed throughout the film its a rare opportunity to see just how much the game has evolved in the last sixplus decades and an opportunity to see rocknes legendary strategic innovations put into practice if youre a notre dame fan youll probably enjoy the fact that the notre dame victory march provides a seemingly constant soundtrack for the film if youre a notre dame haterwell then youre probably not watching this movie anyway knute rockne all american is an inspiring uplifting emotional film perhaps a tad overly sentimental but thats not such a bad thing its a very enjoyable film one well worth taking the time to see
