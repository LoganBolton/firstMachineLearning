you dont have to be a notre dame football fan to enjoy this because i am notbut as a football fan in general this was fun to watch it almost makes me a fighting irish devotee if you cant get caught up in the emotion in this film gridiron fan or not you better check your pulse because this is an emotional film with some very touching scenesbr br as a sports fan i loved watching the classic footage of early college games they had some pretty wild plays back then with a lot of laterals they interspersed that footage with pat obrien shown as head coach knute rockne on the sidelines and some of the players such as george gipp ronald reagan br br reagan gets pretty good billing in this film but his part really isnt that large obrien is the only actor with a large role in here the rest  all playing nice characters  include gale page as rocknes wife bonnie donald crisp as the notre dames father john callahan albert bassermann as chemistry professor father nieuwland and reagan as gipp perhaps notre dames most talented and famous player everbr br what this film does nicely is balance the personal story with the football neither angle is overdone the characters in here all people you can root for as there are no villains on my last look it was interesting to discover johnny sheffield  tarzans son  playing rockne at the age of seven and to see george reeves tvs superman as one of the players br br there have been very few football movies made in hollywood for some reason and precious few good ones this is one of them
