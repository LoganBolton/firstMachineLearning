my first review at imdb after a few years of using this site constantlybr br anyways saw this on the tube the other night loved it its in the mindset of a dangerous minds or a substitute but much better was sure for a moment that rex was speedy levitch in waking life but after checking it doesnt seem sobr br i can see why many have problems with this plot and its poetry but i also think these people are closeminded admittedly the ending wasnt quite what i was hoping for but overall it was so unique and wellacted i cant complain i wouldnt call this cheesy as one reviewer did it pulled off the scene better than most films of the 80s did and they refrained from playing any really dateable 80s musicbr br cant remember everything that made me smile when i saw this but basically it realistically showed very creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity and whether i share rexs beliefs or not i love original attempts to describe the meaning of life and his mutant theory is to my knowledge original he rambled a lot as well but they showed how confused he was at times and why he might have some psychological issues and then in his moments of clarity he was a philosopher extraordinaire a person who noticed the little details in life and tried to give expression to thembr br also i was very impressed with john savage as the teacher usually actors fail at that role he pulled it off brilliantlybr br if you enjoyed waking life i say watch this movie if you get a chancebr br 9510br br pk
