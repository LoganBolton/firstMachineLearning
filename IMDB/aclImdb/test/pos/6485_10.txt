 the beat is too strong  were deaf mutants nowlike them rex voorhas orminebr br i am surprised that this movie has been uniformly bashed let me be the first to actually discuss the virtues of the beat and why you must see this film nowbr br make no mistake this movie is cheesy and bad in the conventional sense the story is preposterous the poetry is silly and the acting is inconsistentbr br but these are the films charmsall of these ingredients form the recipe for one of the most underappreciated cheezy films of the 80sbr br if the reference to deaf mutants didnt pique your interest then perhaps this will what kind of name is rex voorhas ormine anyway it is such an unusual name for north american audiences that i said to myself even the names of the characters in this friggin movie are firggin sillybr br well the beat is so fabulously cheezy that the meaning and symbolism behind rex voorhas ormine is revealed nottoosubtly by bart waxman the misguided guidance counselor you love to hate i wont spoil the revelation behind rexs name but please dont get too excited okbr br overall the acting is inconsistent john savagewho plays the concerned teacher mr ellsworth is pretty good as is the fellow playing bart waxman but the rest of the cast are unconvincing that said the acting does not detract from the film why there is a sincerity in each of the actors performances that makes the characters they play endearing so although the performances may suck you are still left with the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best as a result the actors sincerity succeeds where their acting fails which is quite oftenbr br the homage to beat poetry in this film is bad bad bad but this is a good good good thing when it comes to entertainment would you actually enjoy better quality or more respectable poetryespecially in a film like thisbr br folks that would be boring think about the droll they made us read in high schoolsanitized to avoid corrupting the youth politically conservative and devoid of any critical analysis etc even if you dont like poetry or arty movies with all of the intellectual posturing that implies you most certainly can and should appreciate ludicrous poetry in a wannabe art film how could you not enjoy the followingbr br do you remember the roar of the dinosaur a womans scotty craps on the floor bad scotty bad oh the womans so sad she washes her hands and then waits by the door today yeahtodaybr br yes that is an example of some of the remarkable poetry liberally sprinkled throughout the beat but what about the story you askbr br well the story is preposterous but then again that is the beauty of this film apart from some cliches stereotypes and predictable plot points there are enough genuinely unique elements to the plotstory to keep things interesting who is rex where did he come from what the heck is he talking about deaf mutants illiterate angels do billy and kate really understand what rex is saying is the audience supposed to understand rex and his poetry posse ive seen the movie several times and i still havent figured everything outbr br will bad poetry and high school talent shows really end gang violencebr br i guarantee that you have never seen anything quite like the beata perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry mediocreyetsincere acting and a mythopoetics conquers gang violence storyline that has yet to be rivalled by any film ever madebr br bonus for fans of classic nyc hardcore the cromags make a rare film appearance as the iron skulls and its a hoot to see them perform several songs i wish they included more concert footage but maybe that will be an extra included on the collectors edition dvd i fantasize aboutbr br
