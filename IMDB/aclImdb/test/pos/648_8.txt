i found this movie on netflix and had to add it to my queue i wasnt disappointed when i got it as its just as funny now as when i saw it at a local drivein theater back thenbr br it builds to a climax nicely with you getting glimpses of the various characters as they begin their trip across america on the honky tonk freeway america on wheels this was a strange comedic role for william devane as i remember him as kennedy in the 1974 tv film the missiles of october and felt no one could have pulled that dramatic character off as well as he didbr br it reminds me a bit of dick van dyke in cold turkey where van dyke played the local minister devanes role as mayor minister and activist was typical for small towns so it makes his character seem amusing and realbr br howard hessman and teri garr as the spoiled family in the rv was on target for the time as well anyone who has traveled across country with small children are we there yet will appreciate those scenesbr br the scenes of a small town struggling to survive reminded me a lot of the small town i grew up in but they handled it with the charm and humor that you often only saw in small towns its sad that many small towns disappeared because of the freeway system and it gives a realistic if humorous view of what they had to do to survive used zoo animals anyonebr br all in all its a lightweight comedy with no particular message but a humorous glance at america during the early 80s well worth watching if you just need a bit of good cheer
