thank goodness not all dutch people are that ruthless i think jason is being judged like that by most people simply because he has a famous father maybe hes not as great as some of those actors but hes definitely not as bad as suggested br br i watched the movie some years ago and i actually loved it i knew jason from other movies and of course robin of sherwood but i must say i really liked his acting from this movie on it was really goodbr br during the movie i actually forgot he was the son of sean whobr br and if youre a shakespeare lover i can recommend this movie im sure youll enjoy it
