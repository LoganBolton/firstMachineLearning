back in august 81 there was a countryish buzz to movies big hits like urban cowboy every which way but loose smokey and the bandit were all the rage for that reason i suspect the producers of this movie chose honky tonk freeway as the title hoping it would help the movies box office receipts by drawing in that same urban cowboy crowd instead honky tonk freeway bombed at the theaters and i suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title thats same problem burdens it now on video and thats too bad because its a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of its time no matter what probably anybody who can remember 1981 will enjoy itbr br its too bad this movie bombed but i think it would have anyway even if it hadnt been saddled with a poor title its a movie ahead of its time one could look at this movie now and see that its clearly a father or greatuncle anyway to the kinds of comedy made today for its day honky tonk freeway was pretty full of innuendo and a kind of frankness about life that didnt get popular in comedy till much later on while clearly its a child of airplane its more mature and while its certainly no knocked up it clearly points in that direction the characters are more comedymature in that they are lowkey and dont ever think anything they do is anything other than serious the jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and the camera views and the way the view themselves and their situationsbr br but more than that honky tonk freeway is a real time capsule a great look back at the exceedingly early 80s the people in this movie are dressed and act as everyday people of 1981 did it was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a sly comedic comment on everyday life around thembr br i dont know if my review is helping you but this is really a good sometimes kind of excellent movie thats worth renting if you want to see how a lot of faces that are familiar today looked when they were 30 years younger beverly dangelo is so young its hard to realize its her sometimes so are beau bridges and terri garr terry garr was just about to become the toast of hollywood as her next movie after this one was tootsie which finally made her a star howard hessmann was arguably the biggest current star of the the day when this movie was made back in 1981 howard hessmann was the star of the big hit tv show wkrp in cinncinatti he played its lead character the rascally night dj daniel stern was just about to break out as a star as the grownup narrator voice of the lead child character in the popular 80s sitcom the wonder years there are also several faces that are no longer with us these days its nice to see hume crowyn and jessica tandy as a an old married couple on a journey jessica tandy would finally pick up her oscar ten years after this for driving miss daisy there is also the great geraldine page in one of her final movie appearances though shed had a brilliant career she didnt get her oscar till four years after this in 1985s trip to bountiful for which she richly deserved it and she died very soon after getting that awardbr br plus there are lots of other faces in this movie actors who arent big stars but who have done tons of supporting work many are familiar even if you cant think of their namebr br this movie is a pleasant little diversion a bunch of people with a variety of problems set out from various locations each for their own individual unrelated reasons who all in a vaguely altmanesk way end up heading towards florida and unbeknownst to them a rendevoux in the little town of ticlaw florida which happens to be reeling from the effects of being bypassed by the recently constructed interstate nearby which did not construct an exit to ticlaw which effectively takes the town off the mapbr br and thats also what this movie is about fascination with the whole idea of the interstate system which had only recently been completed it had taken a generation to build from when it was authorized by congress around 1960 through many years as different parts were built and then went live and by 1980 most of the system had finally been built and all connected together and first the first time the promise of what the interstate system would be had turned into what is and people were enchanted by it everybody by 1980 was pretty much an interstate freeway veteran in the sense that by then everybody had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that it had no red lights or stop signs only on and off ramps and that it went to places that were formerly less accessible by 1980 anyone could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything except to eat and sleep and a bathroom and this was all new then br br the ending is anticlimatic and isnt that satisfying albeit its one spectacular moment what makes it great is its the journey not the destination that makes honky tonk freeway timeless in spite of it being such a product of its day forget its title instead let it take you down memory lane
