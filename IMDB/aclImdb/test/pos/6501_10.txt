just saw this film at resfest and was floored ive never been a huge fan of scratching but this film had me hooked from the getgo its listed as a documentary but never really felt like one cant remember the last time i had so much fun watching a documentary it has a style and an energy that is refreshing insightful and never too preachy the production values were up there too shot on film with cool cuts and an amazing soundtrack overall a smart entertaining and enlightening piece
