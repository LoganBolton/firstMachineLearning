wow  most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary at the sheer wizardry displayed on screenbr br the shift from the early days as a newyork based blackamerican phenomenon to current days as a racially diverse subculture and largely west coastbased is profiled wellbr br the humble turntable is not given the respect of any traditional musical instrument but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex these djs take the required skills for any musical instrument  dexterity rhythm and timing among others  and apply them to a new technology with several more variablesbr br dj qberts comment that he pictures what music must sound like on advanced planets and then works it out seemingly silly at first makes more and more sense as you watch these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could ever createbr br some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain stars and squanders an opportunity to profile the wider hiphop culture one film at a time people
