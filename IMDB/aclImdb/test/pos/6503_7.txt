this film is essentially for those who have had little or no introduction to hiphop specifically turntableism as was the case with the director before he started this film it was cool to have it focus on the bay more than expected because ny is always getting all the credit but comin from the bay the qbert worship is a little out of control this film didnt introduce anything new to me but it did change my opinion in that going into it i was sketchy about the prospect of giving the tables the distinction of being a bona fide instrument this film ought to convince anyone that its right up there with the viola and clavichord
