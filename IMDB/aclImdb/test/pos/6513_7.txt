miss cast away is an amusing trifle which dispenses with serious plot or character development to pack in as many gags as possible best enjoyed with a large audience that is open to such entertainments and perhaps has had a few drinks most of the jokes are currentevent based so in future years this film may become a timecapsule of turnofthe21stcentury pop culture referencesbr br the 30i to 24p conversion of the footage does create a jerky appearance in some parts most noticeably the opening aerial shotsbr br the appearance of micheal jackson is indeed a strange nonsequiter event but i for one find it encouraging that mr jackson has shown a helpful interest in one of his protégés even after he the director has passed from the cutepreteenboy stagebr br the effects work is not as bad as one review suggested most of it was done by a oneman crew in a brief span of time consisting of animator william sutton whose name seems to have been omitted from the imdb credits his work is an extraordinary achievement and really helps to fill in the gaps in this movie i hope hes finally been paid
