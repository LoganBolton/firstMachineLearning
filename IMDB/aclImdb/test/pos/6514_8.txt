i love this movie one of my all time favorites ann blythe as sally omoyne is sweet and troublefree she believes that praying to saint anne will solve all her and her friends troubles the subplot of the dastardly bad man to get her fathers property is funny and clever her brothers are what kind of brothers any girl would love to have also look for aunt bee as her mother a strong irish woman who wont leave her house that she brought her family up in they dont make them like this anymore thats for sure
