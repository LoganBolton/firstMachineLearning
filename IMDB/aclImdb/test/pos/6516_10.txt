i watched this movie a long time ago but ive always loved it the story is about a young girl sally omoyne who finds out at a young age that when she prays to st anne her prayers are answered hence her missing lunch pail and a mean neighbor who tattles on her and she prays that someone should give him a black eye for tattling well a minute later something hits him and he has a black eye sally then believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power for good she is well known and loved around the neighborhood as she has copybooksjournals filled with all her friends requests to st annebr br meanwhile a local boy returns home from college i believe and sally is awestruck at how much hes grownup sally has a huge crush on him but is so shy should she use her power of prayer to st anne for her own selfish desire or just watch as the most popular girls in school try to snare the man of her dreams this is a fun filled movie with a grandfather who is so charming and irish brothers who are hilariously annoying and a sworn irish neighborenemy who spars with grandpop on an everyday basis he has his own story of wanting to buy the omoynes property which is a little house in the middle of two huge apartment complexes his own in other words the omoynes house is an eyesore to his lovely buildingsbr br this movie is definitely worth a watch and is good enough and rare enough to add to your movie collection i hope you enjoy
