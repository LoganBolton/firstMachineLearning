fred was such a great showit was simple but somehow very addictingi can still remember the days when id watch this on kids wb saturdays but then kids wb did the unforgivablekids wb became like that older relative that tries to act hip and funky freshshudderthey became like that relative who tries to act all cool but the attempt is a cheesy disasterthey pulled coconut freds fruit salad inland and all the other good shows to put on some of the most pointless shows ive ever seen in my lifejohnny testthe only thing that keeps me watching kwb anymore is the occasional bits of the old shows and the anime on 4kidsit was such a huge mistake to pull this show off of the schedulethis brings me back to my first point bring it back
