coconut freds fruit salad island is a hilarious show that is on saturday mornings on wb it stars coconut fred and all of his friends on the island and every episode is a very funny misadventure of theirs most of the time it is because of coconut freds trouble making antics which makes it funny and other stuff going on on the island at the same time the humor is great and nobody on the island is very bright at all which adds it being as amusing as it is i dont think this could be funnier the voice talents of the characters are magnificently superior and are exaggerated which adds to the shows hilarity if this is ever on dvd im getting it asapbr br strongly recommended for a good laugh
