this is the first american film i have seen at this year and i think it will be the greatest one because of the feeling  as a teenage singer in americaaaron is not as pop as beforemost americans i met said his song is fake and that he even didnt know how to rapbut attentioneveryonehe is a kidhow many people can understand himbeing a pop fan is difficultand being a pop star is more difficulti think this time aaronjd has shows something real to usand i think people should learn to understand each other at another handi like the music in the film very muchi remember the first song appeared in the film is saturday night and it also include some aarons real live showand the second one is one betterso i think if you enjoy this filmmaybe youll be a pop fantoo at lasti hope you will have a great time a voice from a chinese boy
