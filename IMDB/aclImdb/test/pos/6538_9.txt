i dont understand why everyone hates this movie aside from the fact that theyre just jealous their music careers never took off like mega popstar aaron carter like it or not aaron has seen more success in his young life than most people could ever dream of having so it only seemed natural for him to do a movie lou pearlman and company have been known for overexploiting their pop protégées you remember justin timberlakes foray into tv movie model behavior granted this movie isnt big scale and impressive but its not supposed to be its not trying to impress people or be an emmy award winner it was released straight to dvd its just a cute little movie about an awkward teen who gets her dream of being with her favorite popstar i know a lot of you out there have had that dream at some point or another about you favorite singer dont deny it its sweet and gentle and i applaud it for not stepping into the realm of sex violence and vulgar language that seem to be creeping into more and more of our movies today wheres the decency wheres the line teen dramas come in dozens these days because teens are a big market for companies at least this one is more tolerable to me than bratz aka slutz with all the fake little girls running around going oh mah gawd in tank tops and mini skirts and is fathoms better than those gore fest movies like saw i feel for the main character girl because i was nerdy outcast girl in high school who loved aaron carter and nsync and the backstreet boys and other pop music and still do and like aarons character would get crushing testophobia especially in math if you judge this movie solely based on the fact that you dont like or are jealous of aaron carter and his fame then of course youre going to hate it and trash talk it in reviews the only reason britney spears dribble crossroads got a higher score is because she has boobs accept this movie for what it is not what you want it to be i think this happy formulaic teen movie ends on a high note and makes you want to sing
