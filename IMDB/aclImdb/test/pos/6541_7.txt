im guessing that we all no matter if we are fans of cars luv the sound of a dodge challenger as it growls along the road the noise a 57 chevy make as it screams with ecstasy when it tears round a corner and most of all the blast of sound as a classic vehicle bursts into flames as it explodes im not the biggest car enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination but any of the above really does rev my engine theres no denying the importance of transport on cinema it has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the biggest influences on early cinema looking out a window almost like a moving picture and the idea of being transported to a different timespace but the car remains the most popular and most luved its even got its own genre the carsploitation genre a genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars in effect its just porn car porn and im not talking about that rather nasty documentary on channel 4 in which men actually had sexual intercourse with cars whatever floats yourcar i guess moving on whilst running on empty isnt quite as pornographic as vanishing point richard c sarafian 1971 for instance with its close ups of the car in motion all its bumps and curves  this doesnt mean that the car isnt the main focus of this film in fact the cars themselves become characters more on that later theyre objectified and fetishised as much as the women in fact maybe even more and holy holy are these cars something every car in this film besides the ones in the background are simply beautiful  works of art theres no question about itbr br as i was saying these incredible cars are in a way given characters themselves you actually start sympathising with the car spoiler  most notably during the scene in which the car is being wrecked and burnt spoiler over this has become almost a convention of the carsploitation genre the evil 1978 plymouth fury from christine john carpenter 1983 satans custom lincoln mark iii in the car elliot silverstein 1977 the nifty little mini coopers from the italian job peter collinson 1969 to the friendly volkswagen beetle in the love bug robert stevenson 1968 and of course each car from death race 2000 paul bartel 1975 and even wacky races 19681970 all of which had their own character ironically however this emphasis on the car often over takes  the human characters and this is certainly the case with running on empty in which only one human character the blind character who drives his car with his hearing rather than sight has any sort of dimension the rest are very much stock characters these are all your stereotypical australian 1980s teenagers big hair annoying accents and none of whom would look out of place in neighbours especially the kylie minouge lookalike but who gives a damn its all about the cars racing and crashing thats it if you dont like that you really are watching the wrong genrebr br the car scenes are certainly the selling point of this film and the best thing its got going for it they are fast very fast and were not talking about the rather annoying technique some films seem to use where they record the car speeding at around 40mph and then speed it up oooh no not with this film you dont these cars are zooming along at top speeds in real time  no fancy editing tricks here so weve got speed check what about crashes check check check whilst there isnt cars crashing everywhere a la the incredibly blues brothers john landis 1980  when cars do crash in this film they certainly crash it would seem that they use gunpowder or something similar to build the cars as one little hit and kaboom theyre up in flames it kind of reminded me of thriller a cruel picture bo arne vibenius 1974 in that sensebr br between these simply awesome scenes especially the very start and the very end there are quite a few scenes which slow everything done and in my opinion fail to add very much to the film note more exploding cars needed however there are a couple of exceptions here which are great scenes  spoiler especially the attempted rape scenebr br so all in all this is a mans film a boys film full of cars vroom vroom vrooming around the outback and a couple of tits thrown in for good measure too id recommend this little film to anyone even if they are keen cyclists   its a great film which you can just switch your brain off sit back in your leather chair and put on full volume ill give it 35 luvs out of 5 luvs  bruuuuum ps  amazon are selling this for just over £2  its a real bargain although the dvd lacks any special features whatsoever
