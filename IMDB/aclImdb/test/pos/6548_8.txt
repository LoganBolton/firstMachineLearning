having discovered the ring trilogy i have been greedily gobbling up all those other japanese and korean films that are either on or following the bandwagonbr br i dont have an easy definition of horror but this film certainly pushed some of my buttons even though i cant claim that the film makes a lot of sense im squeamish so there were several points in the film when i just didnt want to watch what was happening on screen the film unnerved me so i became apprehensive of seeing things that i thought i was going to seebr br its an imaginative film offering a great deal visually it also provides food for thought and plenty of material to argue about when the film is overbr br the characters are welldefined to say the least could they make films like this in the westbr br so it doesnt make sense in the end but when one has an appetite for the occult the supernatural the bizarre the otherworldly then no film is going to deliver a final allexplaining payoff
