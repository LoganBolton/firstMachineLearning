a girl begins to notice that people in her small town are becoming fascinated by anything that is shaped like a spiral soon the fascination turns to obsession and things get deadly while i wont say that uzumaki was an excellent film i will say that it was unlike anything ive seen before throughout my viewing i felt like i was watching a cartoon there are funny segues between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes later i found out the film is an adaptation of a manga comic so this makes sense however just when you think you are watching something that could be a kids movie you are bombarded with nasty and gory visuals the story often lags and the ending is somewhat abrupt and seemed anticlimactic at the time but in retrospect i appreciate it more for its originality my rating 710
