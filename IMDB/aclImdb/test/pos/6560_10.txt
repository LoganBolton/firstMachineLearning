im a horror movie freak and this has got to be one of the most phenomenal horror flicks ive ever seen the plotline is totally original who else would think up a town who gets totally obsessed with a certain symbol to the point of death and insanity the special effects are amazing and the cinematography couldnt be better some may find it disturbing but that doesnt mean its a bad movie it also makes a good point the spiral symbol is kinda ubiquitous the spiral notebook spiral seashells spirals on cakes of all the shapes they could have used square triangle trapezoid rectangle this was one of the best choices if you can find this movie definitely see it its certainly unique and quite unforgettable
