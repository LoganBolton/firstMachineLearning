uzumaki is a visually stunning film and i dont think anyone is going to be able to argue that but unfortunately the story somewhat falls flatbr br the film nevertheless is very entertaining it uses its wild style to tell a somewhat nonexistant story the film almost works just based on its characters and style but in my opinion leaves something to be desired
