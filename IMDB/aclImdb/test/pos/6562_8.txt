i enjoyed this film very much it effectively combines humor fantasy and a few moments of horror with a solid film making effort from higuchinsky brilliant visuals and a very original story concerning spirals my only complaints are that it had its dull moments and wasnt as daring as it could have been still i give this a solid 8 out of 10 the us should take note of this and other fine japanese horrorfantasy films that have come along recently and have them available on region 1 dvd actually asian cinema in general have some of the finest films that have been unnoticed by the american public because theyre hard to find i strongly recommend people to go look for these treasures theyre hard to find but once you find them youll be glad you did
