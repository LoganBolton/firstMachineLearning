as is frequently the case when manga is translated into live action there is quite a bit lost in the translation however this remains a highly entertaining film the premise is unusual and it is presented in the quiet understated style so prevalent in japanese films ha the special effects are a little 70s camp but it adds to the comic book feel of the film i wouldnt recommend this film to everyone but if you are familiar with and enjoyed other japanese horror films like evil deads trap this film will appeal to you
