ive seen a fair few films from the far east recentlysome were excellent battle royale infernal affairs the eye and some were not so great versus the triple cross then there are ones like uzumaki and returner which while flawed i still enjoyedbr br the basic premise involves the mysterious and horrific effects that a growing obsession with spirals has upon a community sound silly yeah thats what i was thought firstly the good stuff direction was top notch sure a bit over the top in places but never the less interesting and stylish secondly the story was original and like other writers commented very lovelaceesqit was interesting what it reminded me most of however was early cronenberg films like shivers and videodromebr br the acting wasnt great but not too horrible either to be honest i was actually bored on a few occationsi felt the pacing especially initially was a little slow my main problem was that it was too silly and funny to be true horror and yet not so enough to be considered a comedy spoilers belowbr br spoilers some good scenes washing machine  and i liked the final shotvoiceover at first i thought it ended far too abruptly but about 20 seconds later i realised the meaning and liked the end however because of the lack of seriousness in the story combined with over the top scenes such as the news report at the school ment that i did not care for the characters much in the end the final scene which was perhaps supposed to be a little poignent while in reality i couldnt really care for the girl or her boyfriend spoilers endbr br so overall i kinda did like this film but it frustrated me and i think there was real potential in addition to some good scenes couple of other points the main girl is quite pretty and cute and the song that plays at the end is good too i rated it 710br br
