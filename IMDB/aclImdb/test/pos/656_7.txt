this is an interesting hard to find movie from the early 70s starring jan michael vincent as a young man who doesnt make the cut as a marine dressed in baby blue outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home the failed recruits are sent packing vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young richard gere who has just returned from a tour in the pacific as a hardcore marine raider geres character is already jaded and contemplating desertion and he takes advantage of vincents innocence stealing his baby blue uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway vincents character whose name is marion takes geres outfit and is suddenly transformed into a marine raider marion hitchhikes his way into wyoming and stops at a little norman rockwelllike little town in the local caf√© he meets rose hudkins who immediately catches his eye staying with hudkins parents marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks mr hudkins suspects marion and wonders how a marine raider could still be so innocent the story also brings up the japanese internment camps as the towns folks go hunting 3 escapees marion is shot accidentally during this hunt but theres still a happy ending which befuddled me a bit i would have preferred a little more drama anyway this captures jmv at the peak of his 70s performances buster and billie baby blue marine and white line fever in the mid70s were amazingly good jmv performances he was both an action star and a heartthrob all at the same time he made a lot of quality movies during his career and continued to do so up into the mid 80s with the great tv show airwolf he does a very good job in this as hedge quietly observing the way people treat him in his uniform as he travels across the country he must have performed some of the stunt work as well there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movieand it looks like hes the guy getting tossed down the river to me but really at the height of his popularity this movie could have done so much more with jmvs talent and his looks innocence can only be so interesting evil as explored in buster and billie is much more dramatic anyway glynnis oconnor is delightful as rose the whole look of the movie is like a norman rockwell painting the outdoor scenes are gorgeous  must have been filmed in canada
