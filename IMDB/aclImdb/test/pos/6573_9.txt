when i first saw the poster of this movie i discarded it off as another lowbudget movie targeting youth after some days when it finally made it to the theaters one of my friends told me its a good onebr br a year later the first time when i saw the advertisement that anand was going to be aired on television and the moment finally came as i flipped channels and for a moment i stopped to watch and thats it i ended up watching the whole moviebr br and by now 3 yrs later id have watched the movie at least 78 times and i dont really watch movies again and againbr br this movie is great because it tries to be different when all telugu movies were composed of 6 songs and 4 fightsbr br its a simple movie a bit slow but a very gripping screenplay therere no loose ends in the movie very wellversed dialogues which is reallyreally hard to find bybr br music is both classic and soothing great renditions by radha krishnan some great kirtanas also come in the bgmusic through out the moviebr br cinematography deserves a mention editing is not slick but adequate for a romantic one such as thisbr br but what really blows you out in this movie is two things 1the way each scene has been treated with utmost respect by the now famous shekar kammulabr br 2 the beautiful lyrics by veturibr br and one more thing deserves a special mention kamalini part of her success attributed to sunitha for lending her such a beautiful voice really tell you the voice does wonders to mebr br the other actors are equally good raja in the title character and the little girl and the way she shouts when she gets a new dogbr br ultimately i can tell you this movie is soon on its way to be another classic with those old classic romantic ones along with kammulas another classicromantic piece godavari
