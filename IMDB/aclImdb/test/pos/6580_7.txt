the problem i have as a finn is that most of the actors in this movie are in every finnish movie i have a feeling that finland has only like five actors i think that if youre not from finland you really like this movie as a refreshing noveltybr br this movie is about a dreadful chain of events that affects a few people quite harshly alcoholism cold climate and darkness may all be clich√©s but theyre still very real in todays finnish society a lot of people in finland have depression especially during winterbr br the tone of the movie is very melancholic i enjoyed it and louhimes directing was again very solid i liked this movie a lot only negative thing is that you see the same faces that youve seen over and over again
