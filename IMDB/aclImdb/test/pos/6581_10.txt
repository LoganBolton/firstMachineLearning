i saw this on dvd with subtitles which made it a little frustrating to get through because of the films length but i was riveted throughout all of it that i was fascinated by the characters and always engrossed in the story despite the subtitles is a testament to the films power its an amazing piece of work i have it on my list of ten favorite films of all time its easily the best foreign film ive seen in the last twenty years or so i would like to know the full story behind the making of this film it must have taken a very long time and required the use of hundreds of locations its use of some hardcore scenes on the tv in the motel room may unfortunately make some people choose not to see it but if you dont mind those youll be deeply moved by all the stories in this one
