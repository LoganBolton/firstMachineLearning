i saw this film at the 2006 palm springs international film festival and director aku louhimies introduced his film and was on hand for qa after for some reason this movie is titled frozen land in english so i dont know how the distributors got frozen out of paha this is a very good film it doesnt for me have enough that i would knock it up a notch to the excellent category but i did talk to some viewers who felt that it was an excellent film louhimies said that back in finland people either loved this movie or hated it and said a lot of people in theaters walked out on it im sure some objected to some of the violence swearing drug and alcohol abuse and sexual explicate scenes its a very clever story of how these different lives are woven together because of a trickle down effect this film has very interesting and strong characters i would rate it a 70 out of a possible 10 and would see it again and recommend it with caution
