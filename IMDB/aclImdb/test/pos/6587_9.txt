before id seen this movie ive heard a lot of praise about it and quite many exclamations about how horrific it was not to take any credit away from this movie i think it wasnt all that horrible or even shocking its just a movie about people living in the darker side of the town and a good one at portraying the pointbr br theres some great acting here and a wellthought of manuscript paavo westerberg is a renowned writer in the finnish movie scene and hes the best in what comes to describing the contemporary finnish culture albeit hes not the only one writer for this movie but i dare say hes the mainwriter anyway correct me if im wrongbr br the casting is excellent except for jasper pääkkönen the pseudomain character who in my opinion should have stayed in the soap opera scene and the sets the cuts and sounds are very well done as well and give great atmosphere to this moviebr br this movie is a story about loosely interconnected sad destinies that according to a famous finnish bands very well known song eppu normaalis tuhansien murheellisten laulujen maa which very roughly translated to paha maa throughout the whole finnish society lead to a sad dark end accompanied with booze lonesomeness and the bad choices and its the side of everyday finnish life about 80 of the population have no awareness of unless movies like this are made
