so far miguel bardems career its been one of the more dreadful of recent spanish cinema hes made nothing but rubbish until now incautos has been quite a surprise its a serious film with rhythm with a great cast and very entertainingbr br the art of robbing thats what incautos is about a film much alike to david mamets house of game and stuff like that a thousand of twists in the script and a story where nothings like it seemsbr br the weak points in latest bardems movie may be the soamerican language that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural especially victoria abrils shes a hell of an actress but in incautos she looks a little bit forced ernesto alterio is not that bad but hes not half as good actor as his father and what to say about luppi well hes the manbr br in short a good movie the best that miguel bardem has ever made i hope this is the beginning of a brand new stage in his careerbr br my rate 710
