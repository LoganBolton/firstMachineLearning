this is an outstanding criminal thriller and with a great cast too spanish language cinemas best and most popular actors of the past couple of decades victoria abril and federico luppi team up in one of the better spanish language crime thrillers of 20045br br the film begins by focusing on thirty something ernesto ernesto alterio an elegant attractive and slick thief who learned from childhood friend gitano and more recently from manco an old seasoned swindler manco introduces ernesto to federico federico luppi an also elegant but more astute  experienced methodical thief  the best in his classbr br federicos only known weakness is pilar victoria abril his former mistress and partner she suddenly appears and proposes a fabulous ripoff scheme to her former lover a crime in grand scale which will eventually require the help of ernesto manco and gitano among othersbr br the script is full of twists and surprising reversals particularly towards the end of the film one criticism about the film ive heard a lot is that there are too many plot twists towards the end but i disagree the film captivates the audience so much that all the unexpected events are not too much to follow in fact these are what make the film outstanding i highly recommend it
