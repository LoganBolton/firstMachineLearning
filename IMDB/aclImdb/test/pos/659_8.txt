i was actually around 13 years old camping near the mccloud river near shasta when this movie was being filmed my family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon when they filmed vincent floating down the river a little triviathe scene where they pulled him out was actually where he started his float down the river and if the stunt man missed the netting there was 20 foot waterfall about 14 mile down fartherbr br anywayi watched it at the time and didnt get it it wasnt until years later when i saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it its pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by jan at such a young age his movie career never really took off as expected but of course he later found success on tv i wish this movie was available cause i would love to see it again
