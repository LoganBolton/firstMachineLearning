i am an avid julie andrews fan and i just watched this for the first time on dvd  the directors cut version i was very surprised that it was rated g how did they get bedroom scenes a seduction story line two strip tease acts and warshootingblood into a g rating weird i would rate it pg13br br other than that i thoroughly enjoyed the movie it was a beautiful showcase of andrews voice and talent the acting was great the storyline was a little weak leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue there were too many no talking just walking scenes for me i would have liked to see the the relationship between julie and rock blossom so that the intense love would be more believable
