i hate films about sports i guess the prefabricated hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year what i am trying to say is that there isnt much creativity in this genre use exhibit a  the game plan as evidence of this if you want so needless to say i was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element but at the same time i couldnt wait because i love surfing documentaries like step into liquid and billabong odyssey i took a step i plunged into the unknown and to be honest at first i wasnt happy i didnt like the direction the people or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs with my first viewing i thought that history couldnt be fully recorded so i thought stacy peralta was splicing stock footage with fauxactors acting like they were from the late 70s the music was intense it matched well peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment but the visuals were anything but stimulating the elongated scenes while using amazing music to support just seemed flushed and too long for my attention i wanted to get to know the pioneers not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool i wanted a combination of who these kids were where they went during their rise of fame and where they are now it felt like i was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day i wanted to know the men behind the mythsbr br then with a thought that i would have another negative review under my belt i watched the film again with peraltas audio commentary his passion his voice his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished wowed me this suddenly transformed into the film i wanted to see peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today what they are still doing and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera he hadnt seen many of them in 20 years so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface he was sincere he was sympathetic yet he showed so much dedication to this project while i do not agree with everything that he chose to do ie the sean penn mess up is not punk rock he revitalized this film for me it was due to this commentary that i rate this film much higher than originally thoughtbr br jay adams tony alva jeff ho peggy oki wentzle ruml these are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned and continually praised if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees while tony hawks name sells products it is these guys these mildmannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport sure others were probably doing it in the stone ages but these guys did it with style grace and moved it to the next level this was a hobby for them but it also propelled them in a direction i believe none of them were ready for dogtown and zboys is the story of evolution being in the right place at the right time living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted and about friendship we have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity and this is definitely a story that should be added to that i cannot say that i loved this film nor will i but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend it was sad it was emotional and these guys arent multimillionaires over again  they are people with a passion and very rarely do you see that in documentariesbr br overall i cannot watch this film again but i will suggest it to friends and family time after time i think the downfall for this film to me was the filming  the attempts to be avantgarde with the style which ultimately drew away from the characters and events as mentioned before there were some elements that dragged on too much which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now peralta obviously had a passion for this sport for the people but he seemed outoffocus at times the music was intense and worked perfectly with the film sean penn while he was decent with his voiceover wasnt needed at all they could have spent the money elsewhere on the positive the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing peraltas voice instead of penns brings a stronger human element to the scene while he tells us better stories of the people places and events watch this film but dont expect to be blown away listen to the audio commentary i think you will be impressedbr br grade  ½ out of
