take a subject i didnt know much about and make it exciting why dont you it so happens that back about 1979 director robert altman said that he didnt believe he had ever made a real movie and that he expected that one of these kids riding skateboardsif he doesnt break his neckwill make the first movie well i wouldnt put such an expectation on stacy peralta but he is a skateboarder who has made a good movie of course he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage and it is certainly a good thing that so much archival footage existed peralta edited it together well with notyourusual talking head shots of his erstwhile colleagues as they are today the whole effect is postmodern in the best sense but that has been done altmans prediction hasnt quite come true what peralta has done however is capture enough of the energy of those heady days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the zboys this is all good i highly recommend dogtown
