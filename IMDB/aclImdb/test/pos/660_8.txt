just saw baby blue marine again after 30 years i still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever the innocence and purity of a time now long gone is truthfully captured in this small film the acting is above average and richard geres brief appearance as a shellshocked raider marine war hero holds a keen interest for any film buff or gere fan janmicheal vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the allamerican boy the late bruno kirby who was billed as bkirby jr has a meaty role as pop a peaceloving marine corp reject dreaming of getting back home to his wife if youre looking for sex drugs or rock and roll this movie is not for you if youre looking for action and adventure the same applies however if you want to recapture a time in america of innocence honor romance and love then baby blue marine is a movie for you
