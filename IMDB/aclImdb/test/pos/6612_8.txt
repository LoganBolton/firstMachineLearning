i saw this movie on the lowlands festival 23 24 25th of august after a friend of mine said this is a very cool movie about the history of skating i didnt now what to expect from this movie was it recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do a couple of cool tricks or was it a documentary about skatingbr br so i went in after waiting for about an hour whit out any expectationsbr br this movie is really a nice piece of work about the beginning of skateboarding it started with the zephyr team who where a fine group of surfers this is taking place in a not so nice area to live in at a certain point the waves are not so good any more to surf on so they try something else skateboarding was a fact br br if you were a part of the zephyr team in that time you where one of the cool guysgirls because a lot of people saw an escape from the place they were living in with the zephyr team so they were trying all there new tricks now on a skateboard br br in no time skateboarding was popular again there were a couple of competitions and one national competition the zephyr team was taking part on several competition and also the national one but what they were doing on there skateboards was unbelievable but the jury didnt now how to judge them so they put the whole skateboarding world on its headbr br anyway i can tell you the rest of the filmdocumentary but you must see this one with youre own eyes because then you can feel the vibe of this movie this movie got a lot of style for me so i rewarded it with a 8br br greetings from gijs and the rest of holland see you
