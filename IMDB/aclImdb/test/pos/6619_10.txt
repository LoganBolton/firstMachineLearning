back in the day i was one of the rns in the emergency rooms these skaters would occasionally land in they were not treated well and some of it was brought on by their asocial personalities but we all knew they were a talented bunch of wonderkids even then they deserved better care than they received im afraid they had attitude in spadesbr br im so glad i caught this documentary on ifc tonight it will be on again at 1 am and ill be watching againbr br little attention was given to them until the rich dying kid was able to talk his parents into draining the pool and the film really highlights that as the taking off pointit was an amazing time and deserved to be recorded stacy peralta is due all the praise heaped on him and long may those zboys enjoy their memories and contribution to the real sport of skateboarding as for the few sour grape reviews contained herein there always were and there always will be wannabees and hangerson who never do more than dreamthe zboys lived it breathed it were itbr br nice to see the vintage films and even the lone girl peggy who was so talked about as being the only female to win their respectbr br thanks to ifc i get to really take the occasional drugfree head trip of my youth and relive the heart pounding excitement again
