if you have ever been has a friend or a kid that is or was into skating at one time then watch this flick i have seen it several times and i get something new out of it every time that i see it it reminded me of why i got into skating in the first place a long time ago  it reminded me of what skating brings to a person and i have found will also help a person who doesnt understand why skaters well skate sure there is a very dark side to the whole seen which the movie does touch on slightly but it tends to focus more on what is at the core of skating just a person on a board doing it because they love to do it this movie was so inspirational to me that im now skating once again im 32 and i havent been this happy with my self in yearsÂ… give this one a go you will not be disappointed
