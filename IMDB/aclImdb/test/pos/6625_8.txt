oh its an excellent piece of work to be sure in fact several of the best scenes in cinema or at least in bergmans cinema are to be found in this film liv ullmann and max von sydow are as good as you would expect do these two give bad performances sven nykvist delivers some masterful although unconventionally masterful cinematography the script is quite good especially in individual scenes sometimes the film lags and the pace is uneven though probably intentionally br br so whats the problem well the film is too bleak for its own good other bergman films are similarly bleak but nowhere near this harsh eventually i just gave up and i started to become a little irritated i was greatly affected often during the film but by the end i felt uninvolved its a great film but i doubt id ever watch it again nor suggest it to friends or if i did suggest it id be very sure to warn them of whats ahead 810
