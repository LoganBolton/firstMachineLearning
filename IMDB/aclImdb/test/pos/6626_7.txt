it came as no surprise to me that this was a very depressing and draining movie after all its all about the impact of war on civilians and its by the king of depression ingmar bergman in other words so many of bergmans works delve deep into human misery and angst and so this movie seems not so extraordinary coming from this directorbr br even though it is more difficult to watch the last half of the movie offers perhaps more insight into the lower depths of humanity thats because initially the main characters liv ullman and max von sydow try to overcome adversity and are basically decent though a bit stupid people however as deprivation after deprivation occurs they especially von sydow become less and less humane and more animalisticdoing anything in order to survivebr br fun to watch no freaking way but an interesting insight into human naturebr br ps1 thing i loved about this film is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche when the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine they finished the wine completely in most movies they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched it drives me crazy as i would never leave a 4 alcoholic beverage without drinking it unless it tasted terrible or had a bug floating in it bravo
