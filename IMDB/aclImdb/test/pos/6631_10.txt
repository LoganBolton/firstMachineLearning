i should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art because they are human beings and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature that said the simplistic notion that ingmar bergmans great 1968 film shame or skammen is merely an antiwar film does a great deal of damage to the reputation of this very complex and highly nuanced film compared to its more filmically showoffy predecessors persona and hour of the wolf shame is seemingly a more classic film in terms of narrative but the key word is seemingly for while it lacks the bravura pop psychologizing of persona and the gaudy horror film homages of hour of the wolf it is one of the best films ever made about war and not as an antiwar film nor a prowar film as such it has to rank with wild strawberries as one of his greatest films as well as one of his best screenplays if not the bestbr br although ostensibly a more psychologically exterior film than the films that preceded it it truly says far more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive in it max von sydow and liv ullman play jan and eva rosenberg perhaps a nod at the infamous american spies whom many european intellectuals felt were innocent two musicians who used to play for the local philharmonic orchestra before a war broke out and they retreated to live on a small plot of land on an island content to working in a greenhouse the country they live in is unnamed as is the island they live on although the film was made on bergmans small island of farö just off the northern end of the swedish island of göttland it seems that their nation has been at war for some years with an invading country or perhaps engaged in a civil war with rebels from another province this is all left deliberately hazy as this war is meant to symbolize all wars this is reinforced as the film starts with assorted war quotes on the screen as the credits roll these include quotes from hitler to vietnam era american military figures after early scenes that depict the prosaic nature of their rural life and then the coming of war where even old men are conscripted an aerial attack ravages the rosenbergs land as enemy jets fly overhead dropping bombs and what seems to be chemical weapons of an agent orange like nature one plane is hit and a parachutist jumps out and ends up hanging in a tree jan who starts off the film as a sniveling coward refuses to go and help so eva goes alone jan joins her and they find the pilot has been shot it seems he is indeed part of the invading or possibly rebel force a bunch of government soldiers soon stop at their home and ask questions about the dead pilot then advise the couple to leave their home as the invaders are near there are the misinterpretations of the film on a micro level such as that of bergman scholar marc gervais who provides the film commentary on the dvd of the film like many other critics he claims that jacobi is a quisling who has collaborated with the invaders but this is clearly and demonstrably wrong for jacobi is with the original fascist government as proof first off the invaders are repelled after they invade the rosenbergs land and shoot their agitprop interview we know this because the government that later questions them of the faked interview and words put into evas mouth see the film as supposed proof of their treason and jacobi is clearly working with them the fascist big brother statists secondly jacobi is in charge of deciding which of the townsfolk are sent to concentration camps for collaborating with the invaders and the rosenbergs again are among those spared thirdly in his seduction of eva jacobi tells her his son is on leave from the military and clearly if he was an invader he would not be speaking so happily of his son serving the state also rebel forces are not official armies and do not grant official leave lastly filip is clearly with the rebels or invaders of the organization and why would he have killed a colleaguebr br that gervais and other critics so blatantly and wantonly misinterpret and flat out miss such a key and manifest point of this film brings into question their ability to discern any and all aspects of all of bergmans films this is a wonderful and great film and very high in the berman canon but it is disappointing to read how so few critics and viewers have really understand its complex message instead opting out for the cheap lazy and easy claim of its being merely antiwar and a rather simple film in comparison to its two showier predecessors and that in the long run is the real shame of shame
