i watched this movie on a big screen a few months ago i didnt know what to expect precisely and for the first ten minutes i feared i might not enjoy this film it was beginning very slowly in silence and almost banality which was all the less exciting as the sound was quite bad and the subtitles sometimes impossible to readbr br but i definitely do not regret to have gone on watching it it is one of the most beautiful bergman movies ive ever seen at the same time human ruthless and psychologically so convincingbr br seldom have i seen actors play so wonderfully with such an intensity on their faces  liv ullmans interpretation is unforgettable and sydow is excellent toobr br there is always psychological violence in bergman movies and this one may be the most physically violent of them all the strained relationships between the man and the woman evolve in parallel with the physical violence that is surrounding thembr br finally this sober violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly striking human depth an excellent bergmanbr br
