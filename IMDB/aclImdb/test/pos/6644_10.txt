a gruelling watch but one of bergmans finest films interesting to compare this with the hour of the wolf as both feature the same lead actors as artists or an artist and his wife who have taken sanctuary on an island in the earlier film its largely inner demons that lead to von sydows disintegrating personality at least thats how i read it whereas here its very much circumstances beyond his controlbr br much has been written about the unsympathetic central characters particularly von sydows for me there are flashes of a good if flawed man early in the film but one who copes badly with adversity the flaws become all that is left as his humanity is gradually eroded by one horror after anotherbr br i watched a passion ullmann and von sydow on their island again soon after this and was amazed to recognise many of the same locations and then theres a dream sequence
