bergmans skammen is one of the most realistic depictions of war ever set to film this is not an action film by any means though the pacing is faster and there is most action than in most any other bergman movie nor is this a romanticisation of war or patriotism unlike most war movies in fact the gritty realism and the deliberate ambiguity of the characters loyalties has a very contemporary feelbr br skammen is a darkly lit movie that should be watched at night so as to let it work its magic many of the effects are conveyed indirectly but so effectively that some scenes compete in intensity to a contemporary insanely huge budget film like saving private ryan of course the action in skammen is on a much smaller scale but it is impressive nonethelessbr br while the filmmaking style feels contemporary the setting of the film feels timeless and placeless the wartorn countryside and even the yet intact provincial hamlet could be anywhere any time and this film is not so much about specific historical events with specific names and dates but about universal human reactions to adversity and chaosbr br the acting in skammen though typically impressive from ullman and sydow is not of primary importance in this film unlike most other bergman movies through much of the film they are spectators much as we are bergman has the war imposed on them and through them on the audience and their reaction is perhaps what any of our reactions might bebr br highly recommended 1010
