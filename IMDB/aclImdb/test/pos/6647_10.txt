i dont recall a film which so deftly shows the emotional destruction of war as mirrored in one single marital relationship the focus of the film is the union between ullman and von sydowthe two are in every scene through the course of the film they experience a role reversalone has the strength of survival and the other is reduced to emotional escapism through dreams both will lose a measure of humanity but one to a greater degree than the other the characters and the viewer go through periods of fluctuation in regards to closenessthe camera pulls out and away sound disappears words are lost only for the camera to return to painterly closeups of its facially expressive stars the confusion and fluctuation may make this film hard for some viewers but this is all purposeful under the master hand of bergman i think the use of a fake war makes the film timeless as relevant today as ever before and by focusing on the human relationship through war makes the film relevant to everyone the pair could be anyone the film is not grounded in place or time but rather in emotion a unique and effective war film unlike any other bergmans films are virtuosic in presenting human relationshipsthat he would bring this to a war film is masterful
