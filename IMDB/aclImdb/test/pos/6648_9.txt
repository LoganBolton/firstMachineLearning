when liv ullmans character says i feel like im in someone elses dream and theyre going to be ashamed when they wake up she is referring not only to being an unwilling player in societys war games she is referring to being an ignorant participant in life itself at the films end when she says that she had a dream that she had a child and she was trying to take care of it but she forgot something else the implication is that she has forgotten what she has learned in the war shes just survived that like her own mother before her she will be unable to pass on any vital lessons to her own child and therefore the cycle of the shame of ignorance will continuead infinitum
