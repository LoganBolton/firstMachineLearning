how is it possible to like and dislike the same moviebr br the plot is very much like that jody foster thing sommersby only not as good nicole was greatjude was adequate they didnt give him many linesis there a reason for that generally hes a pretty good actor shes so elegant his character is so country bumpkin it makes one wonder what they see in each otherbr br romance between two such was only successful in lady chatterlys loverbr br i think the dislike comes about because the movie is too long they could have told the story in two hoursbr br the story is good good locations good filming the character actors were great
