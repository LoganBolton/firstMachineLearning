stmd is one of the most fun and enjoyable lowbudget films ive seen in quite some time director jeff smith who also served as cowriter cinematographer and editor definitely shows his love of underappreciated 80s horror films with this movie anyone who loves the cheesiness preposterous situations wacky and stereotypical characters of 80s horror movies will definitely love this very tongueincheek homage to the pastbr br stmd definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some it has all the excessive violence and gratuitous nudity that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80s horror movies we all love i had a blast watching stmd from the 80s outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone i just couldnt get enough
