its initial premise is based on the american civil war but its ultimately a love story we start at the beginning of the war where the main characters kidman  law are obviously aware of each other and theres an obvious attraction they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war the main thrust of this film is for laws character to return to kidmans and his struggles to achieve that and her struggles to survive until he returns the reason it fails to convince is that we dont see enough of this relationship before laws character leaves for battle  its difficult to believe the premise that 2 people yearn for each other so much given theyve had so little contact everything else is just about fine renee zellweger and her incumbent father and his entourage are lovely additions as is the threat from the gang chasing deserters sure its a long film but it does hold the interest and the cinematography is great an honourable attempt that doesnt quite make it but worth a watch nonetheless
