watching cold mountain gave me the impression that its director anthony minghella was deliberately trying to outdo himself and the own film of his that he was trying to beat was the virtually impeccable the english patient from 1996 comparing the two movies the premise is quite similar we have a passionate love affair between two people set in a turbulent time of war and they end up treating the war more or less as a disturbance in the background while trying to find themselves back in each others arms again the primary plot differences are that nicole kidmans character is not married jude laws is a deserter and the conflict is the american civil warbr br cold mountain is storywise more watered down and mellow than say the english patient and its more on the level for people who want a simple love story with some kind of an exterior turbulence causing a problem it is a shorter film which is a plus for people with less patience however its not as spectacular or original or genuinely gripping as the english patient my only big complaint about cold mountain is astonishingly the love affair between the characters of inman jude law and ada monroe nicole kidman amazingly their love was the least interesting thing in the picture they dont have a real relationship we dont feel any real passion coming from them and the passion that we do see is more physical than emotional i was more fascinated by the friendship between nicole kidman and oscarwinner renee zellwegger and also jude laws travels across country dodging vigilantes and enemy soldiers if minghella had strengthened the importance of the love story then he would have had i feel a better picturebr br of course the movie is entertaining even if the love story is uninteresting the civil war sequences are absolutely great they are of the modern tradition that show war as horrible and dehumanizing the reenactment of the petersburg campaign in which tons of explosives was detonated from underground and then followed by a handtohand battle is horrifying minghella does not shy from showing blood and gore in an artistic and sensible manner and hes not afraid to show casualties of innocence and life in these scenes there are moments where women as well as men are killed oftentimes by crossfire and theres more to it just the sound design of the movie generates tension theres a scene where inman and another deserter make themselves a meal by sawing off the head of a dead cow we dont see the slicing but the sound effects of blade going through bone are sickeningbr br lastly i must congratulate the cast for the performances jude law was terrific in the movie and deserved the academy award nomination he received i feel that nicole kidman deserved one as well even though her character was a bit shallow renee zellwegger had the most personality and screenstealing atmosphere and then theres just the bit parts that also really work to complete this stylistic world recreating a horrible time in americas pastbr br maybe cold mountain would have been better as a war picture but it most certainly would have been spectacular like the english patient if its love story had been powered up and made more passionate by the screenwriters and director anthony minghella as it is its a most enjoyable picture i wasnt bored by it and i recommend it i just say that its love story  though a central plot point  is a little more mellow than it needs to be and all the stuff around it was what really worked
