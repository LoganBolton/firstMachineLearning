well i expected for all the hype and oscar nominations an epic civil war drama  something with the magnitude of the english patient given the same director this film isnt of epic stature but it turns out i was relieved it wasnt its a love story in the midst of the horrors of war where young men are sent off to fight deserters are tracked and killed and the women and children at home are left to fend for themselves while the men are gonebr br anyway i thought nicole kidman and rene zelleweger were pretty decent and not knowing much about jude law he was all right also it seems rene z had the more fun part of the 3 leads and was able to smartly play a spirited feisty downhome woman with much aplomb also for me it was good to see actress kathy bakersomeones whos talent needs to be more recognizedacknowledgedbr br this film is worth seeing this  im cant articulate why really but maybe because it is a slice of americana br br
