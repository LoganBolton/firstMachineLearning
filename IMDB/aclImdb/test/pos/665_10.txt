its the 1980s and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of murder mcgee after mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an ouija board the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one sound familiar its supposed to its clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80s slashers with the tagline excessive violence gratuitous nudity zero budget br br cant get enough its pure entertainment i enjoyed the humor and the way it poked fun at all the horror clich√©s but at the same time embraced what was fun about movies from this time there is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80s slasher films though good acting the entire cast was very talented and you dont see that very much in any low budget flicks recent or otherwise there was a lot of chemistry between the characters i was very entertained throughout the entire film and i am fully convinced the writerdirector and cast will go a long way in their separate careers the script was very well written and the dialogue flowed naturallybr br the effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not lit well but the fact that this movie admits on its cover there was practically no budget i already know this going in this film makes it simple to politely ignore its faults and just sit back and enjoy although this is not an oscar award winning opus it never claims to be and props to that its a lot of fun if you like slashers youll really appreciate this film if you like blood and boobies youll appreciate it also
