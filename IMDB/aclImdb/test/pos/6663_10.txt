this movie moved me more than i was expecting and i was fully prepared to cry the acting mainly carried this film with superb performances from jude law nicole kidman and renee zellweger as well as the supporting cast these actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they lingered the remainder of the night with me and i had trouble shaking this war drama the costumes and cinematography were also magical but didnt get carried away with themselves they didnt take focus but added to the whole effect cold mountain could never become my favorite movie as that title will always belong to the english patient but its in the top five the story itself was well developed and stayed fairly unpredictable i did not find myself guessing what line came next a heartwrenching story about humanity and war in fact this movie was so strongly real that it was barely noticeable it took place in the 19th century it seemed to apply to all times
