at last a movie that handles the probability of alien visits with the appropriate depth and loving warmth just in case were not alone i do believe that these visitors are just too tourist√≠c to care for us or give that wayward bunch of anthropocentric goofs a stable proof of their existence we wouldnt interfere in the battle rites of some agitated desert tribe either unless were out for messing with our travel insurance huhbr br anyway the movie depicts the transitional cathexis of a weary mind and body by a superior entity that happens quite unspectacular and rather unrecognized but were dealing with a movie here right so prots hospitalization is just a trigger to the plotbr br jeff bridges acts great as usual but spacey is hilarious the role seems tailored downright to him convincing and lovingly mad eating unpeeled bananas sitting in a tree giving his doctor a hard time with quickness wisdom and most of all stunning quotes they made me think and philosophize for hours alreadybr br its an encouraging film to say the least and the soundtrack by edward shearmur is simply beautiful just go and get a copy catch a beam of light now
