this brass eye special paedogeddon was swamped by complaints  more on that later  when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible  sarahs law  following the abduction and murder of school girl sarah payne  in fact its scheduling was delayed while phil collins took legal advice after he found out hed been fooled by the shows maker chris morris into a starting a campaign entitled noncesensebr br if truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but i do confess that i laughed out loud  the edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims  chris morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile  cue the childs frightened screams  like i said very poor taste br br other highlights of the show include dr fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs   no one knows this but its a scientific fact   labour mp barbara follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and kate thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim  who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old colonel   morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if theyre classed as obscene  the photos included barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite photo featuring a young boys head  a dogs body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to john holmes  hey i never said this show was tasteful did i  br br its impossible to mention paedogeddon without the hypocritical fall out that surrounded it where politicians  childrens organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject  the show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but its a biting satire  perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of britain before they criticise a mere tv show for exacerbating tensions
