prot kevin spacey is a mental hospital patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called kpax his psychiatrist dr mark powell jeff bridges tries to help him all the while trying to understand prot and find out if he is really from kpaxbr br this movie doesnt really fall into any particular genre one big part of kpax is drama sciencefiction another part fantasy plus add to that a dash of comedy and you begin to get what kpax is all about the story as you see above isnt too complicated or deep but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did me no special effects or graphics accompany this movie and theres no need to have them the music in the film is great however a techno soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes kpax sound scifi and makes certain scenes intriguingbr br kevin spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien prot from the planet kpax emotional with great facial expressions spacey does a fine job in the lead role jeff bridges is dr powell that aids and attempts to understand prot bridges is also excellent in his part bridges and spacey fit together very well and they should after all theyve both had a lot of experience the wife of dr powell is rachel powell played by mary mccormack mccormack plays her part well showing the frustration from having her husband gone and so dedicated to his patient alfe woodard plays dr powells coworker claudia villars we dont really see claudia too much but overall she puts in an alright performancebr br kpax is rated pg13 for a sequence of violent images and brief language and sensuality and that covers it as far as violent images go we dont see too much a few people that have quite a bit of blood on them but thats all language is as follows 1 f word wow only one 11 s words and a few uses of the lords name in vain not too bad really the sensuality part is just from when prot explains to dr powell how reproduction works on kpax nothing terrible just something about it feels like having your nuts in a vice not too bad on the content level for a pg13 movie it could have been a lot worsebr br in conclusion kpax is not a bad movie it wont stun you but it is enjoyable and kind of fun to watch it has some funny parts sad parts really sad parts and well you know what i mean its a story of a mental hospital patient what do you expect all in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax to kpax is a well done moviebr br bonus if youve seen this movie already like it and are thinking about getting the dvd i would highly recommend it it has loads of extras to look through and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes 810
