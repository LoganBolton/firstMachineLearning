just watched this and it was amazing was in serious doubt about renting the dvd or not so if you areand like watching other than brainless actionmoviesdont hesitate any longer dont let the dull cover put you off the script is one of the best ever inteligent funny original touching and keeps you at the edge of the seat through the whole movie i had already watched another movie right before this one and was really sleepy and usually i get bored on watching a second movie in one night but this one really made me wake up and didnt have any boring moments it also made me rethink a lot of things in life and gave me a really good feelingbr br also the acting is great one of kevin spaceys best roles the visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very wellchosen if i have to come up with something negative to say about itwelli cant really find anythingenjoy 10 out of 10
