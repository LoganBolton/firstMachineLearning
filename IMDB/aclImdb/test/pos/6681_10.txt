if you have enjoyed the butterfly effect donnie darko or the machinist you will enjoy kpax toobr br to me this movie felt really uplifting and yet depressing in the end spacey delivers a great performance as prot also lets not forget the appearance of saul williams in the movie who i am a big fan ofbr br after watching it i recommended the movie to lots of my friends and everyone was pretty much blown awaybr br but still it is very underrated maybe because of the lack of action and explosions im sorry this is not a movie about blowing things up its about how humans behave and how people live in worlds that dont existbr br go on and enjoy
