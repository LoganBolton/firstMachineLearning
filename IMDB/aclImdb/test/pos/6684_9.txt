i was truly surprised when i first saw this movie directed by iain softley it differs in so much ways from the usual hollywood massproduction the plot itself is simple  kevin spacey plays a mental patient prot who claims to be from the planet kpax who arrived to earth by a beam of light while dr powell played by jeff bridges tries to help him to solve his delusions first of all i must admit the cast is perfectly chosen kevin spacey is really brilliant in portraying the intriguing character of prot always walking in the fine line of convincing us that it is real and then making us wonder whether he is delusional or not some of the gem scenes include the one where prot innocently eats the whole banana even the peal while in session with dr powell or the observatory scene where he confidently shows his knowledge of the kpax system to the astonished astronomers jeff bridges on the other hand is the subtle rational side of this movie and he delivers it perfectly there is a whole other cast of excellent actors like saul williams convincing performance as ernie who make this film truly workbr br kpax has it all elements of comedy scifi even psychological thriller concerning the prots identity but most importantly it can be categorized as a heartwarming drama the main premise of the movie is quite intricate but the director never lets it get loose he always keeps it believable and yet twoways interpretable the camera and photography have almost a crucial part here continuing the main idea of light travel there is much focus on lightshadow play lightning settings  one of the memorable scenes is where dr powell holds a crystal figure in his office which refracts light in a beautiful way while all the time he suspects can the idea be true br br subtle and slow paced intriguing and pleasurable kpax is truly a gem to watch one of the kind movie that may not be for all tastes but those who see it  might fall in love with it
