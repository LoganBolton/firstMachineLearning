following a mugging incident at new yorks grand central station an innocent bystander kevin spacey the usual suspects is arrested by police who believe him to be under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs we can understand why they think this considering how the man politely informed them that he wears his dark glasses because the light on your planet is really bright and so prot as he identifies himself pronounced as rhyming with goat is shipped off to the psychiatric institute of manhattan where a weary workaholic doctor mark powell jeff bridges the big lebowski attempts to understand this mans socalled delusionbr br prots manner is courteous and cooperative when asked why he believes he has been institutionalised he matteroffactly replies that it is because you think im crazy within minutes after satisfying his insatiable newfound hunger for earthfruit the completely forthright prot has revealed that he is an extraterrestrial from the planet kpax which resides 1000 lightyears away circling the binary star system agape and satori located in the lyra constellation he also details how his infinitelymore advanced species has already mastered fasterthanlight travel through harnessing the energy of light an accomplishment that is allegedly eons away for the human racebr br powell is understandably very skeptical of these outrageous claims though he is nevertheless fascinated by them and commits himself to understanding how prot came to believe such a thing meanwhile prot uses his time to observe his fellow patients in the psychiatric ward eventually offering everybody around him something to live for and hope of a cure on july 27 prot later reveals he will depart again for kpax and he can only take one human with him of what will actually happen on that date nobody is certainbr br originally slated to play dr powell  with will smith as prot  kevin spacey stepped into the main role when smith had to withdraw from the film you can tell that he had a lot of fun with his character the completely matteroffact delivery of his sometimes ridiculous dialogue your produce alone has been worth the trip often eliciting genuine laughter there is undeniable intelligence behind many of prots words but logic maintains that he must be delusional mustnt hebr br the audience is led back and forth between the possibilities  for the first segment of the film we almost accept the possibility that prot is an extraterrestrial this is a scifi movie isnt it before being totally convinced when prot inexplicably displays an impossible knowledge of the astronomy of a newlydiscovered planet system a final investigation by dr powell offers us a neatlypackaged terrestrial explanation for prots delusions but this is just as quickly whisked away and we are left scratching our heads again the film quite rightly keeps its ending open leaving the audience to contemplate what theyve just watched and to discuss it with those around them nevertheless whether you believe prot to be an alien or not two irresistible certainties linger in your mind the universe is indeed a fascinating place and perhaps there are higher forces that we humans are yet to discover
