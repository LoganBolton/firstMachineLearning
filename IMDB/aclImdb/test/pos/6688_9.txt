im a fan of jeff bridges so i snapped this up on dvd without having seen it previously i instantly became a fan of kevin spacey alsobr br the general plot of alien in human body has in my experience been done to death but i liked the approach taken in kpax which struck me as quite different and much more sensitive than most bridges makes an excellent doctor you want to tell him whats on your mind and spaceys expressions and gestures are perfect in the rolebr br the interaction between prot and the entirely human characters in the clinic is delightful particularly the subtle manipulation of their behaviourbr br the ending is bittersweet  i like prots choice but the final scenes with bridges made me teary
