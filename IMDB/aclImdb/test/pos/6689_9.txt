personally i think kevin spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation maybe the greatest this in combination with another amazing actor named jeff bridges it cant be bad and thats exactly what this movie is kpax is one of the most pleasant surprises of the latest years to start with has the movie a brilliantly written story its part of what makes the movie so great the other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the movie is the acting the combination spaceybridges really worksbr br this was already the second time i saw the movie and im sure it wont be the last time kpax has everything there are moments which are extremely funny parts that remind of a true thriller and others which reminds of highclass drama i think this movie deserves a much higher rating and a lot more awards great movie br br 910
