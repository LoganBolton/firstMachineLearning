a mixture of alien and ghost bustersbr br starts very promising then slows down to almost boring br br lifeforce contains some awesome special effects they were able to make in the mid 80s the story is intriguing but becomes quite lack lustre in the end it was rated r because of the nudeness sex and gore mathilda mays ethereal and savage naked beauty is very apparent through out the whole movie a bizarre movie and cost a lot by the time it was made br br this could have been a bigger classic with a better script but unfortunately it wasnt a great hit i think it actually flopped quite bad br br so something went wrong with this one but still its very entertaining
