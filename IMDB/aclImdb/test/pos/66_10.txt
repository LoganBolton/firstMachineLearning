i first viewed this movie when it first came out and also bought an lp recording of the soundtrack i liked it so well i went back to see it several timescannot understand why it was considered a flop julie andrews was lovely in this film her voice was in top form and the costuming was beautifulbr br the film contains a little bit of everything and even though some of the scenes were a bit heavyhanded they were still fun br br i recently found i could get a copy in dvd form and ordered iti was disappointed that a couple of songs and sequences in the movie were not included in the version of the dvd i ordered
