i finally got hold of lifeforce on dvd with the widescreen format intact and rousing henry mancini score to the max after having viewed lifeforce for fifteen years on tape i have to say that the uncut dvd version was both great and disappointing the us version is so much better than the dvd european version the us version of lifeforce moves much faster the editing on the dvd version is terrible feels like an unfinished cut and the many scenes not seen in the american version add little or nothing to the final problem in fact one new moment almost destroys the entire movie when caine peter firth meets the male alien at the cathedral i love this scene in the us version though on the dvd the male alien speaks to caine and what he says is soooooo hilarious its the pinnacle of hilaritybr br itll be much less terrifying if you just come to me the male alien says in a deep 1950s style voice i was floored when i saw this it just doesnt belong in the movie that scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious flick im glad hooper or whoever cut that scene when the movie was released in north america there are several changes that were made for the us version that make lifeforce that much better and i wished the dvd had the us version the editing is sharp and frenzied without being annoying and some spots that were already boring in the us version are even more boring on the dvd version because of added scenes and the opening credits on the dvd is terrible much better in the us version more subtlebr br i love this film its basically aliens making a pitstop over earth and sucking up as much lifeforce as possible the film has too many flat uninspiring sequences talk talk talk but when the action goes to london its fun the film really shines in these scenes one can see hooper finally doing what hes great at chaos savagery horror lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes theyre the best apocalyptic scenes ever put on film its also the best zombie movie ever the zombies are hungry for lifeforce not flesh and theyre crazed and agile and terrifying not the slow moving bores of other zombie movies also a lot of people have criticized the ending but i love it it leaves you high and dry like one of the lifeforcedrained victimsbr br and to think this movie came out during the cute and cuddly 80s when people flocked to et or cocoon or other sweet and boring feel good scifi movies no wonder it bombed because it was way ahead of its time with its super nihilistic point of viewbr br as for the dvd well it aint great the image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras whatsoever but its great to see the movie in its widescreen format i just hope that theyll release a clean crisp us version on a dvd and with commentary by hooper and dykstra
