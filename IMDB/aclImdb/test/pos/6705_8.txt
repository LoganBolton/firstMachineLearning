something i think some people miss about great science fiction is that it predicts some part of the future no other theatrical movie that i can recall predicted that when the space shuttle went to study halleys comet that a disaster would occur some differences were the churchill the shuttle in the movie actually went to the comet the challenger was only in low earth orbit the churchill was merely burned out inside whereas the challenger explodedhey the vampires had to get back to earth one great similarity and this is always bad luck both had mixed malefemale crewsthe legend of halleys comet and disaster continuesbr br other than this there is not much more to be said about this movie that hasnt been said before as a outer spacescience fictionhorrorsex film individually it provided nothing really new but as in all great dishes it is the combination that counts and taken together this was a highly original and satisfying combinationbr br i just wish mathilda may would drain her victims through another part of the body
