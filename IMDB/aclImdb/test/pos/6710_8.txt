is it a perfect movie no it is a weird adaptation from a scifi book and it features vampires from space naked beauties and the british army efficiencybr br when i first saw this movie i was rather young and all i can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and mathilda may actually if it werent for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie i probably wouldnt have rated it so high but given her sheer magnificence i am now actually considering voting it upbr br lucky for me i got reminded of the movie and watched it again now imagine raiders of the lost ark or poltergeist special effects splattered unto a rather decent scifi story but with completely over the top performances i still enjoyed the movie tremendously as well as mathilda may but it was a mixture of nostalgia comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it endedbr br bottom line if you are a scifi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie oh and did i mention mathilda may is young beautiful and naked
