lifeforce is an extremely schizophrenic movie based on colin wilsons novel the space vampires the script ignores most of the novels concepts and structure  indeed it owes more to the quatermass serials than the novel  but the scenes it does leave in from the novel are nearly identical to those in the film  and talking of the script it must be one of the most uneven in cinema history  its though it was written in chapters by several different people take for instance carlson  he disappears after the early shuttle scenes which led me to believe he was dead then he turns up again halfway through the film in order to explain the plot to the beleaguered brits and its this lack of attention by the screenwriters that spoils the film  and theres plenty of other clumsy scripting such as the heroes returning to london in a helicopter and not realising it has been over run by zombies untill theyre flying over it br br i could go on at great length about these plot holes but lifeforce is actually enjoyable to watch as long as you dont use your brain  its good to see a scifi horror film from an era when aliens were portrayed as being cute creatures that children hid in their bedrooms so that nasty human adults wouldnt get their hands on them  the special effects and pyrotechnics are very very good  theres lots of action and stunts and lifeforce features one of the most memorable aliens in the form of the space girl  when mentioning lifeforce in conversation with males its always a race to say  seen the alien in lifeforce she can suck the lifeforce out of me anytime  hardly surprising looking at the demographics of the votes that this film is more popular with males than femalesbr br  dont worry  a naked girl cant escape from here  cant she  pitybr br
