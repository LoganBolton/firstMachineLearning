no lifeforce is not a great moviebr br its not a good moviebr br it is however an average movie with some good effects and a compelling storyline and of course mathilda may it may actually be one of my favorite sfhorror flicks for the very simple reason that they try to reason their way through the science of the space vampires how often do you see that not even in alien the sfhorror flick of all time does science come into the story at all in lifeforce they are trying to make reason of an unreasonable worldbr br now do i think its successful no i think the movie has the issue of a massive ensemble cast that hooper is straining to keep collected and on track and that the viewers have to focus on more than one villian and there are one too many road tripsbr br to be honest the movie is eye candy and fun to watch but there is great potential here for a superior remake to take a hold of what hooper was trying to do and really create a strong scary sfhorror moviebr br if the remake does happen however i demand that mathilda may have a cameo
