lifeforce starts in outer space where the hms churchill tracks haleys comet  its equipment detects a 150 mile long alien spaceship in the head of the comet unable to contact earth because of interference colonel tom carlsen steve railsback decides this is the one  only chance to investigate it going outside in spacesuits carlsen  some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship  find the remains of a bat like race of creatures  three perfect looking humanoids two men chris jagger  bill malin  a beautiful woman mathilda may all of whom they take aboard the churchill thirty days later  back on earth the churchill is detected on radar a rescue mission is sent up only to discover the spaceship is burnt out  all the crew supposedly dead the rescue team do find the three humanoid aliens though  take them back to earth where in a space research center in london they come back to life  start to literally suck the lifeforce out of human victims who then in turn need to do the same to stop themselves turning into dust things look grim as the epidemic spreads throughout londonbr br this english production was produced by the notorious menahem golan  yoram globus who during the early 80s were responsible for lots of cheap low budget action flicks under their production company cannon usually starring chuck norris  they wanted to move into the big time  signed director tobe hooper up on a three film deal which were this lifeforce the invaders from mars 1986 remake  the texas chainsaw massacre 2 1986 a sequel to hoopers own classic all of which flopped  basically bankrupt both golan  globus  cannon was no more anyway despite being a commercial flop at the boxoffice i have to say i think lifeforce is a highly enjoyable if rather silly scifi horror when originally released into theatres back in 85 lifefore was cut down to 101 minutes by golan  globus but over the past few years the longer 116 minute cut has all but replaced it on dvd vhs laserdisc  tv although apparently hoopers original cut of the film ran for 128 minutes so theres even more footage out there somewhere i will be basing my comments on the longer 116 minute cut the script by dan obannon don jakoby  uncredited rewrites by michael armstrong  olaf pooley was based on the 1976 novel the space vampires by colin wilson  has many extraordinary ideas its scope is truly ambitious  one felt that it ends up being a bit of a mess but a hell of an entertaining one it moves along like a rocket  at heart theres a really interesting story here although the film gets itself into a tangle there are also some hilarious moments in lifeforce the scene when the security guard tries to convince the naked female vampire to surrender by offering her a half eaten biscuit is a true camp classic the horribly overwrought hypnosis scenes including the one where railsback ends up kissing patrick stewart  many many more besides i dont know call me weird but i just thought lifeforce was tremendous fun  highly entertaining in just about every way from silly characters odd dialogue strange ideas that never quite come together  some terrific visuals lifeforce certainly isnt a film that will bore youbr br director hooper had just about more money here to play around with than he ever has double what he had for poltergeist 1982 even  he uses every bit of it to bring this spectacular film to the big screen john dykstra the guy responsible for star wars 1977 star trek the motion picture 1979  more recently spiderman 2002 was brought in to handle the visual effects  generally speaking they look fabulous the sequences set in outer space with spaceships in particular look great theres also some really good visual effects back on earth including the destruction of london as 100s of blue souls fly around everywhere theres some nudity but not much gore there are some withered corpses a few gunshot wounds the skin on someones hand peels off blood spurts from someones eyes nose  ears  theres a severed arm as well as some zombies the special makeup effects are also generally very good i wouldnt say lifeforce is scary as such as its more of a scifi film than horror i loved the way hooper shoots the outer space sequences as he keeps rotating his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness  that there is no solid floor as it werebr br with a supposed budget of about 25000000 it made less than half that in its theatrical run  hasnt set the world alight on video or dvd either which is a shame because although its a bit of a mess its very enjoyable to watch shot on location in england well filmed in 2351 widescreen the 43 cropped image is horrible  cuts huge chunks of information from both sides of the screen this is most noticeable during the opening scenes set in outer space where sometimes its hard to make out whats going on  the sense of the vastness of space  the alien spaceship is lost the acting is ok in a very silly film patrick stewart replaced sir john gielgud nancy paul replaced olivia hussey frank finlay replaced klaus kinski while anthony hopkins turned the role of caine downbr br lifeforce is a bizarre film no two ways about it really  anyone looking for something simple  straight forward should look elsewhere anyone looking for something a bit different in the scifi genre than give lifeforce a go as its one of those so bad its good films with some impressive effects  it isnt your average run of the mill film by any means
