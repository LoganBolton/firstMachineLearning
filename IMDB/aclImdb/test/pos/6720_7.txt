like several other reviewers here im surprised to see many negative reviews on this film dan obannons previous effort was the groundbreaking alien of 1979 because it and star wars introduced the stylistic approach of used or dirty space in artdirection for these kinds of features doesnt mean that this was the only way to produce thembr br rather than dismiss lifeforce outofhand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature its important to recognize that the film draws upon the esteemed traditions of british horror and sciencefiction  specifically hammer and american international features like quatermass specifically quatermass and the pit 1967 doctor who and the day of the triffids 1963 if not the works of gerry anderson ufo space1999 and thunderbirds but none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer obannons genrescholarly appreciation for queen of blood1966 and it the terror from beyond space1958  the immediate sources for alien 1979br br granted this film has some legacy elements but perhaps its worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers  1981s an american werewolf in london and the company of wolves 1984  other 80s films that share a lookingback while they adapt those stories to the 80s zeitgeist all three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same but substantially sexedup their themes because they could and at the same time they recognized the tongueincheek humorous aspects of their projectsbr br neil jordans wolves played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the 80s while american werewolf curdled its theme as a comingofage film its called artistic license and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latterday dramedy inherent in the scream franchise i know what you did last summer and final destination but these teentargeted films seem to be part of a boxoffice trend whereas the 80s films like lifeforce belong a canon of british scifi  even if this one was written by an americanbr br in many ways this film holds up much better than latterday disaster and alieninvasion flicks independence day armageddon deep impact in that the solutions dont reside in gunbattles weaponized payloads and testosterone at the opposite end of the pole it is unfortunate that steven soderbergh and james cameron didnt examine tarkowski and lem more closely before they remade solarisbr br the goal of this film was fun not ponderousness or stupiditybr br 710
