 and 12 stars out of  lifeforce is one of the strangest films ive ever seen so ridiculous yet at the time its strangely compelling and never the least bit dull whether its due to the nonstop nudity the large amount of violence and action it all comes together to make an entertaining 2 hours of cinemabr br the spaceshuttle churchill has been sent to investigate halleys comet when they detect something hiding inside the coma of the giant rock a small team led by colonel carlsen steve railsback has been sent to search the area what they discover includes hundreds of frozen batlike creatures and three nude and seemingly unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystalline containers two male and one female mathilda may they decide to take all three back with them which results in a catastrophebr br when london receives no response from the crew another crew is sent to find out whats going on when they dock with the churchill they find the remains of the crew all dessicated beyond recognition the humanoids are still in perfect condition and they take them back to londonbr br after various tests the scientists still dont know what these beings really are then late one night a security guard in the compound feels compelled to enter the room the female is being held he touches her shoulder and she awakens stands up and smiles at him in a seductive and wicked manner she approaches him and begins to kiss him when it becomes clear that shes actually taking his lifeforce sucking him of all of his energy the effect is slightly cheesybr br she escapes from the compound and begins to leave a trail behind another man colonel caine peter firth is brought in to track her down then the men discover that there is a pattern to the lifeforce process the corpse of the security guard awakens in 2 hours and takes the lifeforce of a doctor it seems in every 2 hours this process is repeated by a victim with the help of the churchills sole survivor carlsen they attempt to track the girl down before its too latebr br lifeforce is pretty good late night entertainment it has all the elements one could look for in such a movie loads of nudity bloodgore and plenty of special effects this is certainly better than a similarly plotted film species thanks in large part to a more riveting finalebr br the performances range from decent to terrible faring the worst is easily steve railsback who overacts to no end much better are peter firth who comes through and convincingly and the gorgeous mathilda may shes as beautiful as french actresses sophie marceau and emmanuelle seigner may does go through virtually the whole role without wearing clothing and there were reports that it was hard on her while filming so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without fidgeting and looking uncomfortable is impressive there are times when she can be quite creepy being simply seductive most of the film manages to work because of herbr br
