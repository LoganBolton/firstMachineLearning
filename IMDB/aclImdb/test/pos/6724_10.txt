i saw the korean version of daisy first it came across as a simple love story that flowed nicely from start to finish i saw it 3 times as i waited for my copy of the directors cut to arrivebr br then i got the dc and watched it wow i think this is the first real directors cut ive ever seen amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions the dc is laid out like a hardcore thriller with the love story in the background it moves at a slower pace than the korean versionthe variations between both versions are so drastic it seems like two totally different movies i thought i would be worn out watching the movie again toughing it out just to look for the added scenes that wasnt the case it really felt like i was watching a whole new moviebr br while the dc is 20 minutes longer than the korean version youll be hardpressed to pinpoint where or what has been changed 2 seconds chopped off here a second added there an entire scene added here another erased there in both versions scenes have been added omitted or chopped up and reordered in some scenes entire lines of dialogue were replaced or reordered  while the scene itself was untouched even simple sound effects were addedomitted from each version  having a major impact on the mood of the film and sometimes even changing the outcome of a scene what comes across as a tender moment in the korean version is a sad somber one in the dc the endings of both versions leave room for interpretation as far as i can tell both versions end a lot different and were intended that waybr br im assuming most people will be acquiring the directors cut of the film and will find the movie pretty decent but a little long and boring if thats the case look for the korean version same movie but different feel i think theres a deluxe 3dvd version that contains both cuts of the film  not surebr br the versions compliment each other so well that as a pair ill watch daisy more often than i do any of my other favorite korean movies alone id say the korean version is a nice love story that id watch once in awhile the directors cut ill watch maybe once or twice then never again as i find the pacing dull but they just go so well together for what i consider the best experience id say watch the korean version first then watch the directors cut to help fill in the gaps of the story that you were curious aboutbr br the editing is the real star of the film
