flowers if its one thing youll take away from this movie its gonna be the flowers they feature so prominently and are used as plot devices youll become an expert in identifying with daisies and black tulips by the time the movie endsbr br set in amsterdam daisy tells the frustrating love triangle story between 1 girl and the 2 men in her life one a professional hitman eking out a living the other an interpol agent featuring a panasian cast korean hong kong and crew director andrew lau from hong kong writer from korea and a thai post production team i could imagine the headaches in coordinationbr br park yi jung woosung is a hitman who found a soft spot for painter hyeyoung played by the pretty jeon jihyun its love at first sight in the meadows of daisies where her clumsiness caught his attention however being shy and ever mindful of the dangers of his professional career he can only admire her from afar do little or perhaps big things for her in an anonymous fashion but the one that takes the cake is sending her potted daisies everyday without fail at 415pm he becomes her guardian angel from afar shielding her and keeping her safe from harmbr br hyeyoung is in love with this mysterious stranger she is constantly waiting for him to appear but i really wonder how difficult could that be given the almost punctual daisy delivery nonetheless shes terribly moved and touched by this sole act however as the stars would have it interpol detective jeong woo lee sungjae chances upon hyeyoung at a town square during one of his undercover missions and he too is captivated by her in a similar fashion because of his profession he is doubtful if he should make the first movebr br which is where the audience would find it frustrating the lady obviously would fall for the wrong guy then again its the good guy park yi being infuriated by jeong woos pursuit but yet still refuses to step out and identify himself and jeong woo being the opportunist in grabbing the free anonymous identity unwittingly its almost as if you wanna give everyone a slap to wake them all upbr br that aside it is precisely this tension that keeps you intrigued and it is wickedly fun to watch the two male leads finding it tough to fall in love without jeopardizing their careers or their loved one but fret not action fans there are enough catandmouse revelations and unsaid camaraderie in the mould of infernal affairs as well as ample gunfights although i felt the ending could have been scripted tighterbr br what rocks is the clever editing telling the story in a nonlinear timeline no worries it aint that bad youll still be able to follow the narrative from the points of view of all the leads keeping you in suspense and culminating in a three way split screen showcasing all their emotions in a single converging event which i thought was extremely welldonebr br its a beautiful film in terms of landscapes of lush meadows and busy city squares with plenty of classical music to sooth the soul as with romance movies all the leads are eye candy  the girls will have a field day with the two handsome male leads while the guys have to make do with a somewhat pudgyfaced argh ok lah at certain angles jeon jihyunbr br if youre into a romance movie with an equal balance in the actiontension department then daisy would be your choice if you prefer a more conventional weepy then the other korean movie making its debut here at the same time you are my sunshine would be your alternative and yes i totally dig the ending scene which i thought only the koreans do it best kinda reminded me of the jsa one
