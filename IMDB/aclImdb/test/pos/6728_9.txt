this film has haunted me since i saw it when i was about 8 years old i didnt know what it was called so am so pleased to have tracked it down finally i remember being quite scared because id just been to a tin mine in cornwall when i watched it so could imagine it all fortunately i didnt see any ghosts of dead children there but i found this film really quite disturbing and scary when i was much younger ive certainly never forgotten it even though i couldnt find it anywhere i seem to remember the childrens film foundation films being generally good but they dont show them at all any more i also remember programmes like the children of green knowe in the same era on bbc  equally unsettling in its own way
