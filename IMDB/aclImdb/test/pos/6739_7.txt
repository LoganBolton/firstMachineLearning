this is a gently amusing comingofage comedy that comes from the later more mature period of neil simons writing although there are plenty of wisecracks to go around this is not one of those neil simon pieces where every character spouts out oneliner jokes for 2 hours like theyre guest stars on a bob hope special there are also dramatic elements some work some are overkill that lend some weight to the storybr br the performances are good across the board especially blythe danner as the mother although she and judith ivey were oddly waspish choices to play jewish women ive never been a fan of jonathan silverman but i will say that he hits the right notes as the obnoxious gawky and totally hornedup teenage narratorprotagonist of the storybr br the movie is very similar in tone to woody allens radio days but the latter is far more imaginative and funny than this one
