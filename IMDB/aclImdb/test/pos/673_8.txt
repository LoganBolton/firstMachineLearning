i particularly enjoyed dellys review of this film and agree that howard is not the only damaged character howard is rather ruthlessly setup by the script but there is no evidence that his previous employer is actually dead or if she is that he murdered her howard doesnt know and neither do we in terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there he bolts however he never actually harms helen gordon no matter how enraged he is indeed he reacts with horror at helens fainting spell and the fact that he is holding a pair of scissorsthen he resumes his tidying up and greets the recovered helen with the almost pathetic  im very tired now i think ill go home frankly i dont think hes a psychopath a sick puppy certainly but not a psychopathbr br the problem with howard is that he has no real male identity he wanted to serve his country but his mental condition denies him a place in the army he is singularly rootless and isolated no wife no girl no home again at least as far as we know and he does a womans job  floors are my speciality helens niece ruthlessly strips away this pride in his thoroughness by exclaiming caustically that she would want a man with a real job also although he finds himself strongly attracted to helen he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass he is remarkably powerless  cant fight cant work cant make lovebr br helen is justifiably terrified however she tries to connect to him but finding that he doesnt respond normally ie way outside the comfort zone provided by her rosetinted memories of husband ned unwittingly presses all howards buttons by lying to him in her attempt to escapebr br both characters trapped in the house trapped by fear neuroses rage and memory deserve sympathy i know the sudden ending has disappointed some reviewers but i felt it fitted well as it offered a kind of release to the characters helen is freed i think from the past when howard tries on her husbands army coat helens disgusted reaction is highlighted she no doubt feels that the sacredness of neds possessions has been violated but hopefully her need to keep everything untouched has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger perhaps she can move onbr br howard is also freed  from his endless cycle of anger hurt and violence whether he moves on to treatment or to jail is debatable but i hope its the formerbr br great performances from ryan and lupino i prefer on dangerous ground but this is pretty good too
