i found this little gem as an extra feature on my dvd of vampyrder traum des allen grey and didnt expect all that much from it it looked like it might be an interesting little short though so i turned it onbr br i am so glad that i did it was really incredible despite having been made more than 70 years ago the animation was in my view better than some of that done today with all the computer effects and experience available nowbr br the story is quite simplea newly put together toy dog hears its owners laments about not being able to afford an orange and goes on a quest to find her one in the process it runs into a toys underworld with all sort of nefarious creatures and toys overseen by none other than the devil himself who all want the dogs orange for themselves as wellbr br this film precedes but reminds me a lot of mad monster party 1969 jules bassa movie which i have always really enjoyedand to a lesser extent some of tim burtons animated worksthe nightmare before christmas 1993 henry selick and corpse bride 2005 tim burton fans of any of these movies will i am sure also love the mascotbr br overall an incredible piece of short animation which is well worth watching
