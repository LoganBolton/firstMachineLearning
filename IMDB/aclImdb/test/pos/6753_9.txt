i agree with most of mr riveras comments and i just want to ad a couple of caveats this film the mascot is criminally neglected in its current form for that matter so is vampyr the mascot isnt a bonus feature its tacked on as a chapter in vampyr even though its made very clear that this is a separate movie it should have been treated as such by the manufacturers and while im at it vampyr needs some of that same respect and cleaning up as well i got the feeling the decision to put the mascot on there went something like thisbr br dude a we just transferred vampyr to dvd but it comes up about 20 minutes short we need to put something on there that wont cost much money can you believe film critics want to be paid to talk about films dude b not to worry i have this little animation thingy thats been sitting in my drawer just go ahead and throw it on as an additional chapter dude a youre awesome dude b the animations of the mascot is great and theres no need for me to repeat what mr riveras done so well however this thing needs some major cleaning and restoring especially the audio the plot comes through in the dialogue and in my copy there were so many hisses pops and places where the sound just dropped right off i would have had no idea what the dog was going after without having read the box no amount of volume was going to make the words more understandable it just brought up the tinniness and made the hisses and pops louderbr br bottom line is starewiczs films need to be put into a respectful collection cleaned up spiffed up liner notes and the whole nine yards in other words they need to be criterionized 9 out of 10 for the movie not the product which would get only a 5
