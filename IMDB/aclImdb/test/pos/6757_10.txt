a brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of its time and certainly far ahead of anything that was being released in mass production at the same point in history the influence of this work upon tim burtons nightmare before christmas is readily apparent one can only imagine how starewicz slaved over every beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiecebr br there have been very few animated films of this caliber its a shame that more people havent seen this gembr br apparently imdb now requires comments to be at least ten lines long so this is the tenth line this must be something new  but i really dont have anything else to say
