this movie is a mix of a dark comedy and a drama about two guys who worked in a butchers shop and wanted to build up their own when they finally fulfilled that dream they faced a new problem there were no clients one day by accident one guy dies in the refrigerator room and a new kind of butchers business begins they start selling human flesh saying to the clients its just chicken and their business starts to improve human flesh sells good oh i forgot to say something these guys arent normal theres really something missing in their brains br br the movie has some nice dark humour scenes but it is in my opinion mostly a drama one that shows us what is inside the head of a psychopath what are his motivations to what he does i must confess i was a bit surprised with the ending of the movie because i never expected they could make it without been discovered but thats probably because i see too many hollywood movies what i mean by this is that in hollywoods cinema we always expect the punishment of the guys which do the bad things theres always a morality protecting the good values in spite of we all know that in real life it doesnt happen this way too many times and i liked this movie mostly because of that because it fits in a kind of cinema which is true frontal without fake moralities and which see what is on the other side behind the conventional morality it just happens in independent cinema especially in the european br br besides therere excellent performances by nikolaj lie kass and mads mikkelsen especially the first one in the roles of the disturbed guys br br very nice danish film
