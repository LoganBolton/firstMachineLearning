ok so im not usually one that runs out and rents foreign moviesespecially foreign dark comedies i think i can count on one hand the number of films that i found genuinely hilarious from beginning to end this movie will be added to the short list even dark comedies right out of hollywood sometimes turn me off because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor but this one had my eyes welling up with tears my sides hurt i havent laughed that hard in a long time this movie was recommended by my mother and i dont think i would have even dreamed of watching it had she not raved about it dont be afraid of having to read during your movie  youll miss out on a hilariously wellacted flick
