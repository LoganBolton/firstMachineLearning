of adams apple and with your permission i didnt know until looking it up just now also the errrrrrmmmmm wilbur wants to kill himself i prefer this very focused deadpan drama over adams apples over the top comedic zeal but with your permission is much more layered and subtle but thats another directorbr br once the meaty part of the story takes place i felt the dread of coming back to the shop again and again a bit claustrophobic  maybe that is intentional it builds on the atmosphere you dread the rediscovery and again and again until the kick in the shinbr br this is some funny stuff
