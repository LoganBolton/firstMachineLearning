the art of the absurd is alive and thriving in current danish cinema well at least it is in this movie nobody in this movie are amused they are all either annoyed or shocked and if they arent yet they soon will be it is a story of screwups murder embarrassment dignity and in the end love and redemption the chilling awkward humorous style is idiomatic and wont appeal to everyone but personally i found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd you pity the characters from a distance even as you dislike them up close and personal but their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them even when they get away with murderbr br this is in my judgment definitely the best danish movie of the last few yearsbr br 9 out of 10
