this is by far the best movie ive seen in a long while it is a wholly original and beautiful plot it is not boring nor is it too dramatic the characters are tangible and realistic but it does not take away from the story line the fact that is not in english is most likely the final touch the end leaves you fulfilled in a way ive never experienced in a movie before br br i wish i had found this movie earlierbr br more linesbr br more linesbr br more lines a lot more lines cmon im done
