the game was made in 1996 but it is still good today the graphics is not that hot and the actors are not oscarworthy but the plot is twisted diabolic and highly enjoyable the dark story is compelling from the first film and is continuing throughout all the play we played several people together for several reasons 1 to use all our minds together 2 not to be so afraidbr br play this game and you wont regret this just dont try to find a quake engine in there
