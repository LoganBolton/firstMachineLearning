a teenaged girl gets the horse of her dreams and is trained by an exjockey to participate in londons grand national steeplechase a fine adaptation of the classic childrens book with an excellent startmaking performance by taylor as the energetic but polite youngster rooney is ok as her trainer although he has some overly melodramatic moments crisp and revere are quite good as taylors loving parents filmed in technicolor it looks beautiful the problems are that there are corny elements nothing very interesting happens and it drags on a bit too long the race is exciting but could have been much more so
