the movie with its single set minimal cast and straightforward photography except for a couple of brief special effects reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during tvs early years nonetheless the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow ida lupino as she tries to deal with her semipsychotic handyman robert ryan before one of his moodswings kills her and who better to play the troubled part than that great actor ryan he wasnt very versatile watching him essay comedy is almost painful but no one was better at wounded idealism on dangerous ground or the psychic pain of this movie few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figurebr br lupinos problem is that shes locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next the suspense comes from her various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape its a nailbiter all the way this is not one of lupinos many fine soulful parts that she was so good at instead its a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough my favorite scene is with ryan and bratty teenager margaret whiting ryans already having difficulty with his masculinity and what others are saying about him then when whiting walks in and finds the attractivelooking ryan scrubbing the floor she starts getting coy flirting with her budding sexuality sensing trouble ryan abruptly fends her off finesse is not his strong suit insulted whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work womens work that does it up to that point hes been courteous and professional with lupino trying to set himself on a normal path but whiting has hit his raw nerve now theres heck to pay as whiting bounces out the door leaving lupino to pay the price its a riveting scene expertly donebr br anyway this is one of the dozen or so films produced by lupino and her husband at a time when audiences were moving away from these little blackandwhites in favor of widescreen spectacles too bad what a hugely talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front she deserves at least an honorary oscar from a movie industry to which she contributed so much
