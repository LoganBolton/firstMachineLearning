first let me say that i find films like shawshank redemption and green mile and most of spielberg to be absolutely horrid and stomach turning although national velvet on the surface would seem to be in the same genre and has what should be cringeworthy moments i thoroughly enjoyed it laughing and bawling throughout the filmbr br the premise of the plot a young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the grand national is certainly as implausible as could be but it is the only thing that you have to accept for it to work as a fairy tale or allegory the characters have depth and grow throughout the story ann revere gives an absolutely stunning performance as one of the wisest women ever depicted in an american film her interaction with the goodhearted donald crisp is funny and sweet while liz taylor tries a bit too hard to be even cuter than margaret obrien she succeeds btw her passion and love for her horse shines through her face mickey rooney gives a beautifully nuanced performance of the trainerbr br this is far from a perfect movie some of the situations and scenes are a bit corny and dated the kids antics and rooneys scenes at the track and in the pub for example but it doesnt matter the plot remains true to the characters and leaves quite a bit unsaid we dont have unnatural overly dramatic and preachy moments  sometimes more is less the final scene is a great example of this  the emotional dialog is left to the viewer to fill inbr br strong understated performances rounded characters pithy dialog intelligent and internally consistent storyline we believe in the characters and are moved by their story yup  they just dont make them like this any more
