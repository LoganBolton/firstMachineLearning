in my opinion national velvet is one of the top family classics of all time it features mickey rooney as mi taylor and elizabeth taylor as velvet brownbr br velvet wins a race horse named pie in a raffle she falls in love with it right away with the help of mi an exjockey they train it to race in the grand nationals after the jockey who was scheduled to race pie backs out at the last moment mi convinces velvet to take his placebr br this was a well put together motion picture fine storyline and top notch acting the inner play between elizabeth and mickey was magical this is a wonderful family picture expertly directed by clarence brown the photography is stunning this is a movie you will enjoy for years to comebr br this picture is what made elizabeth taylor a household name both mickey and elizabeth remained close after the film they still send post cards to each other after all these many years br br one side note elizabeth loved the horse pie so much that the studio gave it to her
