one of the enduring classics from mgm came out in the closing years of world war ii its the film that made young elizabeth taylor a star she had done a few films as a child actress before national velvet but when it came out her place in the movies was assured ironically enough biologically shed be growing up fast enough after national velvet was out and her next struggle as an actress was to get substantial adult roles because casting directors only saw her as innocent little velvet brown who loved her jumping horsebr br im not sure of how this would work because steeplechase horses have to have confirmed bloodlines and the pis are a subject not dealt with in national velvet all we know is that hes a reckless and untrainable horse in the hands of reginald owen and after he breaks free and causes considerable damage owen gets rid of him for a nominal price to the local butcher donald crispbr br at the same time as these things are happening mickey rooney comes wandering into the lives of the brown family which consists of crisp wife anne revere and daughters angela lansbury juanita quigley and elizabeth taylor and their little brother butch jenkins rooney is a former jockey whos now on the open road and heading for the brown family where his father was once a horse trainer for anne reveres family its he who sees the potential of the pi short for pirate as a steeplechase jumper and its elizabeth who convinces crisp not to pass up this chancebr br elizabeth taylor was so sweet and innocent in national velvet the good book says you have to have faith like a child and she has it to spare she infuses rooney with it to have faith in the heart and ability of the pi and to leave a little over for himselfbr br anne revere won a best supporting actress award for national velvet shes a very wise mother who has hidden depths to her that the audience doesnt suspect it turns out that back in her youth she had a taste of fame and glory swimming the english channel and her prize money saved all these years she gives to her daughter that scene is probably what won her the oscar national velvet also won one other academy award for film editingbr br over 60 years after it made its debut national velvet as a family classic hasnt lost a thing its depiction of life between the world wars in great britain is still a standout and national velvet launched a movie legend cant do much better than that for high regard
