for a film by a first time director this is a simply amazing little film though i have to admit that its a bit hard to watch and will probably offend the sensibilities of many who watch it as the film takes a definite stand in favor of assisted suicide however what i loved about the film is that i had no idea this is what the film was about until the film was more than half complete and by then i was already hookedbr br in addition to the excellent way the subject was introduced i was amazed at the very professional style of the filmwith some of the best cinematography ive ever seen in a short film plus this camera work was combined so well with music and images that made the film just beautifulbr br as i said this is a controversial film i myself struggle with what i think about this debate but the film managed to make a statement in such a literate and intelligent way i really have to respect the team who made this film
