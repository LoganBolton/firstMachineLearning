this short has all the elements of a great movie every time i show it to friends on dvr they love it too the dialog is so real the acting is superb while the effectsprops werent as convincing by themselves taken with everything else in the shot they are expertly placedused the music is so haunting perfect for this kind of moment film people who hold dear their beliefs and thoughts are shaken to their core about what they see in this movie most go thats it but in the end they blossom with new understanding and leave the movie with one word to describe itbr br beautiful the beauty of the film is also skin deep i love the fact that there arent any conflicting views no other voices and the voices that you do hear are agreeing with each other no conflict but at the same time there is one and the ending made me love it more harsh reality sometimes is more film worthy than any plot device or twist br br wasnt joshua leonard the guy in blair witch project  movie by a fictitious dead guygreat
