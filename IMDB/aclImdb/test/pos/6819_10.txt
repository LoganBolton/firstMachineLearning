i watched this short moments ago on the sundance film festival website and i must say it is absolutely astounding i expected it to be entertaining  like all of the sundance shorts  but i wasnt prepared for such deep sadness and yet also a sense of passion and beauty br br if you havent yet seen any of this years entries to the festival i suggest you go onto the site and watch these minimasterpieces  i have seen them all and can honestly say the youth in us is the one that has touched my heart the most im not the weakest audience member when it comes to romance in films but my eyes flooded up so much im surprised i could still see the screenbr br i agree with addicted2you it truly is a masterful piece of directorial work and the cinematography will just take your breath away br br i cant think of a better way to spend a spare 12 minutes
