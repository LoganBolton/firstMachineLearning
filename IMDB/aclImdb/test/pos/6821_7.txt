joseph conrads timeless novel heart of darkness was depicted in the 1994 movie i have read conrads novel and i must say even though i prefer the novel itself the movie was a great depiction the set and costume designs brought conrads novel to life on the screen as we followed marlows journey the acting also brought the characters to life through the mannerisms voices and personalities if you have read the novel i recommend that you also view this movie if you have not read the novel however the movie may be harder to follow conrads heart of darkness is too full of action emotion and information to be made into a movie that is a little over an hour and a half long therefore if you have not read the novel the plot in the movie may seem too cluttered to follow overall i gave this movie a seven out of ten the basic plot of the novel was brought forth to the screen with great sets costumes and acting nothing can replace joseph conrads original work however
