i cannot understand the need to jump backwards and forwards to scene set and pad out the plot showing that someone has a skill right before they use it i believe is offending our intelligence its starting to feel a little contrived and as though they are making up for being so vague for the first three series a little disappointing this episodebr br furthermore using past quirks like lockes ability to know when a storm is ending is frankly insulting are we supposed to ooh and arr or laugh at the softer side of lockebr br this episode was all over the place
