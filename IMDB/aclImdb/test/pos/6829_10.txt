the second episode of the new lost gives you just what its fans were lacking  a fair amount of riveting action from the very first scene you keep seeing brand new features you werent expecting to encounter its the best proof that the series ingoing its 4th season is still alive and kicking hardbr br although the producers dont amaze us with some more flashforwards this time the return to flashbacks is more than satisfying as it brings some shocking facts the flashbacks introduce a few fresh characters and the familiar ones turn out to be connected in a surprising waybr br the fresh characters dominate the whole episode and i cant say it does any harm their scenario parts and their actors both do extremely well providing us with a bracing feel  right after the episode youll realize that the show really needed people just like that and here they arebr br confirmed dead is full of gripping action and greatly written dialogues im sure ill quote the best scenes of the episode for the long time  theyre just that good that they remain on the spectators mind the episode is entertaining smart and perky you like lost you have to watch it my vote is ten
