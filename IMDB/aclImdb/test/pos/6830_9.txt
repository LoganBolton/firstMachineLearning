the movie was good really the only reason i watched it was alan rickman which he didnt pull off the southern accentbut he did pretty well with itknow emma thompson did really good she definitely pulled off the southern accent i like all the character in my opinion not one of them did badanother thing i have notice i have read all these comment and not one person has comment on alan 5 0clock shadow which made him look even better and he pretty much had one through the whole movie i would give the movie a 9 out of 10 another one of my opinions is the movie would been better if there wasnt any sex still it was alright love the scene were he says aw sht when he is setting in his car and see them in his mirror
