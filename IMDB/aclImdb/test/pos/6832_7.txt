i got this movie from ebay mainly because im gay and i love til schweiger however its one of those movies that when you watch it a second time you never say to yourself hmm i forgot about this boring part ill go make popcorn it doesnt have that part its a very fluid and constantly interesting film and yes til schweiger is worth it if nothing else but its a great movie even for straight guys
