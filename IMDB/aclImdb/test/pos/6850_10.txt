carla gugino literally melts the screen in this crime caper her sex appeal ample assets and sexy southern accent more than make this film rewatchable but the film has so many other things to make it almost a modern classic simon bakers performance for one thing truly that of a great actor til schweiger is so perfectly cast it makes me wonder why hes not a huge crossover star gil bellows rounds out this motely crew and literally steals this show other guginos cleavage easily the best performance in the movie emma thompson and alan rickman are so utterly brillianti cannot even describe it great chemistrybr br the music is so powerfully eclectic that it was a character in and of itself wonderous to beholdbr br people may say its tarantino influencedi disagree its clearly unique and clever in its own right sebastian gutierrez does a wonderful job at directing this tightly woven film and underplaying a lot of scenes that left me reeling the ending is perfectly sinister and you never see it coming all in all a lovely film that to me is the very definition of what a good movie should be
