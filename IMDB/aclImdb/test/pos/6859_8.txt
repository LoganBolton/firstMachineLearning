i was going to use the german scream as a summary but that was already taken lol it sums up anatomy nicely provided youre not alien to reading subtitles anatomy fits in snugly with the screamurban legend pack its a teenhorror set in a medical school where the students are going missing then turning up as experiment subjects in the dissection lab cue one plucky student investigating herself and uncovering a giant conspiracybr br provided youre watching the original german language film i cant comment on the dub having not seen the english edition anatomy is sharply written and cleverly plotted so that the tension never really lets up in comparison to its american counterparts the mystery is uncovered much faster meaning that instead of being a slasher right up until the final reveal anatomy evolves during its running time from a slashercomebody horror movie into a smart and exciting thriller its a gripping ride from start to finishbr br hats off to the actors involved as well franka potente proves once more that shes an intelligent smart actress who can make any role come to life her central performance as paula is a great foundation for the movie to build from the spooky lecturers and their teachers pets are equally good a truly foreboding presence at all timesbr br its also astounding that the movie doesnt drag much the pace is fast and punchy very similar to the earlier urban legend meaning that theres always something going on to keep your attention high if theres one downside it could be that some will find anatomy too gruesome for them but if you persevere through the first halfs admittedly graphic dissection sequences the latter half with its exciting thriller overtones will reward you i recommend anatomy to anyone who enjoys a good teenhorror but is a bit jaded with the american take on the matter
