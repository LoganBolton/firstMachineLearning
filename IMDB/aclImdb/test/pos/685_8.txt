i swear if i did ever tried cocaine id be able to relate to this film perfectly its pace as well as the dialog churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their headsbr br there are great little elements that pop up through out the film like how rob lowes character seems to always be loosing a shoe or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path the story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawlessbr br the movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness this is one i think most could enjoy a few laughoutloudevenifyouarealone moments ensure that ill certainly be watching this again
