i saw unfortunately the dubbed version on encorebr br student paula henning franka potente who was also in the cult favorite run lola run stars as a serious medical student who gets into a prestigious school in germany but she soon discovers that some students go missing and the bodies they work on in the anatomy lab are incredibly freshbr br i was stuck seeing the dubbed version on encore it hurt a lot the words not matching the lips got annoying real quick but i still liked what i saw the acting was good it was beautifully photographed it wasnt too gruesome and i was never bored even more refreshing was a likable heroine who fights back when the bad guys go after her the mild nudity was in a refreshing twist male a previous poster mentions benno furmann who is excellent showed his butt but i dont remember seeing it regardless this is a well done scary and excellent thriller from all ive read the original german language version is the best i dont doubt that for one second but the dubbed version is watchable i give this a 7
