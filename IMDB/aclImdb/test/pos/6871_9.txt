late one night on tom snyders tomorrow show i watched tom ask his guest henry morgan what he considered to be perfect morgan responded anything with glenda jackson and although i wouldnt consider this film to be perfect it does bear out that notion very well i was about to use the clich√© about hollywood not making pictures like this anymore but then i just saw up in the air another intelligent film about 2 people over the age of 35 who fall in love thats where the similarities end though house calls is just sheer fun watching 2 pros like matthau and jackson hit it off and seem completely natural while theyre at it i saw this film in the theater in 1978 at the ripe old age of 18 and it took me another 20 years to get all of the jokes any film that can make punch lines out of 1920s tennis great bill tilden and british prime minister neville chamberlain wouldnt play too well at the megaplex these days one other thought the original theatrical release featured a walk on the beach  fall in love montage set to the beatlesgeorge harrison tune something it seemed a bit forced at the time but that song has since been swapped out for a rather generic henry mancini music cue for subsequent home video and cable release too bad because that scene just lays there now another victim of music licensing hell
