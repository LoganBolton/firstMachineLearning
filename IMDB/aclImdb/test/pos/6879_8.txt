notorious hk catiii actor anthony wong is for once wellnot actually once  he was a cop in the daughter of darkness films and a few othersnot a psychopathic weirdo in erotic nightmare usually recognized for his role as a complete wackadoo in such catiii nasties like the untold story and the ebola syndrome  this time wong is on the receivingend of the nastinessbr br wong plays a guy who goes to a sorcerer who promises to give him really good dreams for a price true to his word the dreams that wong has involve having mad donkey sex with smokin hot schoolgirls  but the dreams come with a price thats more than money the sorcerer can manipulate the dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost blackmails wong out of his cash and business kills his family and eventually kills wong himselfwongs brother comes to town to find out whats going on and eventually finds that his familys murder is the work of the evil sorcerer  but as it turns out  wongs brother is a pretty dopeass sorcerer himself and with the help of the sorcerers abused wife  turns the tables on the sorcerer and his schemesbr br erotic nightmare is one of the more enjoyable catiii films ive seen in a while absent is the gritty and dark feel of some of the other catiii entries like red to kill the untold story or human pork chop  erotic nightmare though still sleazy in terms of sex and subject matter is more fun then some of the more serious films of the genre more comparable to eternal evil of asia  a more carefree catiii entry that delivers plenty in terms of nudity and a good bit of gore without being overly comedic either definitely worth a look especially to the genre enthusiast 810
