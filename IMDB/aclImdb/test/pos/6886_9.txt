i couldnt disagree more with those who says this is a lousy movie me and my friend went to see it during the stockholm film festival and this was actually one of my favorite movies during the festival dolls being used in horror movies arent something new but i havent seen that many movies were it has been as well carried out as it is in this movie the atmosphere the setting the actors the camerawork everything is just beautiful and they really work well with each other now if you expect this film to be another grudge or ring then you probably wont like it but if your out for a good stylized scare then its perfect even though its pretty predictable and at some times laughable i still recommend this to anyone who likes horror flicks go see it now
