this program is a favorite of our family and we feel it must be released on dvd by seasons the title of promised land is very apt as it is a positive statement about all the good that is left in this great country and the people who live in her its a god bless america type of program with inspiring stories oldfashioned values downtoearth characters truthful and encouraging messages beautiful scenery and wellwritten humor and drama its a show the entire family is able to enjoy and benefit fromwithout worrying about bad language adult themes crudeness violence etc we always felt blessed when we were done viewing an episode and cant wait to see each one all over again when theyre finally released on dvd
