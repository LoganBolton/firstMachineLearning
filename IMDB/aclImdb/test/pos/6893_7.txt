i saw i smell the dead  sorry i sell the dead  at a press screening glenn mcquaid the films writerdirectoreditor is a laddish irishman who introduced the screening by announcing that  whilst it was in progress  he would be going out for a pint i dont begrudge him a drink but  by telling us about it  he seemed to feel he needed to certify his laddishness or his irishness or both when the opening credits rolled there were  as usual at press screenings  loud ovations for the names of every actor or crew member whod got friends in the audience and silence for those who hadnt mcquaid returned for a witty qa afterwardsbr br this horror movie doesnt take itself seriously which is good because its humour is considerably stronger than its horror only one scene is even remotely scary and most of the horror is merely grossout but i laughed throughout much of the filmbr br this movie appears to be set in ireland circa 1850 by which time graverobbing was mostly defunct the story is told in flashback we get flashbacks within flashbacks and the narrating character flashbacks material that he couldnt know about because sometimes he wasnt present or in one case because the action is unfolding behind his backbr br the story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine guillotines werent used in 19thcentury ireland but  for once  we actually see a plausible guillotine sequence the prisoner struggles on his way to execution the rope cleats are accurate and the prisoner manages to look up to see the blade overhead and theres a payoff later to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itselfbr br the characters are ostensibly irish but one major character speaks in cockney slang using phrases like a mugs game and take a butchers for have a look for once actors in 19thcentury roles display 19thcentury dental hygiene yet nearly all the clothes and hairstyles and the womens makeups are resolutely 21stcentury im not complaining in the case of heather bullock who wears a very fetching black miniskirt cozzie that appears to be pvc phworrbr br the lead actors except ron perlman are excellent but most of the supporting cast have no sense of the victorian period the worst offender is joel garland as the publican whose characterisation is firmly rooted in the twentyfirst century just when i thought that garlands performance couldnt get any less victorian he used his fingers to make ironic airquotesbr br the sets especially angus scrimms lab are detailed and impressive yet failed to convince me that people actually lived and worked in these places nearly every interior contains burning candles but never once did i see what would have been there if these were actual victorian homes or workplaces leftover drippings from previous candlesbr br one scene features an extraterrestrial i was annoyed that mcquaid plumped for a stereotypical grey schwa alien rather than something originalbr br there are splendid montage sequences but mcquaid opts for flashy effects  splitscreens overhead shots  that dont serve the story i was impressed by a recurring bluescreen device superimposing the main characters heads over other backgrounds less effective was a recurring creepshowstyle motif of camera shots morphing actors faces into drawings resembling panel art from 1950s ec horror comics im a fan of ec comics but they dont belong in 19thcentury ireland the money that mcquaid spent on flashy photo fx  showing off his editing skills without serving the story  shouldve been spent on accurate costumesbr br big spoilers now ron perlman gives an oirish performance full of actingschool tics ostensibly playing a 19thcentury irish priest he writes with his left hand in victorian ireland lefthanded children were punished for using the devils hand and were forcibly retrained to become righties but perlmans character turns out to have a reason for concealing his right hand elsewhere a character is bitten by a zombie yet suffers no ill effects so i knew thered be a payoff later several scenes that would more logically take place at night are shot in daylight apparently only because this was easier and less expensive since mcquaid is a proficient director and editor he could easily have shot day for night  but using a processphotography effect to help tell the story seems to interest him much less than showing off his flashy editing techniquesbr br mcquaid seems to be giving homage to those great old hammer horror flicks but those hammers were so great because the actors and production designers worked hard to convince us that we were actually witnessing events in 1888 whitechapel or wherever i sell the dead almost entirely fails to evoke the 19th centurybr br glenn mcquaid shows talent as a director scripter and editor yet in all three capacities here he makes odd choices  then largely fails to justify those choices but i enjoyed i sell the dead ill rate it 7 out of 10 and i look forward to his next movie
