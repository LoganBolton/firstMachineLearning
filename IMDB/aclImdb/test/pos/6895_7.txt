i sell the dead is a big sloppy horror comedy that refuses to take itself too seriously this has advantages and drawbacks the 85 minutes of the film breeze by and the film is full of bits sometimes funny sometimes scary sometimes gory occasionally all three at once but the individual bits are much better than the sum of the films partsbr br the story such as it is follows professional grave robber arthur blake played by dominic monaghan arthurs partnerincrime willie grimes larry fessenden has just had his head chopped off for murder and arthur has one night left before his own head is forfeit for the same crime arthur insists that he is innocent of murder but there are plenty of other crimes that he is willing to confess to when bribed with irish whisky by a catholic priest played by ron perlmanbr br since the movie is a series of graverobbing anecdotes confessed by arthur it becomes a sort of horror anthology  a series of disjointed tales all linked by a similar cast arthur and willie and a similar theme grave robbing like most horror anthologies there is no consistent mythology because all mythologies are true and happening simultaneously even when they contradict one anotherbr br it probably didnt help that i saw this film the same night as trick r treat a horror anthology that avoids all of the traps that i sell the dead falls into in fact trick r treat designed as an anthology tells a more unified consistent story than i sell the dead which is intended to be a united narrativebr br the other problem with the film and i recognize that this is insane nitpicking is the way the film plays fast and loose with history grimes is killed with a guillotine we might be able to stretch a point and say that he is killed by a scottish maiden a precursor to the french guillotine but the scottish maiden was abandoned in 1709 and this film is set a good hundred years later since burke and hare are mentioned and they were executed for murder in 1829 grave robbing as an industry became obsolete with the passage of the anatomy act 1832 so the film must take place before thenbr br i know that bringing this up is the ultimate in historical nerdiness and we are clearly dealing with a universe where all sorts of dead undead and legendary dead are possible but the easiest way to anchor a fantasy to convince the audience to suspend their disbelief is to use something real and authentic to bounce the fantasy off of and its not like the history of grave robbers or body snatchers or resurrectionists call it what you like is a boring storybr br the most frustrating thing is that writerdirector glenn mcquaid clearly does know the history especially the good bits as an example when grimes first takes on arthur as his apprentice he correctly explains to arthur that as resurrectionists they dont steal the clothes from the dead because stealing corpses is a misdemeanor punishable by a small fine while stealing clothes is a felony punishable by deportation or possibly even death so you would expect wille and arthur to strip the corpse at this point and for the rest of the film but of course they dont you could accuse the director of ignoring his writers script but not when the writer and the director are the same personbr br my point isnt that there should have been a lot of bucknaked corpses in the film my point is that if you are going to bring up this quirk in the law and make it clear that willie and arthur will follow the law no matter how silly it is than you do have to pursue that thought to its logical conclusion even if that means that willie and arthur wind up chasing a zombie through a graveyard trying to rip his or her clothes off and stuffing them back in the empty coffin so that they dont get deported for stealing the walking corpses clothes otherwise dont bring up the matter at allbr br historical nerdiness aside i sell the dead is worth a rental as a slight but funny horror film that could have been much more
