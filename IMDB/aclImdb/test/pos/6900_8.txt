ok finally a horror film thats done well as soon as i heard the music i knew that some effort had been made in creating what i consider to be an almost masterpiece of good olhorror zombies whores booze grave snatching and a lot more a great cast well acted well directed well writtenthere was hardly a flaw even the american actors with irishenglish accents really pulled it off i thought that the actor larry fessenden looked familiar to me it was that missing tooth finally i realized that this guy was the lead in habit a film about vampires in nyc i thought he was excellent in that role now im wondering if hes an american or not his accent was so convincing in i sell that i thought he had to have grown up in the emerald isle not in the us well apparently hes a born and raised new yorker a great actorreally made the role his own in this movie nothing beats a horror flick set in early 19th century europe like the old hammer flicks i encourage anyone that wants to have a great time to watch this well crafted movie
