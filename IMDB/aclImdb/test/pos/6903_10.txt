note i saw i sell the dead at the glasgow international film festival on 20th january 2009 i sell the dead is a jet black horror comedy set in late medieval times and stars dominic monaghan lost lord of the rings ron pearlman hellboy larry fessenden session 9 and angus scrimm phantasmbr br the movie opens with graverobber willie grimes fessenden still indignant and unremorseful being dragged to the guillotine and executed his apprentice and partnerincrime arthur blake monaghan is locked in the tower awaiting his turn when father duffy perlman a whiskeyswilling priest with an unhealthy interest in the occult pays him a visit with the apparent intention of recording blakes final confession it soon becomes apparent however that duffy main interest lies in the more otherworldly side of blakes exploits most of the plot from here is told in flashback form as monaghan regails duffy with tales of his macabre careerbr br initially grimes and blake start out as simple wisecracking body snatchers working in the employ of the ghoulish dr quint scrimm a callous corrupt anatomist who uses blackmail as leverage over our two antiheroes and takes a rather unhealthy relish in his work the pair have their first runin with the undead when one evening quint sends them on a mission to a bleak moonlit moor to retrieve a corpse that has been mysteriously interred at a crossroads apparently according to some ancient custom but theres something different about this corpse this one has been wrapped in cloves of garlic and buried with a stake through its heartbr br following a terrifying encounter not only do they devise a plan to rid themselves of the scheming doctors machinations but they also uncover a secretive subculture of occultists who will pay good money for corpses and even better money for living specimens of the undead this leads our intrepid duo into the hidden underworld of the ghoul hunting trade where they find themselves going headtohead not only with vampires monsters and zombies and one other paranormal entity for which i will not spoil the surprise but also rival ghoul hunters in the form of the inbred and murderous murphy clanbr br i went into i sell the dead expecting a lowkey mildly distracting low budget chiller i was not prepared for the incredible imagination giddy humour quality acting great dialogue thick atmosphere and sheer personality that makes i sell the dead a strong early contender for my horror film of the yearbr br with the exception of a couple of rough edges the production values are truly fantastic for such a low budget flick  it looks like it was made for about 20 million and i was surprised when the director told the audience it was made for significantly less than half of that although he was unwilling to give exact figures as the film was still being sold to distributors the look and tone of the film is a visual comic book somewhere between tim burton and hammer horror with smart little creepshowesquire artwork inserts the plot is wonderfully surreal but the idea of a hidden underworld running parallel to everyday life but which the general populace is either unable or unwilling to believe in is one that actually makes quite good sense within the context of the filmbr br the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinnbr br conclusion  i loved it its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie i struggle to find anything bad to say about it mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line
