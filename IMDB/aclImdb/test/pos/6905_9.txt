this film was really a breath of fresh air from the load of hollywood crap ive seen recently the acting is superb and the characters are engaging and oddly endearing there really isnt much to the story its simple and it works well an easy film to just sit down and enjoy the mood was fantastic and the sets really helped push the movie along and offered some nice visuals the film obviously has aspects of horror yet is geared a little more towards the humorous side of things you wont be laughing out loud hysterically with this one but youll be smiling the whole way through the humor works very well with the characters and the superb acting doesnt hurt i really watched this movie based on the fact that ron perlman was in it his role is a bit smaller than i expected but it doesnt matter the rest of the cast does more than enough to keep you engaged if you like horror watch this if you like comedies watch this just go ahead and watch this anyway its really quite excellent
