i just saw this at siff and i absolutely loved it there were parts where i laughed so hard i couldnt catch my breath the script and direction by glenn mcquaid are fantastic i cant wait to see more from this talented young man the performances make the movie larry fessenden and dominic monaghan are just delightful as the graverobber willy and his apprentice arthur ron perlman turns in a fantastic performance as usual as a lessthansympathetic jailhouse priest bonus angus scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor as always he balances menace and humor perfectlybr br this is a style of horror comedy that really hasnt been seen since vincent price did comedy of terrors the raven and theater of blood the movie is genuinely scary in places then itll suddenly flip back into hilarious mode keeping you totally off balance some parts are scary and funny at the same timebr br i can only afford to see three movies at siff this year but even if the other two are awful i sell the dead was worth the price of all three im going to be looking for more movies from larry fessendens glass eye pix hes giving the horror genre a muchneeded kick in the butt
