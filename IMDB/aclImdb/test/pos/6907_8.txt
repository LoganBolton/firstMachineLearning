i sell the dead revolves around convicted grave robber arthur blake blakes friend and fellow grave robber willie grimes has just been executed and blake is going to follow suit the next morning while he sits in his cell awaiting his execution a priest named father duffy comes in and asks him if he will tell all he has seen as a grave robber he then proceeds to give father duffy a quasi biography of his more interesting exploitsbr br the plot pretty much consists of several incidents only tied together by chronology this prevents the viewer from ever getting bored but it also makes the events less significant as you could easily add or remove a lot of scenes without noticing it much though flawed i thought overall this method added to the fun loving nature of the film and kept it very entertaining most of the various stories are good specifically the alien the murphys and the vampire but others werent so greatbr br the acting isnt amazing but i didnt find it bad at any point dominic monaghan had a good performance as he managed to be serious when it mattered and also play very well into the comedic parts of the filmbr br the characters were not extremely indepth but they were all interesting i also enjoyed how a number of the villains were done in a overthetop almost comic book manner the part with the back story of the murphys and their gang is pricelessbr br so overall i sell the dead very successfully combines horror comedy and scifi into a mish mash of fun and excitement it is one of the more interesting and original movies i have seen in a while and its unfortunate that independent films like this dont get more recognition
