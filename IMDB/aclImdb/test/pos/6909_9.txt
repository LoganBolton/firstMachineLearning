i saw this movie as part of the midnite madness at sitges set in 18th century england the plot covers the life of arthur blake from his first outing as an apprentice grave robber to his final confession on the eve of his executionbr br the plot moves along via a series of misadventures involving arthur and his partner encountering various unsavory characters and bizarre situationsbr br the first thing that strikes you about this movie is how accurately they managed to capture the look of the hammer period horrors the atmosphere is set with lots of fog laden graveyards rowdy tavern scenes and excellent setcostume designbr br for a movie titled i sell the dead i was expecting the emphasis to be mostly on horror Â– dont get me wrong there are some jumpy moments and gore but the tone is very much comedic driven by the situations the characters get themselves into and their dialog the closest comparison to the scenes between the two leads larry fessenden and dominic monaghan is the character interaction seen in the classic english comedies only fools and horses the two ronnies and morecambe and wisebr br the acting is strong and the casting of very familiar faces in ron perlman and angus scrimm lift the movie above many of the others on view in sitgesbr br overall the movie offers something very different to the current crop of mainstream horror and will leave a smile on your face
