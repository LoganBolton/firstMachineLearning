first of all this was not a three hour movie  two hours ten minutes last time i checked commercials arent actually part of a movie perhaps though it shouldve been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen because of this movie i do now but im not so sure thats a good thing everything here no one really needed to know this was essentially a movie that didnt need to be made but it was made and the reason is because lucy  desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars that is definitely so not true and very very sadbr br anyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good two complaints  the actress who played viv vance  not great casting at all and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york uhhh like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden shes a whole new person that wasnt too great but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy  desi no the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasnt necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy  desi had there been more time had the story been more about lucys entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more but they werent so we got to see the likes of gable  lombard red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in lucys life really neat and its too bad that wasnt explored more oh well what was explored was done well for the most part honestly i dont think ill ever watch this again and i dont think this moviell be that memorable for someone who digs i love lucy but isnt an enormous lucille ball fan this should be an interesting watch my grade for this b
