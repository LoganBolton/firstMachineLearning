first off what are some of you thinking this is the best movie ive seen in ages br br secondly i dont think of it as a british movie as it is set in dublin and has mainly irish actors moran gambon aisling o sullivanrita deirdre okane etcbr br thirdly i thought that moran was excellent he was hilariously funny through out micheal caine seemed only to be there to get moran context each character he took on he perfected br br abigail iversen i thought was better than any other child actor i have seen she was believable as the smart kid and also as a kid and an adultyes i know that sounds strange but hey even she managed to upstage caine br br iversen and moran worked very well together and were very funny in the preparation scenebr br barrelergambon was very funny in his ineptitude
