this movie is all about entertainment imagine your friends that you love spending time with the ones that you know inside out becoming a bit silly and perhaps taking on a character or two thats what this film is about an inventive script and brilliantly performed its not about pleasing the masses with this one its about having fun with a bunch of brilliantly talented people which is what im sure they all thought when they signed up for it br br the above review sounds completely unfair and i think that the person who wrote that was in the wrong frame of mind when they watched the film in a lighthearted moment there is great dignity in it if you care to lookbr br a job well done i thought it was a great film id watch this before the north american norm any daybr br in a nutshell its not the best film youre ever going to see but it has a hell of a lot of moments i havent laughed that long in an age
