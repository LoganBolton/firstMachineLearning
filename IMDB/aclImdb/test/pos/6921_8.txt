tell you what that was excellent dylan moran is simply the funniest actor on screen and on stage and with micheal caine as your partner aint to bad either both are great to watch in a really funny film true not all the gags come off but its worth sticking around for the ones that do but come on its got micheal caine in a dress in it the whole admission fees worth that and every time dylan morans on screen its more like bernard blacks movie the story is two actorsmoran and caine who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by acting out different personas to fool them all but getting away with its a different matter basically the actors is a great british comedy that was somehow missed by many seriously if your a moran fanor want to see micheal caine in a dress definitely see this
