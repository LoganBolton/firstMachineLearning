this is an excellent tubthumper from the war yearsbr br john mills leads a fine cast of regular british bmovie stalwarts in a solo submarine attack upon a fictitious enemy battleshipbr br filmed in black and white its well paced and also well placed considering that a war was going on at the time if anything it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propagandabr br the missionside of the movie takes place in genuine submarines things are cramped and claustrophobic the actors look suitably grimy and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate other commentators have already drawn attention to the authentic little details like keeping the vessel trim and forgetting to read instruments as well as the engineroom activitiesbr br this probably is the first movie in which debris and a dead german is blown from the torpedo tube to fool an enemy destroyer and its the only time i have seen part of the vessel exposed in a pretence of sinking  a high risk gamble if ever there was onebr br im a little sceptical as to whether or not a submarine could punch its way through a wirerope net submerged speed was barely twice that of human walking speed and the net would have had a great deal of give also the engineer was at the same workstation and operating the same levers both on the surface and submerged this too seems implausible as either diesel or electric engines were used and they were in different sections of the ship  or so im toldbr br there was a wee bit too much shoreside drama for my tastes but then this was a propaganda effort and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to mind their behaviour as it could adversely affect service morale and therefor the war effortbr br these niggles aside its a pretty entertaining little adventure nowadays movies of such vintage tend to be screened in the afternoon whilst far more modern and inferior movies enjoy primetime but then its no longer politicallycorrect to mention the war in the presence of our european friends too many of them have guilty consciences or our own leftwing fascists non of whom have ever fought for the freedoms they now take for grantedbr br as a submarine movie it is eminently collectible better than the enemy below i think though less demonstrative not so authentic as das boot by any means but not so gross either
