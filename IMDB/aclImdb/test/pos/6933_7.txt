i am a glutton for bmovies i love the old drivein fare like this movie this film made for very little money it seems does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail it is cheezy it is gory it has no real plot but it entertained me for an hour and a half i was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock there are a few great effects like a shot from inside a guys mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth and one grossout with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out but there is also loads of zombies and some psycho killers patterned after texas chainsaw massacre and a demon possessed scarecrow i loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people it has great camera work and some cool editing tricks this one is more original than the first bloodbath and the undead look better but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70s and 80s and it still has a cheeze factor that ranks mighty high dont expect romero just secondrate fulci i would say that horror fans will like it and it is funny and cheezy and a fast ride through bmovie land
