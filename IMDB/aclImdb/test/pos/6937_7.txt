you cant take it realistically sheetsbr br zombie bloodbath 2 zb2 is a world all of its own ive really never seen anything like it the only thing i can think to compare it to is psychedelic drugs forgive the clichéi dont simply mean that its incoherent and absurd though occasionally it is i mean that it takes you through such a broad range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly as to overwhelm you and when its over you find that its all happened while you were sitting on the couchbr br it is worth noting that its extremely lowbudget as a disclaimer to those who after seeing shaun of the dead consider themselves fans of underground zombie films also of note is that it is much more brutal than youd expect children get disemboweled and someone taunts a teenage girl before shooting her in the groin her corpse is subsequently raped these are certainly not flaws and indeed i feel it is to the films credit but if it doesnt sound like your kind of movie dont waste your timebr br i dont mean to overhype it regarding brutality dont go in expecting inside or something i hesitate to give away any of the plot because its really full of surprises even the opening scene which has nothing to do with zombies is at once a classic horror scene and something quite originalbr br man im three paragraphs in and ive hardly said anything at all heres why i thought the movie was awesome 1 its big and it keeps moving at one point you expect it to turn into another notld clone a boardupthewindows movie where everyone stays in a farmhouse and argues with one another by the end of the film however the farmhouse scenes will seem like a distant dream there are also a number of outdoor urban scenes these are rare in lowbudget zombie filmsbr br 2 the makeupgore is much better than zb1 more convincing and more creative something kind of funny the early zombies look really lame then halfway through they suddenly look really good with prosthetics and everything some of them look like fulci zombies some are reminiscent of mr tongue from day of the dead and its got big scenes of dozens of zombies shuffling around never gets oldbr br 3 theres something oddly emotional about it one character asserts that heaven exists and that our deadundead protagonists are now in heaven in the context of the film we believe it to be true though the characters behave with typical horror film stupidity they genuinely seem to care about each other and accordingly i found myself caring about thembr br 4 the pacing is great theres hardly a dull momentbr br my only observation that borders on criticism is that todd sheets comes up with the most bizarre dialog ive ever heard i personally feel it adds to the experience but i dont think he does it on purpose so i cant fairly give the film a perfect rating example when a car breaks down the owner yells at the passengers then he says something to the effect of sorry i yelled at you guys you dont know what its like to have your dad standing over you with a straight razor when youre five years old wtf at the very end it gets to be more than i can handle involves a montage with bill clinton and then some preachy end credits explaining the zombie metaphor really by this point i was firmly reliving my drug experiencesbr br highly recommended 710
