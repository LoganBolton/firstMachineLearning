i first saw this docudrama in the uk in the 1980s and found myself intrigued and then astonished at how such good intentions could go so wrong previous commentators who are australian have explained the unfolding plots detail better than i ever could but i would like to make an observation about what may lie behind the governorgenerals uk sovereign power all modern laws as i understand them need an ethical or philosophical root to exist in the first place and to become a law at all that being the case and if say the connerskhemlani mess had been possibly set upjust how many businessmenmillionares had been served by khemlani presumably without complaint then the labour government could have been victims of entrapment which would surely have had to have been investigated by the governorgeneral as or until he could see that the budget standoff was a genuine result of whitlams fecklessness and not elaborate entrapment sponsored by person or persons unknown if its the case that kerr in effect didnt have to refer to the law because fiscal circumstances overrides everything then royal power borders onto unreason the implications in any commonwealth country is that fiscal rules literally and that any person or organisation has carte blanche to break any other rule physical or mental so long as they have the control over the purse strings ultimately
