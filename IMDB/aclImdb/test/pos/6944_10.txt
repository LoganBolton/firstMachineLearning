after traveling around the world it dawned on me that australia really lacks one thing that other countries have historybr br fortunately or unfortunately australia wasnt establish following a war it has not had a civil war and most of its political history is rather boring nothing big happened to mark some sort of turning point in australias history until the dismissal of the whitlam government by the governorgeneral of australia  john kerrbr br for those who are australian you can skip this paragraph and move onto the next this is for the benefit of curious nonaustralians australia was colonised by the british as time went on it became apparent that australia was capable of standing on its own two feet accordingly the uk granted australia permission to establish its own parliaments laws courts and so on the law and politics of australia would no longer be provided directly from the british rather australia would be run by australians in their own right even though the courts precedents parliament and so on is largely modeled on the british system this shift was codified in the australian constitution despite the fact that the constitution lawfully establishes australian governments lawmaking procedures courts but for those who are curious  no bill of rights their are two procrown sections that were included and remain there to this day these are more or less regarded as the reserve powers of the crown kingqueen of great britain the first group of sections relates to the creation of the office of the governorgeneral briefly the governorgeneral is considered the queens chief representative in australia and is described as the executive branch of the australian government when a piece of law is passed by the australian parliament the constitution states that it only becomes law when it is signed by the governorgeneral as such the govenorgeneral is regarded by some as nothing more than a rubber stamper performing an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the crown theoretically the governorgeneral can refuse to sign a law passed by australian parliament if he thinks fit for instance if parliament passed a law which allows the police to shoot dead any australian over the age of 50 hypothetically of course then the gg could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the land however this power is theoretical and has to date never been exercised by convention which is the buzz word of the events leading to the dismissal the governorgeneral virtually acts at the behest of the australian government and therefore if the government passes law and the prime minister instructs the governorgeneral to sign it he will almost always without question in fact by convention the governorgeneral acts in accordance with the advice provided to him by the prime minister of the day and the prime minister alone the second aspect is section 64 of the constitution which states that the government ministers hold office at the governorgenerals pleasure now the events of 1975  covered in this film  gave rise to a precedent on this particular section if the governorgeneral is somehow displeased with the government andor prime minister it would appear that this section allows him to lawfully sack the government which happened in 1975 hence the title of the film the dismissal whether at the governorgenerals pleasure can be construed as the unfettered right to dismiss is a contentious point though that led to rather heated exchanges amongst australians at the time  especially considering that the governorgeneral is not elected by the people of australiabr br now that this background aspect is out of the way lets get back to discussing the film it was well made the pace was patient but didnt drag at all the drama was well contained and very realistic it didnt overdramatise the events and most importantly it did not present its point of view from one political perspective on the contrary i felt that it was fair and balanced even though concluding text before the credits indicates that the filmmakers probably didnt approve of the governorgenerals decision to dismiss the whitlam government but i wouldnt describe the film overall as bias in one direction or the otherbr br in terms of accuracy it was virtually spot on the filmmakers certainly did their homework and evidently read the books and writings from all the principle players concerned there were a number of finer details that were somewhat skipped over largely because they took a long time to explain and ultimately had little impact on the events of 1975 so i forgive them for that further i think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that postvietnam war era but noyce pretty much pulled it offbr br finally i was pleased that the film attempted to raise individual policies of both sides without becoming analytical obsessive or judgmental over them moreover any that were raised for example connors pipeline had a great deal of relevance to the story the film makers realised that their task was to tell the story of the events leading to the dismissal and not to present a political endorsement or opposition in relation to policies and viewpoints this was smart because it meant that the film cant be accused of misrepresenting one sides policiesbr br the dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history that has occurred in australia in its short life i am glad that it has been crystallized in celluloid essential viewing for any australian
