even a decade after frontline aired on the abc near as i can tell current affairs programmes are still using the same tricks over and over time after time today tonight and a current affair are seen to be hiding behind the facade of journalistic professionalism and yet they feed us nothing but tired stories about weightloss and dodgy tradesmen shameless network promotions and pointless celebrity puffpieces having often been subjected to that entertainmentless void between the simpsons at 600 pm and sale of the century or temptation at 700 pm i was all too aware of the little tricks that these shows would use to attract ratingsbr br fortunately four rising comedians  rob sitch jane kennedy santo cilauro and tom gleisner  were also all too aware of all this and they crafted their frustrations into one of the most wickedlyhilarious media satires youll ever see on television the four entertainers had already met with comedic success their previous most memorable television stint being on the late show the brilliant saturday night variety show which ran for two seasons from 19921993 and also featured fellow comedians mick molloy tony martin jason stephens and judith lucybr br frontline boasts an ensemble of colourful characters each with their own distinct and quirky personality the currentaffairs show is headed by nicelygroomed mike moore rob sitch an ambitious pretentious dimwitted narcissist mike works under the delusion that the show is serving a vital role for society  he is always adamant that they maintain their journalistic integrity  and his executive producers have excelled into getting him to believe just that mike is basically a puppet to bring the news to the people occasionally he gets the inkling that he is being led along by the nose but usually this thought is stamped out via appeals to his vanity or promises of a promotionbr br brooke vandenberg jane kennedy is the senior female reporter on the show she is constantly concerned about her looks and public profile and if the rumours are to be believed she has had a romantic liaison with just about every male celebrity in existence another equally amoral reporter marty di stasio is portrayed by tiriel mora who memorably played inept solicitor dennis denuto in the australian comedy classic the castle emma ward alison whyte is the line producer on the show and the single shining beacon of morality on the frontline set then theres the highlyamusing weatherman geoffrey salter santo cilauro mikes best friend and confidant geoff makes a living out of always agreeing with mikes opinion and of laughing uproariously at his jokes before admitting that he doesnt get thembr br for each of the shows three seasons we are treated to a different ep executive producer brian thompson bruno lawrence who unfortunately passed away in 1995 runs the programme during season 1 he has a decent set of morals and is always civil to his employees and yet is morethanwilling to cast these aside in favour of high ratings sam murphy kevin j wilson arrives on set in season 2 a hardnosed smoothtalking producer who knows exactly how to string mike along the last episode of the second season when mike finally gets the better of him is a classic moment graeme prowsey prowse steve bisley ep for the third season is crude unpleasant and unashamedly sexist its therefore remarkable that you eventually come to like himbr br with its cast of distinctive exaggerated characters frontline has a lot of fun satirising currentaffairs programmes and their dubious methods for winning ratings many of the episodes were shot quickly and cheaply often implementing many plot ideas from recent reallife situations but this never really detracts from the shows topicality ten years on celebrity cameos come in abundance with some of the most memorable appearances including pauline hanson don burke and jon english watch out for harry shearers hilarious appearance in the season 2 episode changing the face of current affairs playing larry hadges an american hired by the network to reform the showbr br particularly in the third season i noticed that frontline boasted an extremely gritty form of black humour uncharacteristic for such a lighthearted comedy show genuinely funny moments are born from brooke being surreptitiously bribed into having an abortion murder by a crazed gunman and mike treacherously betraying his best friends hopes and dreams only to be told that he is a good friend the series final minute  minus an addedscene during the credits which was probably added just in case a fourth season was to be produced  was probably the greatest blackest ending to a comedy series that ive yet seenbr br below is listed a very tentative list of my top five favourite frontline episodes but make no mistake every single halfhour is absolutely hilarious and hardhitting satirebr br 1 the siege season 1br br 2 give em enough rope season 2br br 3 addicted to fame season 3br br 4 basic instincts season 2br br 5 add sex and stir season 1
