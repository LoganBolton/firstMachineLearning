this show came to canada via pbs in the mid 90s and i really really loved it then even 10 yrs later watching the various news networks i cant help but think of the cynical manipulation that goes on in the name of ratings and the various show ponies we all see on tv as depicted in various frontline episodes the scripts are tightly written and the actors all have impeccable comic timing and none of it is encumbered by an idiotic laugh track there is a lot of funny material here really well executed and we dont need to be told when to laugh and what to laugh at i dont understand why this show never took off in north america as its truly a gem i was really excited to see the dvds available even though they are pal format i figured i would rip them to my computer and then watch the converted files i took a chance and ordered it from abcÂ… 6 to 8 weeks later i had all 3 seasons even better it worked on my ntsc dvd player i suspect any player bought in the past 2 yrs that does xviddivx will play them great stuff 10 yrs later the episodes all hold up really well you dont need to know anything about australian politics to get the humor as it will all be familiar to western audiences my wife and i had a 10 day frontline fest and are still chuckling weeks later after watching all 39 episodes
