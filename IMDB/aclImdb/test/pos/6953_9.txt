where the rivers flow north is a welltold story about two peoples fight to live their own lives in the face of progress and development besides enjoying the movie as entertainment i also learned quite a bit about life in rural new england back in the late 1920sbr br the cinematography captured the raw beauty of northern vermont and set the stage while the music brought the movie to life very well done for a lowbudget locallyproduced film i found michael j foxs character the weakest in the film but rip torn and tantoo cardinal turn in two of the finest performances ive seen in a long time i was saddened she did not get a nod as best actress that year i assume the film was too small a film to be considered
