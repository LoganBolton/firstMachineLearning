if theres one theme of this film its that people can cope with hardship by having a good imagination this family is poor their father works graveyard and their mother works doubleshifts and peter is constantly picked on for a variety of reasons and becomes increasingly frustrated that he is often mistaken for a girl he is just starting to approach that age of 10 or 11 where your perceptions start to change and thinks like your appearance start to matter the backdrop of this story is the 1967 worlds fair and the centennial of canada the films greatest moments come during the various fantasy sequences where we see just how they cope watch the flim and if youve ever had a childhood friend that you dreamt with and then for some reason lost youll really like this film perhaps kids will like this film but only adults will truly appreciate it including its references to bolsheviks and what parents will do for their children
