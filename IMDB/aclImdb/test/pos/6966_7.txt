seeing that this movie was on the imdb bottom 20 i simply had to rent itbr br suprise suprise i have no regret of seeing this movie at all in fact i really enjoyed it theres a level of camp in this movie that puts cult classics of the 80s to shame is it stupid yes but jim wynorski proves that stupid is not necessarily bad after allbr br rent it for a laugh that seems unintended but is actually meant to be funny wynorski is a genius hope he directs the next ninja turtles movie
