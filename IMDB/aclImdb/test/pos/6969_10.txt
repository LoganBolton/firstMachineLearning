ghoulies iv may not be the best out of the series but it isnt too bad if you dont take it fully serious then you may enjoy itbr br its nice to see peter liapis return as johnathan graves who has gave up using magic and has became a detective but still thinks about what happened in ghouliesbr br the plot is about a woman named alexandra that is johnathans exgirlfriend that breaks into a museum and takes a red gem using the gem she awakens her boyfriend named faust that is johnathans dark side but he needs the gem so he can enter the real world and john is sent to hellbr br something goes wrong and alex loses the gem so she needs to find a new one as she leaves the gateway is still open and two little ghoulies named lite and drak appear theyre not the true ghoulies since they look like guys in a troll costume wearing a mask but that doesnt matter since they are humorous in partsbr br lite and dark need to find johnathan since he can return them home so they go around causing mayhem as they try to find johnathan another difference is that the two ghoulies are the good guys unlike the ones in the previous filmsbr br i found ghoulies iv to be good but this film may not go for everyone check it out if you like low budget films like troll 2
