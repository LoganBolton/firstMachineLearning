early coppola with sublime cast that most folks never got to see a pity theres some wonderful things going on in this one  shirley knights best performance an underrated actress a road trip in the late 1960s james caan very restrained and moving robert duvall in a part he was born to play edgy lonely motorcycle cop and a touching script with f coppola behind the wheelbr br if this had been made five years later by some nobody it would have been a smash so much for timing anyway i recommend this to all people who dont need outerspace explosions and bad motherinlaw jokes or a billion dollar budget to sit for a few hours and watch a story unfold give this one a chance if you can find it
