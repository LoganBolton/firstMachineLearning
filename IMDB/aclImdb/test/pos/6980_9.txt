ive seen directors cut version and can be nothing but content excellent acting esp cole hauser i was sad about little space for claudia black though subtle visual effects and photography in overall believable plot considering the genre without a lot of logical holes really nonpredictable twists buildup characters these are the greatest assets of the movie combined with style  some may consider this movie a bgrade effort but i would disagree with that the whole thing really is very original and stylishbr br and even though im not a fan of vin diesel this tough guy role of riddick suited him well cant wait for chronicles of riddick its really cool this flicks gonna have a sequelbr br 910 if you ask me
