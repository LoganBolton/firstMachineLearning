i saw into pitch black on tv and so i had to see this i must say i was very impressedbr br not only has david twohys style improved since he wrote critters 2 this film brought to my attention vin diesel sure he was there in into pitch black but here he was ferocious scary and intense i havent seen charisma like that since schwarzenegger in the 80sbr br the story is simple enough but it is the characters that make this film interesting then there was what happens with the female lead unexpected the dark humor helps the film move along the effects arent grand but when riddick fights the alien it blew all of my complaints outbr br diesel hasnt done a whole lot since this film that i would care about but i am eagerly looking forward to the sequel
