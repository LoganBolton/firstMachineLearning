if youre a science fiction fan and youve only seen this movie once please please go and treat yourself to a second viewing i just did and i was amazed about how good i thought the movie was as opposed to when i first saw it three years ago the first time around i was certainly impressed by the astronomical vistas were treated to in this movie but by and large i didnt think that much of the movie as a whole it was an alien ripoff and i thought the description of the monsters was a case of really bad science that they were allergic to light was something i found especially ridiculous based on my first viewing i recently rated this movie a 5br br however now that the sequel chronicles of riddick is on the way and the movie poster for that one looks amazing i thought id better brush up on pitch black once more so i borrowed the video from a friend i am so glad i did theres so much of what i thought i remembered from the first viewing that turned out to be wildly inaccurate i thought most of the characters died very early in the movie this was not so i thought claudia blacks character was the first to die this was not so i thought riddick was the sole survivor this was not so br br i see now that the movie works extremely well there isnt an excessive tiresome focus on the monsters its much more of a human drama the main characters are appealing and capable of some convincing acting and there are so many little details that make the pitch black universe coherent and believable such as the shortage of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet they crash on and the fact that the monsters have eaten everything on the planet and so they turn on each otherbr br and i have to mention the astronomical vistas again i mean we start out seeing the spaceship passing through a comets tail with bits of spacedust zapping through the hull then we come to a planet with three suns just as the shipwrecked people think its about to get dark a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon and everything is engulfed in a blue glow as the eclipse approaches we see the huge neighboring ringed gas giant rise across the sky and in the final scene of the movie we see the ship skid closely above one of these very rings these scenes are created with a sense of beauty wonder and detail and i dont think ive seen any other sf movie that really made such a point out of including these things i hope we see much more of it in the sequelbr br pitch black now gets from me a rating of 9 out of 10 a cult classic you bet
