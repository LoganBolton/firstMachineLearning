people who thought that the chronicles of riddick sucked harder than the black hole that swallowed up event horizon probably didnt see the movie that spawned vin diesels skinheaded killer to begin with and probably have no intention of doing so too bad because pitch black actually does kick major assbr br directed by genre vet david twohy warlock and the excellent but underrated below and written by siblings jim and ken wheat lies silent scream pitch black begins with an alienesque prologue when a combination cargo freighterpassenger ship is badly damaged by a freak meteor shower in which the captain is also killed the copilot carolyn fry silent hills radha mitchell has an important decision to make ditch the cargo or the passengers close to picking ore over occupants the crash landing derails her ultimate course of actionbr br no matter because the catastrophic landing has been made on a foreboding rock that once held a mining colony amongst the survivors are a couple of settlers shazza farscapes claudia black and zeke john moore an imam keith david and his young followers can you say red shirts boys and girls an antiques dealer named paris ogilvie lewis fitzgerald a young boy named jack rhianna griffith and the most controversial members of the group a marshall named johns the excellently slimy cole hauser and his prisonera dangerous murderer named riddick diesel br br how the group dynamics shake out make for a lot of the dramatic tension especially with concerns about riddick and how many people he might slice and dice if he ever gets away but no one here gets out alive as the saying goes and the biggest twists have less to do with how they get along than how theyll survive when they discover the unthinkable they are not alone on the planetoid things that are hungry taloned and quick are slithering around just where they cant be seen living in the darkness where they can survive and thrive they want the flesh of the new arrivals to sate their appetites but they cant come out into the searing daylight to forage for foodbr br does the phrase total eclipse make things a little more interesting you betcha hence the morethanfitting titlebr br vin more monosyllabic than clint eastwoods dirty harry on his grumpiest day dripping more testosterone than sweat has a field day here with a character that really does seem worth a sequel or two and hauser oozing menace and bile is every bit as good as his dad wings was at onscreen villainy surprisingly though mitchell holds her own and manages to be strong and sympathetic as fry you would expect no less than a strong showing from black she who once was aeryn sun and she doesnt disappoint too bad her role wasnt bigger but thats all ill say about it and david makes his usual indelible impression as the holy man whose faith will truly be tested in the very pit of hell itselfbr br the pace moves faster than riddick slipping up behind his prey with a shank in his teeth and once the darkness descends the terror and tension never let up pretty much as in other classic scifihorror flicks which this imitates but if imitation truly is the sincerest form of flattery dave twohy and the wheats deserve major backslaps for getting this one right with a vengeance and for giving us an ending that is antihollywood to the maxbr br i dont want to spoil the surprises so i wont say much more except that if you saw chronicles first and werent too happy give pitch black a chance anyway and if youve seen neither definitely start with this one br br i dont know what vin is up to now but he could certainly do worse than to give these guys a call again id love to see what they would dream up next
