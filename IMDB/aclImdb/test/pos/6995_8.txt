this film is a variation of a theme weve all seen over and over again  the posiedan adventure in space the characters are all stock characters  feisty heroine judas coward etc etc the only question really is whos next to snuff it sometimes this tried and tested formula works  like in this case  but more often not  like the truly mindnumbing red planet br br so why does this one work because its stylish the acting is above average and above all it isnt predictable the conclusion isnt signposted i really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end that alone deserves top marks in my bookbr br its an intriguing and entertaining movie and though it was never likely to change the face of cinema as we know it it doesnt disappoint
