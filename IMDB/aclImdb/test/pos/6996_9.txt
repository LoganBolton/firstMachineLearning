as a scifi movies fan i also like alien but pitch black is definitely better than alien 3 and alien resurrection it maches well into alien series but it isnt alien its something else ok enough comparisons this movie but me think why people are afraid of dark you cant run away from dark its impossible you have to be faced with darkness and with that whats in dark in this movie i also liked that the vin diesel character richard b riddick wasnt typical goodboy he had a secrets and he has done bad things in the past to the other people he is a hero who tries to save them all first of all he want to get out of that planet himself there is also other metaphors in this story every big scifi fan should see this picture
