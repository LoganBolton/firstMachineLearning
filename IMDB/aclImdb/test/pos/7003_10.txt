as a zombie fan i really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters pb is also an excellent tiein to chronicles of riddick cor the gang has to run as fast as they can away from darkness there are so many metaphors in the story riddick is this bad guy but hes also the hero who tries to save the slowpaced folks the muslim guy imam relies on the suns positions for the five times a day prayers but he is stuck in a land where darkness will rule overall i recommend this film to any scifi fans you wont be disappointed
