the opening scene of this movie is pretty incredible ive seen a number of scifi movies with great special effects but my roommate and i looked at each other after the opening sequence and he said plainly sensory overload the plot of the movie is pretty simple but the nice thing about this scifi movie is that it lets the audience figure out most of the technology for themselves instead of wasting time to subtly explain it the creatures in this movie are also very interesting you dont get a really good look at them until about two thirds of the way through overall a very entertaining movie
