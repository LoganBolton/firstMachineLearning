im 15 usually not kids my age usually watch these old classic movies but this is one of my favorites i was totally addicted after watching it for the first time its really good if u think about technology and movies back at that time music is great storyline is okchoreography is great must see it i dont know why theres a prequel for this movie not many people like this movie but i love classic love movies theyre so much better than movies now this movie will make you smile cry and make you start dancing the music is absolutely ear catching and beautiful i havent seen dirty dancing 2 harvana nightsprequel prequel should have star the original actors thats what i hate about prequels they ruin the original no one wants a prequel they want a sequel many people will agree that for a movie the original sequel and the 3rd one is enough beyond that people wont be bothered to watch it who remembers the movie about the st benard beethoven i think theres 5 movies altogether
