i have watched this movie at least 30 times maybe more and each time i watch it i am drawn into the movie and back to 1963 the movie takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time i watch itbr br i think the important thing to say here is i was 15 in 1963 and i can remember before president kennedy was shot and before the beetles came i can feel myself saying something like i carried a watermelon and then realizing just how stupid that was jennifer grey plays frances baby houseman in dirty dancing baby is going to start college in the fall she goes to kellermans for vacation with her family mom dad and sister lisabr br one of the staff dancers penny played by cynthia rhodes gets pregnant by another staff person one of the college boys played by max cantor and has a chance to get an abortion but it is on a night that her and johnny patrick swayze are scheduled to dance at a nearby hotelbr br thus the need for a fillin dancer for penny johnny is persuaded by penny and his cousin billy neal jones that he can teach baby to do the dance in time for the show baby learning the dance steps with penny and johnny are wonderful scenesbr br babys father doctor jake houseman played by jerry orbach comes to pennys rescue when the abortion is done wrong dirty dancing brought back to me this time in history when girls got pregnant and had abortions in back rooms by butchers around this time 1963 many girls actually died from this type of abortion  but there were not many choices for a girl thenbr br lonnie price plays a great conceited grandson neil kellerman to jack westons max kellerman jane brucker does a great job as babys annoying sister lisa housemanbr br the music is great and the dancing is wonderful the dirty dancers are absolutely wonderful and very sexy  i can feel babys astonishment when she first sees them dancing and says whered they learn to do thatbr br jennifer grey and patrick swayze are just perfect together in their respective roles patricks song shes like the wind brings tears to my eyes each time i hearwatch it in this moviebr br the movie ends on an up note but leaves you wanting to know what happens next in babys and johnnys lives dirty dancing gives something new each time it is watched  it mesmerizes the watcher with nostalgia a feeling of wanting it to be 1963 again
