its funny how time went by and never saw this movietill last week when i was like under a spell i saw it twice in a week and it still wasnt enough its a great movie and i will love to see it again the story is great and it really moved me i would love to live such a story the actors are great the music too and you can dream about your own love story i just hope that someday i will find the opportunity to learn to dance like johnny and baby i feel like dance connects people and brings them together i think people should learn to danceit helps a lot especially in a relationship its great to feel the dance in your blood and in your body
