one of the greatest movies to come out of the 80s dirty dancing was a lowbudget film with highbudget returns with a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance to a love story that all of us wish we could live at least if youre female this is a movie that you will want to watch over and over againbr br the music which is what drives the movie is upbeat and flows well with the emotions which are drawn from the viewer from classic 60s hits like love man by otis redding and big girls dont cry by frankie valli to pure 80s hits like eric carmens hungry eyes and frank zappacostas overload dirty dancing is a mix of fun and sensual showing the transformation of a young girl from shy teenager into a blossoming womanhood all against the beautiful backdrop of a summer romance that we all hope and wish turned into morebr br the dancing in dirty dancing is not to be forgotten cynthia rhodes shines in her role as penny a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and lithe gymnasts patrick swayze does more than a fantastic job and shows off more and more of his skills not just as an actor but dancer and singer as well and jennifer grey shines as baby while her transformation in dancing portrays her transformation in status as wellbr br all in all dirty dancing is one of the best movies of all time and well worth watching at least once its doubtful that the first beats of the ronettes be my baby in the opening title wont snare your attention and draw you in to a magical world of sensual dance and musical enchantment
