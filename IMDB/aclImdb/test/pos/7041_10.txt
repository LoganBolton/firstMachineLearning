i love meatballs terrific characters and poignant situations make this one dearly loved bill murray is hysterical and you gotta love that 4mile trail race at the end a total classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years it brings back fond memories of camp and deals nicely with the experience of being rejected by foolish peers and the empowerment brought one by being rescued by a sympathetic adult tons of great oneliners and quite an assortment of wacko counselors this is the kind of movie where you repeat key phrases among friends for years afterward also nothing overtly crude and what a sweet late 70s soundtrack to bring on just the right amount of nostalgia i cant say enough about meatballs its a classic be forewarned all the sequels are putrid stink bombs that simply bought the name rights for marketing they have no connection to ivan reitmans masterpiece
