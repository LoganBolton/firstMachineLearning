when i was younger this movie always aired on friday night in the summer on channel 40 this was the years before fox was a network and took over the programming i always looked forward to it id go grocery shopping with my parents then sit down with my swansons tv dinner and a lady lee colathe only time of the week i was allowed to drink cola and enjoy sure the script is predictably late 70s like little darlings but its a fun movie and i loved rudy and tripper bill murray coasts with little effort in the movie but he is charming gotta love spaz and those taped glasses pre revenge of the nerds chris makepeace is pretty much the same character he played in my bodyguard but he does it so well
