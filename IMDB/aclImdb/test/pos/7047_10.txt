i first saw this movie in the mid 80s and thought it was a funny movie as i have gotten older i watch this movie for different reasons i like to view it when im feeling sadnostalgic for my lost youth i was a teenager 14 at the time of the release of this film so i can identify with many of the same problemsdilemmas that the camperscits in this movie have i enjoy seeing the clothes that were worn at this time and hearing the same old urban legends such as was told on the overnight canoe trip the film is also full of funny one liners i highly recommend this movie to anyone that was a teenager in the late 70s to early 80s
