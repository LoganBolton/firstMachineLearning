i know that was a goofy movie but i enjoyed it immensely its one of the experiences that make me smile when someone says bill murray i almost always like movies involving the underdog and this movie has more underdogs than you can count its overall a kind moviesome of the adults are not wrapped tightly but the laughter is accepting rather than brutal like so many teen movies these days the rich kids across the lake take a beating but no one i know minded at all i never went to camp but i did some things that were somewhat parallel and most of the bits and tricks ran true they were even understated at times but im sure that was an accidentthe cast performed well with bill murray showing hints of what he would become its not groundhog day or broken flowers but hey a good goofy laugh should be appreciated these days but thenit just doesnt matter
