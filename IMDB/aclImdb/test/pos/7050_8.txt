luckily for bill murray this is such a lightweight project since he pretty much has to carry it meatballs is the story of lowrent camp northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named camp mohawk which culminates in a twoday olympiad competition above it all is bill murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debutbr br the film is sprinkled with mediumsized laughs chuckles and more than a few guffaws along the way the biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while hes sleeping morty or micky as everyone calls him wakes up along the side of a road strung up in some trees several feet above the ground and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake there are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another but this is a pg rated film with little in the way of raunchinessbr br the film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named rudy who is played by chris makepeace of course its up to murray to teach the kid how to open up and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the olympiad the sentimentality of rudys situation seems tacked on to a great degree notice how when murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him you must be the short depressed kid we ordered makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or murray was just adlibbing while the cameras were rolling in other words murray might as well have said to makepeace you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesnt fit in but before its all over murrays performance makes this plot device more than bearable he really seems to have some good chemistry with makepeacebr br the film culminates with the games between the two rival camps very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable but it just doesnt matter this is a pretty good film on many levels dont let the absurd 56 rating this film is currently getting scare you off murray will keep you laughing throughout just be warned avoid the sequels especially the one with corey feldman 8 of 10 starsbr br the hound
