the plot is predictable it has been done many times in other movies you have competing summer camps in this one the rich kids vs the underachievers competing for bragging rights in the typical camp contests while the kids and consolers pursue pranks sex and a good time are you ready for the summer meatballs is the first and best summer camp movie for feelgood comedy as others have posted its no citizen kane but this type of movie isnt meant to be the film works because of the wonderful comic timing and classic oneliners of bill murray his scenes with a camper where he tries to raise the kids selfesteem are very good bills oneliners throughout the film are very funnybr br i also like that this movie isnt dirty or explicit like so many other teens at camp movies today there is some mild sexual innuendo and maybe one or two cuss words in the entire film but meatballs is the type of teen movie that is actually appropriate for the younger crowd its rated pgbr br this is a movie that you have to see a few times to get all of the jokes when bill murray is on the screen or making one of his classic pa announcements you are drawn to the film bill seems to carry the movie all by himself but he does it so well that when you see meatballs you will realize that this is the film that made him a star a side note to this review is to avoid all of the meatball movie sequels they are horribly bad
