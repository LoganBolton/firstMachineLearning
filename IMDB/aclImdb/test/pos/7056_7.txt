 the reason i like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has its a genial summer camp movie so the jokes arent mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule pranks do take place but you get the feeling that the respective fallguys would be able to look back and laugh having been dopey enough to fall for them  and without being too cheesy its actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the endbr br its an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of all these jolly japes is bill murray for me hes still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he gets a chance to cut loose no ones better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone the tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man established with a great opening scene showing the murray way of getting ready for the day everythings silly yes but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of goodnatured fun meatballs promises such and ultimately delivers a nourishing watch
