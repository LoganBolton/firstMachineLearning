i just saw this for the first time in 10 or 15 yearsmaybe close to 20 in some ways it was better than i rememberedin other it was much worsebr br first of all theres the music its just plain awful there are only 5 songs in the movie most of them used more than once the opening song is shrieked by a chorus of annoying children and the discoy title track is performed by rick dees it doesnt get any worse than that even the background music is terrible with much of it repeating the themes of the other nauseating tunes we also get some truly lame slapstick mostly in the opening creditsbr br on the other hand bill murray is spot on brilliant as usualyou have to wonder if he adlibbed the whole thing or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines or maybe hes just that great turning a weak script into comic genius the best part are his surreal pa announcements lobstersget out of hereyoure a menacebr br you also get a lot more character development than you have any right to expect in a movie like this at least half the characters seem like real peopleand mostly real people you would like to have around even spaz gets to do a more than any other eddie deezentype character ever did and when he gets the girl its plausible shes not absurdly hot but he doesnt automatically pair up with one of the nerd girls see revenge of the nerds for examples of both cinematic phenomenonsbr br and when the plot seems clichédwell ya gotta wonder if it wasnt a cliché yet when they made this while it wasnt the first summer camp movie ya gotta go back at least to the parent trap its certainly the movie that made it its own genre in fact i was surprised that there was no talent show scenewet hot american summer spoofed the summercamp genre so perfectly i just assumed everything in it came straight out of meatballs i also halfexpected jon cryer to pull up in a convertible with a chimp thanks to mr shows epic campolympiad spoof monk academy br br anyway this one seems to be vanishing a little as far as the late70searly 80s comedies its not a cable staple anymore and certainly doesnt have the cult following of caddyshack or animal house i was pleased to catch it on showtime today and in high definition at that sure its pretty awful in spots but you could do a lot worse in a 70s80s teen comedy and again murray is a genius
