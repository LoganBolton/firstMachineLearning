meatballs has been a main staple in my family for over 26 years we saw this movie when it first came out and have seen it dozens of times since bill murray is at his best and is most touching in the scenes where he reaches out to a lonely preteen boy and befriends him while leading his cits into once mischievous scheme after another the cast of characters are fun and zany and you really come to care about them and the relationships they have with each other this is not another sleazy dumb teen sexfest it is funny and sweet and just allaround fun anyone who sees this will enjoy themselves it is a mustsee watch out for spaz  he is by far the best character especially during the camp social  while bill murray hams it up for the camera  just watch spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he picks to dance with by far one of my very favorite comedies of all time
