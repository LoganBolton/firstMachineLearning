im not american but meatballs still really hits me maybe because its a sweet sweet movie watching it again today made me sentimental for a time i cant really put my finger on and a place i cant quite rememberbr br meatballs is just a great movie it reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and anything was possiblebr br if youre reading this you probably know what i meanbr br all i can say on top of what ive already said is that meatballs must be even more nostalgic if youre americanbr br i guess you know what i mean by that too
