yes watch this movie if you like brave films this is maybe the best mexican picture since midaq alley just because the excellent cast the outrageous direction and a sublime soundtrack many people did not like cronica they think its very aggressive but they didnt understand that it was just a representation with hyper realism of the mexican society but so similar to all the third world families i hope that benjamin cann and bruno bichir who in this movie gives another example of his greatness as an actor soon get together again with a new film just remember how los olvidados luis buñuel was misunderstood when released but now we consider one of the best movies of all times please prepare yourself and watch this film
