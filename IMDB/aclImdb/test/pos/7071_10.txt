excuse me if im wrong but cronica para un desayuno could be one of the most gretatest films in tne mexican movie history for a lot of reasons we can get a lot of ingredients for a perfect mexican middleclass family breakfast a cup of buñuels surrealistic motifs with a little drop of ripstenian desolated scenarios a pound of phallus symbols around the film and a difficult psychological complexity more than todd solondzs happiness and the dogma movement films theres a lot of sordidness black humor repressed dreams teodoros dream of fly incestual lack of control the relation between marcos and luzma nosense parallel stories a discrete violence anachronisms andbr br a little sign of hope spotlighted in luzma the husbands home return and un poco mas used for leitmotif marcos bruno bichir is a charming character  i think in a bukoskian way the kingwithout acrown who dont expects for anything but broken noses luzma maria rojo  the lovable wife  put out a lot of faces but the only thing that she worried is that her sons had breakfast she s a loser in many ways and sensual in few moments  but you will fall in love of her the soundtracks drag too much woods feeds the lack of technical merits intentional  of course outoffocus shots overlighted closeups in introspective scenes dizzy pans and sudden edition cuts crónica is something difficult to digest it get stuck in the throat and anything helps for it it tastes bitter like a rotten orange juice and sour like expired milk but you want to enjoy it so i recommend to get some melox before the show because you wont get hungry after all
