i loved this movie to be very fair the movie starts off very slowly with none of the characters being terribly sympathetic it continues in this way for a good half of the filmbr br but if youre patient youll be greatly rewarded what the first half of the movie lacks in character development andor sympathy is adequately compensated for in the second half its a bit like riding a roller coaster  a slow uphill climb to strat off with and then speed twists and turns and a few surprisesbr br as usual meryl streep is wonderful she is the finest actress of our time william hurt is good if a bit wooden in spots renee zellweger does a very good job showing that her performance in jerry mcguire wasnt a fluke
