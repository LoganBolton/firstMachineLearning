i read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature finally its about time hollywood got their act together the big studios always frown at edgy material with oscar written all over it go figurebr br jericho mile was made ahead of its time its a masterpiecebr br michael mann a true visionary found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence peter strauss emmy award performance is probably the best character role ive seen in my filmviewing lifetime any actor who touches this role will never be the same unless an academy award is already sitting on their mantlebr br the gritty multi ethnic ensemble a backdrop for the jericho mile makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world this is about redemption without public validation and the power of the human spirit overcoming all barriers imagine a convict imprisoned since he was a teenager for life with no chance of parole that doesnt know he is possibly the fastest runner in the world what would you dobr br this movie makes you walk away feeling you havent been cheated on any level totally thrilling engaging emotional and a rolling stones soundtrack that kicks assbr br i always thought this would be made for the big screen cant wait in the meantime ill have to continue rewatching my weathered vhs copy ive had for many years
