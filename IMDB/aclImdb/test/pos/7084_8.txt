one true thing proves that its the characters which make a movie streep will surely receive an oscar nomination for her role a beautiful drama one true thing is a prime example of moviemaking in the late 1990s  there are still people out there who care about making and watching movies other than the big blockbusters with million dollar special effects its no best picture or anything dont be silly but the amount of emotion that was delivered by both the actors and the writer hit me like a shockwave i cried twice in this movie which says a lot for a 24 year old man
