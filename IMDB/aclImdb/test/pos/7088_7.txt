the dvd jacket in which this movie came describes it as uplifting and humorous those are not the words i would have chosen  not by a long shot i would choose a word like sombre sometimes even depressing which isnt to say that its a bad movie its actually a pretty good movie featuring good performances from the leads with enough uncertainty throughout about whats going to happen at the end that you keep watching the uncertainty comes from the structure of the movie  it seems to revolve around ellens reminiscences of her mothers slow death from cancer as she is interviewed by the da so we know from the start that something suspicious happened at the end  the questions are what and who br br renee zellweger was very good as ellen  the somewhat resentful daughter who has to give up her life and job in new york to return home to care for her sick mother ellen evolves through the movie  moreso than any other character  as she learns to deal with both the strengths and weaknesses of her parents her relationship with her father william hurt is quite interesting my initial impression was that they were quite close but the warts in the relationship start to show after a while hurt was effective as the detached husband  detached not in an uncaring way but in the sense of being unable to cope with whats happening to his wife and seeking escape from it in various ways finally meryl streep as the cancerstricken kate was very convincing in the role seeking to live out what remains of her life in the most fulfilling way possible then dealing with the anger she feels at her increasing debilitation in a way watching a family deal with this kind of crisis reminded me a little bit of ordinary people although this movie was far less emotionally intense so not uplifting and humorous with all due respect to whoever wrote the synopsis on the dvd jacket but very good in its own way 710
