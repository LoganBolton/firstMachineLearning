what impressed me the most about one true thing was how upfront it was when the daughter mentions her mothers cancer at the beginning of the movie as depressing the subject matter was it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blindsided with the revelation about a characters fatal illness 23 into the movie love story terms of endearment etc br br meryl streep renee zellweger and william hurt give very strong performances that dont go over the edge the characters they play seem human theyre not perfect people arguably one might not say that about the martha stewarttype character streep plays but throughout the film i found her character to be noble in a nonsappy way shes dealing with her plight the best way she knows how br br one true thing is an observant unsentimental family drama in which the tears at the end were wellearned
