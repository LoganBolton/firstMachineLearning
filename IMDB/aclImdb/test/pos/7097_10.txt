this movie was a very good universal monster movie it once again stars lon chaney as the wolfman and glenn strange as frankensteins monster oh yeah that jerk john carradine is back again as dracula i like every actor in this movie i especially liked onslow stevens as dr edelmann its spelled with 2 ns i thought it was a good idea to have the goodhearted doctor himself doomed like talbot was one scene that i think is very good is the scene when dr edelmann is in deep thought as he changes everything that is troubling him flashes before your eyes the good doctor is saying no while his evil side is saying yes thats the only reason why i didnt want the dracula character eliminated completely from this movie i thought dracula had no business in house of frankenstein if his character was taken out you wouldnt miss him in this film the doctors blood is contaminated with draculas giving him his jekyll and hyde curse i hate john carradine and i dont think he should have ever played dracula i didnt mind other actors playing the frankenstein monster after the great karloff because they all did good jobs but when they get another actor to play dracula it stops right there john carradine thought he was so high and mighty they offered him the role of the frankenstein monster once and he turned it down because he thought he was too highly trained i could just picture carradine if he did play the monster arguing with the director on the set i dont have to take this from you ive done shakespeare john carradine wasnt dracula and he never will be sorry john bela lugosi is the one and only dracula thank god they got bela to come back as dracula for abbott and costello meet frankenstein br br dont miss this movie it doesnt disappoint you and you will enjoy it as you did the other this is a very good addition to the monster movies if youre a collector be sure not to leave this one outbr br
