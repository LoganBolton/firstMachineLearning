this film marked the end of the serious universal monsters era abbott and costello meet up with the monsters later in abbott and costello meet frankentstein it was a somewhat desparate yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the wolf man frankensteins monster and dracula one last timebr br i say desparate because in the previous film house of frankenstein both dracula and the wolf man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be dracula by the sunlight and the wolf man by a silver bullet yet somehow they return in house of dracula with no explanation this movie could have played as a kind of prequel to house of frankenstein if the frankenstein monster plot wouldnt be continuing chronologically into house of dracula from house of frankenstein and if the wolf man didnt get cured then thered be no plot holes but since this is not the case the plots of dracula and the wolf man make no sensebr br however ignoring these plot holes house of dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film thats fun to watch it has many high points especially seeing the wolf man get cured i know i just said that this shouldnt have been included but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time and the scene with the lady playing moonlight senada on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under draculas spell was very eerie dr edlemans transformation into the dr jekylmr hyde type character was also done very wellbr br and its great to see dracula frankenstein and the wolf man together one last timebr br  out of
