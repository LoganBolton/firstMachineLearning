i liked house of dracula much more than house of frankenstein carradine is much more passable  his acting isnt as ridiculous  overboard as in hof the actors deliver solid enough performances the subplots eg the monster the village mobsters the village idiot the hunchback nurse etc  are mixed in well so that none becomes an odd splinter as in hof better run than the stitchedtogether hof the hunchback nurse is as likable as the hunchback in hof the doctor is very good as well lon chaney adds a classy touch with his wolfman worth watching twice a classic universal horror with that typical 1940s long lost flair especially good is the doctors performance beforeafter his blood had been contaminated with draculas
