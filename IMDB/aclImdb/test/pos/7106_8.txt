dracula john carradine visits dr edelman onslow stevens who believes everything can be cured by science he wants edelamn to cure his vampirismedelman agrees then lawrence talbot lon chaney jr pops up looking for a cure for his turning into a werewolf thr frankenstein monster is discovered too but doesnt really do anythingbr br very ambitious plot for a universal horror film from the 1940s trying to cure the monsters by science is actually an interesting idea also this movie has beautiful sets love the castle to doctor lives in tons of atmosphere is very welldirected great use of shadows and has pretty good special effectsbr br the acting is all good except for carradinehe tries but i could never accept him as dracula also lionel atwill pops in playing as always the chief of police this is pretty much forgotten and derided as a stupid film but i think its very good its also to last time the universal monsters were done seriouslythe next film was in 1948 in abbott  costello meet frankenstein its a great film but the accent is more on comedybr br the only real flaw here is theres a lot of plot for 67 minutes and some gaps in logic why does dracula try to bite lovely miliza martha odriscoll when hes being cured and why and how does the doctor get frankenstin into his castle still these are small complaints recommended
