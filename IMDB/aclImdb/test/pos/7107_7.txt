house of dracula isnt all that bad of a film and is rather decent at timesbr br spoilersbr br arriving at the home of dr franz edelmann onslow stevens in his seaside home count dracula john carradine discreetly seeks a cure for vampirism he starts work on a potential cure involving blood transfusion the wolf man lawrence talbot lon chaney jr arrives at his estate looking for a cure to lycanthropy working with the two patients he discovers a possible cure in a mold found near the laboratory and after searching the area he finds the frankenstein monster glenn strange buried nearby becoming obsessed with reviving it dr edelmann keeps neglecting dracula and larrys requests and after demanding that they get their treatment instead of him working on the monster they turn on each other in a climactic showdownbr br the good news this was a rather decent film there is one main idea that is quite creative and imaginative this is the first film to openly propose the idea of vampirism as a blood disease and one that can be transferred from person to person through the exchange of bodily fluid something that would be taken up by later genre works but rarely as directly as this theres even a microscope slide of the parasite that is believed responsible for the condition it works in some rather nicely used ideas and comes across as a rather nifty idea even if some of the execution is a little stale the fact that each of the creatures has at least one standout scene is a nicely done idea the wolf man has a marvelous scene where he transforms inside a prison cell to the doubting members of the search party and goes crazy draculas initial appearance of appearing as a bat and flying toward a prone figure sleeping and then appearing in human form looks really impressive the monster rampage is well handled and an appropriate amount of destruction is caused the large bat that dracula transforms into always looks decent for once and is quite realistically done its a thoroughly decent affairbr br the bad news there are several things that werent all that great about this one the fact that the film combines so much potentially intriguingly plots and ideas that it really doesnt know what to do with them there are several different backstories that have to be mingled together and which should be clear enough to mix well together and seem coherent this really doesnt have any of that the plot is rather flimsy and doesnt really give a preferential treatment to any of the stars and instead concentrates on one then another and then includes all three in the ending the monsters only seem to get engaged with each other for the smallest possible reason makes it a big distraction the ending is for once a big letdown and seems entirely like it was changed at the last minute theres a few other small things that werent all that spectacular and pretty much also contribute to thisbr br the final verdict its quite a decent film and manages to get through most of the time with an entertaining style nowhere near the classic status of each monsters debut features but its a nice enough watch for fans of the monsters and of universal films in generalbr br todays ratingpg violence
