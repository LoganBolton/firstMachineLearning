this is quite an entertaining bflick in the universal horror series featuring dracula the wolfman and frankensteins monster the plot revolves around dracula john carradine and larry talbot the wolfman lon chaney jr separately visiting a revolutionary doctor they both ask him if they can be cured and the doctor attempts to devise a way for each beneath the doctors castle they find frankensteins monster buried in mud this is apparently a reference to the previous movie in the frankenstein series br br of course if things had went as planned the movie would have turned out incredibly boring instead dracula cant suppress his appetite and the doctor is eventually infected by a blood transfusion with vampirism as a semivampire the doctor goes insane and awakens frankensteins monster as with all of the universal horror series the ending is completely unsatisfactory a beautiful woman with a hunchback one of the doctors two assistants has a particularly gruesome end plus you just have to feel sorry for frankensteins monster in this film  hes awake for around two minutes kills one police officer and then yet another building whats this the fifth now collapses on top of him and is consumed by flames it is also unfortunate that the great character created in the wolf man 1941 larry talbot is really reduced here people underrate that film and chaneys performance in it here he would be justifiably criticized as wooden all in all though its a pretty fun movie at just 68 minutes a nice waste of time 710
