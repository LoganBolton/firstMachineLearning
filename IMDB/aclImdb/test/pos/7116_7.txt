house of dracula works from the same basic premise as house of frankenstein from the year before namely that universals three most famous monsters dracula frankensteins monster and the wolf man are appearing in the movie together naturally the film is rather messy therefore but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the films sixty seven minutes dont become boring its obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writers head before an actual plot did as the yarn were given isnt exactly without holes the plot sees count dracula arrive at dr edelmans home asking for a cure for his vampirism then what can only be described as a coincidence sees lawrence talbot aka the wolf man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction it turns out that dracula is on the prowl for edelmans daughter but talbot really is serious when it turns out that he cant be stopped from turning into a wolf the wolf man throws himself into the seawhere he ends up finding frankensteins monsterbr br overall this film isnt as good as the earlier house of frankenstein the 1944 film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does as the plot here doesnt give equal time to each universal monster draculas plot is the biggest at first but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end the wolf man is the star of the show but his story never really develops and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in frankensteins monster is given the coldest hand as he appears in the movie merely as an afterthought and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie the story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting but this is a little disappointing as he isnt the reason why people will see this film the acting is good enough with john carradine showing his sinister side and lon chaney jr once again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy glenn strange is given nothing to do and onslow stevens proves the real highlight as dr edelman overall this film wont do much for anyone that isnt a fan of universal horror but as silly monster movies go house of dracula is worth seeing
