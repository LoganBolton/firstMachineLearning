my sister dad and i are really into dd and one night we were browsing netflix looking for a movie to watch when this one came up we thought we would try it out and i ended up almost dying from laughter the writing and acting in this movie is so amazing witty characters great interaction and hilarious moments kept us in stitches the entire time i love this movie it might not make that much sense for those who dont know about dungeons  dragons but nevertheless it is a good movie this only goes to show that movies dont need an astronomical budget and big name actorsactresses to be a success check it out if you want a good clean comedy
