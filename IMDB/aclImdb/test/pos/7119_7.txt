i am so impressed really i expected cheesy gamer humor and nothing elsebr br ok theres a ton of pretty geeky humor but the movie is so well done the acting is quite goodbr br the dialog while gamer cheesy at times i guess to cater to the gamer crowd is not bad at all at times its even dare i say greatbr br when the female gamer who built this non traditional fighter type character rather then the usual minmax type gets all these additional attacks seem right i did not check the rules it was coolbr br the sets are amazing for what must be a fairly low production moviebr br the story moves right along the transitions from game world to real world are well done a male playing a female character would sometimes be played by a female and sometimes by himself pretty clever i thoughtbr br the guy who decided to play a female but kept forgetting he was female was good for a lot of laughs he even said tag at one point and the female walked on to play the role  sorry i did not look her name up she did great though the guy always trying to get some got a bit tedious but i guess that was more gamer humorbr br there was just so much to like about the movie lighthearted fun very well done and i am saying that as a movie fan not a gamer and i am not a dd player as i said i expected so much lessbr br movies often dont hold my attention i end up listening to them while working on my computer this one held my attention i cant give a movie much higher praise
