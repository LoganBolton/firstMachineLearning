peter strauss by nature of appearing in miniseries and madefortv films often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews  usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film having channelhopped into it halfway through well ive just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about the jericho mile  that should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this filmbr br peter strauss won an emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much br br looking to be objective i attempted to criticise this film instead i found myself arguing down every one of my possible nitpicks this is what true realistic filmmaking is about this is not your typical hollywood sensationalism where everything is overacted  its so realistic and true to life that people have thought its based on a real event
