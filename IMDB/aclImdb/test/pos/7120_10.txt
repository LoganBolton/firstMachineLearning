there are few films that deal with things that i would consider myself an expert on this one isbr br after some years of fantasy role playing we split me not leaving without a sense of shame of what i had become a dorkbr br you see these things are really canonical it happens to everybodybr br first you create a character fairly and it dies after the first attackbr br then you help a little with the constitution and while youre at it why not help with strength intelligence intuition charisma and dexterity too this in turn frustrates the game master who doesnt know how to deal with this invincible gang and after a while it bores the players too so they start to create ever more exotic raceprofession combinations no matter how ludicrous it isbr br i created a druedain warrior monk yeah not that far from the filmbr br and thats not all to be said about the destructiveness of the inherent dynamic of this devilish game think the hunt for experience points but just watch the film it shows it all  and of course the stupidity of its most basic premissesbr br for this end in turn there is no better profession than the bard i dont exactly understand why the bard became a character in the first place after all the blacksmith is none but once it became one it had to be mapped into the game flow that is it had to be made lethal at least indirectly the poking of fun out of this never comes to an end and rightfully sobr br sure its not exactly a professional production but i havent seen a better satire in ages
