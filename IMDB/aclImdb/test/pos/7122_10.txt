this movie brilliantly captures the atmosphere of a dd group while watching i could not help but notice how vividly characters reminded me of myself and my gaming friends to the point where they acted literally the same as we do including the bickering the fighting the internal jokes driving the dm crazy everythingbr br it has it all jokes that made me cry action scenes which even filmed in lowbudget i found uncannily awesome the story is pretty straightforward and unsurprising but that doesnt really matter since the best part of the movie is to see the characters react and interact with each other and the npcsbr br seriously if youre playing dd or any similar rpg i cannot stress this enough watch this movie it captured beautifully the spirit of dd
