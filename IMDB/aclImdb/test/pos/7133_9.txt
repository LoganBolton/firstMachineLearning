im new to gaming but i would have started much sooner if this film had been around i caught it at gen con last year a trip made only as a favor to my husband and loved it even to a nongamer like i was at the time its funny and accessibleso much so that i finally relented and started sitting in on my husbands gaming groupbr br i dont want to give away any plot details but if youre a gamer you need to see this filmand if youre not youre going to have a great time despite yourself there are certainly in jokes but the vast majority of the film is accessible to anyonebr br my only complaints wish it were longer and wish it were available on dvd soon perhaps
