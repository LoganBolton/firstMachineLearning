i loved this film markie post is really great in it i saw it on lifetime and its in the same entertaining class as films like the betty broderick story locked up a mothers rage etc which by the way are also very good entertaining films its an over the top drama about a single mother who tries to break away from her middleclass predictable personality this movie is just pure entertainment it doesnt have to be a realistic look at heroin addiction but it does show how any regular middle class person can  they do get addicted to heroin junkies arent just homeless uneducated people on the street by the way if you do watch it check out how the kid bosses his mother around spoiled 8 out of 10 stars
