the 1990s film with anthony hopkins and debra winger is rightly showered with praise and i enjoyed it very much but this tv original is just as good and in some ways more appropriately cast claire bloom isnt a brash joy but she is still confident and throwing her cap at her favourite author played by joss ackland in one of his best performancesbr br quieter calmer and less emotional than the attenborough film this may be but it does justice to what is a marvellous play full of meaningful dialogue youll still cry to this version but perhaps you wont have the musical prompts to set you offbr br theres room for both  and having seen this on stage i would say that the acklandbloom one is slightly more faithful but theyre both excellent
