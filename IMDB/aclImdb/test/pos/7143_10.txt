easily one of my favourite dramatic tv films in many ways beautiful yet sad heartwarming and thoughtprovoking this is a superb dramatisation of a few years in the life of cs lewis and his relationship with joy davidman i found it to be incredibly absorbing with excellent and realistic dialogue and situations it all seemed very real yet there were also magical moments that almost leave you breathless with delight ackland and bloom as the central characters were excellent as were the supporting cast its one of those dramas that i find hard to criticise simply because for me there is nothing to be criticised it just works so well on so many levelsbr br very highly recommended
