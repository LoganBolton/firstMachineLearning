this is a wonderful movieits funny dark poignant thoughtprovoking innocently naughty and generally entertaining all around i dont know that ive seen the like beforethe raptureor maybe one of todd solondzs blackasnight comedies or even the recent movie teeth come to mindbut those are all bitter nasty little gems franklins despite the darkness around the edges manages to have a thoroughly sincere and pure heartbr br the story is similar to john waters low down dirty shame only this film differs in that it actually has a story and something to say as well beyond waters juvenile sex isnt dirty snicker nudgenudge message a conservative repressed family undergoes a drastic change as a result of a car accident and suddenly arent so conservative anymorein fact theyre finally actually happy probably the only people in their town or maybe the entire world who are to talk about why this is the case would be to spoil the film simply put everyone should see it though of course only people who are already sold on what the movies upbeat hopeful philosophy is ever wouldbr br the acting is greatjust this side of realistic enough to keep the proceedings from getting too heavyteresa willis gives an especially memorable and brave performance as an uptight mother who emerges like a butterfly when shes freed up both she and robertson dean deserve kudos for their unflinchingly sincere performances not to mention frequent and extensive nudity and sex scenes they turn what could have been a salacious joke involving a deviant sex practice into a touching believable and endearing moment aviva as the daughter is a standout and someone to watch perfectly capturing the attitude angst and speech patterns of a girl her age vince pavia as the himbo brother with a secret is good looking and functional although his storyline and how everyone reacts to it is more rewarding than his actual acting mari blackwell as the conflicted best friend to mother franklin is wonderfully cold confused and even compassionate in a role that could have gone overthetopbr br technically the film looks fantastic all bright colors and wideopen localesit looks like it may have been shot hidefif so the line has gotten very thin it looks very much like film there is a great deal of talking and a lot of it philosophical which gets a bit preachy moreso id imagine to a viewer who disagrees with the films politics but this film says a lot of things that need sayingif only people wouldnt be afraid to listen and think the arguments that take place are smart and well thought out first and foremost refusing to demonize either the religious or nonreligious partiesbr br the ending is on the ambiguous side which i found a bit of a disappointment somehowi think it wouldve worked better had the author as jay floyd is since he produced wrote and directed given a more workable denouement some sort of solution but then again there probably isnt one when it comes to pitting people with different faiths against one another all the same it was a moving memorable final image that left me choked upa success meanwhile im awfully glad mr floyd got this film made and look forward to sharing it with as many people as possible check it out
