ive never given a movie a ten out of ten before but this is the closest i have ever come i gave it a 9 there are very few movies that i truly love this however is one of them with its gritty realism fantastic onsite locationing and its great soundtrack it literally blew my young mind when i first saw it in 1979 at that point i didnt know about prisons violence racial tensions or the struggle to survive  live free i doubt that anyone who is an adult or for that matter anyone who is growing up in todays world could be impacted by this film in the same way i was all those years ago but i will say this if you havent seen this movie i envy you this is because you have the chance to see this great film for the frist time for each of us theyre different but heres to the rarest movies of them all the ones we actually love
