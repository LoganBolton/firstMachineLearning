its always a pleasure to see characters in a movie who are wholly goodhearted and wellintentioned even when theyre surrounded by those who are neither the films moderately silly premise is that the conservative religious franklin family mother father teen boy and girl are involved in an accident wherein the parents and brother have a neardeath experience during which they meet jesus a pleasant but somewhat exasperated soul who removes from them the burden of original sin when they return to their lives many of their views and attitudes have changed much to the consternation of the daughter who didnt share the experience the religious side is i think presented with a good balance from the good jesus to the starkly awful those of his followers who are obsessed with the sins of others and utterly oblivious to their own its a movie to make you think give you a few good laughs along the way and leave you with the pleasant feeling that the world just might be a nicer place than you think it is
