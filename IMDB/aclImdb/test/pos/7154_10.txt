wow just caught this movie from blockbuster and i love finding gems like this while it was definitely shot on a budget and misses a little bit in clumsy editing ie accident hospital scenes second to last end scenes for a first directorial effort i give this 10 stars i absolutely loved the thought provoking concepts brought forth and if youre a free thinker and open to ideas outside the box i highly highly recommend this movie i think the director and writer jay floyd should be given some attention and more opportunities in the film industry based on his credits he may be another quentin tarantino
