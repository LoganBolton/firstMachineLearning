in this tale of a tightly wound christian family that has three of its four members born again after a cakecaused car crash what really stands out is how grounded most of it is where there is so much potential to go over the top and how truly inspired most of the acting is where most of the films moments particularly its frank and innocent discussions of sexuality after three of the four family members have their guilt and shame removed is hilarious it is also thoughtprovoking and the characters stay with youbr br how often for example does a character in a comedy spin from near caricature to fullbodied emotional being in the course of one scene how often do we see a cast that can pull back from showboating midsentence in order to show a bit of the humanity beneath the characters skin even many of the bad guys in this film have moments of heartbreaking honesty even while much of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and horrifying there is truth and history behind even the most questionable acts in this film which is a difficult task in satirebr br how refreshing it is to see a darkish comedy that can dare to be humanistic how nice to see actors so fully committed to character that they can dare to let them be ridiculous and sublimebr br and as a gay person i do not think i have ever been quite so touched by a heterosexual sex scene as i was by the first sexual encounter between the parents of this family after their accidentbr br bravo bravo one of my favorites at outfest this year
