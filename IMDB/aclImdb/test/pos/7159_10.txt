just saw this film the other day at the santa fe film festival i was delighted by its honesty and humor it was the most thought provoking movie ive seen in a very long time  i just cant get it off of my mind for some reason it may not be for everyone because it makes you think i dont know if people like to think in movies so much anymore which is a shame the actors who play the franklins are quite a find i couldnt imagine playing these complicated people with such frankness though i thought a couple of the supporting characters were not as good as the franklins i can totally forgive it  because this is an important movie in my opinion i didnt expect to like it so much but as ive thought about it for a few days its proving to be a very relevant piece of entertainment
