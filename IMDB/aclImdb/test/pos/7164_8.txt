i originally saw this movie as a blockbuster vhs rental that was quite some time ago but still remembered it blockbuster doesnt have it anymore netflix didnt have it and there werent many copies on the web  only a few spendy vhs copies recently did finally find it available in dvd form on ebay for a reasonable price in pal format but our dvd player will play pal discs on our ntsc tvbr br wife and i both enjoyed it the style of the movie is a bit strong and many if not most of the parts are rather strongly overplayed as if amateurs were making itespecially the kids but its not bothersome the contrasts of societies are accentuated in the overplaybr br there is a bit of political preaching in terms of saying that the young in russia shouldnt try to escape their notsogreat life but instead should at least try to make things better first but thats not dominant its fairly humorous most of the timebr br some downplaying of the west commented upon by others isnt that at all imo i take it as a comment about expectations of the russian characters at least when taken from my western viewpoint perhaps its a downplay of the west from a russian viewpoint which it is literally by the characters saying itbr br i cant say how literally true to the film the english subtitles are but i can say that the subtitles were done very well full of english idioms as if done by a native english speaker  complete with colorful language
