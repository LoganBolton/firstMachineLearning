one unfortunate reality of postsoviet russia was that the peoples welfare didnt change much from soviet times as we see in window to paris most people are still as depressed as ever while they are encouraged to go after moneybr br then everything changes for music teacher nikolai chizhov sergei dontsov after he finds a window that leads to paris he and his friends are naturally quite amazed at what they find this movie has one of the funniest discussions of elvis presley and edith piaf that ive ever heard so watch this movie youre sure to love it its sort of a precursor to being john malkovich
