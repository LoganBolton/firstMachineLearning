my first mamin film saw it on ifc long ago and loved it it seemed absolutely artistic original fun and hilarious not a moment in the film let me down or made me bored and i was laughing a lot or had a smile on my face i mean this movie is truly funny but heres the catch its also very artistic and creative  if you dont know yuri mamin probably sadly because so many of his great films arent available here he has a very original style like no one elses and for me this isnt even my favorite film of his right now its the insane saideburnsbakenbardy also i have to say as a russian this film is great because you really do see what russians are like and this is possible because this is a true russian film to me not a foreign film trying to be american or trying to appeal mamin did not sell out nor has he since gorko 1998 was as good if not better this is true russian style filmaking that came out of communist social realismbr br if you liked this film i think you have a very high chance of loving mamins other films in fact i like quite a few of them more than this one i guess this one is his most accessible film a similar film is fountain taking place 6 years before during perestroika it has the same actor in the leading role and more of mamins regulars who you will recognize from window to paris this one has one supernatural twist in the end but is mostly a realistic comedy a great one viva mamin hopefully criterion will hook all of his movies up one day hes still working and his catalog is so great see any of his films if you can
