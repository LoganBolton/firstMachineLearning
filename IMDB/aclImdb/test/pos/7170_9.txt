i thought that i wrote a comment on this movie before but i cant find it on here anyway i am writing it again i accidentally found this movie from my colleges library collections it was free to watch so why notbr br i am certainly glad that i watched it i love this movie i have seen a few russian movies before most of them have serious topics i am surprised that this was one a good comedy i had a great laugh while watching it and this is a movie that i want to buy this thing is so funny and they are not just silly funny those plots were very original and well thought so they dont seem to be silly at all i am surprised that this movie didnt attract many viewers this is a classic that you can watch it over and overbr br those actors were also very authentic their acting are real not faked if you havent watched it go get a copy soon definitely recommended
