this movie just screened on channel seven  australian tv  todaybr br in my opinion it was a very interesting take on how the nazis treated the russian jews as mercilessly as everywhere elsebr br kellie martin did a really great job and her tears and frustration as frusia were quite convincingbr br the holocaust is a part of our history that we must not forget schindlers list wasnt the first  and it wont be the last  account of survival and courage in that five year nightmare my family is dutch and i will always applaud any movie makers who want to keep the candlelight alive by telling of someones courage to stand up and help those who were being abused violated and murdered for being a jew
