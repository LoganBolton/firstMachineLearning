a film of high intelligence and activity as well as being a strong capsule of the time and persona that was the 60s the film is also truly a surprise in its forwardthinking themes and the unique presentation of the system of power in a group william greaves appoints himself to the authoritative role in the group he asks his crew members to film and film and keep filming first the two actors then the crew filming the actors then the entire set including bystanders policemen and finally a homeless man whose been living in bushes in central park for 9 weeksbr br greaves edits the film thousands of feet together and surprisingly makes a strong narrative with an interesting arc and motivations dont expect to be bored by this film each of crew make for engaging conversationalists and often times are voicing the thoughts that the observer has watching this film greaves does well at integrating the multiple camera takes using synchronized threeinone pictures and other attention shifting methodsbr br in the end the film will really only be effective if its what youre looking for if youre looking for some abstract arty film that feeds your own selfindulgent ego while never having a point look elsewhere if youre looking for a film that will have you talking and thinking long afterward about the desire for honesty and sincerity in documented reality and the inevitable transparency that comes of it then this is the perfect film
