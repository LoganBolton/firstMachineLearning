you cannot be seeing the same movie if you didnt grow up in france or spent at least 10 years there like me i dont know if it will ever make it outside french cultural borders i include belgium and luxembourg here you cannot translate its kind of fun  every name is joke how many people outside paris would understand the pun in couloirdebus the name of one of the roman legionnaires  however monica bellucci is so beautiful i almost forgot to breathe when i saw her
