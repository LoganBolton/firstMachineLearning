the above line sums it up pretty good the best assets of the comics are its visual gags and wordjokes the latter of which are almost impossible to translate which is why the comics are at their best in their original languagebr br both are quite hard to capture in film which is why those will never be as good as the comics movies are simply a different medium than comics with that in mind this movie does surprisingly well in capturing the fun of the comicbr br the word gags are bearable and sometimes even funny debouze does an amelie reference i have to mention that i watched the french version if you dont watch the french version or your lack of understanding of the french language limits you to the subtitles the word jokes will probably suckbr br the slapstick is okay as well its a very simple form of humor and not really funny when youre older than twelve but it captures the spirit of the comicbooks the other visual jokes are the movies saving grace for the older audience as their often quite funnybr br the acting is totally over the top but again thats not annoying at all as it captures the spirit of the comicbooks only depardieu and clavier dont really overact which might be the reason some people think they didnt enjoy their roles i didnt notice a thing on the other hand jamel debouze and especially claude rich turn overacting into an artform its actually fun to watch again i fear it wouldnt be nearly as funny when the voices are dubbedbr br overall not a bad movie at all much better than the previous one its not a classic and it doesnt dethrone the twelve tasks of asterix as my favourite asterix movie but its still worth seeing the french version that is 710
