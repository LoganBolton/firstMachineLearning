jennifer montgomerys art for teachers of children is a stunning disturbing masterpiece montgomerys gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14yearold jennifers seduction of her married boardingschool guidance counselor the scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing jennifer caitlin grace mcdonnell and jennifers mother actually voiced by ruth montgomery on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful ive ever seen captured on film the lesson ultimately learned here theres nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art well i would highly recommend this remarkable piece of art for anyone interested in thoughtprovoking independent cinema
