in the original french version the jokes of numérobis great funny voice  jamel debbrouze are very funnybr br but in translated versions i saw the german  english version its not half good than the originalbr br but goof special effects almost the full comic with differences like the figure of lügnix german name is placed in an other comic bookbr br sure the asterix comic book are cult but when you watch the animated comic movies from 1968 to 1998 you will see much better jokes better story and the old charme and flair of the cult storiesbr br for french speaking people i suggest to watch it in its original version with or without subtitles where available in different languages
