it is the first time i can recall where an adaptation did exactly like the book in fact only jokes were added to the story rather than content blended or removedbr br such as the egyptian slave cellularis who had difficulty transmitting um communicating lol or when tidivinnus was played like a quasisith lord and got annoyed when the roman empire endured a blow the general ordered for the empire to ah watch the movie folksbr br i can easily believe that this picture was one of the most expensive in french cinema history and for my part it was worth it depardieux was excellent as the roman bashing and boar chomping obelix clavier playing the little indomitable gaul was perfect and a far cry from his days as the bumbling squire of jean reno in just visitingbr br the fightscene between artifis and edifis was hilarious and was nice to see the matrix theme was not borrowed to despoil an otherwise perfect battlebr br redbeard the pirate and his crew almost stole the picture from scuttling their own ship to being the engine for otis edifis assistant invention used at the very endbr br i understand theres asterix and the olympics with many of the same team back by toutatis i plan to view that too
