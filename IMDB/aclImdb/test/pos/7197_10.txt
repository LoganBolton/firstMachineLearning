ive read every adventure of asterix and obelix at least 5 times and im also a fan of les nuls and les robins des bois and jamel so i expected a lot from this movie and i finally got satisfied unlike the first adaptation of asterix on the big screen astérix et obélix contre césar which wasnt a real success besides the appearance of laetitia casta this one really captures the spirit of the comic and we get the beautiful monica bellucci in the first movie the director tried to be too realistic about the time where the story is set and it killed the whole spirit that made asterix hilarious in this one all the clothing the way of talking and everything is identical to goscinny and uderzos work more it really stick to the original story with the downside that we know pretty much everything thats going to happen but alain chabat gave us a few surprises at the end i really enjoyed that movie and everytime that the first sign of boringness starts to appear jamel comes in and makes us laugh like crazy this movie is a big mix of all the kind of humor i really like and even if maybe its mixing it too much i cant help but to like it so if you like asterix and the humor of all these young talents that started in nulle part ailleurs a french mix of the tonight show and snl go see this movie
