i was lucky to see this sequel before the original because im not sure i would have gone out of my way to see it if the contrary had been true i found mission cléopâtre better than its predecessor for different reasons but the major one is this  it was almost word for word an adaptation of one book not an amalgam like the first movie the physical resemblance of some characters to their animated self were very funny especially the bad guy whos name is escaping me but hes the other architect i dont know how this movie played in english my first language is french so i didnt have that problem i imagine some of the jokes werent that easy to translate ive learned something with years its better to watch a movie with the subtitles than with the dubbing maybe you wont understand what is said but you wont lose the rhythm and i think thats important too i would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves astérix et obélix
