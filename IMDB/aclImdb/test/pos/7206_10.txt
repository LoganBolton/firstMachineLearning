this is definitely a must see film the excellent director alain chabat also acting as ceasar has managed to capture the very essence of the adventures of astérix the french comic books its based upon and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy which is also an homage to the world of animated films this movie is so funny so full of jokes both visual and spoken that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all between your bursts of laughter the only drawback is that a nonfrench audience or at least a nonfrench speaking audience might not get all the private jokes there are so many dialogues impossible to translate so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the french way of life that the fun might be lessened however its still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture the amazing stunts the music the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting all actors are great but the film would not be the same without jamel debouze gérard darmon and edouard baer and please dont ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books  astérix et obélix contre césar and directed by claude zidi
