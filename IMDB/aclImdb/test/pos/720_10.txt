if you enjoy riddles and suspense you will enjoy this movie truth be told it was mostly the adrian paul part that got me to pick it up i knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand plot is sarah carly pope a student of philosophy and metaphysics starts playing a mysterious riddle game trying to figure out the reason and gets involved in the game by solving riddles vern adrian paul is a shop owner also a riddle fanatic and also gets entangled in the game myth has it that if you solve the game the meaning of existence referred to as the design is revealed brendan fehrs character is a village idiot type hanging around the shop who turns out to be more than he seems all in all i thought the movie was pretty well done and its definitely an original concept a rare find these days i personally happen to like riddles and puns so while most of them werent very difficult it was still a fun movie well worth the rentalbr br  so if you havent seen it  get it dbr br
