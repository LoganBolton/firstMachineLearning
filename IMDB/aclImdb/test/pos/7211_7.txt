can this really be a troma movie some scenes almost have an a movie look the acting is generally competent the two leads and the nursesurrogate were especially good and i liked some of the confrontations between the young capulets and ques the scenes were smoothly edited the plot is coherent its funny it has a hip original sound trackbr br it does have the usual troma grossouts and low humor but i dont think shakespeare would have minded so much in fact i think he might have gotten a few good laughs out of thisbr br its a good dvd there is an alternate sound track with a very informative commentary by the director several deleted scenes and the usual collection of troma selfdeprecating sillinessbr br im not going to tell you this was citizen kane but it is some pretty inspired lowbudget filmmaking
