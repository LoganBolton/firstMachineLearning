tromeo and juliet is perhaps the best shakespeare modernization i have ever seen not that theres much competition but anywaybr br all in all tromeo and juliet is definitely one of tromas better movies one of the little pearls hidden in a towering heap of dung its a funny actionpacked gory take on the worlds greatest love story but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as one can except from this kind of movie well except for the ending where tromeo and juliet kill juliets abusive father and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their hideously mutated childrenbr br this is the movie high school literature classes should show instead of making poor students read through hundreds and hundreds of pages of shakespeares scripts thumbs up
