wow this movie is amazing it is such an excellent film has some sick scenes not nearly as sick as terror firmer or citizen toxie some nudity and this was the penis monsters debut on film this has set the scene for many of tromas movies this is a very tromatic film it mixes comedy romance and my favorite horrorgore not that much gore in this flick but enough to satisfy this is the best adaption of shakespeares romeo and juliet much better than any other version they make it so entertaining and fun to watch and we have debbie rochonhehei like her  all i have to say is this is a great film very funny and lemmy is a good host for it the acting is good and kaufman directs stylishly as always must see for all troma fans
