this movie is really sick and funny i have made my friends cringe describing it to them i saw it about 8 months ago and i still have the song shall we gather at the river echoing through my headbr br so basically it is a tromatized romeo and juliet but it goes beyond what you would expect lets just say incest references to child molestation gore of course but unfortunately has a sort of happy endingsort ofits more weird than happy cappy capulet was brilliant he has this sort of intellectual snobbish tone hes abusive but civilised he quotes more shakespeare than anyone else in the filmall while engaging in his sadistic role as a husband and fatherbr br the meat guy was pretty cool too he was juliets fianc√© deeply infatuated with her and soon to be heartbroken because of tromeo and tromeo a true romantic hes a handsome really sweet guy desperate to find true love she doth make torches to burn brightly unfortunately troma just had to resort to that awful fake green vomit and their other antics they really get carried away with that stuff sometimes but hey this film made a great impression on me how often do i refer to it in real life situationswow thats patheticbr br anyway enjoy
