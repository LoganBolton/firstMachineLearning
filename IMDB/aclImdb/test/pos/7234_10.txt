this is the best movie ive ever seen and ive seen a lot im not even a troma fan ive never heard of troma before watching this moviebr br i had already given up hope to see a great movie until i saw tromeo and juliet this movie is a dream coming true shakespeare would likely be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic there are sex violence humor and satire it breaks many taboosbr br this movie is neither disgusting nor stupid its hard to describe with words how clever funny exciting and witty this movie is the music is great and perfectly fits every scene the characters are very believable and the acting is great i really cared for the charactersbr br it is certainly not for tromas fans only its for all people who have a sense of humor and like clever and believable entertainment as opposed to totally stupid and unbelievable mainstream movies that dont dare to do what this movie doesbr br the bad reviews only prove that this movie is great and something exceptional you either love it or hate it like all true works of art it isnt understood and appreciated by all people
