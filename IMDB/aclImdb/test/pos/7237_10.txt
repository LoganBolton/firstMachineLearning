yes they finally got it down to perfection what a great idea a refreshing exploitation epic for generationx whether they know it or not after disasters like sgt kabukiman nypd and getting screwed by blockbuster our hero lloyd kaufman just decided to go for it stop catering to distributors and let troma be all the troma it can be lloyd would make this one the most unapologetic outlandish and downright hilarious troma movie yet this time lloyd takes shakespeares love story turns it inside out tromatizes it and adds that long lost entertainment value it was always lacking entertainment value such as lemmy kilmister the narrator debbie rochon the cook joe fleishaker the fat guy and of course brutal mutilations and toilet humor tromeo and juliet is the definitive edition of a rather lackluster story and the crown jewel of the troma universebr br years ago in tromaville nj business partners monty que and cap capulet start a film company called silky films which would produce supposedly tasteful soft core films monty considers cap his friend but cap is out to screw the poor sucker out of his share of the company on paper and in books it appears that monty gave away his lifes work for free fast forward to mid90s manhattan we have two families who are extremely displeased with one another its to the point that theyre just looking for a reason to take a limb or preferably a life monty has a son tromeo nephew benny they with their friend murray martini whos just a little too excited about all the carnage wage war on the incestuous capulets except monty hes too drunk to care like in the original there is a confusing situation leading to tromeo falling for caps daughter who he has never met or never even knew about unfortunately cap is a sadistic pervert who not unlike tromeos dad has a thing for the bottle and this would of course lead to daddys little chenshaw melon being physically and emotionally abused and molested and kept in a plexiglas cage off and on depending on how foul of a mood cap is in cap is also forcing his vegetarian daughter to marry london arbuckle a billionaire butcher who would make just about anyone uneasy with or without the raisin loaf with all these inconveniences the young lovers feel that eloping would be the best decision but how will this effect the big feud it might or might not go a little something like the original but figuring out how this one ends up is just simply not going to happen youll never see it comingbr br the one with leo is downright sleepinducing compared to tromeo  juliet but if watereddown overdirected bigbudget hollywood garbage is what youve been programmed to go for then by all means go for it but if youre in the mood for something a little more colorful something that really packs a punch and doesnt follow the normal movie pattern and if you happen to have a rather abnormal sense of humor then you just might not hate this movie tromeo and juliet gives the finger to all that is mainstream fullblast exploitation with as much meanspirited humor as anything from a young john waters along with some badass acting tromeo and juliet flaunts a thunderous score which includes the legendary motorhead and not to mention much input from james gunn that really brought this one together for more awesomeness from james gunn check out lollilove and for more excellence from lloyd kaufman check out his next vision terror firmer tromeo and juliet is jawdroppingly priceless exploitation for the 90s brought to us by the one and only king of the bmovies thanks lloyd 1010
