as always joan hickson is wonderful as jane m subtle sharp and aware i do not wish to dwell on her acting skills as they are praised enough on this site i would like to criticize some of the smaller parts as the rest of the cast seemed to be hand picked by director david tuckerbr br liz frasers performance as mrs bent the mother of the missing girl nora is a joy to watch subtle and deeply moving as the alcoholdepending grieving mother who loves and misses her daughter desperately a good long shot of her monologue thanks tucker so she can be enjoyed to the fullest i was moved when i saw her the first time when it was broadcast and i am moved again now i have it on dvd bravabr br joanna hole as madge the tourguide i find highly amusing she is on the edge of overacting but her role can have it she is so funny as the overorganized guide who wants to do good with everyone on that bus i find her hilarious her reaction after she boarded everyone on the bus is great as always to perform comedy one has to take it very seriously and thats what ms hole doesbr br i do hope those two ladies have good careers as i live in holland i do not know if they have not all theater productions can be googled their performances on the screen deserve itbr br pieter
