so it might not be entirely historically accurate and there is little or no real character development but for jake son of ridley scotts first attempt its well worth the ticket pricebr br captain james macleane jonny lee miller looking as good as ever may be a gentleman but he hasnt got the money or the clothes to prove it plunkett robert carlyle with all his clothes on is an apothecaryturnedoutlaw the circumstances of their strange meeting involve a dead body a ruby and eventually a partnership as the gentlemen highwaymen as the tag line says they rob the rich and thats it there isnt really much background or even indepth development but the object seems to be to relieve the aristocracy of enough money and jewels to pay for the two highwaymens passage to america one small problem macleane falls in love with the chief justices ward rebecca liv tyler who happens to also have caught the eye of the thief taker generalbr br the plot is original enough the casting is excellent especially alan cumming as the dragqueenish lord rochester carlyle and milleralso together in trainspotting they havent lost their dynamic the costuming is fantastic the makeup is outrageous and the music is hardedged techno with a strangely classical undertone jake scott has an eye for light and shadow a good sense of balance between spectacle and plot and he isnt squeamish about showing the more unpleasant side of 17th century london and lucky for us he likes closeups of faces especially eyes jonny lee millers eyes and liv tylers too but hey who is this movie about rebecca no plunkett and macleane but theres more to this movie than just pretty faces at the risk of sounding cliche its a fast furious and sometimes frustrating ride with the most noble highwaymen since robin hood decadent sleazy and violent scotts debut film makes for an entertaining evening at the moviesbr br as macleane says i was terrific and it was a bloody good laugh
