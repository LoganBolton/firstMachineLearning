this has to be my favourite film the script is sharp and played to the limit by an excellent miller and fantastic carlisle sharp wit excellent narrative and no hollywood polishing a totally immersible film which has you gunning for the bad guys stott excels again as the detestable chance while liv tyler truly beats her other lighter performances as the excitementhungry rebecca the soundtrack may not be known to you by name but anyone who has ever seen top gear watched the football or seen any tv action sequence is probably familiar with it particularly due to craig armstrongs escape which must allow him never to work again the soundtrack on first play may seem out of place in a costume dramaactioncomedy but one rewatching shows it is perfectly at home in giving the the script its dramabr br my one gripe about this film is that it isnt shown enough on tv where is it truly excellent sharp and classy  youll not regret watching it  again and again exits to switch on dvd player
