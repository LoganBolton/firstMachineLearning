i tend to like historical period films and get new ideas for costumes for my historical group and a friend recommended this one to me i like johnny lee miller as an actor so i figured it was worth it and i was definitely rewarded his portrayal as a member of the english noble class was by far more accurate than ive seen in the past the comedy aspect of it left my sides hurting the costumes werent awful and historically i didnt wince too much i also noticed the fact that england didnt have a proper sewage system until much later but anyone who dose not go deep into the minutae of englands past wont notice nor care absolutely worth seeing i highly recommend this movie
