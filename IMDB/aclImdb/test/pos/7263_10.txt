normally i hate period films living in england is a nightmare at the moment if you have an allergy to period dramas  which i do however this one is the best it doesnt take itself seriously and jonny lee miller and robert carlyle are great together liv tylers good as well although her english accent is dodgybr br the film has everything for someone who just wants to go the cinema to enjoy themselves it has action adventure drama and comedy im not sure how well the jokes will translate across the ocean but hopefully they will it would be a shame for american audiences to miss out on this film it shows that english filmmakers can produce something that doesnt involve constant swearing and sex both do feature in this but in a balanced format iain robertsons camp portrayal of the well to do gentleman is brilliant and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class set are hilariousbr br as the trailer for the spy who shagged me is pupported to sayif you see one other filmthis spring make it plunkett and macleane its got fun action lurve and of course jonny lee miller with an english accent for a change
