this movie without doubt is the best i have seen and really shows what british talent can do its effects are exceedingly good considering the movie is set in the mid 18th century and all the grittiness and disgusting filth of england at the time is captured very well the characters are developed and fleshed out from macleanes whoring antics to his development into highwayman and exhibitionary the gentleman highwayman contrast well with robert carlyle whos cynicism and honour show that you can love a thief and a criminal cos i quote hes got more honour in his little finger than any of you fat bastardsbr br not referring to you of course but it has arguably the most stirring and emotionally charged scene ever witnessed in a movie but youll just have to see it to find out suffice to say that it involves rope round your neckbr br
