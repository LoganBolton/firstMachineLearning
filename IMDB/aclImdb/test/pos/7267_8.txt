 is the princess bride meets well trainspotting but wait really its a good combination this was definitely one of the better movies ive seen in a long time it has the kind of witty dialog i associate with the princess bride or cemetery man along with the disgusting scenes of violence of a horror movie the heroic feel of princess bride combined with the this is odd lack of any really good guys that trainspotting hadbr br im not saying it was as good as the princess bride but it was in the arena and it rocked some of the dialog transcends pleasing to brilliant the plot is interesting the characters  while slightly anacronistic  are anacronistic not due to their intrinsic nature there were flamboyantly gay people in the 18th century contrary to a previous reviewers remarks but just in a bit of the language they used the anachronisms made it fun though and not cheesy and easily dismissedbr br if youve ever read any simon r green or gleen cooks garrett series you know exactly what this movie is check it out its great
