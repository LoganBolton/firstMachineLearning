im amazed that i have a real affection for this one inasmuch as im not an action and adventure lover but hey its pretty tough to go wrong with a robert carlyle film ive read several poor or temperate reviews on this film pulling it apart for its period errors or unlikely plot development but no one seems to mention the rather intriguing character transition which features how a hardened downonhisluck scoundrel carlyle transforms into a rather noble selfless hero and how the prettyboy cowardly vagrant millerdevelops a real taste for the life of a highway man once he gets the feel of it filled with lots of badboy humor lavish scenes particularly the use of fireworks by former apothacary plunkett and a charmingly ecclectic musical score plunkett  macleane is a fastpacedhighly enjoyable piece of film making its certainly worth your viewing time for the climax scene alone shoot em up boys
