when i sat down in the cinema to see this i was expecting to see a sort of stylish tongueincheek action film which had been implied by the trailers however it very quickly became apparent that this film was trying to be morebr br normally i dont approve of films that try to entertain in as many ways possible for instance this film tries to mix action with comedy romance lightheartedness and gritty seriousness all at once most of the time this sort of approach doesnt work in films just look at batman forever but i was was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case they pulled it offbr br the end result is a highly entertaining film that should appeal to most mature cinemagoers however the weak of stomach should really be warned of one or two scenes robert carlyle and jonny lee miller pull of a brilliant double act and ken stott does a excellent villain this mixed in with superb costumes and a few decent action scenes makes for a very enjoyable watchbr br however the big letdown here for me is that in having the gentleman highwayman there was a real opportunity for some good dialogue but the script was definitely lacking in punchiness and there were few belly laughs okay so the lines werent terrible but to me it does highlight a problem with recent british films ignoring a few notable exceptions the screenplays being written today are still relatively mediocre when compared to some of hollywoods efforts
