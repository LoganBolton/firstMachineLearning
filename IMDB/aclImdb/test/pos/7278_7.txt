after reading the terrible reviews of this movie including comments said to be quoted from colin i almost didnt bother to add this film to my firth film collection however being the firth fan which i am intrigue got the better of mebr br to my surprise i thoroughly enjoyed the movie it had suspensedrama and intrigue and vsexy colin scenes the plot kept me guessing right until the end credits and i felt that once one got past jennifer rubens opening scenes that the actress played her role convincingly colin was as brilliant as ever and its great to see him play a character from the dark side a chill went down my spine and after watching this i cant wait to see colins recent film traumasoon to be out on dvd br br ok perhaps it wasnt a film that was in your face so to speak and one couldnt go to sleep on the plotespecially towards the end as there was a lot going on but that was what i liked about it the acting was subtle thankfully not overdone like many suspense thrillers this made the film all the more chilling to watch one just couldnt second guess what colins character ross talbert or for that matter jennifer rubens characterjamie harris was going to do next and there were quite a few surprises in store i sat on the edge of my seat throughout with a cushion handybr br personally i am very glad that i watched playmaker and i shall certainly rewind and view again i think that any firth fan would benefit from watching this film if they didnt like the plot then just watch colin
