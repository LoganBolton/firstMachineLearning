its become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie anymore thought this movie was a good thrillerbr br could have had better production values but what kept me going was the suspense and the twists i had real reservations before seeing this movie because of the cover i was afraid that it would be excessively bloody and gory i was wrongbr br although there is a lot of scary parts there is a lot of suspense and drama toobr br the acting in dead line was better than what you would expect from a micro budget horror flick the characters were believablebr br the movie is really thrilling and quite scary at moments so it makes you grab your seat until the ending credits rollbr br because of its production values the sound is not very good for example 810
