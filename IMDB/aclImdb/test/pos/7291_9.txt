alright im 12 so this is where you get to see the movie from a preteens point of view ive also commented on magnolia and bicentennial man both great movies if you want to check it out alright here on earth was a beautiful movie with astounding scenes and images very pleasing to the eye the writer i dont know who it was check imdb either worked very hard or has a good appreciation for love poetry and drama i cried 4 times throughout this movie once for over 30 minutes it was really sad really beautiful really meaningful its a great movie for anyone say 11 and up who isnt a romanticcomedy freak yeah its romantic yeah its comedic but in my opinion its better than shes all that or whatever it takes i never cry its a tender story go rent it and tape it
