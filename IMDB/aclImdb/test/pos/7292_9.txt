i dont understand why critics would bash this movie its a teen movie thats actually serious which is a rarity ill admit that there are moments that are hugely sappy but cmon its about young love its gotta be sappy to be valid my biggest complaint is chris klein while he was funny in american pie he apparently isnt ready for the switch into more dramatic fare yet hes very uncomfortable looking in some of his mama stuff hartnett and sobieski on the other hand demonstrate a remarkable amount of depth and believability as do the parents although the script is heavily cliched with the lovers spouting off poetry the actors make it work the directing sports some powerful images on the screen beautiful cinematography nice music great young actors i was impressed and im a jaded critic when it comes to teen movies
