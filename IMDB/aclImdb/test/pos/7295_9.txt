one of the message boards threads at imdb had two women talking about colin firth how they watched the movie only because of him obviously these were two young women but what struck me is how little this movie has been appreciated by audiences generally the brilliant and i mean brilliant performances by michelle pfeiffer and jessica lange were hardly noticed not only by audiences but by the academy and by most of the criticsbr br i think i know why first the plotor actually just the setupis a kind of bastardization of shakespeares king lear with the dying crazy patriarch and the three scheming daughters who will inherit their names even begin with the same letters regan goneril and cordeliarose ginny and caroline and i guess larry jason robards works for lear the apparent idea envisioned by jane smiley in her pulitzer prize winning novel was to tell a learlike story from the point of view of the daughters and to tell it a sort of late twentieth century realistic way not considered by the bard the problem is in smiley and moorhouses story the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses while the father is a most despicable character without much in the way of redeeming qualities his only strength was his ability to make a financial success of the farm however we can even discount that since his father and grandfather before him built the farm and he inherited itbr br the second problemand this is one i cannot personally attest to not having read smileys novelis that the movie is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel still it is almost always the case that an excellent novel especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances cannot be faithfully transferred to the screen the vision and audio demands of film drown out the subtleties of a narration while the time constraints dont allow for the full development of character and motivation achieved by the novelist given five or six hours perhaps moorhouse could have made a movie more in keeping with smileys novelbr br a third problem is one that is perhaps moorhouses alone she began her directing career with the very well done aussie film proof 1991 starring russell crowe she follow it up with how to make an american quilt 1995 which celebrated women especially women of a certain age however it was a bit heavyhanded and clearly and determinedly a chick flick in a sense a thousand acres takes off from there showing us not only the point of view of women but does so in a way that may seem politically motivated to some larry cook is clearly a bad bad daddy he beat his daughters and he had carnal knowledge of them he ran the household with an iron fist jess colin firths character seduces the inexperienced ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a bit of fun it would appear and then he goes to rose who clearly is going to be the power behind the new ownership and hooks up with her while incidentally inducing her husband to end his life in a drunken accident the rest of the men are onedimensional characters without nuance the way they often appear in romance novels i think most audiences were put off by the heavyhanded incest adultery and sexual betrayal that was woven into the storybr br having said all this i think the critics and the public are wrong i think the direction was biased against men but in this story it needed to be i think moorhouse did a fine job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that were none too pretty and the acting by pfeiffer and lange was nothing short of sensational they seemed to feed off of one another in a way that i found absolutely authentic and deeply moving in particular pfeiffer was riveting as she projected her bentup anger and hatred the way moorhouse allowed her character to be revealed to us gradually is a tribute to her ability as a director as well as to pfeiffers outstanding performance and the skill with which moorhouse guided the change in ginnys character as she went from a ninny as she called herself to someone with selfawareness and some understandable bitterness was also excellent the fact that she left her husband was as much out of shame as anything else he needed to go get her and forgive her and bring her back and robards in his intensity and madness was also very goodbr br i predict that this film which bombed in theaters will be better appreciated in the years to come as people see it on dvd my question is whatever happened to moorhouse her talent is obvious but she has yet to director her fourth feature film when she does i hope she remembers to go with what she believes but to be fair as well i think actually she was fair to the two lead character in this film but didnt pay enough attention to the others in addition to the unnuanced father jennifer jason leighs caroline was unfinished leaving us to wonder about why she did some of the things she did and the husbands needed to be something more than mannequins they needed to be engaged and involved
