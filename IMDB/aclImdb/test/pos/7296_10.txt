br br when i unsuspectedly rented a thousand acres i thought i was in for an entertaining king lear story and of course michelle pfeiffer was in it so what could go wrongbr br very quickly however i realized that this story was about a thousand other things besides just acres i started crying and couldnt stop until long after the movie ended thank you jane laura and jocelyn for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie thank you cast for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and gentlenessbr br i recognized the angry sister the runaway sister and the sister in denial i recognized the abusive husband and why he was there and then the father oh oh the father all superbly played i also recognized myself and this movie was an eyeopener a relief a chance to face my own truth and finally doing something about it i truly hope a thousand acres has had the same effect on some others out therebr br since i didnt understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land they werent fighting each other at all i watched it a second time then i was able to see that if one hadnt lived a similar story one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all that is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors for instancebr br but yet another reason why this movie is so perfectbr br i dont give a rats ass pardon my french about to what extend the king lear story is followed all i know is that i can honestly say this movie has changed my lifebr br keep up the good work guys you can and do make a differencebr br
