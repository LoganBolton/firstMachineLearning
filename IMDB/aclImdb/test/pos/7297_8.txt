i just watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week whats the problem here folks admit that the performances are greati mean lange is stellarand that the film is goodlooking but its got less than a 6 i dont get it come on the writings not that badbr br having read a lot of pulitzerwinning novels and having seen a lot of the films based on them i think a betterthandecent job was done in bringing the screenplay together i thought the paring down of all the dialogue in the novel was executed almost perfectly this story had a pretty hefty amount of dialogue in it and the story really came through on the screen despite the fact that only a portion of it was usedbr br book spoiler part i was however a little disappointed in the ginnytriestokillrose subplots being omitted i thought that was one of the more emotionally jarring parts of the book but it was probably a good bet to leave it out avid moviegoers more than avid readers i think tend to be less forgiving of protagonists pulling antagonistic stuff its apt to confuse johnny lunchpail and joe sixpackbr br if you loved the book you will like the movie if you hated the book you will likely hate the moviebr br br br rog
