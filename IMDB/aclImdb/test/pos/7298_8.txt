okayso i am gazing through my mom and dads extensive dvd collection mostly because they dont charge late fees and i come upon a thousand acres i was stunned that here was a movie that had jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer with a small appearance by jennifer jason leigh that i had not seen i dont think i had ever even heard of it before well this is exactly the kind of find that i dream about since i have to admit that my parents raised two movie buffs in my brother and me with a few exceptions neither of us can even get them to consider watching the lord of the rings movies but my dad loves the matrix trilogy  go figure we have very similar tastes in moviesbr br it was a particularly awful day today weatherwise it poured rain all day so i popped in this movie and shortly after i was mesmerizedbr br this has to be one of the alltime best sleepers i have seen jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer are great in their roles especially since they are playing very different types jessica langes character is a peoplepleasing follower who despite her being the senior child in the family rarely takes a leadership role rather she bows to her father jason robards and sister rose pfeiffer and is hellbent on teaching her little sister caroline leigh how to follow suit michelle pfeiffer plays a very strong willed cancer survivor who is barely able to keep the anger at her unhappy life contained this movie is five years prior to white oleander mind you so it was definitely inspiring to see her playing such a strong angry characterbr br i would have to say that this movie will probably appeal more to women however true movie buffs who enjoy a film for what it is regardless of genre or target audience will have a hard time denying the charm of this touching drama about family secrets and what they do the people involved and those who love them i dont know how i missed seeing this movie before now but it sure was a nice distraction on a rainy afternoon enjoy
