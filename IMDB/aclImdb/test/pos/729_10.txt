it could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie you dont have to throw cartloads of money at a movie to make it good nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching but i think that is totally missing the point if your expecting fast cars ta or a movie that will spell itself out for you then dont watch this youll be disappointed and dumbfoundedbr br this movie was thoroughly enjoyable kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think the writer obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this movie and it shows through the end just remember to keep an open mindbr br note the school scenes were all filmed at mcmaster university and most of the rest was done in toronto
