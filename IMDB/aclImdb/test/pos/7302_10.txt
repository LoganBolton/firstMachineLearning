this movie is excellent in how it portrays the reality of sexual abuse the daughters perfectly express their conflicting emotions of affection and betrayal the onlocation scenery is absorbingly authentic and the soundtrack is unobtrusive yet moving this film is a graduatelevel course in a reality thats too little recognized in american society personally im freaked out by the names of the characters  langes character is ginny cook smith  my name is connie cook smith and my mom is genny cook the youngest daughter is caroline cook which is my sisters name and the father is larry cook my cousins namebut sex abuse was not in our immediate family
