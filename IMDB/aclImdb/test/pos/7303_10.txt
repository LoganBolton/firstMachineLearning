having watched this film years ago it never faded from my memory i always thought this was the finest performance by michelle pfeiffer that ive seen but i am astounded by the number of negative reviews that this film has received after seeing it once more today i still think it is powerful moving and couldnt care less if it is based loosely on king learbr br i now realize that this is the greatest performance by jessica lange that ive ever seen  and she has had accolades for much shallower effortsbr br a thousand acres is complex human vibrant and immensely moving but surely doesnt present either of the primary female leads with any touch of glamour or sexiness i dont think this is well received in these timesbr br perhaps one reason for this films underwhelming response lies in the fact that the writer jane smiley screenplay laura jones and director jocelhyn moorehouse are all women i know that in my younger days i wouldnt have read a book written by a woman i didnt focus on this fact until years laterbr br if you havent seen this movie or gave it a chance in the past try watching it anew maybe you are ready for it
