i thought this was a beautiful movie very brave such beautiful imageryand i liked the use of breaking glasses w applause also how the best friend repeated the line about and shes one year older than me showed that their friendship has rekindled and grown but maybe some competition is lefti loved the footage of hands feeling the fabric the dance concert was beautiful the beginning seemed slow thoughit took awhile to feel for the charactersthe husband could have been more abusivehe just seemed absent so when other characters talked about himit didnt really fit the affair btwn the best friend and husband seemed randomthe doctors meeting seemed to hint that there was not much time leftto live so when the infidelity was revealed i didnt feel as much sympathy for the charactermore like relief the ending was so great the lines btwn her and the husband and the scene where she is pulled over is brilliant
