wow what can i say it was a good movie very different to all the boring remakes we see lately the only thing i would have liked to see a bit more of an ending like when jane left her husband im guessing she was going to serena cause she fell for hernot just her but everything that she isi so wish producers would actually show that sort of ending instead of leaving to it your imagination sort of ending i really hate it when they do that the aerial acts looked like fun but i guess youd have to be light and muscly i would like to see more movies like this one maybe the could do a sort of sequel of jane and serenaif i were in janes shoes i would have went for the girl too she was attractive
