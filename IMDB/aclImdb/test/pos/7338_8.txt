the gymnast unfolds in short shots and short scenes revealing its characters and message over time the spare editing is accompanied by a beautiful simple score this intimate approach is wonderful for feeling like youre on a path of discovery as much as the characters arebr br the spare approach is also its drawback there are a few scenes that are confusing because they dont have enough context there are some decisions made by the characters that seemed rather flip until i watched the interviews that were in the bonus materials im glad i did because the actors descriptions of their motivations gave me a much more well rounded understanding of the film overallbr br aside from the story itself it was wonderful to see women so comfortable and strong in their own bodies the shooting was very tastefully done very matteroffact one has the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfold not a voyeuristic sleaze film the physicality of the athletes  their realness  is a great contrast to the sometimes ethereal nature of the plotbr br not a film ill need to see again anytime soon since the storyline is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time
