this film also known as dont look in the basement is actually not bad it is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but i found this movie pretty entertaining dont get me wrong its certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look the story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly an appealing one to me i thought the acting  which seemed forced at first somehow got better as the film went along it seems like the actors really got into their roles there are some good colorful characters including a guy who thinks hes still a soldier one who thinks hes a judge an adult with a childs brain and an attractive girl who craves attention so bad she drops her clothes when any man gets near her the title dont look in the basement has about as much relevance to the story as the last house on the left has on that film if you like movies with creepy characters in a mental ward like i do check this out
