whatever you do dont stop watching when you think the movie is over hang around for the first batch of credits or youll really miss something we saw this movie at the savanaah film festival and thought it was the best of the bunch dreya weber is a marvel really not only because of her performance but because she can pull it off so far above the ground at the qa she said there were no wires or effects so everything you see is really her going for it addie couldnt make it to the festival because she was dancing with madonna she was excellent and my gawd so beautiful i was amazed that the film went over so well with the blue haired lady crowd but there you have it savannnah isnt a backwater
