dont look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and bad acting sure its not a masterpiece by anyones standards but it is a very fun little bfilm with a lot to offer and even a lot of creepy scenes that will stay in your headbr br as i said the acting could have been a lot better but thats the case with most exploitation so i cant really complain the story is clever and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing i thought the gore was a lot of fun too theres just something great about older gore films because they didnt have cgi back then so they had to actually set it all up themselves see this one for a good time
