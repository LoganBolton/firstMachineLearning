it may not have had the big budgets celebrities or endorsements of scream urban legend or i know what you did last summer but campfire tales had one thing these three movies lacked true horrorbr br this film tackled the subject of urban legends a year before the aptly titled and less than enthralling urban legend did it was intriguing masterfully scripted and logical in a way i know what you did last summer could only dream of finally it held its focus and finished with a flurry while scream fizzled and diedbr br whats most exciting about the film is the variety of horror that the writers and directors achieved the overarching story of teenagers around a campfire was classic dread at the unknown but certainly expected doom that awaited them in the forest but the tales themselves are where the movie really shinedbr br the opening sequence is pure fastpaced urban myth its based on a popular legend and the director plays on this with the style and pace of the action making it more enthralling because we know whats going to happenbr br the first campfire tale is a straightforward thriller based on another popular myth we dont actually realize this until the end both because it blends so well into the story and because the action keeps our attention being the thriller of the trilogy this one plays off our fear of the unknown and includes several welldone jump sequences that dont feel nearly as cheap or contrite as those in movies like scream or urban legendbr br the second tale is more suspense this time though the characters still dont know whats going on we do and this provides the horror no need for cheap thrills herebr br the final tale contains elements of the supernatural and uses a creepytrippy atmosphere to scare the viewer because we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation our fear comes from their intensity and what they cant explain this is the true ghost story of the triobr br i didnt expect to enjoy campfire tales when i rented it i figured that if i didnt like its more acclaimed biggerbudget counterparts how could i like itbr br the truth is though this film succeeds where the others fell far short of the mark
