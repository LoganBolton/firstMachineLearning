i just discovered this obscure 70s horror movie while browsing on youtube for a lowbudget effort it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish while there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly the fact that shes a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story and theres one scene with the curlyhaired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad the young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself and im not surprised she posed for the cover of playboy some characters are very irritating and some scenes do seem ridiculous for the most part however dont look in the basement thats the title i saw on youtube provides enough drama and chills for an entertaining bmovie
