i switched this on from cable on a whim and was treated to quite a surprisealthough very predictable this film turned out to be quite enjoyableno big stars but welldirected and just plain fun with all the overhyped crap that is out there it is very nice to get an unexpected surprise now and then and this little film fits the bill nicely 910
