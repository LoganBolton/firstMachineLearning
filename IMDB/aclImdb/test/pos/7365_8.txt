caught this flick as one of a fivefor5 deal from a local video store and it was a most pleasant surprise its a collection of four interrelated tales built around four kids whove just had a car wreck and are waiting for someone to pick them up they tell each other these stories to kill time and are occasionally startled by flashing lights and funny noises which all come together in an o henryesque ending that left me gleeful a real discovery blood and plenty of it breasts and beasts round it all out rather nicelyjacinda barrett is worth the price of admission alone this one is a keeperjim bob says check it outbr br oddly enough pumpkinhead was one of our five choices too and imdb recommends that for anyone who likes campfire tales ill followup as soon as i get a chance to sit down and watch that one joyeux samhain
