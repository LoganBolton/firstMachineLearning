i recently bought this movie for three bucks at a garage sale and while im glad i didnt have to pay the usual 1999 for this dvd i was pleasantly surprised by how good the film wasbr br its set up like a horror anthology broken up into 5 tales including the connector story which involves four teenagers whos car breaks down a dark lonely road in the middle of the night apparently these kiddos like horror stories because thats what they decide to do until morning  tell spooky stories around a campfire each character takes their turn telling a story after which their own story is wrapped up with a nice little twistbr br the first story the hook is kinda a waste of time a bit bland and dull luckily this is not one of the main stories and only lasts maybe 5 minutes its intended merely to introduce the film and its easy to overlook the unoriginality of this piecebr br the second story the honeymooners is eh okay its about  you guessed it  two people on their honeymoon theyre traveling around in an rv headed to las vegas they decide to stop somewhere for the night but theyre quickly warned by a mysterious stranger to leave the location or risk being attacked by some dangerous unknown creatures this story has a pretty good setup but just merely an ok delivery basically its fairly entertaining and mysterious till the monsters show up then its just kinda iffybr br the third story people can lick too is my personal favorite it involves a young girl whos parents are going out for the night and whos older sis is ditching her for a party so shes going to be all alone  a fact she makes known to an internet buddy of hers trouble is that internet buddy is not exactly a thirteenyearold girl this storys conclusion is slightly less climatic than i might have liked to have seen but still pretty dang goodbr br the final story the locket is definitely the one packed with the most atmosphere set in a creepy mansion on a dark rainy night its the tale of a young man played by glenn quinn traveling around on a motorcycle who stumbles across this house just at the time that he conveniently has a problem with his bike he meets the mute girl who lives in the house and falls in love with her at first sight unfortunately not everything is all fine and dandy  and it might have something to do with that locket hanging around her pretty neckbr br after the stories are wrapped up were presented with a twist involving the four teens in the car a twist which in retrospect should have been obvious but which it didnt really see coming and its a quite pleasing conclusion to filmbr br so all in all a good movie rent it if you can because unfortunately i dont really think it has a lot rewatching value but next time youre in the mood for a vaguely scary litte flick in the same vein as tales of the darkside or something grab this movie and some popcorn turn off all the lights and treat yourself to this surprisingly nifty little flick
