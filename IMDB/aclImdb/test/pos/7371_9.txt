this was on the saturday before halloween this year today at the time of this writing and it has to be the best horror anthology out there i am normally not a fan of horror movies  largely due to the volume of crap thats been recently released however the director of campfire tales has the hitchcockesquire gift of suspense  unlike other contemporary films it doesnt take every opportunity to scare you silly instead using foreshadowing and nearmisses  incidents that seem like the instant that the climax will occur in the instant before but turn out not to bebr br i didnt catch the hook or the first main segment but from what i have read here they were the two you could afford to missbr br people can lick too was full of suspense  this short keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen to the little girl as she wanders about her yard and house looking for her soccer ball and later her dog she encounters so many nearmisses that the suspense reaches heartstopping proportions before the climax of the short when the girl gives up and goes to bed thinking her dog is underneath it she reaches her hand down to let him lick it and she feels the touch of a tongue on her handbefore noticing that on her mirror written in blood is people can lick too ill leave the last few seconds for you to find out my reader for at this point the short could have taken any number of turnsbr br the locket however was the unarguable masterpiece of this film it begins with a man on a motorcycle simply drivingtowards what he does not know but he can feel himself getting closer as hes driving along a storm breaks out and hes forced to find shelter in the house of a mute girl the two quickly cozy up to each other but before they can do anything besides kiss the girl reveals through writing that ghosts inhabit her house they quickly begin packing up to leave but they are caught in the middle of a reenactment of a scene decades past  a father coming home to his daughter and her boyfriend preparing to elope murders the both of them and then commits suicide ill have to leave you to discover the ending here as well  i couldnt hope to do the story justice in any case and what ive said so far is just a brief summary of the story  i couldnt hope to convey the nuances and sensory details that add to itbr br the campfire being the connecting thread between all of the stories is a fairly interesting rehash of the car accident theme and the girls are very much attractive  in fact most of the girls in this film are goodlooking anyway despite the fact that its chopped up the story is given justice and the ending is difficult to predict if youre preoccupied with the other stories however if you pay enough attention to the segments of the campfire spread through the film its certainly possible to predict the ending especially if youve seen movies based on the same premise mst3k fans remember soultaker same premise but without the god awful writing of vivian schilling and the bulk of the movie if youve seen the first 30 minutes of that you should be able to predict the ending all in all the best horror movie ive seen in a long time and the only horror anthology worthy of a buy
