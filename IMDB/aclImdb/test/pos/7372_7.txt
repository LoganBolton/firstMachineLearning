campfire tales is basically made up of three spooky stories that a group of friends tell after they get into a car crash in the woods after a concert the film begins with the classic hook story and then were introduced to the group of friends driving home from the concert they crash their car put out some flares and start a fire in a little abandoned chapel waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire to pass the time they decide to start telling classic horror stories about terrorized honeymooners a girl who falls prey to an internet predator and a motorist who takes refuge in a haunted house as they tell the eerie tales each story becomes increasingly terrifying but the real shock that awaits them is yet to comebr br in my opinion the last story they tell is probably the scariest and had some genuine frightening effects the first story was alright and the motorhome sequence near the end was a little creepy the second story built a lot of suspense more than either of the others did but its unoriginal plot was its downfall i remember watching this movie a long time ago when i was like eight years old on hbo and the third story scared the crap out of me although its not scary to me now youll probably recognize some of the cast here particularly amy smart from the opening hook interlude story and christine taylor as one of the main actresses in the film the twist ending was kinda interesting too i know i didnt see that coming i thought it was all cleverly pieced togetherbr br to sum things up if youre looking for a horror movie that is worth the while rent this you should be happy its a great anthology of some classic urban legends and the whole film was tied together neatly it is much better than what one would expect 710
