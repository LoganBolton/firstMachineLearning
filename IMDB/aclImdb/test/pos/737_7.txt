widely known as dont look in the basement  this is pure 70s horror bmovie goodness that could actually pass as the genres version of one flew over the cuckoos nest though the movie seems to go nowhere throughout the first hour of its runtime i enjoyed this particular batch of quirky crazies and their various personalities and deficiencies  such as the former army sergeant a chick obsessed with caring for a plastic doll a lovable manchild and a loony nymph after their headdoctor is murdered by a patient a small sanitarium hires a new nurse onto their understaffed facility who becomes immersed in the residents different ticks and outbursts things gradually become stranger however when patients start acting far more abnormal than usual you never really know or care where the movie is going cause it still entertains up until its completely whackedout ending several of the twists felt a little too forced and i could have used a tad more blood but i really dug this much too underrated blend of humor and horror check it out
