if the ending hadnt been so fantastically unexpected i dont think i could rate this movie so wellbr br this movie has a lot of uncomfortable distressing marriage falling apart character interaction that sort of thing is not my kind of drama so the pace seemed to drag for mebr br in addition the main characters are difficult to relate to and thus care much about  the husband alan rickman is rather bitter and cranky and the wife polly walker is aloof and a little haughty the acting was just fine norman reedus was very alluring but the characters themselves were perhaps a little too realistically flawed for mebr br the setting was nice and appropriately isolated and a little spooky the cinematography had something to it that seemed a little oldfashioned to me somehowbr br but the last 515 minutes of this movie are so ingenious that every uncomfortable scene awkward conversation and inexplicable character behavior absolutely worth it i guessed every typical plot twist except the one that occurredbr br the ending definitely makes this movie worth watching the intrigue and the drama not quite as much
