i saw dark harbor at the 98 seattle film festival filmed against a autumnal maine backdrop this movie boasts an excellent cast and a plot that keeps you guessing throughout at times eerie at times funny i have to say that it stayed with me for days after seeing it rickman and walker are wonderful as the icy marrieds and reedus is someone youll be hearing more from im sure the opening shot of a winding deserted road in a downpour at dusk and the score that accompanied it set the tone so well  just terrific nice nice work from a newish directorscreenwriter and his talented crew
