the first time i saw this film i wanted to like it for so many reasons but i simply did not it just seemed a little dull but there was a tiny question i had about something i saw near the beginning of the film so i watched it again and then finally it clicked for me i first watched the movie knowing the surprise ending and while i definitely wouldnt recommend having the ending spoiled for you i have still thoroughly enjoyed the bulk of the film and discovering the many seemingly insignificant events that all unravel to point to a very sinister schemebr br i dont think that everyone will love this movie or even like it if you like any of the actors youll like this movie because the acting is fairly strong and they all get a lot of screen time if you like mysteries namely hitchcock youll like this movie if you like independent or psychological films youll like this movie it really worked for me on all of those levels if you dont like the actors mysterious plots or psychological elements you might not like this movie but thats your loss personally the only thing that irked me a little was the accents good try alan rickman on the american dialect but it wasnt much improvement from the scene in die hard the wonderful voice makes up for the weird accent though the medley of accents in the movie was a little odd but it was not so distracting that it became difficult or particularly irritating also the camera change from scene to scene was evident and might bother some people but i actually think it added to the scenes or scene i can really only recall one scene where the change was severely different but it workedbr br when you see this movie see it at least twice the second time you see it i hope you realize how intricate the plot really is every time i watch this movie its under an hour and a half so multiple viewings are not difficult i seem to notice something else about it and find myself wondering why did that just happen or was that intentional i like movies that make me think this one does so just see it twice
