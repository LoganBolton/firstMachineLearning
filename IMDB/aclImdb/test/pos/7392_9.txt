i think this movie is different apart from most films ive seen it was exciting in a way and no matter what others say i say i was surprised about the final solution certainly didnt see it coming although its sad its worth watching i cant think of any movie that would be like this actors knew what they were doing if you say this movie sucks you say probably what most people would say but if someone says that this movie is ordinary i absolutely dont agree and norman reedus should be more noticedbr br maybe im freak but i liked this very much it was kind of mess but who cares im tired of boring and ordinary movies
