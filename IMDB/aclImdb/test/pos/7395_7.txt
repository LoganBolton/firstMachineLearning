jack frost 2 is probably the most cheesiest movie i have ever seen in my life the complete title of the film is jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman horror movie fans that have a taste for campy story lines will be delighted to watch this this film was straight to video and for good reasons heres why the acting was so atrocious and so terrible that it could cause one to cry the main character had no personality and the actors bad acting made it all worse the screenplay was was also atrocious each character always says a cheesy line and add the cheesy lines to the bad choreography then you have something bad second the story line isnt really all that impressive but since this movie was straight to video it is forgiven the director and writer could have turned the idea of a killer snowman into something cool but they didnt they story has lots of plot holes in it in the beginning a cup of coffee gets knocked into the fish tank with the melted jack frost scientists try to restore his life but they couldnt once the cup of coffee fell into the tank jack frost was completely restored now he is immune to antifreeze in jack frost part 1 the main characters dna got mixed up with the antifreeze that was used to kill jack frost since the main character is allergic to bananas jack frost is too hence heres my point they say that sams dna combined with jack frosts but one of the scientists had some saliva on the cup so when it fell into the tank the scientists dna would have been combined with jack frosts another thing the special effects werent very good either heres the good points jack frost 2 has lots of blood that looks pretty realistic even though this movie is flawed to hell it is still entertaining overall jack frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie the first one was better though 7 out of 10
