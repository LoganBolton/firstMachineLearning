okay ill say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people dont get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and its all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for mebr br for example anne tiler to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darlingbr br if that chunk of dialogue doesnt make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully youll see whats so damn funny about jack frost 2
