sometimes good things happen by accidentbr br id never heard of silverwing until late 2005i was flipping channels and happened to see something on toon disney with bats in a sawmill being attacked by owls i had no idea what it was but i was motivated to stay tunedit was hard waiting for a commercial so i could find out what it was calledbr br part of what intrigued me was the looks of the batsfirst of all they didnt use the popular convention of giving the bats extra fingers where their thumb claws are supposed to be rather they have palms like human hands but the fingers are longer and have webs of skin between thembr br also the facesthey look like human beings in fact at one point i wondered if they had once been human but were transformed into bats ordinarily i dont like this in cartoon animals but it worked herethe story is a human story even though its about bats and other animals not unlike the lion kingbr br what i saw on tv were the last two parts of the trilogy id missed the very beginning of the first one towers of fire the second overall but for the most part i saw all of each of them however i found myself wanting to understand what was going on since the first part hadnt been on and i wouldnt have caught it anywaybr br but i saw that it was based on a book by kenneth oppel how fortunate that i paid attention and wrote it downi was very disappointed when i learned that the series wasnt available it wasnt even that recently made that it made sense for it not to be available yetbr br however i did find not only the book silverwing but also the two sequels sunwing and firewing when i read the first book i was left wondering is that it not only because a lot of whats in the series isnt in that book but even had i not seen the animated version the book silverwing otherwise a good story doesnt end so much as it stops only one loose end is tied upshade and marina meet the silverwing colony at hibernaculumbr br in fact silverwing and sunwing should have in my opinion been published in a single volume because they make for a complete story together but not separatelybr br actually the animated version takes some elements from sunwing e g orestes the lifting of the ban from seeing the sun and some were completely original its not perfect but its definitely very enjoyable i enjoy both versions of the silverwing sagabr br which is why im glad its finally going to be available in june it was a long time coming and its well worth the wait
