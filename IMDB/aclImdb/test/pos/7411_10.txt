pharaohs army defies formula instead of selling out for cliches and big stars it relies completely on the excellent acting from a strong cast the strength of a well written script and a fascinating and bitter story the result is a raw and realistic film that moves along fast with a heavy emotional current one of the best ive ever seen about the civil war and i think it can owe that to the pleasure of being an independent film if you like this film try to see the similarly brilliant indie civil war film wicked spring as wellbr br pharaoh simply tells the true story of a small expeditionforage team of union men who ride into a confederate farm to take provisions but end up stuck there because of an accident of one of the men tensions broil and relationships are made and broken nothing happens the way hollywood would write it this movie comes from the mind of someone who actually cares about quality film and the telling of history superb dialogue and plot exposition move along a film that looks highly professional but often doesnt feel like youre watching a movie more along the lines of hearing a storybr br the film boasts an incredible performance from chris cooper who shows an amazing versatility in the exploration of his role he transforms but is always at the height of believability and is easy to emotionally relate to patricia clarkson is equally as stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses would crumble in she shares an interesting chemistry with coopers character and where shes the more severe of the characters is still as easy to identify with the rest of the cast is quite capable and fill their roles in wellbr br the art design and the set are wonderful and personally i love the cinematography it all has the feel of a civil war period photograph with the camera presenting strong contrasting colors and shadows and a tinlike metalic tint but always keeping the naturalistic look of the rustic setting they seem to have used natural lighting but whatever they used works beautifully everything looks like it belongs where it is it feels period something i find rare in american period films the actors act 19th century not like 20th century people in old clothesbr br above all this film is very personal i think that as an indie it can afford it the film is nearly flawless with an outstanding script that effortlessly creates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and lets them grow in a situation as bad as it is it doesnt fail in getting its point across and it gets its point across without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war films these days its brave it relies on its characters a fantastic script human emotion and in the cold hard fact that the civil war wasnt all cgi big stars and hoop skirts
