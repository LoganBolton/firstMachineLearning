i just saw this movie in a sneak preview and before reading my comment you have to know that it is very subjective because i love techno trance club house and music like thatbr br the movie deals with carl whose brother jason or whatever his name was died in an accident he fell off a rooftop drunk carl meets his brothers girlfriend sunny and the two of them quite unmotivated some kind of private investigation about jasons death and carl gets involved in jasons exlife that was filled with clubs and drugs the movie itself seen from an artistic point of view is nothing more than a big pile of st the plot is predictable all of the characters are extremely cliched and twodimensional stupid boy from a small town young goodlooking innocent girl big bad drug king the list is endless and most of the acting such as the plot are just not credible matthew rhys performance of the stupid boy coming to big london and sudden taking drugs from people he does not even know does not seem very credible unlike his female counterpart sunny performed by sienna guillory whose behaviour seems more realistic to the spectator nothing more than a joke was tim currys performance of the drug king damian a phony caricature too eeeevil and just too ridiculous to be truebr br but if you like club music the club scenes such as the selected tracks are simply brilliant if you enjoy a simple lovestory with a sweet girl like sunny yes i confess i lost my heart  that makes my comment even more subjective i guess with some predictable twists and turns you will definetely enjoy this moviebr br anybody else forgetitbr br 3 out of 10 objective viewbr br 7 out of 10 my personal view and also my final vote
