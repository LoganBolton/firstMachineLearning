didnt have much aspiration for this film but was pleasantly surprised very well made film very well cut doesnt really get to the height that human traffic did but its a very good effort well directed and i thought the lead actor put in a superb performance in fact the only really bad performance in the film was from tim curry who is supposed to be the namebr br cool film surprised it hasnt done better than it has id never heard of it until i saw it at a matesbr br im not a raver but i imagine people who are will really like this film
