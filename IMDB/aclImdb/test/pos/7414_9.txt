how on earth this film isnt more widely regarded is beyond mebr br i picked it up for Â£1 and im not exaggerating when i say its the best pound ive ever spent on a filmbr br the thing that usually lets films about the club scene down is either the music or the actual scenes filmed in clublandbr br here the music and club scenes are completely credibleusing some big tunes of the time and filmed in real clubs with people actually looking like they want to be therebr br the performances from the actors are of a high standard all round although jason donovan in particular for me stands out he was playing frank n furter in the rocky horror show in london at roughly the time this must have been filming so his drag phase was in full flow and of course tim curry whos eloquent drug land boss is convincingbr br simply put if youre a fan of british film you have to see this it matters not a jot if youre into clubbing as the film is strong enough as a story anywaybr br highly recommended
