this movie has one of the best club scenes very good soundtrack if you like technotrance musicbr br some situations as the main character carl begins to take drugs for example are a little off reality but the plot is entertaining but the characters are all a little shallowbr br id not recommend you to see this film if you dont like techno musicbr br for the plotacting alone this movie is a 410 with the really cool special effects and the club scenes and soundtrack its a 710 but if you would want to go to the movies just to hear nice tracks and grab a little club feeling its a 1010br br the special effects are sometimes hidden sometimes clearly visible ie fast moving cloudssunmoon morphing background morphing cutsbr br i for one enjoyed it very much a shame there was no dancefloor in the cinema
