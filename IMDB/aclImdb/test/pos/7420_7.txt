terry and june was one of the classic british sitcoms in my opinion you knew what to expect  and aint that just so typical  unlike modern sitcoms with utterly contrived plots this show is still a breath of fresh air how lovely not see or hear remarks about bodily functions or not to see a family perpetually late for breakfast or a family with impossible teenagers and therein is the secret terry  june was based on a middle class couple living in relative harmony in stead of todays strained plots with the de rigueur dysfunctional family made to look hipbr br personally i vote the bridge to far episode as one of the best in a way terrys antics reminds me of basil fawlty  both sometimes getting almost impossibly embarrassingbr br terry  june comes highly recommended have your tea and biscuits ready
