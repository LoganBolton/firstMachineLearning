when the long running happy ever after came to an end its characters terry  june fletcher were revived for the longer running and more popular sequel terry  june although their surnames were changed from fletcher to medfordbr br terry has received a new job and as a result he and june move to purley where they end up in all manner of scrapes unwanted guests dropping by to visit at an inconvenient moment the boss inviting himself to dinner and terry trying to chance his arm at diy but cocking it up each time a fellow imdb user branded this show as not clever and never well written fair enough it wasnt clever but that was the whole point as for never well written some of the episodes were pretty substandard i will admit but overall i found it to be extremely well written highly amusing and very well actedbr br it was warm hearted slapstick not dissimilar to the later bbc sitcom keeping up appearances eight different writers contributed to the nine series giving the show plenty of scope terry scott was a comic genius as he well proved in productions such as hugh  i the carry on films and of course here june whitfield likewise was a comedy legend in her own rightbr br i enjoy some modern shows ie still game the catherine tate show legit and empty i even enjoyed the alternative comedy naked video the young ones and the comic strip presents but i am more inclined to enjoy vintage comedy such as this humour that you dont need to think about is excellent for when you are feeling down and want to lift yourself up for the record terry  june was wonderful stuff special note should be made of the catchy theme tune which caught the mood of the show tremendously well
