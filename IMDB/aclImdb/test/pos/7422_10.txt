terry and june in my mind is a all time classic along the ranks with bless this house with the late sid james and the late diana coupland but terry scott will be sadly missed even tho he passed away in 1994 i have all the dvds upto press and i look forward to getting all 9 also would be nice to see happy after ever released on dvdbr br june whitfield is still going strong and terry scott will always live on in my memorybr br terry scott rip there arent many comedies today that i can think of that will stay in the legends list and yes the middle class bit does get on some peoples wicks but i dont mind i think it would be brilliant to see some celebration of the life of terry scott
