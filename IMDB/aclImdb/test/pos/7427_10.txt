this movie is a hidden gem i cant understand why this movie doesnt get more air time errol and eleanor parker make for a real attractive and dashing couple and their chemistry is impeccable i really liked the touch of his daughters reference to him as being her robin hood i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys errol flynn its nice to see errol playing a father as well by all accounts from his very own children he was a very attentive and loving father in real life also the supporting cast is wonderful as well you cant go wrong with supporting players such as hattie mcdaniel and lucile watson hattie mcdaniel makes a movie that much better from the getgo this movie has now become a holiday tradition in my home enjoy
