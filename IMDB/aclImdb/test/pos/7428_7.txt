this was the third time i tried to watch this film the previous two times i found the beginning so sickeningly sweet and schmaltzy that i just stopped watching however now that i am a little older and more compulsive i forced myself to watch all the film and i was very surprised to see that i actually liked it quite a bit so i look at the movie much the same way i would look at swimming in the ocean when the water temperature is 70 degrees thats about 2122 degrees centigrade for all those metriclovers out there sure the water is terribly cold and shocking at first but if you force yourself to stay in the water youll get used to itso resist that urge to jump out right away br br the film begins with a lengthy exchange between flynn and his daughter played by a lispy patti brady some may find there conversations very cute and endearing though others may find them a bit hard to take since these moments are so goshdarn sweet in a way it was some amazing acting by flynn because its hard to imagine him in real life having kids or acting domestic especially that he wanted to be faithful to one woman in this filmnow thats acting never say goodbye concerns the divorced couple flynn and parker and their mutual desire to remarry since they both love each other as well as their lispy kid it seems like a foregone conclusion that they will once again tie the knot however there are some serious problems standing in their way lucille watson who plays her usual overbearing and controlling motherinlaw character flynns girlfriend after all he is errol flynn and he is divorced so you gotta expect him to have a girl somewhere and a marine played by forrest tuckerbr br not unexpectedly all this does get worked out by the end and everyone lives happily ever after however despite it being formulaic and predictable the film is a winner because it is so much fun to watch flynn despite his reputation as an actionadventure hero is very good with comedyromance and its just a lot of fun to watch him also the film has the everscene chewing cuddles sakallhes just so goshdarn cute and sweet that he is perfect in this type of film and despite the sweetness the film is pretty wellwritten the bottom line is the film is funbr br so my recommendation is that you do watch this film and force yourself not to retch at the sickeningly sweet aspects of the film once youve gotten over this the rest of the film is a picture that is well worth your time
