i really love this movie i havent played final fantasy vii but i still loved the movie its really funny and i love the job the voiceover actors have done the visuals are so fantastic and all the lines are so well donebr br i have to admit i have a pretty good imagination so i was able to fill most of the gaps the movie presented and i suggest you watch it twice because lots of things suddenly make sensebr br also this is pretty funny you should watch it with the subtitles on because what they say and what the subs say are sometimes completely different its really usually pretty funny but sometimes it helps u to understand what they say betterbr br watch it love marnie
