it really isnt hard to understand this movie i watched it with no expectations and no knowledge of the story from the games i was completely blown awaybr br initially i wondered how most of the characters have some sort of superpowers but it is called final fantasy i also wondered about clouds past but that was easy enough to look up in no way did these questions spoil the enjoyment of the movie though just the opposite it shows i kept thinking about the story long after seeing the moviebr br its one of the most beautiful movies my eyes have ever seen the music supports the movie completely the characters are incredible br br i want more
