the movie is really cool i thought it sticks to the original game quite well and some of the battle scenes are depicted in such high detail its incredible i thought the movie could have been a little better if theyd give you a little more information before the end but trying to figure out whats going on is what hooks on you this moviebr br the cg is beautiful i dont think they could have done a better job graphics wise every little detail the way they move the way their swords look everything is perfect the way they make the characters look is almost like theyre real peoplebr br the music was great and i found it entertaining to listen to just how much of it was remixed from the original game with new instruments and effectsbr br all and all id recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys fast paced action and a good storyline i would definitely play the game before id watch the movie though
