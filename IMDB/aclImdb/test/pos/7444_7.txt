some major spoilers youve been warnedbr br i saw this movie yesterday at venices film festival and i must admit that being a fan it was really impressive excellent graphic excellent music excellent dubbing excellent action sequences and so on but theres a but all the film was thought exclusively for the gamers that have loved it and that can therefore enjoy every single reference character inside joke you should see a joke with winning music thats particularly comic etc a poor man not inside the world of ff will obviously see the magnificence of technical part but cannot grasp the inner satisfaction of seeing eg barret appearing and shooting bahamut totally out of nowhere hell ask himself whos this guy and i cannot blame him he cannot even understand what a gamer feels when in the opening sequence theres games opening music nanaki running in the canyon with his two cubs howling at midgars ruins and then 498 years ago almost all characters have made an appearance or quote including reeve tseng and elena and reno  rude were really goofy and comic to see but the final impression the movie left to me was hardcore gamers final dream but far less for a movie fan
