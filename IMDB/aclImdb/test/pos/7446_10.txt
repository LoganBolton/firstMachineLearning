square really landed this one they didnt try to please everyone and instead focused exclusively on final fantasy 7 fans and boy are those going to be happy fans when they see this movie the story might not be all that interesting or credible but it ties in neatly with the story of the game and has several honesttogod funny moments a total surprise there and a welcome one toobr br there are lots of cameos and funny references to the game too and most important of all the fighting scenes rock so hard they could cut through diamond they are truly the total awesomeness and would have made the movie worth it even if everything else sucked i mean they are some of the best ever created periodbr br see this movie byebr br ps i know my review sounds like the ravings of a teenage girl it was like totally what i intended
