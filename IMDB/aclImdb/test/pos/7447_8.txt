just watched it then it is pretty damn awesome the fights are fantastic and the magic is really cool its totally like a videogame in parts with some amazing handtohand combat in therebr br this film is for the fans to those who loved this world once before and spent time with its friends gather again and devote your time besides this ominous opening the story was not very hard to follow and ihave never played a final fantasy game i think it pays to be familiar with role playing games in general knowledge of the genre kinda helps you grasp some of it better i think though that if you pay attention and accept what the film throws at you its quite easy to understand there is a lot that isnt explicitly explained and if you demand that it should be then you will probably be confused and irritatedbr br watching the film is like being dropped into the middle of some grand saga and having to put as much of the puzzle together as possible i like that approach you get caught up in the mystery and confusion that all the characters are going through but like i said just be accepting if a weird red lion thing that talks turns up and starts kicking ass and taking names and the other characters just say hes an old friend accept it and move on you dont need a biopic flashback or a tellall sitmedown you are an observer here of something beyond your experience and undestandingbr br so fantastic graphics and animation great voice acting cool video game styled music involving story and characters and maybe some of the coolest fights youll see in a while its worth seeing and while it is for the fans it is perfectly accessible for people like me that have never played the games
