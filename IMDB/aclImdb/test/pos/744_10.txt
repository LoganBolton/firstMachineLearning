dont look in the basement is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that brownrigg is one of horrors real underground stars and imho is vastly overdue some proper recognition dont is his undisputed masterpiece this scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd disjointed claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on it succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty just plain grubby for brownriggs world is this mad unwashed scummy prison cell of rants obsessions and all shades of mental illness and he uses his low budget palette to wrap his grot blanket around you like a bad memory there is just something so beautifully odd about the whole damn thing in a word classic also if you watch dont first then you will have some idea of the insane psychodrama style that marks brownriggs other films in summary they really dont come any more esoteric than this  well actually they do track down brownriggs keep my grave open mad genius accept no substitute
