i do not have much to say than this is a great finish to the story most people have said that there is not enough plot and its just eye candybut think about it everything was explained in ffvii you cannot add more plot to such a grand story it would ruin it they did the best that they could do and i think that this should be taken more as a final fmv the last fight br br graphics  1010 absolutely amazing br br story 8510  dont think they could of expanded it that much more and the stuff they could put in there was clever enough i thought br br characters 910  well most of them have already been explained during the game but still could not fit it all into 90 mins br br sound  1010 since i am a metal fan i loved the fight music and piano just reaches right in thereit is a great st and i was not disappointedbr br tiltreplay 1010  enjoyable every time br br overall 910 ff fan view 1010br br i personally think this is what was needed a fight to end it all the plot was already in place the action was necessary as much as people complained i loved every second of this movie it was a pleasure to visit the world of ffvii just one last timebr br just remember this most movies that have been made form a game have been directed by movie directors i think this is pretty great for a team of game directors dont think ive seen a better game to moviebr br thankyou square i think you did it right
