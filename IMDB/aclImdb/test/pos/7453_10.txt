graphics brilliant obviously the most stunning things were definitely not given away in the trailers fight sequences move extremely fast but after watching a couple of them your eyes should be used to it and it wont seem so confusing cloud has a wide array of swords and i kinda wish things were moving a little slower just so we could see them because they were each incredibly detailed oh and we finally get to see exactly how one equips materiabr br music brilliant also i was a bit nervous about it since from what ive seen nobuo isnt the best at writing music to go along with action remember the steal the tiny bronco sequence but its brilliant and it fits perfectly im glad i preordered the ost they changed the lyrics to one winged angel though so you wont be able to sing along if you know the carmina burana lyricsbr br plot the first half of the movie sets up things and introduces everyone in a fairly complex tapestry but the second half is almost entirely fight sequences once all the players are in place i wouldnt call it a weak plot but its nowhere near as convoluted as the games plot was i think this is in an effort to avoid trying to overshadow the game and i think thats a good thingthe movie is its own entity and shouldnt try to top the original in terms of sheer plotbr br i admit i was kind of hoping that this movie would bring ff7 to a wider range of people but this is not a mainstream movie i was going to give it only nine stars just because it doesnt even really try to explain anything to newcomersmarlene at least i think it was marlenesounded like her gives a bit of background at the beginning but its more of a refresher than a crash course but then i realized for me this movie is a 1010 so why should i take off points just because other people probably wont like it as wellif youve played the game or are at least passingly familiar with it you should see this movie but you dont need me to tell you that if youre not familiar with it go out and buy it sit there for twenty hours and beat it and then see the moviealthough even without any background its still stunningly beautiful you just wont get any of the inside referenceswhich make up 50 of the movie that is everything that isnt a fight sequence
