duckman was a show that used to be on during the last hour or so before it was time to sleep about ten or so years ago it was a contrast to a lot of the kidtype of animation i was watching at the time i was still a minor junkie for disney and looney tunes stuff and most saturday morning cartoons were still on the runoff of the peak from the days of ninja turtles and batman but also around this time i began to recognize that the more raunchy mature surreal obscene and though i didnt know the term at the time satirical cartoon shows were more creative than the stuff i was used to around the time of beavis and butthead ren and stimpy and even the maxx were hitting tv sets via mtv usa put out two shows one of them was weird science and the other was duckman ive always remembered a few key bits from the show and some of the lines are very quotable to those who havent forgotten it completely luckily i found a tape recently with about six episodes i taped long ago and the jokes stayed very fresh and the delivery of the jokes are rapidfire a lot of the time in the better episodes br br in the voice department the choices in talent are top notch for the storylines which are usually just an excuse for crude fascinating parodies of popculture politics movies and tv shows music detective mysteries and the dysfunctional family unit jason alexander is a wonderful choice for duckman and his performance is a comedic 180 from his days on seinfeld even if there might be some similar characteristics here and there also the voices of gregg berger as the unmistakably monotoned and deadpan cornfed dweezil zappa as the hilariously inept ajax and nancy travis as the sexstarved obnoxious sisterinlaw bernice all contribute in a full amount along with some great writing  even when a joke isnt surefire the wit behind it compensates  the animation style while a far cry from some of the refurbished computerenhanced product of today is inventive and often abstract it has that homemade gritty quality that beavis and butthead or south park would later have and like those shows if youre a little kid i mean little as in younger than i was watching the show you may not understand most of the jokes ie there are enough stripper and vd references to fill two shows sometimes but its inventive to catch if its on tv late at night and it functions rather well in that time slot one can only hope for a dvd box set br br so to no one whos barely or even never heard of this program heres a general note think of this show as if dashiell hammett met up with walt disney and decided to go to slum part of vegas with a free minibar and make a collaboration in the vein of luis bunuel and the simpsons combined not to mention its by the group that did rugratsstrong a
