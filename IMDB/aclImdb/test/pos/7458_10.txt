ive always enjoyed animated ducks for some reason duck tales darkwing duck daffy duck donald duck though none of them are as deranged as duckman originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997 duckman lasted for a total 70 episodes but could easily have gone on forever without becoming stalebr br the titular character is a discombobulated unapologetic slob and pretty much the worst living person in the world hes a private detective a widower a peeping tom an alcoholic a sex maniac a murderer a fill in the blank you name it duckman has done it but who can blame him for being such a slimeball when the world hewe live in is so insane outrageous and just plain nonsensical eric tiberius duckmanvoiced by the maniacal jason alexander could carry the whole show by himself but when hes surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting characters you just know that trouble is just waiting to explode at every opportunity my favorite has to be willibald feivel cornfed or just cornfed pig duckmans incredibly deadpan sidekick who is seemingly talented and highly skilled at everything and is perpetually oblivious to his partners infinity of vices and incompetencebr br the typical plot will involve some bizarre case hell inevitably blunder through or will revolve around his highly dysfunctional household though every now and again duckmans archenemy king chicken tim curry a sort of professor moriarty in fowl form hatches some diabolical scheme in revenge for being bullied in high schoolbr br since i was a teenager this has been my absolute favorite animated show better than the simpsons family guy and even king of the hill nothing will ever surpass it there never was or will be anything quite like duckman ever again the level of satire observational humor and writing is so sharp its deadly and the animation is done in that unique klaskycsupo style anyone who has seen rugrats will understand its a wonderful highly imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish 1940s feelbr br you can never have too much of this particular bird
