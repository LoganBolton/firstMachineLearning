finding the premise intriguing and reading the reviews and being an angel fan i watched this movie its sexy and original and quite entertaining david boreanaz is keith hes a hunky married man stay at home dad and he feels a little inadequate in his marriage he makes the mistake of penetrating a close circle of teenage girls who are fascinated with the idea of doing it with an older man theyll do anything to get into his bed including beg lie and blackmail but they mostly try to push his buttons the nuttiness that ensues sends keith reeling and pushes friendships to the edge david boreanaz shows a little skin in this one and hes looking hot yeshe plays a sleazy cheat  but he shows enough vulnerability and tenderness toward the goofy teens that you end up cheering for him in the end one more thing when someone moans oh yeah ohohyeah its hard to see them as a victim of rape
