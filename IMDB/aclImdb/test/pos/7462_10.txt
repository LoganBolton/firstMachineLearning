this is a great movie i read the brief synopsis and was unimpressed but as i watched it mainly for caroline dhavernas it grew on mebr br its such a nice change to see a movie where girlsyoung women are not punished for their sexuality the girls are given full license to explore and even the chance to make mistakes without ridiculous repercussionsbr br some of the scenes are absolutely hilarious  and many of them the supposedly erotic scenes  which were not over the top or distasteful the male characters in the movie were brilliant  david boreanaz was great as the fickle hunk  and what is great is that the movie doesnt make us hate him all that much the other two younger male characters were good too without being overbearingbr br this is one of the best movies ive seen that has girls growing up and is quite empowering to see how the they realise their mistakes but eventually come through and carry on with their lives rather than drag their mistakes along with them
