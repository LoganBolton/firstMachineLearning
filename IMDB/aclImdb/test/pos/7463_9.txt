i am really amazed how little fame this film had i think it has to do with distribution companies and etcbr br dont be idiots  if you are looking for a good fun take this movie  this is very nice movie to pass few hours with and the music is greatbr br its about  well girls and boys and whats between them with not too much story but not all movies should be pulp fiction should they its nice and cute and gives good time  the girls are also very good looking and this makes the whole movie even more enjoyablebr br why i gave it only a 9 well the story could be little more convincing from the middle and on in some point you start to see events that are little less reliable small spoiler the baby is crying and the father goes in and tries to relax him now i am not talking about some small cry but no  hysteric cry and 30 sec after that the father goes out and baby is sleeping excuse me  when and how exactly did you make him calm and sleep and be able to leave his room in 2030 seconds but ignore this kind of small picking because the film itself is not docudrama  its fun and this should be overlooked
