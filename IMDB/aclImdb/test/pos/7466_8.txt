i had the honor this evening to see a screening of the movie these girls at the philadelphia film festival going into the movie i knew very little about it and just took a chance on it because the films plot sounded interesting so as i entered the theater just hours ago i wondered what the final verdict would be thumbs up or thumbs downbr br these girls is the story about three best friends from a small town keira caroline dhavernas is the ringleader who basically doesnt know what to do with her life after high school but her father keeps pushing her to go to college which is something she doesnt want to do lisa holly lewis will be going away to a christian school after the summer and finally glory amanda walsh who plans on spending her summer babysitting but this summer is going to be a special one as they all blackmail keith clark david boreanaz the sexy older hunk who they babysit for fun times and a lot of laughs ensueÂ… br br i normally dont like movies like these girls but there is something about this movie that i really liked i think the quality i liked most about it was that it seemed rather realistic three girls who want to explore their sexuality pick a hunky guy who lets all of them have sex with him only to be blackmailed by them later its a pretty funny tale about growing up friendship and sex but even though it sounds pretty cheesy i can see majority of this film happening in real lifebr br the subject matter here is probably a main reason why this film didnt get a mainstream release in the united states all the girls in this film are suppose to be under 18 which if i remember correctly two of them are 17 and one is 16 now in the usa even though underage sex occurs on a daily basis many production or finance companies wont finance a film like this because of the sexual content this information was actually confirmed by the director himself john hazlett at the qa after the film the thing that gets me is that the sex scenes in this film arent graphic and the nudity is minor not to mention that all the actresses in this film are way over 18 in real life go figurebr br what the movie does best is it provides a lot of laughs as well as very strong characters i liked all the characters in this movie and each character seemed to have a now  then characteristic to them the jokes were funny because they were cleverly written not because they were dirty or over the top everything seemed to flow together nicely both the comedy and the drama the script was very strongbr br the acting was very good for the most part i thought all the three girls were great caroline dhavernas who also starred in one of the most underrated television series of all time wonderfalls was just terrific as well as holly lewis and amanda walsh who both did a fine job as well david boreanaz did a good job and he looked like he was having fun while shooting most of the scenes the guy played a pot head so it was funny seeing him play that rolebr br i had the pleasure of meeting john hazlett tonight who seemed like a very nice guy and was very appreciative of the comments made about the film i am shocked that this movie didnt go anywhere i think with a little marketing behind it it could have taken off sadly its going to be one of these direct to dvd films which so few will ever have the pleasure to see i think with what little budget mr hazlett had to work with the film turned out well and i think he did a fine job directing this little gembr br for someone who typically hates teen sex comedies i can honestly say i really enjoyed this film the character development and witty script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and be amused this is a fine comedy because it has heart and spunk to it i know i will be sure to buy this film when it comes on dvd on may 16 2006 if youre a fan of coming of age stories teen sex comedies or romantic comedies be sure to check this film out because its one of the funniest films of its kind to be released in yearsbr br moviemanmenzels final rating for these girls is an 810
