i had the pleasure of watching this two chairs down from one of the executive producer at the atlantic film festival which was interesting because he laughed at very different times than the rest of usbr br filmed in atlantic canada the movie is about three teenaged girls who in one of their last summers of their youth devote a large deal of energy to sleeping with a married 30year old man despite much protestationbr br its definitely worth a watch but the humour was geared a completely different demographic than the one i inhabit male 1825 so i was shaking my head at the characters antics rather than laughing inspite of this the story is strong enough to hold up for itself make it entertaining without so much laughing
