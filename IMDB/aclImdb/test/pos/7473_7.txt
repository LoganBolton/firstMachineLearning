i dont know what the critics were viewing when this movie was released but it slipped by them unnoticed it is well written witty satirical and thoroughly enjoyable its like a video game brought to life you never know whos behind the door or what will happen next the violence is not gratuitous nor overdone for splatter effectbr br one last word for you mickey rourke fansthe mickster is back and at his coolest in the cameo performance at the end
