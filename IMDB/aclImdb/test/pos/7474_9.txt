i saw this movie by accident while in paris i went into the wrong theater by accident and by the time i realized it wasnt a preview or a short film i was hooked br br paulina does a phenomenal job of holding your attention with her acting i cant say enough how impressed i was with her portrayal of this real femme fatal the rest of the cast performs very well too dont get me wrong this is not the greatest film ever made but given i knew nothing about it i was left with a lasting and very positive impressionbr br finally not speaking french in france paid off for once i didnt stop talking about this film for 3 weeks after seeing it
