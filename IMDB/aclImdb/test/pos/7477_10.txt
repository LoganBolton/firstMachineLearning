this movie was excellent from starttofinish i was riveted by the action the black humour and the incredibly bad luck our hero encountered at every turn thomas jane is a great actor and i hope to see him in many more movies to come reading through other peoples comments i have to admit i never once thought about tarrantino while watching thursday but now that i think about it i guess there are some similarities i guess i dont spend much time trying to relate everything to everything else the rape scene between porizkova and thomas jane is one for the record books  sexiest scene ever
