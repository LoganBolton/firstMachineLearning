i love the premise but its replay value is only for certain partsthe opening scene of course some characters are a bit outrageous but they are entertaining none the less i think the ballping sht was pushing it i know it was to show that nick and casey were living foul out in la and to show why casey quit the lifestyle i just think that the flashbacks story could have been better also the jamaican guy rapping on the phone is clever and entertaining but once again i think the story was told sloppy it really seems unbelievable i actually believe swordfish the other movie woods has written more than some of the parts in thursday because the government keeps sht a secret all the time and has organizations set up that the public will never know aboutbr br thursday is the best quentinesque movie ive seen i think woods is imaginativeclever and has witt however his work needs more maturation to even to get to the natural born killer script not stones movie level how old is he anyway
