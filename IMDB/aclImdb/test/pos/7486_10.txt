this movie is excellent not because it does anything special or new but because it is consistently great in all of its parts no part stands out as being groundbreaking or stellar but all parts are far above mediocre and that makes to me an excellent moviebr br i own several copies of this movie and may acquire it on collectors dvd or bluray someday holding off right now due to high bluray prices and of course the face that i dont have a bluray player but thats beside the point of this reviewbr br it stars off sort of ordinary but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension some action strongly portrayed characters and a well though out plot which keeps you interested until the very endbr br wait no it does not start out ordinarybr br it starts out sort of like what a qun tar movie wishes it could be with an awesome scene where an attempt to buy coffee and a donuts goes very very wrongbr br by the end of the movie nothing was as it seemed and a few people are dead and a few people are very rich i wont tell you who watch and enjoy overall rating 1010 a excellent
