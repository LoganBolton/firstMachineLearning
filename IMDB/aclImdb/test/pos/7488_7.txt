a vehemently cynical sarcastic and intense film mocking and imitating the style of pulp fiction and stylized gangster films thursday is an entertaining offputting and hilarious thrillride an amazingly eclectic mix of overthetop characters and bizarrely entertaining situations this dayinthelife of a gunman trying to go straight proves to be a worthy addition to the series of films that attempts to mimic the genius of tarantinos darkhumored masterpiece pulp fictionbr br nick aaron eckhardt stops by caseys thomas jane house to catch up on old times casey was a former gunman for drug dealers who has since reformed become an architect married a successful businesswoman paula marshall and is now contemplating adopting a child nick who still has ties to the gangster underworld leaves a briefcase full of drugs at caseys house while he borrows his car to run a few errandsÂ… aka unfinished business disgusted and angered by the introduction of drugs into his home casey flushes them all down the kitchen sink thats when one at a time nicks doublecrossed accomplices rapping rastafarian drug messengers and crooked cops all come aknocking for the unsuspecting casey who is about to have one unbelievable thursdaybr br the film opens with a hilarious sequence in a gas station in which nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee after pondering which size cup to get a fiasco breaks out with the cashier when he demands a free snackie cake and uses a 50 bill to pay resulting in comically brilliant bloodshed the situation goes from bad to worse when a cop intervenes and is caught in the most unusual of circumstances this opening segment establishes the perfect mood for the rest of the film which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters that seem selfaware of their own existence in this nonsensical gangster flickbr br the film is broken into segments based on various events and times during the course of one day this effect is much like pulp fiction which is a similarly given chapters although thursday doesnt mess with chronological order except for the occasional flashback also like tarantino music magnificently introduces each scene and each character oddly humorous creatures such as the jamaican hitman pizza delivery guy that raps over the phone and shares his hashish and paulina porizkovas narcissistic dallas who attempts to rape casey add humor to each event regardless of how horrifying and unnerving some of the coincidences are when mickey rourkes calmly spinechilling crooked cop kasarov is introduced the careful staging and intricate setup is fully assembled and caseys sticky situation becomes even more daring and laudablebr br definitely a wannabe pulp fiction with plenty of violence witty dialogue and extremely creepy antagonists thursday does some things right but other attempts at homage may be going just far enough as to suggest ripoff a flashback sequence that shows casey shooting up baddies and sporting a hairstyle that exactly matches john travoltas do in pulp fiction is easily one step too farbr br  mike massie wwwmoviepulsenet
