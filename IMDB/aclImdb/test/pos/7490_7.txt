it resembles so much to movies like pulp fiction or reservoir dogs that is impossible to think that tarantinos films werent a source of inspiration to this thursday however for a low cost bseries movie its not bad the plot about gangsters is captivating and funny and it also has a bit of dark humor and sarcasm we can find in pulp fiction the resources werent many fore sure but the film is well produced the acting also is good i enjoyed the scene when the girl was sat on the sofa teasing the doctor it was hot and funny at the same time the soundtrack is nice too i didnt hear too many songs but the ones i heard i liked i score it 710
