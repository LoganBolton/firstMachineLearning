i found the film dont look in the basement to be very good with some great characters in it it is about a young psychiatric nurse called nurse charlotte bealerosie holotikwho is going to start work at a isolated mental asylum whilst there she meets various sorts of different characters including dr geraldine masters who becomes in charge of the asylum after the the owner of the hospital dr stephens gets killed by one of the patients by hitting him with an axebr br my favourite characters in the film are mrs challinghamreah macadams a very funny little old lady allison who is a nymphomaniac and sambill mcghee a young black guy who goes around all day seeming to be in a world of his own all of the time the film was a very low budget film but was still a really great film i know that it was on the video nasties list back in the 80s but a did not think that it had a lot of gore in it alothough it did have some disturbing senses in it great film recommended
