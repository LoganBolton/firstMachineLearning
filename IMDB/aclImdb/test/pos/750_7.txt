i personally have a soft spot for horror films that are set in hospitals and asylums so i had a good feeling about watching this dont look in the basement even though its reputation is doubtful well turned out i was right this is great trashy entertainment with a couple of efficient shocks and delightfully absurd characters you have to of course look beyond the poor productions values and the completely illogical plot but if you manage to do that and if youre a fan of this type of horror thats an essential quality youll be rewarded with an outrageous videonasty in which blood and insanity form the main elements the young and cute nurse charlotte arrives at a remote sanitarium where shes supposed to start her new job she finds out that the doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and the replacement doctorincharge masters seems reluctant to accept the new arrival the life inside the sanitarium is rather peculiar with the patients running around free and every door is kept unlocked after a whole series of bizarre events charlotte discovers the horrific secrets that the institution hides the opening 10 minutes precredits are great and so is the completely deranged climax everything in between is pretty much without surprise or tension but you patiently wait because you just feel that the finale will be wild fun the asylums patients are textbook lunatics but i love them nevertheless some of my favorites include the former judge who still talks exclusively in legal terms the suspicious armysargeant and the madraving old lady dont look in the basement is great lowbrained fun especially recommended to fans of 70s trashcinema sick puppies and other types of scum the lunatics have taken over the asylum yeah
