the hospital is a movie that was made ahead of its time this film produced by screenwriter paddy chayefsky who gave us the oscarwinning film network deals with overworked staff gross incompetence and bureaucratic corruption at a large conglomerate hospital in manhattan george c scott in a superb performance as the head physician is driven to alcoholism and a deathwish as he tries to recover from a divorce throwing his son out of the house and worst of all a medical facility where corruption and incompetence take precedence over caring and healing of the sick and injuredbr br mr scott makes the movie his own and viewers will be shocked at what they observe at this medical establishment you can feel the pain pun intended of what this hospital has done to him the vivid images of this hospitals incompetence are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you may find yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from scene to scenebr br if only the film had stayed with that premise in a documentary style fashion as it starts out this picture would be brilliant unfortunately there is a subplot of scott falling for the daughter of a senile patient the patient has been murdering people at the hospital this is where credibility of the picture becomes strained the romantic dialog scenes add nothing to the picture and the mental patient posing as a doctor i found to be totally unbelievable a simple security call and records check should have prevented the senile patient from doing the killings it takes almost the whole movie before security people are brought into the film to get the patient out of the hospital i could not see one person doing that much damage even as corrupt as this hospital isbr br furthermore george c scotts character is overworked another pun intended because the script has too many things happening at once for example within a period of 20 minutes you could have as many as 20 different doctors accused and denying what they should have done or didnt do with the nurses and aids its the same story someones chart was read wrong someone was given the wrong medication and died the doctor operated on the wrong patient than another doctor does the same thing blaming a third nurse who was not on call because the second nurse who was supposed to be admitting the patient was on her coffee break there is also a lot of subtle dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption being fed to the viewerbr br this repetition of medical ineptness is unforgettable however the murder subplot is a distraction more than a help to this movie when the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and scotts reactions to this you are glued to the screen but the conversations between scott and the mad patients daughter force the film into a mystery type who done it scenario that seriously hurts the quality of the movie when the loony patient is revealing how he did the killings i wondered the following why did the producers need the find the killer madpatient subplot i think the only point of scotts character having a relationship with the senile patients daughter was to give him anybody with whom to communicate the hospital should have maintained its scathing indictment of the medical profession by removing the loveinterest and mad patient scenes it should have focused on the incompetent bs within its walls more frequently in an era where this movie could have been phenomenal the subplot stories make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been
