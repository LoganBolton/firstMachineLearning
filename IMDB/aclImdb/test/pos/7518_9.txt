anybody who goes to the manhattan hospital center is taking his life in his hands that includes the staff of the hospitalbr br i had never seen the hospital before and i was intrigued at how similar the characters and situations of the plot were to that other paddy chayefsky masterpiece network there are elements in george c scotts character that have both al schumachers and howard bealesbr br hes the administrator of the hospital and hes mad as hell and not going to take it any more hes completely estranged from his wife and kids it takes a faye dunaway type character in the person of diana rigg to make him snap out of it one roll in the hay with her and hes shocked back to reality and the fact he still can contribute in the worldbr br but first hes got a real problem someone is out killing hospital staff four of them in a 48 hour period and the nice part is their deaths can be attributed to in large part to the general incompetence of a medical bureaucracy thats where the comedy comes inbr br there is an actual howard beale type character in the person of barnard hughes diana riggs father his end is not quite as dramatic as beales thoughbr br back in my working days it was part of my job to pay medical suppliers some of them could be as big creeps as youll find portrayed in the hospital the black comedy satire had some real bite to it for mebr br george c scott was nominated for best actor but having won and refused to accept the previous years oscar for patton he wasnt about to get a second chance he lost to gene hackman for the french connection still his handling of the role is unforgettablebr br try viewing the hospital back to back with network and see how many similarities you spot
