watching this movie i cant help drawing the comparison between it and wild reeds another thoughtful film about teenagers coming of agebr br like wild reeds this movie is slow and the director would not be hurried so if you want a quick resolution to things dont watch it this movie is like a slice of life beginning imperfectly and ending imperfectly theres no resolution to anything no happily ever after for anybody just like real lifebr br this movie is as real as it gets the acting is surprisingly good the director is fond of long really long shots and the actors and actresses excel at showing subtlety and inner thoughtsbr br i love this movie i almost didnt watch it but now im very glad that i did its not a movie for everyone but if youre willing to let it grow on you you will be rewardedbr br 1010
