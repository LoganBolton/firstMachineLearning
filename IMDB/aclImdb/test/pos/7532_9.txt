writing about something so wonderful is completely hard actually its almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie this is a marvelous story about sex and gender and its almost unbelievable that we have not to deal with obscene scenes of sex feeling this film was made for people that like to feel and just to feel life in all its complexity in a gorgeous simple way we look at it and something starts growing inside our minds even our hearts it a pure poem ive watched some gay movies and i almost always got really unsatisfied with unnecessary scenes of sex not because i dont like scenes of sex but generally they are so pornographic that im forced to think that the director or the producers or the writer of the script thinks that homosexuality means perversion nagisa no shindobaddo is totally different from that ones three are the main characters we have ito yoshida and aihara two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle ito likes his best friend yoshida yoshida likes aihara and aihara likes ito imagine what this could turn in unprepared hands but in the contrary hashiguchi makes a magnificent story which goes profoundly in the philosophy of life adding a question in our mind that made me think astonished in the end of the movie why and that why expanded in multiple questions inside of my brain and inside of my heart the scenes actually sometimes tending to be boring are moments of the most delightful poem which we are able to feel but totally unable to write down in words and maybe because of that we are unable to understand the question in the end of the movie im sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of itÂ… some people want to understand a film almost dissecting it others are so used to common american gay movies that cant appreciate the real value of this masterpiece watch it close your eyes in the credits and feel everything feel yourself feel the wonderful song for all this and much much more i give a nine and i just dont give ten because ten of ten is perfection but i confess i almost did it
