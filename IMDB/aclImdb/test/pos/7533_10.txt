nagisa no shindobaddo or like grains of sand is an amazingly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls dealing with the state of becoming one with who they are this movie isnt about homosexuality but it is about sexualitybr br aihara an aloof girl will definitely make the viewers ponder who is behind the aloof girl does she love yoshida or does she love ito or did she somehow turn into a lesbian because of the incident i doubt itbr br and what about yoshida does he realize that he loves ito in the end well we all know he loves him as a friend but youll never know once you see this movie haha  in the end aihara along with ito delivers an exceptional message to the audience which is that it does not matter if you love a boy or a girl and i have to tell you im so dense that i didnt get it at first  its because of the whole no talking scenes you have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and not by what they say especially the final part whew boy that was confusing its a confusing story but it is beautiful nonetheless  this movie is certainly one of the best japanese movies i have ever seen and trust me ive seen plenty
