a stunning and thoughtful observation on modern life for youngsters in japan like grains of sand delves into issues such as rape homosexuality and pubescent angst in a subtle and significant way it gives an insight in to the youth culture struggling to define itself outside of the bounds of their parents generation with its strict conformity and facade typical to japanese cinema often what isnt said is more important that what is so to those not versed in japanese film and culture beware it can seem dull and minimalistic pretty much like every film to come out of japan bar mangas if you dont know what to look for i saw it for the first time when i was 15 and was what originally sparked my interest in japan its culture and language considering im now 22 and learning japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years needless to say its a powerful film enjoy
