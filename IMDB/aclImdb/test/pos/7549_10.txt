i rented this movie not knowing what to expect but whoa was i in for a treatbr br for anyone who like myself was waiting for a good movie that combined horror and sci fi it is time to rejoice because the wait has finally ended writing acting filming and directing  all top notch i hate to admit it but i actually cried at one point when dracula was talking to the crippled guy truly an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish the corridors of the ship provided the perfect spooky setting for this tale and the actors were really able to make their fear come alive to me and coolio as a vampirevery nicebr br and believe meas great as the bulk of the movie wasthe ending will blow you away i know this movie gets a lot of flack on this site for some reason but i know none of you saw the ending coming brilliant
