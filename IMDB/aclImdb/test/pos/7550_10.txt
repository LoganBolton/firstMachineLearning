unfortunately many great films on imdb such as this one have their scores adjusted by imdb this is truly a fine and intriguing film by the accomplished director of bonnie and clyde little big man night moves mickey one and the chasebr br if you click in the user rating area youll see that the actual median for four friends is 76 however imdb has adjusted dumbed down the rating to 64br br per imdb imdb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at vote stuffing by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of itthe exact methods we use will not be disclosed this should ensure that the policy remains effective in other words we wont disclose our methods so you cant question how we arrived at the score what a shame to see fine thoughtprovoking films like four friends fare no better than lame formulaic comedies due to imdbs filters
