four friends was first billed on hbo in 82 as a sleeper hit having heard the term sleeper when 14 back then  i was anxious to see one  boy  was i surprised that film i hadnt really fallen in love with a nonspecial effects film outside of treasure of the sierra madre  much less a hippy flickbut having had grown up with a couple of hippies  i understood the power behind mr penns film four friends is definitely one of a kind the script is so personable  and that cast craig wasson defines danilo prozor so well he just personifies the writer type to a tee  both smart and clumsy the scene at the window and strong yet so very vulnerable for me  he captures what its like to be so taken with agirl that it lasts over a decadeand i have always found solace in the character  and in the film throughout the 80s four friends was a partner in crime to me  and i caught the movie whenever i could on hbo  even if i had to stay up until 5am and still always at the end  there is a sense of loss when all those wonderful characters part from the viewers on the beach jodi thelen personifies that girl to the hilt  it is so hard not to be charmed by her this movie really stands the test of time every once and a while i check out my video of itor show a friendand it still gets a solid reaction ive known women who absolutely fall in love with georgia so many levels just an incredible little 60s piece of humanity very special very magical i recently found the novelization of four friends by robert grossbach  and its even more detailed that the movie actual dates of events etc a real find and whats more  haha  i found the novel while thumbing around in a used book storein omaha ne of all places guess you have to have an eye for her when i was in la in 92 working as an extra  i went into a ruddy lil memorbilia shop  and there were a ton of stills from the film unfortunately  i was broke and couldnt indulgebut boy those photos of georgia and the guys all together just went right through me i met director joe sergant on the set of skylark in emporia ks in summer of 92and we spoke about four friends  very cool alsoworking at a video store in omaha in 98  waited on a female who was a relative of jim metzler told her to pass the word on that there was some kid in omaha who was just fanatical about the film  and had gotten the utmost out of it once again  the movie captures everything thats in danilos characters heartgreat great work  one of mssrs tesich and penns finest efforts steve tesich is sorely missed an incredible writer isadora duncanbr br  c
