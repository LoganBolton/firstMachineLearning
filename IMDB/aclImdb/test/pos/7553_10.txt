i first encountered arthur penns four friends late one night on hbo having never heard of it i expected very little but watched because i was interested in seeing what a creation by a teaming of penn and screenwriter steve tesich would be like for the next two hours or so i sat mesmerized watching this incredible teaming of talent and the story they wove a semiautobiographical tale of a young immigrant to america growing up amidst the turbulence of the 1960s four friends follows the story of danilo an eastern european immigrant the brilliant craig wasson from his arrival in the united states through a decade that changed the american landscape accompanying danilo on his journey are his friends georgia the radiant jodi thelan in a role that sadly she has never had the opportunity to equal tom jim metzler and david michael huddleston four friends covers way too much territory for me to attempt to explain it here but if you havent seen this film i urge you to find a copy its just been released on dvd and watch it you wont be disappointed tesichs script is wonderfully poignant Â— at times funny at times incredibly sad but always fascinating and honest penn directs with a sure hand and an obvious love for the period and the people whose lives were following the cast is uniformly superb this film should have made a major star out of wasson who is truly one of this countrys most wasted talents jodi thelan not your standard brainless hollywood sexpot heats up the screen in a performance that makes the audience fall in love with her character as easily as the characters in the film metzler and huddleston subtle performances could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their costars but they are excellent and help anchor the film also superb are miklos simon and elizabeth lawrence as danilos parents as well as reed birney and lois smith i have not been without a copy of four friends since the day after i first saw it on hbo those many years ago it has been and remains one of my alltime favorite films for more than 20 years now i cant recommend it enough and feel if you give it a chance youll feel the same way
