a wonderful movie about people i first saw four friends when it was originally shown in theatres and ive seen it many times since if im not watching it when its on tv ill get together with friends and rent it invariably the people ive watched this movie with find it enjoyable it deals with friends from childhood to adulthood in the 50s and 60s its very funny and touching dealing with first love and first sex racism war politics the whole 60s shebang it can also be quite dramatic if you enjoy movies about people this one is definitely worth the time
