a great look at the 60s through the eyes of four friends from their student days in 1960 to their reunion 10 years later  a yugoslavian immigrant in love with the american dream and struggling to cope with the often violent reality a prematurely balding undertakers son a soldier and the crazy hippy girl they all love good direction and a strong cast do justice to steve tesichs brilliant script the dialogue isnt as snappy as in breaking away but the themes of growing up and fatherson conflict are dealt with just as well and there are still a few wonderfully comic moments among the shocks and drama
