behind the nostalgic music we see a young boy get off a train he is arriving from yugoslavia to meet his father a man he has not seen in a decade at the train station we meet the man he never smilesbr br thus we begin our journey into four friends arthur penns powerful and amazing film you may ask why i began my review that way well that is the way the video box describes the film you may have figured out that the film will be the story of the boy trying to get along with this emotionless man and eventually he will peel away at his cover and expose the kindnessbr br well if you bought that ive got a bridge i want to sell you you see modern hollywood would make that film penn has always been an outsider and has never resorted to typical cliched storytelling he always tells interesting stories about people his credits include bonnie and clyde the chase alices restaurant and the underrated mickey one and four friends is no exceptionbr br a typical hollywood film would focus on the boy who is named danilo but steve tesichs script only focuses on that for about 4 minutes and then abandons him we meet the adult danilo played by craig wasson whom you may recognize from body double and nightmare on elm street 3 and his friends tom david and the passionate georgia the movie takes us throughout the sixties now in a lesser film the events would receive the attention but in four friends these events happen but penn and tesich is more concerned with character study than plot and i think the film is better that way we know the events we dont need to dwell on them againbr br i know i havent described much of the plot but i dont know if you can describe four friends its not one of those highconcept films that can be described in a single sentence its a film of many moods and textures its also a genuinely emotional experience the final twenty minutes of this film moved me to tears im not ashamed to admit it rarely does a film have such power that it can reduce me to tears the acting is first rate especially by craig wasson who seems to be one of the most underused actors working today this is such a difficult emotional performance and wasson pulls it off he should have received an oscar for this another great performance is by jodi thelen who has an even more difficult role than wasson but she handles it extremely well and gives georgia a certain dignity most hollywood actresses wouldnt theyd be too scared to even try theyd be more concerned with image rather than giving a great performance thats not what acting is about she also deserved an oscarbr br four friends didnt receive much of a push in 1981 maybe people just didnt have the emotional capacity to handle it and clueless executives couldnt push it as another american graffiti it lacks the wallop of four friends so they let it die too bad for this is one of the very best films of the 1980s a decade where more and more slick trash was created and great art like this was without a home i ask you to give this film a chancebr br  out of 4 stars
