zeke rippy mic is great you totally believe his character and its scary as hell i spent half the movie covering my eyes the other half on the edge of my seat its cool to see something this suspenseful and frightening that isnt all blood and guts  but it did give me bad dreamsbr br  basically this is a great movie  see it the first chance you get
