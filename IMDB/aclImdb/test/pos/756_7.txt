youll either love or hate movies such as this thriller set inside a lonesome asylum in a far off lonesome land its not so much of a horror show but a concoction of frightening imageries and wackozoid mental patients scream is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular drivein classic noted for some strange and wicked behaviors notice the judge whos about to put on the ax from behind the doctor brrrrr not much else can be described here other than some bloody tasty goodness but when you get a chance remember the familiar old saying by the hag lady get out get out and never ever come back dont you wish you havent looked in the basement
