glenn close is back as sarah plain and tall a woman who keeps a family together through the good and bad times the acting is superb  christopher walken unusually nonspooky as her husband once again delivers a topnotch performance its good to see young christopher bell all grown up too bad we dont get to see much of anna lexi randall also a few years older but the new addition to the witting family played by emily osment was very welcome and finally jack palance as the long lost witting patriarch is as fine as ever
