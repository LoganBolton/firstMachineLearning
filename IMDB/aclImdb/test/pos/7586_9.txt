i have seen over 2000 studioera sound films including lots of judy garland lena horne shirley jones and deanna durbins own universal features plus a decent amount of live and studiorecorded musical comedy and opera and i assure you no one tasked with singing in front of a camera and microphone or maybe anywhere ever has ever touched durbins solo heremono soundtrack and crap 1930s microphones and all the kid from canada sings this bit from il bacio like she lived and wrote it herself and then happened to show up for a retrospective in italy late in her career not like a child who learned it from her music teacherbr br if you skip this extra on the dvd or skip ahead to the garland solo you are just depriving yourself since this cheap mgm teaser just happened to capture one of the greatest performances of the 20c
