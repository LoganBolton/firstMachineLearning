canthony is correct that this little short is just an excuse to hear a very young judy garland fourteen years old singing with a slightly older by one year deanna durbin but i must disagree with everything else he or she said including the running time  which is only about ten minutes not twenty a singlereelerbr br the song is not her best obviously but its enjoyable and definitely worth the ten minutes to watch on turner the duet with durbin is quite interesting two conflicting styles that nevertheless dovetail reasonably wellbr br the short is just a throwaway but its nowhere near as bad as the other reviewer made it out to be honestly i enjoyed itbr br dafydd ab hugh
