although little more than a pleasant 11minute musical diversion its rightly billed as a tabloid musical every sunday is one of the most famous and precious documents in cinematic history since it provides an invaluable look at the burgeoning talents of two of the screens most talented and beloved musical performers deanna durbin and judy garlandbr br although often cited as an screen test of sorts produced by mgm to test the adolescent appeal of studio contractees durbin and garland whose options were reportedly coming up for renewal this assertion is not entirely accurate by the time every sunday was produced in july 1936 deanna durbins contract with mgm had already lapsed and she had been immediately signed by universal a month earlier in june 1936br br however a provision in durbins mgm contract permitted the studio to exercise an option on her services for up to sixty days providing she had not yet begun work on a picture at her new studio as durbins debut vehicle three smart girls was still not ready to begin filming mgm chose to exercise its option and although officially under contract to universal at the time durbin found herself back on the mgm lot filming this agreeable short subject with fellow adolescent singing hopeful judy garlandbr br this along with garlands far more extensive prior professional performing experiencetraining which included appearances in several earlier movie shorts may explain why every sunday often seems to favor judy garland over deanna durbin giving garland more lines to speak and an original song americana to sing while durbin offers the popular classical art song il bacio by luigi ardiiti certainly it would make perfect sense that mgm would want to favor one of its own contract players over another from a rival studiobr br ironically although garlands character is the more overtly proactive one of the two girls in this short it would be durbins feisty and impulsive little miss fixit screen persona at universal which would propel her to instantaneous worldwide super stardom as the worlds first teen idol with her debut vehicle three smart girls while garlands more passive wistful wallflower adolescent image would see her generally cast in supporting roles opposite frequent screen partner mickey rooney and in ziegfeld girl the upandcoming lana turner not until her fifteenth mgm feature 1942 for me and my gal which was also her first fully adult role would garland achieve the solo abovethe title billing and solo attraction status of a true superstar that durbin had attained instantaneously six years earlierbr br it is entirely inaccurate therefore to assert that garland was the only superstar attraction of the two girls as durbin attained this status with press n public almost a decade before her mgm rival literally in foreclosure at the time of her signing the on screen evidence strongly suggests that universal was much quicker to realize deannas full superstar potential than mgm was with judy and its worth noting that almost every notable accomplishment garland achieved at mgm from superstar billing to having starring vehicles specially written to showcase her talents and appeal to being invited to plant her footprints in the forecourt of graumanns chinese theater to receiving an honorary oscar in recognition for her talent deanna durbin received well before her gifted mgm contemporarybr br in any case every sunday is a delightful utterly unpretentious musical short its plot line durbin and garland use their singing talents to save durbins grandfather from being forcibly retired by the town council from conducting his sunday concerts in the park presages the plot lines of both garlands lets put on a show musicals with mickey rooney and durbins 100 men and a girl unlike garlands later babes films the short never treats the insubstantial storyline seriously and consequently its eleven minute running time flies bybr br of course the true magic of every sunday is in observing the already remarkable performing talentsscreen presences of durbin and garland at the very beginning of their legendary careers both girls even at this early stage possessed remarkable screen presences and are utterly natural and unaffected in their presentation as both singers and actresses garland fairly explodes off the screen with vitality as she literally punches out the lyrics to the jaunty americana as she socks across the number with appropriate hand gestures judy literally seems to be chewing on the words of the song as she screws up her mouth and bugs out her eyes in her intense eagerness to show what she can dobr br by contrast durbins presentation of il bacio is far more demure and subdued although entirely appropriate for her classical selection durbins delivery of arditis waltz is much more of the traditional stand n sing variety than garlands physically emotive turn nevertheless though miniature diva deanna does nothing to call attention to herself with her candid eyes dazzling smile and artless delivery she easily holds the screen with jazz baby judy and their delightful duetting of americana in the shorts finale makes one regret all the more that producer joe pasternak was never able to realize his dream of pairing durbin and garland in a musical feature film because universal refused to loan number one asset durbin outbr br a priceless document of the nascent talents of two remarkable and utterly unique talents see this one if you get a chance
