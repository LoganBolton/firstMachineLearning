women will like this movie better than men of course women like all romantic comedies more than men  on average i generally like romantic comedies quite a bit however i considered this a 55 for the first 50 of the movie and about a 65 for the next 40 and about a 9 for the last 10 so begrudgingly i will rate it a 7 i tape and keep all movies rated a 7 or better and none that are a 6 or worse  at least thats my objective i have over 1200 movies so why keep the dogsbr br my wife liked this movie quite a bit more than me though im not sure why i am a bigger drew barrymore fan than she isbr br the whole point of this movie was about a young woman who goes back to high school undercover to write a story about the high school experience nowadays she was a dork in high school the first time around and has to learn how to be cool the second time around her journey toward cooldom as well as her falling in love with a teacher is the storybr br what drove me nuts for the first half the movie was just how mangy she looked i wondered why they would pick her for this role until i realized how capable she is at looking like a dog so much so that i truly dont think i want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning argh naturally she transformed into a rather attractive cute woman by the end and she became very popularbr br the ending is about a 99 on the very sweet scale so you sappers out there will like that otherwise it isnt very memorable and easily missable
