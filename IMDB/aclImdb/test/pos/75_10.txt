this often maligned movie is a must for fans of blake edwards julie andrews henry mancini or hollywood musicals other writers have commented on the shifts in tone the confusion of plot etc but the film has many things to recommend it the score is one of henry mancinis best and he has written many wonderful ones several songs are sung to perfection by andrews julies performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes she is at her absolutely loveliest here the onlocation shots are breathtaking and there are some funny inspector clouseautype sight gags to boot rock hudson basically phoned in his performance but he is passably good a real curiosity item in that it was the last major film julie did for about 10 years and in many ways is a precursor to victorvictoria it is lovely to look at and listen to when will it be available on dvd when it is i for one would like both versionsthe longer and shorter directors cut since it was lampooned in sob they would make a great twopack
