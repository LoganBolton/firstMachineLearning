this movie may superficially appear to be flaky and for teenieboppers it seems to be the stereotypical high school movie but in fact it takes an honest and touching look at the high school experience it doesnt propose some unrealistic ending where the geeks and the popular kids reconcile it doesnt change what happened in adolescence it just attempts to reckon with it this is a really great fun heartwarming movie good for teens and for those who can still remember being one
