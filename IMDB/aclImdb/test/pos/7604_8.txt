this movie turned out to be pretty much what i expected of course its sappy of course its predictable we all know the fairytale but knowing that when you go to watch it its enjoyable enough to watch it was funny and sweet i did find it annoying that they showed geeks as either kids who didnt wash there hair or kids who loved math and joined clubs about math and wore tshirts about math i was an outcast in high school and i didnt do these things it goes much deeper than that having to do with many things some of that being how much money your family has how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and how mean you are willing to be to other kids anyway i wont get into it i dont agree with other opinions that drew isnt convincing as a geek with braces no makeup and unwashed hair i dont think too many people would be drooling over her and even when she goes back to highschool and sheds those things shes still wearing the wrong clothes wrong hair and has the wrong attitude to be considered cool and her other geek friend may be beautiful but it doesnt matter where i come from you can still be an outcast and be beautiful inside and out
