i saw this movie for a first time years ago when it was still new and i was satisfied its a great hollywood makebelief story for teenagers however its not lifelike as much as you would want to believe it these stories never happen thats why it is irritating to watch movies like that they play with teenagers minds just imagine how many girls still in high schools believed in that magic and got disappointed i wouldnt recommend this movie to my little sister or my cousin the director should have spent some more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about actors yes they actors were good but the idea isnt worth a 10 there are a lot of films about teenagers so why dont we make a better one
