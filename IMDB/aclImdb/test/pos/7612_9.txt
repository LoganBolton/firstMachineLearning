i love this movie so much it always makes me cry if you appreciate drew barrymore half as much as i do youll love this movie its got all the essentials i look for in a movie it has good actors good characters good humora lot of heartwarming moments too the flashback moments when we see josie in high school make me cry though every single time im sure youll like this one dont judge based on the fact that it looks like a teen movie even though it is in a way a teen movie sure if youre a guy and all you watch are hardcore special effect movies only in the top 250 movies of all time then this isnt for you but if you like romantic comedies you will not forget after seeing it pick it up at a video store and enjoy drew barrymore is great in this one
