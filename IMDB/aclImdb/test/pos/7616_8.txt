i cant say that i embrace this as a romantic comedy as i found little funny about it i did find it endearing entertaining heartwarming and terminally sweet and while there were some witty moments i found them more bittersweet than outright comedicbr br i liked this one barrymore has grown so much as an actress and its always wonderful to catch her on the big screen but this translates well to the small screen too in fact on subsequent viewings i like this one more and morebr br if youre a fan of the romantic comedy then you may be a bit put off by lack of comedic effect with this one but if youre in it for the romance its definitely here to be foundbr br it rates a 7810 frombr br the fiend
