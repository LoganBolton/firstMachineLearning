very sadly i can relate to this movie as im 17 and have yet to be kissed so i really feel for josie its been a while since seeing this film but to write this review i rewatched it and remembered everything i loved about itbr br drew barrymore is a great actress and this role suited her really well at the time the chemistry between sam and josie was really good and michael vartan was an excellent actor in thisbr br i loved the storyline too  as i said up there i could relate and its rare you find a film you can completely relate tobr br all over  i loved it 710
