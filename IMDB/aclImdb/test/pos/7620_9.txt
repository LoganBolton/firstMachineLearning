i loved this movie not as great as 50 first dates but its definitely a repeater especially on a rainy day or with a group of girlfriends yes the plot was cute and maybe even unbelievable but whats so bad about a feel good movie drew as josie and her romance with the teacher is so sweet and brother baseball wannabee adds to the movies good feeling with all the junk out there whats so bad about a good movie the whole family can enjoy without being embarrassed while watching with your kids drew is an awesome actress that really seems to be unappreciated for the most part this is definitely one of her best roles
