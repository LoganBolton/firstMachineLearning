stupidly beautiful this movie epitomizes the so bad its good genre of films br br the only two talents in it are richard boone and joan van ark and only boone is any good its kind of sad that the man who rose to fame as paladin should wind up in this ugly pile of celluloid while he turns in a fantastic performance i couldnt help but feel that he so outclassed all his fellow actors in this piece that he shouldnt even have been therebr br the effects in this film are laughable but fun the idea of a dinosaur being buried in the wall of a cave and suddenly coming to life is bmovie gold when the triceratops gets killed watch how it falls its clear that the stunt performer in the front of the costume knows the timing best he falls to the ground well before the back half of the dinosaur follows suitbr br speaking of suits there is nothing good to say about the purple tyrannosaur in this flick it seems to have some kind of stealth technology since bunta reputed to be the best tracker in the world twice fails to notice it until its within biting range of him i dont know how all the prints are but in the version i own the tyrannos roar contains godzillas trademark bellowbr br this is loads of fun to watch if you like bad movies i love them and especially bad monster movies so i consider this the gem of my collection if bad movies are your thing definitely get this one
