i watched this movie on hbo and i had a good timebr br the director has done a great work i found myself totally absorbed into this movie once it started norman reeduss performance is cool i expect more chilling movies from himbr br i was so absorbed that on occasions i wanted to grab gun from norman and shoot that snake girl hehe i like the movies when innocent looking girls play tricks with men really cunningly the ending was what i wanted  br br this movie is filled with twists of moments you expect this but something else happens br br in the beginning those massive images cut scenes were really painful to eyesbr br although it was not shown when norman reedus changed currency notes or is it me standing by fridge
