i like armand assante  my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will againbr br the early part is difficult to follow but later it clears up i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose endsbr br some of the acting is unconvincing but maybe thats because i was always expecting some kind of doublecross in that case the poor acting would be the insincerity of the characters interacting with each other so it fits very wellbr br the important theme is the carnival owner assante is laundering money for a local casino  his snakecharmer wife dagmara dominczyk wants to steal it she complains to archie reedus how terrible her life is and how he could help her get out of itbr br there are 3 or 4 plot twists which is probably the reason for all of those loose ends and just when you think you have solved the mystery something else will happenbr br my 810 score is mostly for the plotbr br i wont say any more  i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time
