didnt really know what to expect from this movieand found myself being pleasantly surprised i picked it up because i recently stumbled across norman reedus and am trying to find more of the films that hes been inbr br im not big into hustler movies or con movies but i have to say this one roped me in within minutes probably because i couldnt quit figure out exactly who was hustling who this movie is stylish and fastpaced with a story that is believable thanks to location and fantastic performancesbr br while i was impressed with most in the film i must say dagmara dominczyk was simply excellentbr br give it a chanceits a really fun film
