we stumbled across this show one sunday morning at 630 am while flipping through all of the cable channels and this turned out to be best show on it is absolutely adorable we need shows like this for children and adults as im certainly way beyond my childhood years as one of the other commentaries pointed out this show benefits from the simplicity of the characters and story lines the puppets are fantastically cute the backgrounds are colorful and even though they are created out of cardboard foam paint and pure imagination they remind us of our own childhoods when we could spend the day at our own grandmas house exploring the world around us for those who never were lucky to have a grandma as nice as nana this show is for you youll make up for lost time this show is a true inspiration and filled with cleverness and humor and just outright fun for children and adults alike in other words dont overlook this show just because youre over the age of three spend a half hour with mona nana mr wooka and russell theyll be friends you look forward to seeing
