this film is a tapestry a series of portraits of rom communities woven together by music its very much a musicians film because of the paucity of spoken dialogue  and what dialogue there is is not important to the structure of the narrative some might expect a national geographic tale of customs dress and music or a plotline orbiting a few central characters  dont look for that herebr br this is because it paints a portrait of a family of peoples rather than telling a story of individuals the plot is the story through space india to andalucia andor time we cannot tell of a people there is no need of narration you get a sense of a joyous people strongly linked in small communities where social interaction is very important and a great sense of sadness in parts at their rejection by society at largebr br so its a paean to rom culture very beautifully shot with a wide spectrum of rom music and a sting in the tail which is the oppression these people have faced and still face
