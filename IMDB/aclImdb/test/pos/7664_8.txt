i love the thackeray novel on which this film is based and while this modern version of becky sharps story is a b film the casting of loy in her first topbilled role is rather fascinatingbr br before loy became mgms reigning good girl in scores of genteel and comic roles she was an actress vanity fair was loys followup film to emma in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper marie dresslerbr br loys becky is much nastier than miriam hopkins version 3 years later in becky sharp loys becky is very much a precode film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways its the type of character that jean harlow or clara bow could easily have played but becky here is still supposed to be of the genteel set thats what makes her fallen character so tragicbr br in counterpoint to loys grasping becky is the goody goody amelia barbara kent who is just not an interesting character mary forbes is icily good as mrs sedley most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah conway tearle as rawdon walter byron as osborne anthony bushell as dobbin others are nearly dickensian is their quirkiness billy bevan as joseph lionel belmore as crawley montagu love as the marquis lilyan irene as polly the maid elspeth dudgeon as the housekeeperbr br loy is front and center throughout while the ending is rather shocking she has several excellent scenes such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another womans winning roulette bet the more loys becky descends morally the more beautiful she gets until she is finally caught bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by loy in a film that should be seen
