i was in my early 20s just graduating from college when this movie appeared seeing it was event of great impact not only because of the high quality of the film as evidenced by its many awards but because of its place in the historical context of 1959 because of social progress since then it is nearly impossible to fathom that my college had only begun admitting carefully screened black students in 1953 a mainstream highbudget extravaganze with an almost entirely black cast was a distinct novelty in 1959br br the movie was given a deluxe roadshow reserved seat presentation in only the best theatres complete with a souvenir program detailing the lavish care that had been taken with lighting and color multitrack stereo sound etc almost every black entertainer that we white people had any knowledge of was in the movie gershwins music superbly performed and the sheer universal humanity of the story was tremendously movingbr br i was recently able to obtain a faded copy of a twohour cutting of the film and repeated viewings have confirmed my opinion time has made what seemed steamy sex scenes in 1959 seem quite tame but the musical quality has not diminished sammy davis and pearl bailey are masterful in their portrayals what a crime that the young black artists of today are unable to see these performers at the peak of their careers
