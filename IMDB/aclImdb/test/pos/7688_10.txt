porgy  bess was the very first movie my parents ever took me to see even at the tender age of 5 years i was so greatly moved by the drama that i cried aloud at the screen crown please dont take bess i was fortunate enough to see the one tv broadcast of porgy  bess so many years ago and now all i have are the great memories and the record album to remember this wonderful wonderful movie i have been waiting and wishing and hoping that one day i might own a copy of porgy  bess  but it doesnt look like it will happen what is the hold up obviously there is enough public interest in this movie to warrant a release after all these years i remember it and it sure seems like im not alone this movie is brimming with human emotion  jealousy lust anger bravery determination porgy  bess is a buried gem that deserves to be brought forth into the light for a new audience to admire and an old audience to relish
