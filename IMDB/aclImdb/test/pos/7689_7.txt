i had the privilege recently of viewing what is said to be the last 35mm technicolor stereo print and found it much livelier and more touching than remembered also closer to the original material  basically all screenwriter n richard nash did was trim change much recitative to spoken dialog and insert a transitional scene or two including a very amusing one for pearl bailey oliver smiths production design is stagy in the lil abnerguys and dolls 50s adaptation mode but it works well for this works folkloric unrealistic quality stereotyping and racism are present but not to a winceinducing degree further for a movie of its time its pretty frank  the adultery violent behavior drug use and selfdestructive habits of the denizens of catfish row are not at all minimized in the telling but there are debits beginning with all that variation from the stage text the loss of so much compromises gershwins brilliance  no wonder the family doesnt like it the reorchestration especially of sammy davis jrs material is disconcertingly trendy and vulgar george knew what he was doing folks you didnt have to mess with it so much and while poitier and dandridge act well and their singing doubles sing well theres a huge chasm between the characters singing and speaking voices  youre constantly aware of the artifice what really counts here of course is the music among the greatest ever written for the theater anywhere despite all the tinkering it survivesand youd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it if the treatment isnt entirely to the estates liking and it shouldnt be theres still no reason not to spend some bucks to restore this ambitious filming of gershwins masterpiece and make new generations more aware of his genius
