i first saw the opening of otto premingers porgy and bess on tv probably some time in the early 80s and my younger self found it a bit slow despite the timeless music i turned it offbr br last night an extremely rare cobbled together print screened at the la cinematheque and it was a bit of a revelation the performances are strong and memorable dorothy dandridge brings a great deal of vulnerability strength and subtle at least by todays standards eroticism to her part sidney poitier is said to be uncomfortable with the movie but his performance is terrific as is pearl bailey even better are sammy davis as the amoral catlike sportin life and brock peters as the villanious bully crownbr br still im no fan of premingers earlier leaden  and far easier to see  carmen jones porgy and bess is far superior to that less controversial film  though that may have to do with the fact that the source material is also far superiorbr br as seen last night this is a sturdy but far from perfect work not all of the moments quite come alive and there is some awkwardness in the way the film mixes the overtly stylized catfish row set beautifully done by oliver smith with actual locations also even to my rather untrained ear some brief portions of the score seem unduly popularizedbr br moreover while this doesnt detract from the achievement of the filmmakers  premingers decision to film almost entirely in wide shots with no closeups and occasional medium shots no doubt rendered it unwatchable on tv panned and scanned and may doom it even on widescreen dvds if it gets the restoration it deserves on smaller screens we wont be able to make out the many details that are crucial to the way preminger staged the filmbr br also the mix heard last night was odd many of the vocals particularly on the opening summertime seemed unduly soft and were overwhelmed by the instrumental music perhaps this can be fixed in a restorationbr br there is the issue of the films racial politics personally i see nothing wrong with it at least in a contemporary context at the time when so few films depicted strong africanamerican characters this may have seemed an unfortunate choice for a bigbudget hollywood film and while there may not be much empowering here these are recognizable human beings that are not racial stereotypes these are operatic characters who make poor choices because thats what tragic characters do that alone made it a giant stride forward at the timebr br in a modern context where strong and heroic africanamerican characters are less rare though still not common enough these characters seem nothing more nor less than human they truly could be poor and undereducated people of any ethnic backgroundbr br thorny politics aside the original work is undoubtedly one of the truly great achievements of american music and secondarily theater poitier davis dandridge peters and yes pearl bailey were all amazing performers who well never see the likes of again this less than perfect but still solid film clearly deserves to be seen and treasured
