i have always been a fan of this largely unseen filming of the gershwin opera since i last saw it in 1959 as many of you know it has been unavailable on video or dvd in fact the gershwin family sought to destroy all existing printsbr br yet for some reasonhopefully signaling an end to its opposition the gershwin family recently approved the showing of a collectors print at the museum of the moving image in astoria queens br br well the widescreen technicolor print was excellent not perfect but excellent the sound was outstanding in roadshow quality stereo the folks who saw this in its original release wouldnt have seen a much better copy the program notes include the original variety review which cautions that people might balk at the steep limitedrelease ticket price of 350br br and as much as i loved it originally porgy and bess was better than i remembered it its just wonderful sidney poitier as porgy was at the point where his career was just beginning to catch fire and his charisma shines through dorothy dandridge as bess is spectacularly beautiful brock peters as crown is aggressively masculine pearl bailey as maria provides a few comic moments although her role is small and sammy davis jr as sporting life steals every scene hes in hes especially riveting in his two big numbers it aint necessarily so and theres a boat thats leavin soon for new york that last one won applause in the screening i sawbr br porgy and bess is setbound but it really doesnt matter when the set is as gorgeous as this one the costumes are also outstandingbr br sidney and dorothys singing voices are dubbed in but they are dubbed in extremely well the exquisite summertime is sung by clara played by a young diahann carroll her singing also is dubbed actually only pearl and sammy do their own vocalizingbr br the music is sublime of course but what really struck me this time was how much emotion preminger got out of the story people were actually sniffling in the audience a number of timesonce when bess sings that beautiful i loves you porgy and i got a kick out of the audience actually laughing out loud at the lines in it aint necessarily so could it be they had never heard this song before or never really listened to it i believe that much of the emotional impact of this film is due to poiter and dandridges performancesyou root for their love to win outbr br a minor quibble with the 136 minute running timeone or two slow spot and a stereotypical amosnandy kind of scene about bess seeing a shyster lawyer to get a divorce from crown even though shes not even married to him i would have cut that and the beginning is a little confusingboth title characters are introduced awkwardlytheyre part of the movie before you realize who they arebr br and i dont think preminger used a single closeup in the entire movie it all seems to be shot in 34 which im guessing was his way of working with the wide screenbr br porgy and bess has always been a cult film for those of us who saw it for those of us who loved the soundtrack and for some of us who have only heard about it lets hope they find a way to rerelease this and put it out on dvd it deserves the widest audience possible
