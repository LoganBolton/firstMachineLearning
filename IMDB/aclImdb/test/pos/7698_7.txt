the plot of sally of the sawdust is the usual melodramatic stuff an orphan ragstoriches but the film rises above most silents thanks to three people br br this is not of course d w griffiths masterpiece but it does showcase his filmmaking savvy in full maturity he uses all his innovations which are techniques we take for granted now closeups crosscutting a mobile camera and the ability to modify acting from theatrical exaggeration to cinematic subtletybr br w c fields also showcases his skills not his signature gruff delivery but his remarkable dexterity as a physical comedian he does a few inventive juggling acts cut too short to be fully appreciated and some very deft pickpocketing but it seems that every prop that comes within reach gets manipulated for comic effect hat cane car roof dog cash hes a joy to beholdbr br finally theres carol dempster much has been said against this actress but her performance here is also richly comic she was 22 at the time playing a teenager and her approach to the role is a combination of grace and awkwardness that may not be wholly convincing but she truly engages the eye when shes on screen particularly when shes dancing shes not a beautythough shes positively luminous in the one scene where shes gussied up like a talmadge sister but her plainness only adds to sallys character especially in the many moments when she shows very obvious affection for fields as her guardianfather few if any hollywood performers could compete with fields when it came to comedy but griffith gives his leading lady every chance to match her costar and dempster absolutely holds her own
