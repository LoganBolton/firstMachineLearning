i suppose i like this film as well as any i know it is not perfect but under the title the americanization of lily this charming and memorable semimusical satire might i suggest have been appreciated more and still loved by those who recognized its special blake edwardsproduced spirit of gentleness clever humor and solid narrative the improbably but delightful storyline follows lili smith a fringetype spy for the germans in a much simpler and less blackandwhite war lili schmidt passing as smith is helping her uncle who is patriotic too for germany but neither cruel nor political merely opportunistic lilis target is william larrabee a charismatic us squadron leader who can supply her valuable information the plot thickens comes when lili falls in love with larrabee has her eyes opened to the consequences of her playing spy and sees the effects of combat on wounded men at a hospital and realizes what it might mean to his men whom she has met and likes she gets jealous of a rival for larrabees affections then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business the logical end of the film comes when after the terrible wwi has ended as she sings the theme song of the film wishing in a darkened theater one by one the members of larrabees squadron appear including her lover himself indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents and even uncle kurt enthusiastically joins in the singing of its a long to tipperraree to indicate all is well with the world again this is an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea written by director blake edwards and william peter blatty of john goldfarb fame and it is a delightful narrative larrabees squadron including an inebriate who keeps crashing and other lovable types populate this lively film and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic both in its scope and realization credit must go to jack bear and donald brooks for their costume creations reg allen and jack stevens for sets fernando carrere for another beautiful production design henry mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score and to russell harlan for his shining cinematography in the beautiful footage the principal actors are julie andrews as lili rock hudson as larrabee keremy kemp outstanding as lilis uncle kurt michael witney lance percival as the inebriate pilot gorgeous gloria paul as lilis stripteasing rival and many other fine actors in smaller parts it is hard to say enough nice things about the pace or the cleverness of the justthissideof broad comedy this element is introduced by edwards to leaven the horrors of actual warfare to example the almost comicopera approach with which men made war back in a more innocentminded era of human civilization this comedy also helps prepare the way for lilis conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the german state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing this is a rare senseoflife film about lilis americanization her assertion of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen it is haunting i find and beautiful in many ways i consider it to be blake edwardsmasterpiece of directing and under the title the americanization of lili i believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard i know
