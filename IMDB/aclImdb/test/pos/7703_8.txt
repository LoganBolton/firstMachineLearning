one of the most macabre depressing yet eyeopening docs ive watched in awhile theres no narration or story thats told just a third eye type camera following around 2 couples of heroin addicts in nyc through the seasons watching them shoot up on the floors of public washrooms then clean their needles in the public toilets sometimes its a bit too much and you need to hit pause just to go for a breatherbr br anyone currently in recovery of alcoholdrug addition should watch this when theyre craving  it really shows you to what you could be going back to after seeing this its a wonder how anyone could even try this drug to begin withbr br the only thing it needed was a follow up at the end to tell where these people are today judging from what is shown in the doc theres no hope for any of them they mention wanting to get better and quit but it seems the only end to their habits is to quit by way of dyingbr br this definitely isnt for all audiences i found myself kind of like watching a car accident  after i started watching it i just couldnt turn it off i had to keep watching with a darkmorbid fascination of what its like inside the lives of these addicts
