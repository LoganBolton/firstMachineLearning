this is one of nine shorts on the anime disk the animatrix it is my favorite the artwork is amazing the blackandwhite somewhat grainy texture perfectly captures the mood that the segment is trying to portray the story is tight and the ending is true to film noirbr br overall i gave the animatrix a 7 but this particular segment deserves a 10
