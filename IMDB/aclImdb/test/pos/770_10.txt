after seeing the harry potter movies ive been a fan of the trio actors rupert grint daniel radcliffe and emma watson yet weve been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides play the same characters year or every two years of the jk rowling series mainly instead of a trio the cameras and magazine articles concentrate more on daniel and emma being that theyre the leading male and only leading female in the saga leaving rupert deadend no matter every actor has a time to shine and ruperts light hits him for once in this moviebr br driving lessons is called the harold and maude of this generation with rupert grint playing the role of ben marshall a young british lad who lives with his domineering mother laura linney and a wimp of a vicar priest father for which he wants a job in the summer but cant find work while at the same time taking his driving tests and failing and writing poetry for a young girl who doesnt have any interest in himbr br ben seeks an ad in a church newspaper for which the job requires to take care of an elderly lady he takes the job and realizes that hes in for a fun of surprises as evie julie walters ruperts mother in the harry potter series an outofwork actress who is also a poet giving ben the run for his money they bond where and tell each other secrets along with evie acting like a child and getting into mischief where she drags ben along for a country road trip from their not only does ben drive all the way from britain to scotland since evie needs to recite at a local library but at the same time an older lady falls for the young man in which ben starts becoming a manbr br there is mishap and at the same time rejoice with ben and evie along with saying that i was very pleased about the film when it came out in theaters and i was impressed with rupert grints acting especially if he showed the rest of the world that even though he brings a bit of ron weasley within ben marshall theres no stopping the actor on his brilliant performance
