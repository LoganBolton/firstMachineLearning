ive seen three of the animatrix episodes and this is my favorite of all of them the second renaissance provided a flimsy back story to the already flimsy universe program was a stylistically impressive number it just felt kind of silly i guess what gives this one its special touch is the direction from shinichiro watanabe director of the incredibly popular and for good reason series cowboy bebop it has some of the best elements of bebop slick scifi adventure a nononsense slightly apathetic hero working for hire a bountyhead more or less and a chase scene all wrapped up in an excellent filmnoir packaging watanabes tarantinostyle slickness comes through here full throttle
