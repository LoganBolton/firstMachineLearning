my comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator the extra on the film and his unhappy assessment of the film i think his perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director the film was sweet the acting sufficient the experience of watching it a nice diversion from a busy work week it wasnt the hours acting or the matrix special effects or even the color purple direction most movies wont be but it also wasnt the crap fest that vinny would lead you to believe sorry guy just my 2 centsbr br as to the movie itself it was in the end very gay affirming  1 it showed a world full of diverse and less than perfect peopleyou know just like ours  2 it opened a door on one culture without excluding other cultures  3 and i liked the music  4
