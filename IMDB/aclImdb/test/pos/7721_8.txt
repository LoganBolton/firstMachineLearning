for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job we have to support the emerging industry especially coming from up north it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents the film has just opened i do hope it does well  people should support this little film i think this vinny person is very bitter about something and getting too personal shame i say well done to all those involvedhave a drink on me i look forward to you next venture
