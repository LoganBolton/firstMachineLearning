this movie is a quite fair adaptation of the prosper merimeés novel in the novel merimeé himself is a character don josé is from navarra north spain and historically a basque country zone they can speak basque language they are in seville andalusia south spain and they only speak spanish with andalusian accent in no way they speak basque but carmen explains to don josé that she was living in navarra you can believe it or not anyway this is the books version then you cant be critical with the movie about this be with the book you have to note are different the novel by merimeé and the opera by bizet and this movie is an adaptation from the novel anyway in the opera don josé is still spanish from navarra never hes french why so many people keep thinking don josé is french i dont know but i guess because the novel and the opera are in french although is supposed to be in spanishbr br the only important difference between the movie and the novel is that in the movie don josé also kills the torero lover of carmen and in the novel he doesnt neither in the opera i guess they wanted to keep the movie a little more gore i think the movie is quite good anyway
