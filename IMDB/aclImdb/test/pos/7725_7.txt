this is a nice movie with good performances by paz vega and leonardo sbaraglia  of course vicente aranda is a legend in spanish cinema and surely one of the great directors in spanish cinema but i dont think this is one of his greatest movies even if its fine the screenplay plays with the introduction of merime√© as a character  its a nice touch but its unbelievable the music is composed by jose nieto  national spanish prize in cinema i mean this movie is very good in all the technical aspects there are very good actors in supporting roles like antonio dechent  maria botto and others  i give it 7 out of 10 cause i think this could be a better movie but as it is it is not boring at all
