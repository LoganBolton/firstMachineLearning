cheers to all the wonderful fans of this film that have not only seen and appreciate it but based on the many literate comments actually get it i for one have always considered paul mazurskys tempest a musing on the shakespeare play of the same name as has been noted in a few of the other reviews here on the other hand if youre looking for a more straightforward adaptation of the play you should look elsewhere as an experiment however it succeeds just spectacularly charming moving funny sad dramatic  its all of that and much more cast locations script music are just fantastic cassavetes and rowland were never better susan sarandons turn more than hinted at the great work to come from her in the future molly ringwald makes her film debut memorable and you just have to love raul julias performance  he steals the show in several scenes whats more the always great cassavetes was confident and assured enough a performer to have let him a study on what the thematic elements of shakespeares classic might be life if updated into more modern times mazurskys tempest burns brilliantly
