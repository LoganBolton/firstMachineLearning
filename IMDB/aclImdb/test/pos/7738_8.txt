i love this movie despite the fact it just misses being great its an adult entertainment full of issues that a grown person can relate to the acting is superb its fun watching john cassavetes and gena rowlands as a feuding middleaged couple who knows how much of it came from their own marriage susan sarandon has never been sexier or more appealing than as her freewheeling character aretha raul julia is a hoot as a lusty goatherd the scenery in greece is spectacular the new york settings cause me to squirm due to many shots of the world trade center fantastic score by stomu yamashta with so many things going for it why isnt this a great film its a bit rambling and overly long unfocused and uncomfortably imbalanced between humor and drama still its engaging entertaining and deeply thoughtful
