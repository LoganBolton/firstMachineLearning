ive often heard people express disappointment that mazurskys tempest has little to do with shakespeares original in my opinion that is both true and false but most of all its a bad starting point for offering critique a work of art should never be criticised for what it isnt but for what it is the movie tempest is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play but to my mind it is faithful to shakespeares work in spirit what tempest is then is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time no not experimental as in hand held camera and mumbled dialogue but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue regard for box office earnings mazurskys tempest is epic sad realistic joyous full of life but most of all it is imaginative cassavetes portrayal of philipprospero is in itself worth a 1010 rating and when you add gena rowlands susan sarandon a wonderfully deep molly ringwald raul julia the dialogue the music and the exquisitely suggestive little tableaux scattered throughout the picture i rest my case one of the best movies of the 80s dont miss it
