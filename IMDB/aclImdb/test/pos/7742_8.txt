i cant say what knowing the source for this movie adds but this is one of my favorite films from paul mazursky director and coauthor this is a retake on the shakespeare comedy but utterly removed from the stage without much text mazursky and star cassavettes make visual a midlife crisis of passion and purpose desperate to recenter himself cassavettes retreats to a remote greek islandwhere the locals and the island itself weave a little magic with raul julia especially susan sarandon and molly ringwald this is an adult fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually gorgeous and funny it wasnt a big box office hit but whenever it does come to dvd it will sell
