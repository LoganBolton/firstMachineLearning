i have no words to really describe this seriesbr br the premise behind this concept a highly hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality which ends up whirling up a team of oddballs into her own rendering of the world which after all was a creation of haruhi since she wants a world with aliens espers and time travelers is a breath of fresh air in a world ridden with repetitive anime series and non innovative tv showsbr br characters are well developed and you will end up loving them some less than others the word to describe the animation job does not exist since excellent would really fall short to describe how was done there are many funny situations which either will make you smile or put you into deep thoughts dont fall for the impression of the first episode since thats only the tip of the iceberg as the novels are yet to comebr br the only problem comes due to the lack of chronological order in the episodes but you can solve that problem no br br conclusion unquestionably one of the best series of 2006
