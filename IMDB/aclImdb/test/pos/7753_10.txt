on the surface tmhs appears to be yet another generic high school drama but surprisingly hidden away underneath is immense amounts of depth originality and eccentricities that will not only render it unforgettable to the viewer but also makes it indisputably one of the best animes that the medium has produced in the last few yearsbr br we see the world through the eyes of kyon who on his first day of high school meets haruhi suzumiya a girl that boldly claims to the rest of the class she has no interest in normal humans and to top it off casually invites any aliens time travellers sliders or espers to meet up with her kyon stares in disbelief wondering if shes joking or has a few screws loose however defying his gut instincts he begins talking to her in doing so it soon becomes apparent she isnt some ordinary high schooler not to long after she creates her own aptly named sos brigade school club and drags kyon amongst other highly unfortunate people to attendbr br nothing in this anime conforms to the usual standard conventions kyon the protagonist is an overly cynical pessimist and contributes a witty narration to the show a farcry from the usual 2d male leading characters that tends to populate the medium the episodes themselves are not chronologicaland forces the viewer to think about the events unfolding and how they relate to prior instances this is a stroke of genius the effect is like a jigsaw puzzle as a new piece is layed we get more of a sense of the bigger picture previous scenes are now given entire new meanings and the realization of them are profoundly satisfying this does mean however that it feels disjointed its anything but a very cleverly written script has bypassed this problem and ensured that it flows smoothly from start to finishbr br the story itself is strikingly original but i wont delve further than the simple barebones plot outline i gave earlier as it will no doubt spoil it for you however what i will mention is the plot incorporates a vast array of genres ranging from comedy to scifi how they managed to accomplish this in the space of fourteen episodes is beyond me and no doubt a huge achievement in itselfbr br tmhs is a true gem which has such diversity and depth that it will appeal to pretty much anyone with an interest in anime watch it rather unusually this is something that lives up to the enormous hype that it has received and even exceeds it
