from the get go you wont be able to look away and you wont want to the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya suzumiya haruhi no yuutsu is one of the most entertaining animes ive seen in a long time if you can look away from the insane and sometimes perverse humor its easy to find a brilliantly constructed and masterfully executed workbr br part of the brilliance comes from the fact that the episodes are not in chronological order so you may not understand some of the things they talk about at first but as the series progresses youll find yourself saying ah so thats what they meant even though this might confuse some people after watching the show youll be hard pressed to make a case against telling the story in this fashionbr br after all the focus is on the characters the title character haruhi suzumiya is by far one of the most eccentric heroines of any anime ever her opening speech to her class in which she declares she is not interested in normal humans and is searching for espers aliens and time travelers is absolutely bizarre but shes lovable that waybr br then theres kyon the normal guy who is pulled into the madness surrounding suzumiyasan hes the narrator and his quick wit always makes the scene that much more entertaining he finds himself caught in the middle of various factions all trying to influence haruhi suzumiya and the other three characters are representatives of these factions ironically they are the very beings haruhi is searching for and yet they cannot reveal themselves to herbr br the first is yuki nagato a quiet girl who happens to be the only member of the school literary club and also a representative of the integration thought entity she is basically an alien though the best description of her is a computer program in a human body her purely emotionless responses make her comically deadpan and always make you think theres more than meets the eye then theres mikuru asahina the time traveler who happens to be incredibly cute a major ditz and the subject of suzumiyas plans to advertise her club the sos brigade to the world the end result is that suzumiya does things to her that border on sexual harassment making her dress up in fetish uniforms the final character is koizumi itsuki the timid and perpetually optimistic philosopher who happens to be haruhis esper though he can only use his powers in certain conditionsbr br the end result of all these characters is a comedy unlike any other that is both crude and deep and always brilliant dont believe me watch the first episode their student film youll see what i mean
