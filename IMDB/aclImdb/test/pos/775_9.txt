i watched this film on itv and i enjoyed it a lot it was very watchable and very funny julie walters and rupert grint were perfect in their roles julie walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch bens character is kinda shy and stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by rupert grint i would definitely say he has a future in acting after harry potterbr br laura linney is quite good in her role as bens over protective mother the only thing they went wrong with is by making her toovillainy bens father was also an interesting contrast to his mother and in the end he is quite honourable too the only character i wasnt keen on was bryony she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thoughtbr br overall this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch one of my favourite films of the year easily
