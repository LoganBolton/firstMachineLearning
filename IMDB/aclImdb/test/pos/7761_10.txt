suzumiya haruhi no yuuutsu is a very highrated anime in almost every review page youll find on the web so i really wanted to know why and i was anything but disappointedbr br if you can get past the very bizarre but rather funny first episode youll find yourself in a very entertaining and much strange world a very well drawn perfectly animated world that isbr br i cant tell much of the story without spoiling it so ill just say that its a high school comedy and yet its not i cant really say what its about reallybr br seriously im a huge anime fan and ive got around 50 full series and im not kidding when i say that even though i havent finished watching haruhi suzumiya it is actually standing in a very high rank in my personal collection i fell in love at first sight with this one and i assure you that at the very least you wont be indifferent to its irresistible charm trust me i dont go around giving a 10 to every thing that i watch
