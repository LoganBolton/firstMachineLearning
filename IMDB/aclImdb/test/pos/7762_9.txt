okay let me start off by saying that on the whole i dont like anime very much ive enjoyed a couple of the oftcited classic series but regard the medium as a whole in exactly the same way that i do american television namely that a good 9095 of it is utter tripe with the remainder falling anywhere from watchable to decent this being the case its no wonder that i dont like the selfdeprecating anime parodies out there i dont get most of the jokes and the medium itself enforces a certain style of humor that doesnt appeal to me at all  loud hyperactive lowbrow and completely over the topbr br so when i started watching this series at the behest of a friend i was primed for disappointment after the first couple of episodes i figured that the characters were supposed to represent clich√© characters from shopworn story outlines and that their actions were supposed to be similarly satirical i could kind of see where it was coming from but didnt think that it was all that clever  lots of wacky funfilled highschool shenanigans and goingson only now were being ironic about it at about the third episode my opinion drastically changedbr br it was at that point that the strengths of this series started to manifest themselves the quirks of the nonchronological episode order its snarky sense of selfawareness and above all clever humor with gasp a wellexecuted straight manbr br in what i consider to be a rarity in any medium this show presents wellthought out witty interactions between diametrically opposed characters protagonist kyons perpetual sense of vaguely annoyed resignation provides the perfect foil to the actions of title character haruhis generic animelike exploits its a break from formula and it works incredibly wellbr br based on that strong foundation the series further succeeds with a truly phenomenal level of attention to detail as previously stated the episodes air out of chronological order i considered this to be a gimmick at first but it works surprisingly well the chronological sequence of events makes sense logically but the aired order of the episodes more closely follows the traditional structure of aristotelian drama the order chosen leaves no narrative gaps that cannot be filled by simple inference but while it is possible to guess what happened in an unaired preceding episode one still feels compelled to watch exactly how those events unfold and superb planning prevents any plot holes or contradictions i watched this series a second time immediately upon completing it the first time and i was amazed at how well even seemingly inconsequential events were all tied togetherbr br the last point is indicative of the extreme attention to detail in every area of the series while the stock anime character designs grate a bit the background art is exquisite realistically rendered based upon actual photographic references animation quality is also excellent at important points for example there is a musical performance late on in the series in which the characters are shown actually playing a song  this may sound trivial but the subconscious effect of watching filmquality animation which actually corresponds to the soundtrack is incrediblebr br in short i love this series for some reason by its very nature it is something that i generally dislike but its execution is so unique and wellcarried out that i cant help it
