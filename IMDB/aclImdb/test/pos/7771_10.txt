i have watched love jones over thirty times it is one of the rare films that depict a love story about people who happen to be africanamericans the dialogue was realistically written and delivered with honesty it was so nice to see a film where the story line centered on young professional africanamericans this is virtually an untapped market love jones was visually captivating as well the chemistry between lorenz tate and nia long will bring memories of past and present love the feeling of the film is jazz and blues and brings to mine the sensuality of a warm creamy hot chocolate with a splash of kahlua and butterscotch if you hadnt guessed i loved it
