love jones cleverly portrays young africanamerican men and women in a clear positive realistic sense i feel that all of the actors and actresses were magnificent and really did a great job at capturing the mood nia long and larenz tate worked well together and i hope to see more work from the two of them as a matter of fact all of the actorsactresses did such a fine job it would be great to see another romanticcomedy from them this movie can be compared to most any wellwritten romantic comedy if you have not seen this movie already i strongly recommend that you do it can definitely give you another perspective on life and love
