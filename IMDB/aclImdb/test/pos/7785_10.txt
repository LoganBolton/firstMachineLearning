according to me a movie can be best rated by the number of best scenes there are there are probably at least 8090 scenes in the whole movie that is probably rated as best by somebody or the otherbr br this movie is a masterpiece period i know many who have called it ahead of its time probably because it bombed at boxoffice however i think any generation can relate to this movie and have a good laugh through outbr br i am personally glad that mahmood is part of the movie too his role isnt that meaty however its good to see that he is a part of the cast in the funniest hindi movie ever
