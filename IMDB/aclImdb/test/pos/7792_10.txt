i watched this movie probably more than 20 times the jokes are now 1015 years old but every time i watch it it makes me fall off my chair two of the finest actor salman khan and aamir khan plays the lead roles here even if aamir khan is a much better actor and got the better rolesmart guy in the movie salman khan matches and sometimes perform even better as the dumb guy all the characters are memorable this movie is filled with hilarious oneliners and funny situationsa little too silly probably dont try to look for logic in this movie let your brain relax for some time i promise it will be an experience to remember
