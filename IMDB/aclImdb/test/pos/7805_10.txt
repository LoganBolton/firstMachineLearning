there are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be boxoffice failures andaz apna apna an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that catogory for once an indian director has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience and not churned out a kader khan type stereotypical hoax the movie is about two guys who dream of riches and try to accomplish that by wooing a millionaires daughter a humorous drama unfolds while a lot of complexities surface in the story the complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot aamir khan plays the a streetsmart guy while salman khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy the villian played by paresh rawaland his henchmen junior ajit and kaliaa make you laugh in your sleep although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies despite shoddy camerawork and despite being loud at times it remains one of the scarce funny movies bombay has come up with after movies like padosan golmal and other amol plaekar movies it is sad that it didnt do well at the boxoffice for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity is abandoned
