i cant disagree with a previous comment that driving lessons is more than a little twee but one mans indictment is anothers endorsement i suppose in my book this film succeeds on pure charm no small feat in itselfbr br i cant help but wish the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it but by the end the plot seems more like a backdrop for the character interactions anyway julie walters dame evie is a gloriously over the top and over the hill actress though evie hasnt had steady work in years its unclear the last time she visited reality if ever think edina from abfab at 65 at one point she is even forced to come to grips with her kitschfactor some may find her annoying but i think thats the point to emphasize just how much she pushes the reserved bens rupert grint buttons to force him out of his shell ben is equally isolated from reality living his whole life under the thumb of his overly dependent mother who laura linney manages to breath some life into despite being a fairly onedimensional character ye olde overbearing religious mom i was rather impressed with rupert grint who i found to give a very honest and believable performance not to mention sweet as all getout i cant think of many teen actors today for whom i can say thatbr br the heart of the movie is what happens when ben and evies worlds collide at first ben is understandably tentative but also intrigued as evie is essentially the exact opposite of everything hes ever known with the combination of evies persistence and bens helpful nature a genuine sweetness develops between them culminating in an unlikely road trip that gives ben his first real taste of independencebr br the tone is consistently light even through a few brief melodramatic bits but there was still a surprising amount of emotional resonance a credit to the main actors all in all id say that if youre willing to sit back and let yourself be charmed by some lovely performances driving lessons shouldnt disappoint however if cute is not in your movie vocabulary best to stay awaybr br one other minor note the soundtrack features the music of sufjan stevens prominently a nice touch
