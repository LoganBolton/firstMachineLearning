this movie fully deserves to be one of the top hindi comedies ever made  rajkumar santoshi is mostly known for his gritty hardhitting social dramas  but this is easily the most effortless movie he has made br br the plot revolves around two smalltown buffoons amar aamir khan and prem salman khan  they want to get rich quick and so move to the big city  they hatch the same plan separately  to woo a rich heiress raveena raveena tandon who is the daughter of a rich businessman ramgopal bajaj paresh rawal  thus the one who marries raveena gets his hands on all her wealth  but when they get to know each others plan  there is an intense tussle of oneoneupmanship over who marries raveena  hilarious gags and situations ensue as the battle rages on br br at the same time ramgopal bajajs identical twin brother shyamgopal bajaj wants to eliminate his brother and niece and usurp the family fortune  add to this an assortment of funny characters including a raveenas maid karishma karishma kapoor  a mistakeprone butler named robert vijoo khote  a manager named bhalla shehzad khan who mimics yesteryears villain ajeet and a funny gangster gogo shakti kapoor who looks more like a pirate and a rollicking comedy awaits you br br do not waste your time looking for logic in the movie  leave the company of your brains and just enjoy  the actors are so much in sync with the script that no room is left for mistakes  dialogues rajkumar santoshi  dilip shukla are witty  music tushar bhatia and lyrics majrooh sultanpuri are memorable  the picturization and choreography saroj khan of yeh raat aur yeh doori  ae lo ji sanam and dil karta hai tere paas aaoon is fitting and will remain etched in my mind forever br br the film starred two superstarsinthemaking  aamir khan and salman khan they eventually became superstars  aamir khan is impeccable in his first allout comedy role  i salute his sense of comic timing  salman pales in comparison with aamir but is still likable  among the supporting characters  paresh rawal stands out in his dual role of ramgopal and shyamgopal br br the movie surprisingly failed at the box office  i fail to understand why  i recommend it to all nevertheless
