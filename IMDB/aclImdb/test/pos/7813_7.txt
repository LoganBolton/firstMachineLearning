i found this to be an underrated quietly compelling spaghetti western also known as dead or alive despite modest credentials apart from multipurpose cowriterproducer albert band the only notable crew member is composer carlo rustichelli the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three american stars newcomer alex cord is an ambiguous antihero while veterans arthur kennedy and robert ryan lend a mythic quality to the proceedings as well as the unusual plot involving a crippled protagonist an amnesty ruse covering a strategic cleanup of the town and which has the law finally siding with the gunfighter against a horde of mexican banditsbr br there are several tough action scenes on hand  the film is capped by a terrific climax in which the star trio is besieged inside a blazing cabin  plus a couple of outrageous moments which are something of a spaghetti western trademark from the middle of the street cord sees a hidden gunman at a window reflected in a whiskey bottle a man who helps cord escape is repeatedly immersed in a pool of oil by the villains nicoletta machiavelli also makes a nice impression as a village girl with whom cord lodges the supporting cast then is peppered with familiar if largely anonymous faces  all of them essentially genre fixturesbr br i wasnt aware of the fact that the englishdubbed version of the film on mgmuas r1 dvd was cut i was fooled by the wrong runningtime being listed on the backcover the film was only 99 minutes long and not 118  apparently cords character is killed in the longer italian version
