a minute to pray a second to die is a quality spaghetti western with a solid cast and an interesting storyline it is filmed beautifully with a relatively high production value for a film in this genrebr br alex cord does a terrific job portraying clay mccord an outlaw who is suffering from increasingly debilitating seizures he is seeking amnesty before his enemies close in on him but is being too cocky for his own good when he asks for it robert ryan delivers the best performance in the film as the governor of new mexico mario brega and arthur kennedy are also great herebr br this movie is very good but it doesnt stand out to me as being one of the best spaghetti westerns out there its lacking too much in style to be in the same league as any of the great ones it does have some cool spaghetti overtones but overall its a bit too much like an american western this is especially evident in the music score which is ok as movies go in general but pretty dull by eurowestern standards the soundtrack kind of reminds me of the music from the unforgiven although there is an interesting story here it is told in a manner which is a bit too conventional for my tastes if a spaghetti western fan and a hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together this one would be the perfect compromisebr br all of this is not to say that anyone should avoid this film i did enjoy watching it very much as i said it is a very welldone film and i recommend it to anyone who likes westerns spaghetti or otherwise
