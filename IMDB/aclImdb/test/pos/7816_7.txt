the cast alone tells you this will be a notch above the usual italian western veteran actors robert ryan and arthur kennedy team up with alex cord who at the time seemed on the verge of stardom the result is a movie thats both offbeat and downbeat and yet itll satisfy those who seek more from a western than just gunplay especially interesting here is the character played by alex cord one expects the hero in these westerns to be taciturn and introspective but clay mccord is an extreme example and surprisingly enough hes often shone in a passive even weak position much is made of the fact that he fears falling prey to the epileptic fits which immobilized his father and in these moments of helplessness hes either at the mercy of those who wish to harm him or those who wish to help him to emphasize his passivity clay mccord  dont you love that name  is often shone stripped to the waist as if he were little more than an attractive plaything being put on display theres even a strong masochistic streak in his nature most in evidence when hes used as a punching bag by his enemies and then suspended by his wrists and left hanging above the middle of a street not only does he often fail to protect himself but mccord is equally ineffective in protecting those around him nearly everyone who helps him is killed br br while a minute to pray a second to die is far from being a complete success it has a depth and a tone which sets it apart and causes it to linger in the memory its also a good showcase for alex cord whose career tended to decline after this point following a few promising years in the mid1960s he must have been about 36 years old when he filmed this  in his physical prime  and the scene of him hanging by his wrists barechested and sweaty is a memorable piece of cinematic beefcake
