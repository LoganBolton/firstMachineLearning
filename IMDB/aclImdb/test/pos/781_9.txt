i saw this tonight with moderate expectations  if tartan films have picked up on something and are releasing it the thats generally a good sign however im not normally a fan of julie walters generally disliking her comedy roles sorry to any fans but its a personal thing  i just dont find her funny in comedybr br this was magnificent though  a great performance by all but grint and walters are exceptional plenty of laughs plenty of pathos great timing and a wonderfully paced film  such a coming of age film wouldnt normally be something id expect to like so much but i cant recommend this highly enough  and watch rupert grint as he matures into a fine fine actor
