snakes on a plane was such a well hyped film that it was both inevitable and a little crazy to try to release another movie with almost the same title in the same year let alone the same week reading the other comments here i see the results a lot of people are mad mad because it doesnt have the best special effects mad because it doesnt have a star cast mad because they wanted to see samuel jackson say im sick of these mer fing snakes on this mer fing train br br well this sure aint the samuel jackson version and maybe thats goodbr br snakes on a plane was lost between cop film and horror a family action film and a bloody gory movie of death saturday night live performers got laughs while jackson swore enough to make a grandmother cover her ears and as far as kids go they would be traumatized by the violencebr br snakes on a train however knew exactly what it was this was a cheaply made horror movie on a train sure it had snakes and sure many of them were scientifically harmless garden snakes with fake rattler sound effects but never once did it miss a step in its plot or intention where as the on a plane version was tripping all over itself from the first scene onbr br i did enjoy the over the top fun that snakes on a plane had to offer and i admit that the on a train version was a little dry but hey in trade it was a cool and unexpected story this little horror film could have gone way more wrong than it didbr br for this it gets a 7 out of 10
