forget everything that you have ever read about the mallachi brothers straighttovideo release snakes on a train especially if it was a negative review this movie is way more fun than the movie that it obviously rips off snakes on a plane frankly i am surprised that more people arent rhapsodizing about this lowbudget asylum release instead most reviews that ive read have nothing kind or critically worthwhile to say except the usual stupid herd mentality idiocy such as the acting was amateurish the action didnt numerically live up to the advertising and the entire thing amounted to a hideous waste of time of course it doesnt help that the title is a tipoff to the obvious ripoff nature of this film actually i felt that snakes on a train surpassed snakes on a plane for a number of reasonsbr br first the producers used real genuine snakes until the last fifteen minutes when they substituted either giant fake snake heads or computer generated a supergiant snake that consumed an entire amtrak like train how many movies have a snake gobble a train as a result snakes on a train ranks as the first movie to scale that heightbr br second this lowbudget movie employs some grisly grossout effects the woman who coughs up baby snakesreal oneswas fantastic the special effects of her forearms getting tore up later in the movie were visually enticing also you get to see a little white girl get eaten alive by a snake she was as cute as she could be no more than 10 years old or thereabouts and she died screaming all the way as nasty ol√© giant mister snake head swallows her not only kids in jeopardy but kid eaten this is exactly the kind of graphic material that you wont find in 99  of all theatrical hollywood releases of course she wasnt eaten by a real snake but its the subversive thought that countsbr br third it is one of those cursed upon movies where alma julia ruiz of that guy the chief female characterno heroinehas a curse placed on her by her parents because she didnt marry the man that they recommended as a result she is filled with snakes coughs up quantities of green radiator fluid slop then chucks up a baby snake imagine medusa the mythical characters that had snakes for hair only with the snakes in her belly her psychoshaman type boyfriend collects all the snakes that come out of her because they are heading to la on a train to see a relative of his who can put all the snakes back inside of her and return her to normal talk about a whacked out character performing stomach churning routines prepare yourself for lots of slime blood and gore br br fourth the train had only about twenty or so passengers not hundreds nevertheless it looked like the mallachi brothers filmed this aboveaverage horror flick onboard a real train with real snakes and they played up the swaying motion of the train on the tracksbr br fifth the snakes slither around for the first hour quietly infiltrating the train before they turn weird and attack everybody in other words its suspense suspense suspense before people start dying from snake bitesbr br up until the last five minutes when the snake grows bigger than the runaway train and swallows it snakes on a train is warped wonderful and wayout it doesnt have the attention deficit editing of a big league hollywood movie its a fantasy about an unfortunate hispanic women victimized because of her feminist atoddswithsociety attitude br br altogether youve got gory fantasy type stuff suspenseful snakes slithering around the train and am overthetop gigantic snake at the end incidentally they get on board the train because a bunch of other mexicans have bribed a train employee and the mexicans on board think that the girl is so cute that they let her and her boyfriend on freebr br i think its better than snakes on a plane if you want a tough little independently produced horror movie
