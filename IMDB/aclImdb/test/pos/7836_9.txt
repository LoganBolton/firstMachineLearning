forget some the whiny and pointless comments left here by some this series is well acted well shot and makes a refreshing change to most of the pap on tvbr br any fool can nitpick anything however in this show the characters are believable the story lines intriguing and compelling but do require some intelligence on the part of the viewer overall its enjoyable and its british  we do occasionally come up with some gems and this is one of thembr br the shows are an hour long each and i think there are four of them all together at least ive only seen four of them the show clearly impressed some us tv stationdirector who made a longer series which was nowhere near as compelling in spite of the bigger budgetbr br if like soaps and reality shows you wont like or understand eleventh hour
