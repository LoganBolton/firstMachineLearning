the beguiled is one of those underseen films in the careers of a director or actor that ends up playing better than expected in the same year that clint eastwood and don siegel collaborated on dirty harry they also worked together on this little psychosexual drama set in civil war era confederacy country its almost a 180 from what harry had for audiences here is a film that is under the radar and with a lowbudget to almost no business when compared with what dirty harry pulled in it is also a story where eastwood is not surrounded in a world full of dangerous men but women who despite their first appearances have darker sides to them and theres even romance in it in between some of the rougher and more complex scenes but in this kind of framework to make the film siegel therefore actually has a little more freedom to do things with the style of the picture that roams into something more european im reminded here and there of polanskis work in the 60s it all works though pretty well even with the initial doubt that these two figures of masculine filmmaking eastwood the obvious and siegel having made his niche in bnoir and lowbudget thrillers can pull off material that could possibly be made for a lifetime moviebr br it was also captivating and really darkly comic here and there to see eastwoods performance working off of these girls hes doing something a little subversive in his performance by still having the sort of eastwood machismo if there is such a thing close to his clich√©d movie image by being a step ahead of this little school for young women at times and not at others to see eastwood in a performance like this as with play misty for me the other eastwood work of 1971 shows how cool he can act believably with very good actresses particularly here are the four main female characters each of varying ages and each with varying attractions to their yankee man while siegels work directing all of the actors has its moments in the first half its really once the story crosses the halfway mark in the dream sequence less successful than the director could be capable of that the real juicy scenes start to pick up a lot of this is the best that siegel directed dramatically pushing the psychological and emotional edges of scenes where not expectedbr br its a difficult film all of this praise aside as it doesnt paint anyone as being too respectable only the character of hallie the slave on duty played by mae mercer is sort of separated from what transpires between the alltoocurious women and mcburney along with this eastood here is acting in a role that is and isnt what hes usually seen as during this time of his true formative years in the movies hes an antihero here which was his trademark of the westerns and other thrillers he was doing at the time but unlike those films hes not really in a mode where hes larger than life to put it in a way as he is both deserter and womanizer deceiver and tricky even in his most charming and affable moments if its not one of his best acting jobs which is hard to really put together considering his catalog it is one that is worth a look for fans who might want to see another side of him its a credit to him but also to what clicked with his collaborations with siegel as they both took chances at this time in hollywood
