during the civil war a wounded union soldier hides out in a isolated confederate ladies school where the head mistress and the teacher of the school decide to care for him and keep him about until trouble starts brewing between the lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls the soldier decides to take advantage of this situation but it all comes at a price in the end br br dirty harry 1971 which was made about the same time of the beguiled might be my favourite collaboration between eastwood and siegel but after seeing this i tend to think this to be the pairs finest work together a very atypical savvy and stylish vehicle for eastwood is always on the mark with richly controlled direction by don siegel and a hauntingly rousing music score by lalo schifrin standing out strongly is its sultrily lurid and bleak nature thats intrusively planted into the films psychological makeup and manipulative strangle hold in sexual depravity its assiduously played out and makes it more the brooding and blood curdling when those random shocks and saucy intentions take hold with gripping tension the way siegel illustrates john b sherry and grimes grices alluring bold slowburn screenplay taken from the novel of thomas cullinan is effectively done through stark emotions and the scripts tight lyrical context siegels strong direction captures the idyllically southern victorian setting with such potently garnished photography and he sets up some strangely piercing imagery with great clarity and restrained br br while the performances are truly commendable and high of quality clint eastwood as the smoothly suave sweet talking chameleon union soldier is very impressionable and delightfully assured a profoundly eminent geraldine page steals the picture as the hardened head mistress and the elegant elizabeth hartman adds a delicate sincereness to her innocent character mae mercer is strongly tailored as the black maid and jo ann harris is the pick of the crop from the young pupils with her seductively sly persona br br honestly while eastwoods charismatic character plays the field for his own selfish needs theres still mixed intentions there that the ones being played where rivalry between the women creep in turn out to be no better than their guest at the end throughout theres a perversely dark sense of humour and ironic touch settling into the material whats demonstrated here is simply more than your basic little minded shocker but one thats thickly layered with intrigue and a sense of realism thats hard to shake that also goes for its extremely eerie title and closing song br br a effectively chilling lowkey item thats hard not to be tempted by its swinging hospitality
