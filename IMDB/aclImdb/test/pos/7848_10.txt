let us assume for a moment that you havent experimented with the psychotropic mushroom and youre wondering about the so called bad experience and just how something like that might play itself outÂ… well go ahead and pop in a fresh copy of the beguiled see with film you have your clean trips solaris and anything else directed by andrei tarkovsky whack trips ie the experiencefromwhichyouneverrecover sweet movie and el topo and youre bad organic trips a category specifically reserved for a film like the beguiled which is the sort of content those keen writers at the times who made all the right decisions with their lives and graduated from the harvard department of english refer to as hallucinogenic in tone by the third act of this don siegel directed movie you may not exactly observe that your two leadheavy hands have become shrunken and assume all the characteristics of a burrowing insectivorous mammal nor will you exactly fall under the suspicion that your spine has achieved the same sinuous shape and knotty texture of a pomaceous fruit baring tree incalculable in age but you will feel somethingbr br in 1970 when this film was filmed most americans were looking for an anodyne for their collective pain a movie like the graduate perhaps a lot of worldendism was going on and of course you had the nightmare break down of war in vietnam what you get with the beguiled banal drug metaphors aside is a screenplay adapted from a novel by a guy who at least for the moment wanted to be known as grimes grice and direction from the director who helped bring about the work and career of sam peckinpah in the beguiled donny siegel born in 12 chicago il less than 45 years after the great fire is showing his attempt at grappling with all that contemporary cultural madness of the early 1970s in the form of a classical film artifact the beguiled is an incredible film and an outstanding contribution to the cinematographic arts in almost every aspect the shooting editing direction and story are all fantastic and youre not likely to see anything else like it undoubtedly a sinister film its effects as ive said both dizzying and adulterating frankly its hard to believe would ever universal attached its name to this picture but you are going to see upon viewing some of the sweet sweet camera moves and cinematographer bruce surtees exploiting every bit of dark myth you harbor in your head about the american plantation south conflating beauty with evil in every location shot clint eastwood needless to say has never been like this old clint he moves at instant from coy to livid his eyes like two archimedean spirals in medium close up the rest of the cast is equally exacting and uncannybr br this beguiled will never make the afi 100 in my lifetime but that doesnt stop me from positing that its one of the best american synch sound films ever made while most people catalogue it as a western to include the folks at the western channel the beguiled is a problem because you dont really know what it is a sort of war movie a drama psychological thriller maybe the answer to all those emotionally wrought noir films starring kirk douglas i actually call this piece a horror film because when my old man who likes to kick back with the cheap gratuitous violence projected in entertainments like the wire saw that high angle medium long shot of geraldine page wrapping a tourniquet around clints bloody leg pa was pretty quick to suggest we watch something else like the outback bowl right before he absconded to another room my advice watch this one and make sure it is on a very large screen preferably run on that dpl home theater projector youre contemplating i would put the beguiled right on order along with that important consumer purchase turn the overheads out throw some cinematic light up on the big blank wall and try not to lose your grip because just like norman bates we all go a little mad sometimes even the beguiled
