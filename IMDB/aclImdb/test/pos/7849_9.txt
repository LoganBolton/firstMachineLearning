the beguiled was one of the few early eastwood films i hadnt seen until i gave the dvd a spin today and from its opening sepiatinged shot to the macabre climax i was utterly enthralled too many filmmakers these days substitute special effects fast editing and dizzying camerawork in place of characterdriven stories but director don siegel knew how to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot and the characters are believable and compellingbr br the story concerns a ladies finishing school which happens to be situated on the edge of various skirmishes during the american civil war the southsupporting ladies find a badly wounded union soldier clint eastwood nursing him back to health he begins to manipulate the sexually frustrated women for his own endsbr br geraldine page is excellent in the role of the headmistress with a secret and her descent into madness is subtly conveyed for a film that virtually takes place in a single location it never loses visual interest theres even a chance that the normal status quo long abandoned when eastwoods machinations are uncovered could return but the mistresses and pupils descend upon a darker roadbr br this is a totally different style of film from the same directors dirty harry made in the same year and yet they are both equally superb eastwood is great playing against his usual stoic antihero image yet theres also some mysterious quality attached to his character we never really learn much about him prior to his incarceration and the viewer is free to decide upon his wellshaded persona villain or victim whatever you think all i can say is that i thoroughly enjoyed it
