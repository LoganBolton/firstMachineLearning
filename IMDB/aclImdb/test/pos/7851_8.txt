i was amazed about this early performance of clint eastwood i had not read a summary of the film when i decided to watch it on tv due to mr eastwood i expected some nice shootings and no deep story i was quite mistaken i found a couple of topics unusually explicitly addressed and until the end i couldnt make up my mind about whos good and whos bad this movie is definitely not typical eastwood but surely worth watching
