clint eastwood plays a wounded union soldier found by a girl from a confederate boarding school and hes taken in and nursed back to health instead of turned over to confederate soldiers seems that the womenfolk at this place have ulterior motives geraldine paige the headmistress justifies not turning him into the confederacy and even passes him off as her cousin of course when the man gets to feeling better he becomes quite the ladys man and is pretty much making the rounds but when he gets busted he really gets busted in fact so badly he gets his leg cut off but its for his own good of course not out of retribution things get carried a bit further though when certain women dont get what they want i havent seen this for years and it still has a certain creepiness to it that by todays standards is still pretty strange not typical eastwood at all if you havent seen this one its worth seeing 8 out of 10
