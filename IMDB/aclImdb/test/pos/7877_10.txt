oh man  this movie is amazing its very good its a story about a man who isnt so accepting of black people he sits at a bar drinks on his night out and he rants about hippies who are antiwar  and how blacks and hippies dont deserve to get any welfare checks this movie is very realistic because it portrays a guy joe who represented a lot of guys back then and now too the story goes like this joe is in a bar and he rubs shoulders with a rich guy who just accidentally killed his daughters hippie boyfriend and this rich goes to the bar to rethink what he just did and while hes doing that joe is in the bar ranting about hippies and people who are against the war the rich guy accidentally tells joe that he killed a hippie  and obviously joe applauds the rich guy cause joe hates hippies amazing movie watch it to see what happens next i liked this movie  because it was reminiscent of those days in the early 70s i liked the way movies were shot back then in those days very good stuff  its not like todays movies basically the movie gives you an inner look into the mind of the lead character joe  i like the theme of the movie  about the working man  whos busting his ass trying to make a living
