i recall so many things about seeing this movie back during its original theatrical release  the post woodstock afterglow of peace and love along with the prewatergate tension of fear and paranoia its hard to believe that its thirty seven years later and i can still remember the thoughts going through my head while watching the film with my best friend like marveling at peter boyles characterization of the ultimate redneck sure to typecast him the rest of his career oh how wrong and how the counter culture jarred the sensibilities of most of the country to this day my buddy and i still use joe currans line from my summary above when faced with a dilemma curious how a simple line like that can stay with you for decadesbr br its curious to read comments about the film from others on this board particularly the ones stating that the film has a dated quality and how over the top the characters were still if you were around during that time the picture gives a pretty accurate portrayal of the polar opposites that existed back then pretty much side by side as the events in the story reveal if you really want dated when was the last time you heard the words macys and gimbels in the same sentence or a line like joes  come on get with the pepsi generation for historical perspective you have that great nixon poster lingering in one of the background scenes  would you buy a used car from this man with minor intricacies like those director john avildsen captures many of the subtle but ever present hints of how life was four decades agobr br todays viewing was only the second time ive seen the movie and i have to admit i dont remember susan sarandon in one of the lead roles but then again this was her very first picture the scenes of nudity and free love were something actually quite new and bold at the time shocking in fact as film makers began to experiment with their ability to push the envelope of propriety and convention joe took a major leap in that regard particularly since it was a mainstream picturebr br with the passage of time the thing that impresses me the most about peter boyle was how he overcame the stereotype of joe curran to appear in or star in some of my very favorite pieces of work i mean how do you go from joe to that hilarious rendition of puttin on the ritz in young frankenstein and my absolute favorite episode of xfiles has boyle as clyde bruckman in both a tender and tragic funny and serious portrayal that turns the tables on scully and mulder more than once and as a career capper frank barone has to be one of the funniest characters in the history of television even repeat episodes in syndication are funny as he whenever the elder barone lets loose with one of his observations he is one actor that this viewer sorely misses already
