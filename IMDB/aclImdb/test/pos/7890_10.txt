i only voted excellent because this film took two snapshots of americana one in 1970 and one for every year afterward br br nothings really changedbr br joe is actually a jerk a big stupid slob whos mad at everybody else in the world for his own idiocy this aint really a spoiler but the key to the film is the big corporate never does wrong guy making friends with this semitroglodyte joe and he gets some kind ofvalidation from his bigotry and stupidity and sense of being wronged br br yet few would argue that the dealer boyfriend did deserve to die and those kids shouldnt have ripped joe and compton off and joe and compton were actually getting into the hash and the young skin until they got ripped off a simple film in many ways except that in 1970 new york city was par to a battle zone thanks to nixons care and all of the money going to the war in vietnam as i write this 2252007 there is a very long wait on netflix for this film  which makes me happy because i think there are people out there who want to learn this was a pretty good snapshot  not exact a bit caricaturist  but actually pretty close to how it was back then and the scary thing is  things havent changed that much sure theres no more welfare but that just means the wageslavery has won out br br amazing how millionaires will complain about not making enough money then complain that 515 an hour is too much to pay their people
