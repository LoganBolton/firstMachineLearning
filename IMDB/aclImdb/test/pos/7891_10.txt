i finally have seen the real reason why peter boyle became famous it wasnt being the monster in young frankenstein or being cranky frank barone on everybody loves raymond for younger people who only know him from tvgive this film a tryit makes frank look like a saintbr br joe is boyle in his finest acting role and as someone mentionedmost likely gave the inspiration for archie bunker on all in the family i think boyle even went back to joe a little to play frank i say this because i noticed the basement of both joe  frank barone look similarbr br i knew nothing of this movie when i checked it out of the libraryi just knew boyle and susan sarandon were featured yessusan does look great here and for a young actress a very good early role a young hippie wanna bewho escapes her parents home and lives withthe ultimate lost in a drug induced haze hippiewho also sells as much as he buysbr br after a nearfatal overdose on too many pillsshe is hospitalized while her parents go to collect her thingsher mother wont go into the smellyrun down apartment but her father does while dad gathers up her thingsher boyfriend comes home and the two exchange words and then the father does what we will later hear joe say hed like to do to a hippiebr br joe is shooting his mouth off about how he hates different culturesraceshippies and a laundry list of others when he saysid really like to kill one of themthe father trying to look like hes kiddingsaysi just did joe almost buys it but then takes it as funny br br laterwhen the police are at the scene and the story is in the paperjoe realizeshe wasnt kidding instead of nailing the rich guy for money through blackmailhe actuallykind ofdoes blackmail him by just wanting him and his wife to get to know him and his wife long story short their association is awkward but after sarandon gets wind of what her father has donethe bottom is at risk of falling outbr br how this all plays out in the end youll have to watch for yourself although its over 35 years agothe ending is something you wont expect unless youve seen the film before of course againi recommend it mostly for those who havent seen itbr br 10 stars for boyle not just playing someone completely opposite his nature but for what will show others that he was more than just a tv and movie comedy actor end
