cautionpossible spoilers aheadÂ… just watched joe for the second time the first time was 30 years ago on an air force base i was reminded of that by the air force overcoat with tech sgt stripes wore by the boyfrienddealer we airmen had quite a laugh the first time that appeared on the screen because that is a lifer rank over the years i have carried several other images from the film foremost was the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive as someone else commented you could not take you eyes off her i did not realize until now that this was a 20year old susan sarandon in her first movie what a loss that she did not do more movies when she looked like that i also recall the irony of having a counterculture hero like peter boyle playing the title role of a rightwing gun nut not unlike george c scott playing generals in dr strangelove and patton and of course the shocking ending made a lasting impressionbr br 30 years ago it was the most talked about movie that ever played on the base we thought it was a great film then and i have been reluctant to see it again because i was afraid that it would be as disappointingly dated as easy rider but watching it today i was amazed at how well the film has held up it is a very strong script with few holes although you have to wonder about the boyfriend immediately getting out of the bathtub when sarandon gets in with himbr br searching for an explanation of why this film is still so entertaining i have to think it has something to do with the perfect physical casting boyle was physically believable as joe as others have pointed out his portrayal would inspire the archie bunker character a few years later did ted knight model his caddyshack characterjudge smails after the dennis patricks advertising executive in joe they look alike and sound alike patrick was totally believable as the wrappedtootight upper middle class executive and sarandons doeeyed innocent with the raggety ann doll still evokes a protective response from all male viewersperfect casting br br the nude and drug scenes actually hold up they were very provocative for their day and are as explicit as anything to be found in thirteen about the only thing that dates this film is that the violence is not realistic or graphic joe was about the same time as the wild bunch and the tone of movie violence had a just begun to change br br another reason this film holds up is that events in the past couple of years have brought back the relevancy of the theme and context of this film in the film both types of conservatives are portrayed as full of fear and hate toward the unconventional ways of the counterculture and filled with envy at their free and hedonistic lifestyle the counterculture is portrayed as mocking the straight culture and although paranoid toward conservatives legitimately so given that this was just a couple months after kent state they cannot resist flaunting their lifestyle in an attempt to antagonize the political landscape is not all that different 30 years later im not sure conservatives envy young people and liberals as much as 1970 but they fear and hate them morebr br an excellent film that surprisingly is as relevant now as it was in the early 1970s
