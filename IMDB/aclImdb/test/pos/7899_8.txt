lets face it you know what to expect when you tune into a post 1990 corey feldman film there are probably boobs guns and cars saying that there is more to this movie than just naked ladies im sorry to say cos its mainly people getting themselves killed in a variety of unusual and as the name suggests often mystical ways i love crappy horror and i love this film if you dont you probably wont but i think its worth most people giving it a go its not so crappy that itll ruin your weekend or anything all in all if its mindless good fun a bit of corpse loving and an 80s childhood superstar your in the mood for then youve come to the right place its a cracker
