saw this for the first time on uk tv with good musical accompaniment the elevator scene is class especially when he does the goingdown thing in the phone booth and then fiddles with the floorindicator the jump through the transom is really impressive and theres so much more apart from all the stuff thats been mentioned before theres the fight with the man whos been bullying the woman with the dog  it just looks so simple the only drawback is the plot  he gets mixed up with dead eye dan who then escapes but doesnt reappear even when some more gangsters get involved later on the scene where it looks like hes shooting at the fat inspector is funny but would have been better if dead eye was the one pulling the trigger
