robert mckimsons acrobatty bunny is one of the directors finest shorts although the circusbased setting may evoke hideous memories of mckimsons dreadful big top bunny acrobatty bunny is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty pitting bugs bunny against a ferocious lion acrobatty bunny is fresh and funny from the outset not to mention extremely attractive to look at theres a classic scene in which bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion in a brilliant disney parody he hollers pinocchio down the lions throat this brilliant opening is a sign of things to come there are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lions cage to begin with followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of laugh clown laugh which as a child i used to impersonate regularly all this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name ive never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but acrobatty bunny breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst mckimsons best
