vanaja 2006 written and directed by rajnesh domalpalli is an extraordinary film from south india mamatha bhukya plays 15yearold vanaja who lives in a rural area with her loving but alcoholic father if she is going to succeed in life she will have to overcome the liabilities of low caste and poverty br br i went to the film expecting the depiction of an wretched girl who is crushed by society this isnt what vanaja shows us the young woman is attractive intelligent and ambitious she wont accept her fate with tears or simple resignation she wants to succeed and its never clear that she wont succeed despite the odds br br the acting that mr domalpalli draws forth from his cast of amateurs is miraculous mamatha bhukya is outstanding in the title role and urmila dammannagari does an exceptional job as mrs rama devi the wealthy landowner who is a formerly famous classical dancerbr br in the film vanaja learns south indian classical dance as she did in real life i couldnt tell how good vanajas dancing was by indian standards but the many dance scenes were spellbinding dont think bollywoodthis is classical dance its also very different from ballet because in ballet the dancer lifts her heels away from the floor in sound indian dance the heel is the primary contact pointbr br this is a movie that is not to be missed it will work on dvd but will be better on a theater screen because the dancing will be shown to better advantage however if dvd is your only option then see it that way just be sure to see it
