the commenter before me stated this movie is the worst that was ever forced upon himher as a child i have to say though that i loved this movie when was little and i still love it today the movie has the best running theme of allfamily togetherness considering the time period the movie was released i thought the movie was acted out well i only wish i could still find a copy of it somewhere of all the 1980s films i watched as a kid this was on of my favorites i know i probably watched it at least once a week with my brother and my mom i would definitely recommend it to anyone i knowor dont know so if you do find a copy of it i suggest watching it its wonderful and heartwarming
