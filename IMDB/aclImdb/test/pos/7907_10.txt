my cousins and i have watched this movie ever since we were little i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memoriesbr br i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch it is an old movie but dont let that fool you this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other
