evocatively directed and slickly photographed psychological mystery thriller with an exceptional lead performance by a sombre donald sutherland and potent support roles from donald pleasence and david hemming the material decides to keep it all glum and moves from the investigation period into the backstory of the victim the seldom and quite sullen nature of investigation pulled me in but when it flashback to the victims side showing her final days werent as compelling and became somewhat stodgy and stocklike while the script is strongly detailed and to a certain degree complex in stringing us along however the final and surprising revelation should have been more bonejarring and its not helped out by its sloppy execution howard blakes music score has an emotional sting to its cues that simply linger and director claude chabrols capable handling well for most part has a strong stylistic and tight manner which gets the best out of moody locations and flexible cast the young faces lisa langlois and aude landry do an incredibly good job as well
