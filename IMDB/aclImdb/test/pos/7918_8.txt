it is important to realise that eisenstein was a committed marxist film maker who held some very specific and particular theories about what film could achieve and howbr br it is simply idle to compare alexander nevsky negatively with anything from a similar period in the us this film comes from the oldest film school in the world from another continent from an entirely different approach to cinemabr br to appreciate this film a little more try finding out about pudovkins and kuleshovs theories of montage for example or read the wikipedia entry on marxist film theory if youre feeling really bold you might even investigate the triadic forms of hegelian dialecticbr br it follows that if you watch this film without some understanding of eisensteins ideas and ideals you probably wont get it in alexander nevsky the main characters arent playing themselves they are meant to be distillations of their nations character nevsky and his generals are deliberately shown largerthanlife because they represent stylised heroic aspects of the entire russian peoplebr br the acting isnt wooden its meant to be slightly mannered it represents a completely different school from the more naturalistic narrative style which hollywood was rapidly adopting eisensteins films are especially designed not to be realistic if anything seems somewhat obvious whether lighting or language or a pose struck by an actor its meant to be that way eisenstein was one of the early proponents of film as an art form not just as entertainmentbr br if the editing sometimes seems to consist of a clash of images well thats the idea shots are meant to contrast with each other eisensteins films contain and embody elements of a politicalphilosophical argument namely marxist dialecticbr br so sit back shout hurrah for russia and her folkhero defenders boo at the cowardly nobles and the teuton invaders and enjoy the difference
