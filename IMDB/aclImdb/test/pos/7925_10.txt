went looking for this movie after i read tom clancys red storm rising novel timeless masterpiece about 13th century russians being invaded by the germans movie was made in 1938 under orders from joseph stalin to warn soviets about hitler and germany battle scenes are wonderfully done showing that you dont need computer animation to make a great fight scene probably sergei eisensteins greatest work also see battleship potemkin any history buff or polisci major should watch this movie 10 out of 10
