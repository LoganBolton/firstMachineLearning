to my eternal shame ive never seen a silent movie  not even the mother of all vampire movies nosferatu however if they display half the creativity and sheer joy of this effort from buster keaton then ill probably try to watch a few more this is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies the premise such as it is focuses around an unfortunate case of mistaken identity as keaton is mistaken for renowned badguy dead shot dan codirector malcolm st clair this leads to a number of chases and escapes as the authorities get ever closer to the increasingly desperate keatonbr br youre left amazed and entertained in equal measures keaton is a natural comedian but also an accomplished stuntman judging by the way he leaps and jumps around like jackie chan on speed and the comedy is also of an exceptionally high standard  my better half had to cut short a phone call to her parents because she was laughing too much if youve never experienced a silent movie like this then it is nothing short of a revelation to watch  it certainly blew away any ideas i may have had about silent films naturally it isnt as polished as todays movies  the acting is pretty awful truth be told but that doesnt matter because youre enjoying the movie regardless anyone with a passing interest in movies in general should make the effort to watch this because they will not be disappointed brilliant
