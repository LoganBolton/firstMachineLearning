there is a version of nevsky that is shown with a live symphony orchestra chorus soloist and the movie if its ever performed within a days travel of you see nevsky done that way the oklahoma city philharmonic did it with the okc canterbury choir one of the finest anywhere a couple of years ago i think i cried through the whole thing it was one of the most emotionally powerful movie experiences of my life im listening to nevsky on the radio right now and it still tears me up there are movies that i love and classical music pieces i love but there is no combination i can think of that comes close to the impact of nevsky performed in real time
