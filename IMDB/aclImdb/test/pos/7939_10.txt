i saw this film with a live performance by the buffalo philharmonic and the music was one of the two things that definitely made the experience for me particularly the song after the battle where the woman is looking for her husband was just devastating the other thing that stood out to me is the battle on the ice itself a bit of strategy ripped off thoroughly by the makers of king arthur in 2004 also the battle goes on forever half an hour painfully long i cant think of another propaganda film that makes war look less glamorous or rewarding im surprised stalin liked this film so well i wouldnt want to go out and fight after watching it
