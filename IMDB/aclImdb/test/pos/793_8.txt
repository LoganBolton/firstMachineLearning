not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal br br there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off busters physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the 27minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our herobr br earlier its a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later its big joe roberts a rotund cop  and father a girl buster is interested in  who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his bestbr br its just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares its buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think 85 years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool
