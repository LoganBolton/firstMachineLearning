at school i was taught how some shots were called and there were two directors constantly mentioned  orson welles and sergei m eisenstein i didnt care that much then i was a kid but now i know why eisenstein is a genius and it is a shame to see what was possible in 1938 where as almost more than a half century were stuck with countless blank movies some say this movie isnt worth the genius of eisenstein then they have to watch it over and over till they can say anything bad or even worse that it is just some propagandamovie for the russians lets say it as it is it is indeed pure propaganda for patriotism but isnt saving private ryan or the longest day so i could sum up so many movies in where america is being raised to the top so why not russia and besides every war is fought for itrs patriotism why else would they raise flags aleksandr nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography as almost every shot is a sublime picture perhaps its all overseen but i am in wonder why this isnt included in imdbs top 250 where as there is so many overrated oscarcrap in it as well
