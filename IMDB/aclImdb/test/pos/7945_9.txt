i saw this film back in the early 70s and i was mesmerised by judy geeson for me it captured the clandestine nature of rod steigers irrepressible obsession with the young and extremely sexy hitch hiker played by geesonbr br you couldnt help feel a little sorry for the wife played brilliantly by claire bloom i was really disappointed to see that the original cut may have been lost and there is little chance of it being released on dvdbr br i defy anyone who saw the film and its strong message not to be equally absorbed by the three main character performances and i would have loved to have seen it again if nothing else for a purely nostalgic reasonbr br going back in time some 35 yearsbr br a real classic
