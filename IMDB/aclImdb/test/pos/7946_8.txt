many accuse rod steiger of overacting and anyone who has seen the amityville horror and the fly section would struggle to say otherwise that said hes brilliant in thisbr br its never on tv you cant buy it on dvd legitimately in 1988 when channel 4 still had a prescription for innovation they showed this amongst a small amalgam of 60s films privilege etc  and i remember an essentially theatrical experience transposed well to film the great thing about theatre is its enclosed  how do you make it available and interesting on screen ph just about pulls it off because this sort of film is never even on cable or sky tv anywhere its hard to get a debate going but for anyone out there who has seen it or can remember my memories are of a forthright almost strident performance by sally geeson thats all taken care of which eschews the almost diffident general performances of her and her sibling in many early 70s offerings she says ref conception there are several of these  key lines you remember years decades on thats the power of a film like thisbr br ps i just saw it again and its just as good one day tv too will be enlightened
