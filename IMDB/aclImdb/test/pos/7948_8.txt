spoiler alertand i really mean it read no further unless you are prepared to have a major plot element revealedbr br okay first ive gotta say that i have a relatively high tolerance for depressing films ill watch and appreciate films about true life horrors such as war and the holocaust or where death and sadness are important to the plot but i hate films like steal magnolias and terms of endearment where the film is built around a manipulative death of a main character so already no matter how well made this film is its got a major strike against it because one of the main characters dies from a disease at the end though they never say what he had in the english subtitled versionbr br so you might ask yourself then if this blowhard hates this type of film then why did he watch it in the first place you would have an excellent point to ask this though i hope i am not really a blowhard well when i found it in our local library i had no idea what it was about the movie was not intended specifically for export as the subtitles were in korean english and japanese and the box was printed all in korean well being a fan of trying films from any nation ive seen films from probably at least 3040 different countries i gave it a trybr br well apart from the obligatory death i loved the film and so hated the way it ended while i usually hate hollywoodtype miraculous endings i wanted to see the guy saved through some new drug or experimental surgery i was really bummed that he had to dieparticularly since he seemed like one of the nicest people ive seen in films in a long time his smile was infectious and i really wanted him to get the girl in the end oh well at least i can appreciate the films message that you need to seize the moment great acting music etc but just not the most satisfying ending for me this film was good enough to encourage me to try some more korean cinema
