i really appreciate what jungwon had done before his death everything i want to say that his choice for love is unselfish if he chose darim  that will be good for him but darim will need more time to recover from his death obviously he does not want to let it happen as he did in the film he chose giving up so it was just temporary agony for darimbr br as comparison my life without me is very different their behavior shows big difference between eastern culture and western culture i cannot say which is better every one can has right to choose that is totally up to you life is equal for everybody we can live only once any choice is acceptable if only you think it is fit for youbr br in truth the slow pace of the film cannot be the excuse for rejecting the movie just calm down you will get more from the moviebr br one of the best korean movies i ever watched 910
