i always had this concept that korean movies were all about comedy and drama but christmas in autumn has changed my point of view this movie is so simple it doenot have any melodramatic scenes or over the top comedy scenes not a single scene where the actors cry out loud not even a scene where the actor and the actress kiss not even a simple kiss and yet this movie is able to reach its viewers in ways that i dint know existed the ending of the movie left me speechless i dint even cry but my eyes were red hot this movie left me a feeling i can hardly describe in wordsbr br i dont think i can recommend this movie to everyone but i do recommend this movie to people who want to watch real cinema 9410
