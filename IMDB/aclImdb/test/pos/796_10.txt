i hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem except to say that it represents young buster keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the halfdozen best short comedies ever made the goat is twenty minutes of smoothly paced expertly photographed beautifully executed gags two reels of nonstop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending  which wasnt always the way with busters comedies see cops for one case where fatalism ultimately got the better of him or one week for the victory of defeatism if i had to describe this film in one word id call it effortless but if i were permitted two id call it seemingly effortless for surely a lot of hard labor goes into the making of any comic opus that unfolds with such sublime ease still they didnt call him the great stone face for nothing buster never let the public see him sweatbr br a sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is set along millionaires row ie on a bread line in a grim urban setting where buster waits patiently at the back of the line and as a result doesnt get fed but it needs to be emphasized that not for one moment does he play for pathos buster has our sympathy but he never asks for it before long through a series of accidents coincidences and absurd misunderstandings buster is believed to be an escaped killer named dead shot dan and is being pursued by every cop for miles around and yet while hes clearly dismayed by this turn of events there is never a hint of selfpity or even surprise we get the sense he always knew that this is what life would have in store for him and that he hasnt time to feel sorry for himself anyway he has to figure out new ways to dodge those cops and escape from the latest trapbr br just as buster refrains from playing for sympathy he never seems to strain for laughs either which is especially impressive because the goat must be one of the most laughpacked short comedies in existence this is the film that features that iconic shot of buster riding a trains cowcatcher right up to the very lens of the camera which isnt a gag exactly but sure is laughprovoking in its own strange way meanwhile there are gags involving guns dogs cops an incredibly furry mustache and a clay statue of a horse that melts under busters weight a surreal sight indeed but some of the biggest boffos are saved for the finale when buster is trying to elude his primary nemesis big joe roberts a rotund cop who also happens to be the father of leading lady virginia fox trapped in big joes dining room buster leapfrogs over him and sails through a transom turns a phonebooth into an elevator and pretends to disappear and eventually uses the elevator itself to rid himself of his pursuer and win the girl in time for one last fadeout gagbr br to say more would be a disservice to firsttime viewers i only wish i could see this film in a theater full of people whod never seen it before and float on the laughter live musical accompaniment would be nice too and incidentally the musical score supplied by kino for their home videodvd version of the goat is firstrate serving as icing on an already tasty cake
