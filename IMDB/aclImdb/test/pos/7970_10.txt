this movie is very similar to death warrant with jeanclaude van damme and also has some similarities to island of fire with jackie chan and i also heard that there is some other very similar action movies but this film has a much better action than death warrant or even island of fire thats right the jackie chans movie rarely american action movies has such a great action sequences though there was many negative reviews on this film it easily beats most of the action movies of that time who were more successful there were many martial arts scenes david bradley was fast as bruce lee in this film and what else was good that fighting scenes were much longer than in most of the american martial arts movies the shootout scenes were similar with john woos movies maybe not that good but still very exiting there was also many impressive explosions and one great chase scene ive seen some other david bradleys movies but this one yet is the best in terms of action ok this movie has some cheesy moments but which movie hasnt the acting was decent charles napier was incredible and his character was real tough adam clark who played squid and yuji okumoto who played the main bad guy were also very good other actors acted pretty well too though the acting isnt important in this type of movies if you are action movies fan i mean the real action movies fan who really can appreciate the good action than you must see this film
